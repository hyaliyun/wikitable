He was inducted into the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame. Biography Born in Aiken, South Carolina, he learned the sport from his parents, Louise and Thomas Hitchcock Sr.. His father was a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horse trainer who had been a 10-goal player who helped found the Meadowbrook Polo Club on Long Island, New York, and who captained the American team in the inaugural 1886 International Polo Cup. Tommy Jr. played in his first tournament at age 13 and was part of the Meadowbrook Polo Club that won the 1916 U.S. national junior championship. Hitchcock attended St. Paul's School, where he played football, hockey and was a member of the crew team. After being elected president of the Sixth Form, Hitchcock chose to leave school and join the Lafayette Flying Corps in France during World War I. He was shot down and captured by the Germans but escaped by jumping out of a train. On foot, he hid in the woods during the daytime then walked more than one hundred miles over eight nights to the safety of Switzerland.March 18, 1985 Sports Illustrated article titled Tommy Hitchcock: A War Hero And Shining Star Of Sports' Golden Age After the war, Hitchcock studied at Harvard University and Oxford University. In polo, he led the U.S. team to victory in the 1921 International Polo Cup. From 1922 to 1940, Hitchcock carried a 10-goal handicap, which is the highest ranking in polo, from the United States of America Polo Association. Playing with notable stars such as Pete Bostwick, Jock Whitney, and Gerald Balding, he led teams to U.S. National Open Championships in 1923, 1927, 1935 and 1936. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald modeled two characters in his books on Tommy Hitchcock Jr.: Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby (1925) and the Tommy Barban character in Tender Is the Night (1934).http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/fight_for_the_great_dad_sby_6RievlJ3Y8fEt16uHRVHbI Son claims his LI dad was 'Great Gatsby' inspiration ‚Äì and someone stole his $750G book Hitchcock married Margaret Mellon, daughter of William Larimer Mellon, in New York City on 15 December 1928. They had four children: daughters Louise Eustis Hitchcock and Margaret Mellon Hitchcock, and twin sons Thomas Hitchcock III and William Mellon Hitchcock. In 1937, with fellow polo player Robert Lehman, he became a partner in the Lehman Brothers investment firm. Serving as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, Hitchcock was assigned as an assistant air attach√© to the US Embassy in London, England. In that capacity, he was instrumental in the development of the P-51 Mustang fighter plane, particularly in replacing the original Allison engine with the Packard-built Rolls-Royce Merlin. He was killed while piloting one such aircraft near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England when he was unable to pull out of a dive while doing tests. His death was reported to his family by fellow St. Paul's alumnus John G. Winant, then serving as United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Legacy Following its formation, in 1990 Tommy Hitchcock Jr. was inducted posthumously into the Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame. Three of Hitchcock's children ‚Äì Margaret, Thomas III, and William ‚Äì loaned the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York to Timothy Leary from 1963 to 1968, and it became a nexus of the psychedelic movement of that decade.

History Godfather's Pizza was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1973. Willy Theisen bought out the pizza parlor and the name in 1974 from Gregg Johnson (who later started the Minsky's Pizza restaurants), and sold his first franchise. Theisen sold the company to Pillsbury in 1985 and stepped down from actively managing the company. In 1986, Pillsbury named Herman Cain CEO and president of the brand. Cain and Ronald B. Gartlan, the company's executive vice president, led a group to purchase the Godfather's brand from Pillsbury, which they did by the beginning of 1990 in a leveraged buyout for what was reported to be $100 million. It was reported to be the fifth largest pizza chain in the United States at the time, down from third place in 1985. About this time, many Godfather's locations in the St. Louis area were bought out by Pantera's Pizza. Under Cain's leadership, Godfather's closed approximately 200 restaurants and eliminated several thousand jobs, and by doing so returned to profitability. Cain stepped down from his position as CEO and president in 1996 and Gartlan became CEO. Cain stayed on as chairman until 2002. In 2009 Gartlan bought out Cain. According to the company's official website, as of August 2016, the chain had 453 locations in the U.S. Godfather's Pizza also operates in some Speedway locations, as well as most Minit Mart locations in Kentucky and northern Tennessee, as of 2007. Menu The restaurants serve a wide variety of pizzas, breadsticks, chips, cookies, and pastas, and have an extensive salad bar and buffet. They offer four different types of crust: Original, Golden, Mozza-Loaded, and Thin. By January 2010, the chain introduced gluten-free pizzas, made from rice flour. Spokesman Godfather's Pizza is known for its commercials featuring \\"The Godfather\\", a parody of Marlon Brando's character, Don Vito Corleone, from the 1972 film The Godfather. \\"The Godfather\\" has been played by two Omaha actors, the first being J. William Koll, who typically wore a white fedora hat, a pin stripe suit, and a flower on his jacket. Dale O'Brien has been the Godfather's Pizza spokesman since about 2000.

His writings focused especially on life scripts, alcoholism, emotional literacy, and interpersonal power plays. In the 1970s and '80s, Steiner was a founder and practitioner of Radical Psychiatry, a new approach to psychotherapy based in a social theory (of alienation) rather than a medical one (of individual pathology). Influenced by progressive movements of the time, work in this modality continues into the present and is gaining recent recognition worldwide. He was also considered the originator of the theory called Stroke Economy. Early life Steiner was born in Paris, France. His parents were Austrian, his mother Ashkenazi Jewish and his father white. The family left France in 1939 ahead of the impending Nazi invasion. Eventually the family settled in Mexico. In 1952, Steiner went to the United States to study engineering. In 1957 he met and became a follower of Eric Berne, a psychiatrist and founder of the transactional analysis school of psychotherapy. In 1965 he obtained a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He was a founding member and teaching member of the International Transactional Analysis Association.  Radical psychiatry  The concept of radical psychiatry was first introduced by the Canadian psychiatrist, Eric Berne, who was Steiner's teacher. Steiner's contribution to the foundation of this now defunct theory was his Manifesto, which outlined fundamental tenets of the theory's framework such as the incorporation of elements of transactional analysis (TA) assumptions about the psychiatric field and people. He became one of the founders of Radical Therapist Collective and wrote extensively about radical psychiatry in books and journals such as The Radical Therapist. Politics Steiner was active in political causes. He opposed America's role in Vietnam War and was an outspoken critic of US policy and actions involving Latin America. Steiner summarized his views in his conclusion to his treatise called \\"Transactional Analysis in the Information Age\\". > It seems that many in Transactional Analysis are impatient with the state of > transactional analysis as a dynamic, developing theory. For myself, I have > thought at times that Transactional Analysis has had its day. Many of its > ideas have been silently incorporated into the psychiatric culture, but on > the whole its point has been missed and it has not been given a place among > the great psychiatric theories of the century and I was ready to put it to > rest. Accordingly I followed my interest in power and its abuses away from > Transactional Analysis into propaganda, journalism and Central American > politics. From the distant perspective of an investigator into media and > information, in a dawning Information Age I came to see Transactional > Analysis in a brand new light; as a visionary theory of Information Age > psychology and psychiatry. As the world peers into the twenty-first century > with every one wondering how they will be affected by the looming millennial > changes, we, in Transactional Analysis, are in possession of a legacy which > is only now becoming clear: we have the tools and the insights of an > Information Age, communication-based psychology and psychiatry. A Warm Fuzzy Tale A Warm Fuzzy Tale is a 1970 book by Steiner. The fairy tale‚Äìlike story introduces \\"strokes\\" and other ideas about social interaction and emotion derived from transactional analysis. It was republished in 1977 as The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale with illustration by Jo Ann Dick, and has since been translated into multiple languages. The slang term warm fuzzies, a reference to positive feelings, derives from the book and its adaptations. The story and ideas derived from it are sometimes used in teaching or counseling about emotion and interaction. In the story, people exchange things called \\"warm fuzzies\\" which make them feel happy and warm. A bad witch convinces one character that warm fuzzies are in limited supply and should not be given away. Instead, the witch induces people to exchange \\"cold pricklies\\" which make them feel cold. These exchanges symbolize Steiner and Eric Berne's notion of \\"strokes\\", recognition and emotional support among people. The story ends by inviting the reader to make warm fuzzies abundant \\"by freely giving and asking for Warm Fuzzies and being as loving and healthy as you can\\". Death Steiner died at his ranch in Ukiah, California on 9 January 2017 at the age of 82. Publications *1962 'No Exit' Revisited.

The exact wording depends on the station and the nature of the incident. For example: \\"Would Inspector Sands please report to the operations room immediately.\\" or \\"Would Inspector Sands please report to Platform 2\\". The automated public address announcement can be generated automatically by the station's fire warning system, or can be triggered from the station control. The message audio file is usually stored as the primary standard emergency announcement on the station PA/VA system. Fire alarms in small buildings automatically activate all fire sounders to instruct occupants to evacuate the building whereas larger public buildings such as railway stations require a staged evacuation procedure to avoid false alarms. The message may indicate that a single fire alarm call point in a public area has been activated and which needs to be corroborated by a station staff before a decision is made whether to evacuate the whole station. If an automatic fire detector in a non-public area is operated, or more than one device or zone reports a fire, the system will start the evacuation procedure and the fire brigade is automatically called. The announcement can be triggered by the station controller to alert station staff of other incidents which need urgent attention. The automated nature of the announcement and its high priority means that it has occasionally been known to cut into manual (lower priority) announcements being made by station staff. On some railway stations the announcement is also triggered during the routine testing of alarm systems.  History  The code phrase \\"Mr. Sands\\" was used in theatres, where sand buckets were used to put out fires, as a code for fire. The word \\"fire\\" backstage would cause alarm to either performers or the audience.

The two nearby mountain ranges are: the higher Santa Susana Mountains adjacent on the northeast across Santa Susana Pass; and the Santa Monica Mountains running nearby along the south. =Watersheds= The hills provide the complete or partial watersheds for several year-round creeks and numerous seasonal streams. They include Las Virgenes Creek (tributary of Malibu Creek), Moore's Canyon Creek, Bell Creek, Dayton Creek, Woolsey Canyon Creek, Brandeis Creek, Runkle Canyon Creek, Arroyo Simi, Palo Comado Creek, Cheeseboro Creek, and Arroyo Calabasas (northern fork). Bell Creek and Arroyo Calabasas are the headwaters of the Los Angeles River, by name its beginning with their confluence in nearby Canoga Park. 90% of the Santa Susana Field Lab property drains into the Los Angeles River via tributaries. =Peaks= Peaks in this region include Simi Peak, 2,403 ft (732 m), Chatsworth Peak, 2,314 ft (700 m), and Escorpi√≥n Peak (aka: Castle Peak), 1,475 ft (450 m). Panoramic view of the Simi Hills looking north from the Santa Monica Mountains. =Climate= Because of its low elevation, the Simi Hills typically experience rainy, mild winters. Snow is rare in the Simi Hills, even in the highest areas. Summers are warm and dry and wildfires do occur here. Cool winds from the Pacific Ocean come from the Oxnard Plain and blow into the inland areas through the Santa Clara River Valley and the Conejo Valley, though some low hills, such as Conejo Mountain, block these winds from the Conejo Valley. The Simi Hills further block these winds, which bring cool weather in both summer and winter from the San Fernando Valley. Flora and faunaFlora= The southern lower hills are mostly covered in grasslands and oak savanna. The northern rocky hills area is primarily chaparral shrubland and oak woodlands. The Simi Hills are part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The oaks (Quercus spp.) include: the evergreen coastal live oak (Quercus agrifolia), the deciduous valley oak (Quercus lobata), and the scrub oak (Quercus dumosa). Riparian zone plants include California sycamores (Platanus racemosa) and arroyo willows (Salix lasiolepis). Spring wildflowers include the redbush monkey flower (Mimulus aurantiacus), Plummer's mariposa lily (Calochortus plummerae), and canyon sunflower (Encelia californica). poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) is also an important member of the native plant habitat community here. =Fauna= The Simi Hills is the principal, and much wider, of only two terrestrial wildlife corridors linking the coastal Santa Monica Mountains with the inland Santa Susana Mountains, Topatopa Mountains, and San Gabriel Mountains, all of the transverse ranges fauna community. The Simi Hills are the most critical wildlife corridor linkage for the Santa Monica Mountains to these and other Transverse Ranges further east. The Simi's undeveloped native habitat provides routes that protect larger land wildlife of the Santa Monicas from genetic isolation. Large sections of the Simi Hills are protected by parks and open space preserves. The Santa Susana Field Laboratory property, a crucial wildlife corridor to the Santa Susanas, has been proposed for public open space parkland after the closed site's cleanup completion.

The Rancho El Conejo was to the west, and included that end of the Simi Hills. In the first half of the 20th century, there were four large movie ranches in the Simi Hills for filming motion pictures on location. The gated community of Bell Canyon began development of geographic Bell Canyon in the 1968. To the north of U.S. 101, east of Thousand Oaks, and west of Simi Valley the early 1960s suburban expansion of metropolitan Los Angeles brought the development of small to significantly sized parcels of land in the Simi Hills. Hillside subdivisions regraded natural contours into terraced lots, changing the Hills viewshed, drainage patterns, and habitats in those areas. The extensive planned new community projects at Jordan Ranch and Ahmanson Ranch were eventually stopped by local citizens and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy keeping extensive Hills acreage natural in open space parks. The Simi Hills were home of the Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) for open-air testing of rocket engines from 1947 to 1990, and the site of experimental nuclear reactor experiments with four nuclear accidents between 1959 and 1969; these projects and accidents were declassified in 1989. The first accident, in 1959, was the most serious with a full meltdown. The extent of the accident is unknown due to instrument limitations, other than it is released extensive radiation.

D√©cor of such restaurants features higher-quality materials, with establishments having certain rules of dining which visitors are generally expected to follow, sometimes including a dress code. Fine dining establishments are sometimes called white-tablecloth restaurants, because they traditionally featured table service by servers, at tables covered by white tablecloths. The tablecloths came to symbolize the experience. The use of white tablecloths eventually became less fashionable, but the service and upscale ambiance remained.

On 21 June 1919 he ordered the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow to prevent the British from seizing the ships.  Early life  Reuter was born in Guben into a Prussian military family. His father, a colonel in the army, was killed in the Franco-Prussian War. In 1885, he became a cadet in the Imperial German Navy at the instigation of his mother. As a midshipman at the age of 17, he was promoted to Unterleutnant zur See in 1888. By 1910, he was a Kapit√§n zur See, commanding the armored cruiser .Van der Vat, 1982, pp. 109‚Äì111.  World War I  Two months after the outbreak of World War I, he was made captain of the battlecruiser , which he also commanded during the Battle of Dogger Bank. In September 1915, he became Commodore and commanding officer of the Fourth Scouting Group of five light cruisers (, , , , ), leading the group during the Battle of Jutland. Promoted to Konteradmiral in November 1916, he was placed in command of the Second Reconnaissance Group, a fleet of six light cruisers including his flagship . He commanded the group during the mine sweeping operation that led to the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917. Faced with a surprise attack by a numerically superior force of British ships, he successfully withdrew his group under fire to the protection of the battleships and . Reuter was appointed Commander, Reconnaissance Forces and I Scouting Group in August 1918, succeeding Franz von Hipper. = Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow= von Reuter's Command flag, reputedly removed from the Hindenburg after her scuttling at Scapa Flow After the armistice that ended World War I, Konteradmiral von Reuter was requested to take command of the fleet that was to be interned at Scapa Flow until its final disposition would be decided at Versailles. Admiral Franz von Hipper, commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, had refused to lead his ships into internment. He thus protested against the seizing of the fleet by Britain and its relocation to a British war harbour instead of a neutral location, as had been agreed initially. As the final deadline neared for the German delegation to sign the Treaty of Versailles, Reuter anticipated that his ships would be handed over to the victorious Allies. To prevent this, he ordered all 74 ships scuttled on 21 June 1919, using an unusual flag signal previously agreed upon. Unknown to the British, all ships had long ago been prepared for this action. Within five hours, 10 battleships, five battlecruisers, five light cruisers, and 32 destroyers sank in Scapa Flow. The battleship , the three light cruisers , , and and 14 destroyers were beached when British watch personnel were able to intervene in time and tow them to shallow water. Only four destroyers remained afloat. Nine Germans were killed in scuffles either aboard some of the ships (including Walter Schumann, the captain of ) or some of their lifeboats ‚Äì the last German war deaths of World War I.Massie, 2003, p. 787. Reuter was vilified in Britain and made a prisoner of war, along with the other 1,773 officers and men of the fleet's remaining rump crews. In Germany he was celebrated as a hero who had protected the honor of the navy.Van der Vat, 1982, pp. 180‚Äì185. While most of the imprisoned Germans were soon returned to Germany, Reuter was among several who remained imprisoned in Britain. He was eventually released and finally returned to Germany in late January 1920.Van der Vat, 1982, pp. 194‚Äì195.  Later life  Grave Five months after his return from Britain, Reuter was requested to hand in his resignation from the Navy. The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to drastically reduce the size of its navy leaving Reuter without a suitable command, given his rank and age. Moving to Potsdam, he eventually became a state councillor. He also wrote a book on the scuttling of the High Fleet, Scapa Flow: Grave of the German Fleet. On 29 August 1939, he was made full admiral to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Tannenberg. Death Reuter died in Potsdam of a heart attack on 18 December 1943.

In humans, it is encoded by the IL6 gene. In addition, osteoblasts secrete IL-6 to stimulate osteoclast formation. Smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of many blood vessels also produce IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-6's role as an anti-inflammatory myokine is mediated through its inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha and IL-1, and activation of IL-1ra and IL-10. There is some early evidence that IL-6 can be used as an inflammatory marker for severe COVID-19 infection with poor prognosis, in the context of the wider coronavirus pandemic.  Function  Immune system = IL-6 is secreted by macrophages in response to specific microbial molecules, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These PAMPs bind to an important group of detection molecules of the innate immune system, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These are present on the cell surface and intracellular compartments and induce intracellular signaling cascades that give rise to inflammatory cytokine production. IL-6 is an important mediator of fever and of the acute phase response. IL-6 is responsible for stimulating acute phase protein synthesis, as well as the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. It supports the growth of B cells and is antagonistic to regulatory T cells. = Metabolic = It is capable of crossing the blood- brain barrier and initiating synthesis of PGE2 in the hypothalamus, thereby changing the body's temperature setpoint. In muscle and fatty tissue, IL-6 stimulates energy mobilization that leads to increased body temperature. At 4 degrees C, both the oxygen consumption and core temperature were lower in IL-6-/- compared with wild-type mice, suggesting a lower cold-induced thermogenesis in IL-6-/- mice (Wernstedt I, Edgley A, Berndtsson A, F√§ldt J, Bergstr√∂m G, Wallenius V, Jansson JO. Reduced stress- and cold-induced increase in energy expenditure in interleukin-6-deficient mice.Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 2006 Sep;291(3):R551-7. doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00514.2005). IL-6 is also produced by adipocytes and is thought to be a reason why obese individuals have higher endogeneous levels of CRP. IL-6 may exert a tonic suppression of body fat in mature mice, given that IL-6 gene knockout causes mature onset obesity.. Moreover, IL-6 can suppress body fat mass via effects at the level of the CNS. The antiobesity effect of IL-6 in rodents is exerted at the level of the brain, presumably the hypothalamus and the hindbrain.). On the other hand, enhanced central IL-6 trans-signaling may improve energy and glucose homeostasis in obesity Trans- signaling implicates that a soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) comprising the extracellular portion of the receptor can bind IL-6 with a similar affinity as the membrane bound IL-6R. The complex of IL-6 and sIL-6R can bind to gp130 on cells, which do not express the IL-6R, and which are unresponsive to IL-6. Studies in experimental animals indicate that IL-6 in the CNS partly mediates the suppression of food intake and body weight exerted by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor stimulation. Outside the CNS, it seems that IL-6 stimulates the production of GLP-1 in the endocrine pancreas and the gut. Amylin is another substance that can reduce body weight, and that may interact with IL-6. Amylin-induced IL-6 production in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a possible mechanism by which amylin treatment could interacts with VMH leptin signaling to increase its effect on weight loss. = Central nervous system = Intranasally administered IL-6 has been shown to improve sleep-associated consolidation of emotional memories. There are indications of interactions between GLP-1 and IL-6 in several parts of the brain. One example is the parabrachial nuclei of the pons, where GLP-1 increases IL-6 levels and where IL-6 exerts a marked anti-obesity effect.  Role as myokine  IL-6 is also considered a myokine, a cytokine produced from muscle, which is elevated in response to muscle contraction. It is significantly elevated with exercise, and precedes the appearance of other cytokines in the circulation. During exercise, it is thought to act in a hormone-like manner to mobilize extracellular substrates and/or augment substrate delivery.. Like in humans, there seems to be an increase in IL-6 expression in working muscle and plasma IL-6 concentration during exercise in rodents. Studies in mice with IL-6 gene knockout indicate that lack of IL-6 in mice affect exercise function. It has been shown that the reduction of abdominally obesity by exercise in human adults can be reversed by the IL-6 receptor blocking antibody tocilizumab. Together with the findings that IL-6 prevents obesity, stimulates lipolysis and is released from skeletal muscle during exercise, the tocilizumab finding indicates that IL-6 is required for exercise to reduce visceral adipose tissue mass. Bone may be another organ affected by exercise induced IL-6, given that muscle-derived interleukin 6 has been reported to increase exercise capacity by signaling in osteoblasts. IL-6 has extensive anti-inflammatory functions in its role as a myokine. IL-6 was the first myokine that was found to be secreted into the blood stream in response to muscle contractions. Aerobic exercise provokes a systemic cytokine response, including, for example, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-10. IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional to the length of exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. It has been consistently demonstrated that the plasma concentration of IL-6 increases during muscular exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to TNF-Œ±. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-Œ±. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6. IL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise- induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage. However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric \\"nondamaging\\" muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery. Recent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling pathways for IL-6 differ markedly between myocytes and macrophages. It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent upon activation of the NFŒ∫B signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally independent of a preceding TNF-response or NFŒ∫B activation, and is anti- inflammatory. IL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic in myokine research. It appears in muscle tissue and in the circulation during exercise at levels up to one hundred times basal rates, as noted, and is seen as having a beneficial impact on health and bodily functioning when elevated in response to physical exercise. IL-6 was the first myokine that was found to be secreted into the blood stream in response to muscle contractions.  Receptor  IL-6 signals through a cell-surface type I cytokine receptor complex consisting of the ligand-binding IL-6RŒ± chain (CD126), and the signal-transducing component gp130 (also called CD130). CD130 is the common signal transducer for several cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotropic factor, oncostatin M, IL-11 and cardiotrophin-1, and is almost ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. In contrast, the expression of CD126 is restricted to certain tissues. As IL-6 interacts with its receptor, it triggers the gp130 and IL-6R proteins to form a complex, thus activating the receptor. These complexes bring together the intracellular regions of gp130 to initiate a signal transduction cascade through certain transcription factors, Janus kinases (JAKs) and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). IL-6 is probably the best-studied of the cytokines that use gp130, also known as IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST), in their signalling complexes. Other cytokines that signal through receptors containing gp130 are Interleukin 11 (IL-11), Interleukin 27 (IL-27), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interleukin 6-like protein (KSHV-IL6). These cytokines are commonly referred to as the IL-6 like or gp130 utilising cytokines In addition to the membrane- bound receptor, a soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) has been purified from human serum and urine. Many neuronal cells are unresponsive to stimulation by IL-6 alone, but differentiation and survival of neuronal cells can be mediated through the action of sIL-6R. The sIL-6R/IL-6 complex can stimulate neurites outgrowth and promote survival of neurons and, hence, may be important in nerve regeneration through remyelination.  Interactions  Interleukin-6 has been shown to interact with interleukin-6 receptor, glycoprotein 130, and Galectin-3. There is considerable functional overlap and interaction between Substance P (SP), the natural ligand for the neurokinin type 1 receptor (NK1R, a mediator of immunomodulatory activity) and IL-6.  Role in disease  IL-6 stimulates the inflammatory and auto-immune processes in many diseases such as Multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), diabetes, atherosclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's Disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, Beh√ßet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Hence, there is an interest in developing anti-IL-6 agents as therapy against many of these diseases. The first such is tocilizumab, which has been approved for rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Others are in clinical trials.First IL-6‚Äìblocking drug nears approval for rare blood disorder, Nature Medicine, October 7, 2013 =Rheumatoid arthritis= The first FDA approved anti-IL-6 treatment was for rheumatoid arthritis. = Cancer = Anti-IL-6 therapy was initially developed for treatment of autoimmune diseases, but due to the role of IL-6 in chronic inflammation, IL-6 blockade was also evaluated for cancer treatment. IL-6 was seen to have roles in tumor microenvironment regulation, production of breast cancer stem cell- like cells, metastasis through down-regulation of E-cadherin, and alteration of DNA methylation in oral cancer. Advanced/metastatic cancer patients have higher levels of IL-6 in their blood. One example of this is pancreatic cancer, with noted elevation of IL-6 present in patients correlating with poor survival rates. = Diseases =Enterovirus 71 High IL-6 levels are associated with the development of encephalitis in children and immunodeficient mouse models infected with Enterovirus 71; this highly contagious virus normally causes a milder illness called Hand, foot, and mouth disease but can cause life-threatening encephalitis in some cases. EV71 patients with a certain gene polymorphism in IL-6 also appear to be more susceptible to developing encephalitis. = Epigenetic modifications = IL-6 has been shown to lead to several neurological diseases through its impact on epigenetic modification within the brain. IL-6 activates the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and a downstream target of this pathway is the protein kinase B (PKB) (Hodge et al., 2007). IL-6 activated PKB can phosphorylate the nuclear localization signal on DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). This phosphorylation causes movement of DNMT1 to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed. DNMT1 recruits other DNMTs, including DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which, as a complex, recruit HDAC1. This complex adds methyl groups to CpG islands on gene promoters, repressing the chromatin structure surrounding the DNA sequence and inhibiting transcriptional machinery from accessing the gene to induce transcription. Increased IL-6, therefore, can hypermethylate DNA sequences and subsequently decrease gene expression through its effects on DNMT1 expression.  Schizophrenia  The induction of epigenetic modification by IL-6 has been proposed as a mechanism in the pathology of schizophrenia through the hypermethylation and repression of the GAD67 promoter. This hypermethylation may potentially lead to the decreased GAD67 levels seen in the brains of people with schizophrenia. GAD67 may be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia through its effect on GABA levels and on neural oscillations. Neural oscillations occur when inhibitory GABAergic neurons fire synchronously and cause inhibition of a multitude of target excitatory neurons at the same time, leading to a cycle of inhibition and disinhibition. These neural oscillations are impaired in schizophrenia, and these alterations may be responsible for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression and major depressive disorder  The epigenetic effects IL-6 have also been implicated in the pathology of depression. The effects of IL-6 on depression are mediated through the repression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the brain; DNMT1 hypermethylates the BDNF promoter and reduces BDNF levels. Altered BDNF function has been implicated in depression, which is likely due to epigenetic modification following IL-6 upregulation. BDNF is a neutrophic factor implicated in spine formation, density, and morphology on neurons. Downregulation of BDNF, therefore, may cause decreased connectivity in the brain. Depression is marked by altered connectivity, in particular between the anterior cingulate cortex and several other limbic areas, such as the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for detecting incongruences between expectation and perceived experience. Altered connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex in depression, therefore, may cause altered emotions following certain experiences, leading to depressive reactions. This altered connectivity is mediated by IL-6 and its effect on epigenetic regulation of BDNF. Additional preclinical and clinical data, suggest that Substance P [SP] and IL-6 may act in concert to promote major depression. SP, a hybrid neurotransmitter-cytokine, is co-transmitted with BDNF through paleo-spinothalamic circuitry from the periphery with collaterals into key areas of the limbic system. However, both IL6 and SP mitigate expression of BDNF in brain regions associated with negative affect and memory. SP and IL6 both relax tight junctions of the blood brain barrier, such that effects seen in fMRI experiments with these molecules may be a bidirectional mix of neuronal, glial, capillary, synaptic, paracrine, or endocrine-like effects. At the cellular level, SP is noted to increase expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) through PI-3K, p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase pathways. Data suggest that nuclear translocation of NF-Œ∫B regulates IL-6 overexpression in SP-stimulated cells. This is of key interest as: 1) a meta- analysis indicates an association of major depressive disorder, C-reactive protein and IL6 plasma concentrations, 2) NK1R antagonists [five molecules] studied by 3 independent groups in over 2000 patients from 1998 to 2013 validate the mechanism as dose-related, fully effective antidepressant, with a unique safety profile. (see Summary of NK1RAs in Major Depression), 3) the preliminary observation that plasma concentrations of IL6 are elevated in depressed patients with cancer, and 4) selective NK1RAs may eliminate endogenous SP stress-induced augmentation of IL-6 secretion pre-clinically. These and many other reports suggest that a clinical study of a neutralizing IL-6 biological or drug based antagonist is likely warranted in patients with major depressive disorder, with or without co-morbid chronic inflammatory based illnesses; that the combination of NK1RAs and IL6 blockers may represent a new, potentially biomarkable approach to major depression, and possibly bipolar disorder. The IL-6 antibody sirukumab is now undergoing clinical trials against major depressive disorder. =Asthma= Obesity is a known risk factor in the development of severe asthma. Recent data suggests that the inflammation associated with obesity, potentially mediated by IL-6, plays a role in causing poor lung function and increased risk for developing asthma exacerbations.  Protein superfamily  Interleukin is the main member of the IL-6 superfamily (), which also includes G-CSF, IL23A, and CLCF1. A viral version of IL6 is found in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.

From her teen years onwards, Fisher carefully developed her public image, which was boosted by attention from Sir Joshua Reynolds and other artists. By emphasizing Fisher's beauty, audacity, and charm, portraits and newspaper and magazine articles promoted her reputation and prompted spectators to view her with redoubled awe. She was one of the world's first celebrities famous not for being an actress, musician or member of the royalty, but simply for being famous. Her life exemplifies the emergence of mass media publishing and fame in an era when capitalism, commercialism, global markets, and rising emphasis on public opinion were transforming England.  Early life and courtesanship  Born in London,A German background, suggested as a possibility in the Dictionary of National Biography, is based on Sir Joshua Reynolds' spelling of her name consistently as \\"Fischer\\" and once as \\"Fisscher\\". she was the daughter of John Henry Fischer and Ann Fischer. According to some sources, she was originally a milliner, whom either Commodore Augustus Keppel, second son of the Earl of Albemarle (as reported by Town and Country in 1771) or perhaps Lieutenant- General (then Ensign) Anthony George Martin (d. 1800) reportedly introduced to London high life. With a flair for publicity, she became known for her affairs with men of wealth. Her appearance and dress were scrutinized and copied, scurrilous broadsheets and satires upon her were printed and circulated, and several portraits of her by Joshua Reynolds, including one in which she posed as Cleopatra Dissolving the Pearl, were engraved. Prints from these engravings were sold to thousands of her fans, making Kitty Fisher one of the first \\"pin- up\\" glamour girls. In one famous incident, on 12 March 1759, Kitty Fisher fell off her horse while riding in St James's Park, apparently exposing that she wore no underpants. Scores of broadsheets, ballads, and prints mocked her, playing on the pun of being a fallen woman. But Fisher was not one to be outdone and immediately seized public attention for her own ends by having her portrait painted by Joshua Reynolds, the most prominent painter in England. Her fame spread throughout Europe. When he visited London in 1763, the famous Italian lover Giacomo Casanova met Fisher and wrote: :... the illustrious Kitty Fisher, who was just beginning to be fashionable. She was magnificently dressed, and it is no exaggeration to say that she had on diamonds worth five hundred thousand francs. Goudar told me that if I liked I might have her then and there for ten guineas. I did not care to do so, however, for, though charming, she could only speak English, and I liked to have all my senses, including that of hearing, gratified. When she had gone, Mrs Wells told us that Kitty had eaten a bank-note for a thousand guineas, on a slice of bread and butter, that very day. The note was a present from Sir Akins, brother of the fair Mrs Pitt. I do not know whether the bank thanked Kitty for the present she had made it. It is unclear to what extent Casanova's account is to be trusted, as similar stories of a currency or bank-note sandwich were told about several other women who were Fisher's contemporaries. His insistence that Fisher spoke only English is contradicted by other sources. It is possible Casanova sought to link his name to Fisher's due to her celebrity. Fisher maintained a famous rivalry with Maria Gunning, who had become Lady Coventry after a calculated insertion into the marriage market orchestrated by Gunning's mother. Fisher's rumoured affair with Lord Coventry several years later sparked the rivalry. Giustiniana Wynne, visiting London at the time, wrote: :\\"The other day they ran into each other in the park and Lady Coventry asked Kitty the name of the dressmaker who had made her dress. Kitty Fisher answered she had better ask Lord Coventry as he had given her the dress as a gift.\\" The altercation continued with Lady Coventry calling her an impertinent woman, and Fisher replying that she would have to accept this insult because Maria became her 'social superior' on marrying Lord Coventry, but she was going to marry a Lord herself just to be able to answer back. Fisher's retort to Lady Coventry shows her intentions to marry a Lord and thus ascend social class by means of marriage, in much the same way as Gunning herself. Fisher's cynical assessment of the gender politics of the day shows an awareness of the constraints on single women with a mind towards greater social mobility, but also serves as a condemnation of the Gunning girls for positioning themselves to marry wealthy, powerful men, merely for their own means and preservation. Wynne also wrote that: :\\"She lives in the greatest possible splendor,In Carrington Street in fashionable Mayfair, according to DNB. spends twelve thousand pounds a year, and she is the first of her social class to employ liveried servants -- she even has liveried chaise porters.\\" Quoted in A Venetian Affair by Andrea di Robilant.  Later life and death  The first artist known to have painted her was Joshua Reynolds. In addition to the portraits made famous through engraved prints that were marketed directly to the public, he did several other painting of Fisher that suggest a more intimate, private view. Some of these appear to be unfinished studies. Nathaniel Hone. Nathaniel Hone painted her at least once in 1765, at the height of her popularity, and possibly a second time as well. His famous painting, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows her with a kitten ('kitty'), which is trying to get at a goldfish in a bowl ('fisher'). Reflected in the bowl are the faces of a crowd of people, looking through a window. Besides sitting multiple times for Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds, she may have been painted by Philip Mercier, James Northcote, and Richard Purcell, among others. Apart from the letters of Giustiniana Wynne, she is mentioned in the diaries and letters of people as varied as Madame D'Arblay and Horace Walpole. In 1766, she married John Norris, son of the M.P. for Rye and grandson of Admiral Sir John Norris. She came to live at her husband's family house, Hemsted (now the premises of the prestigious English public school Benenden School). Some sources say she settled into the proper role of mistress of Hemsted, building up Norris's fortune and enjoying the company of the local folk, who liked her for her generosity to the poor. Unfortunately, she died only four months after her marriage, some sources say from the effects of lead-based cosmetics (although this may be a confusion with the fate of her rival Lady Coventry), some from smallpox or consumption, in 1767. She was buried in Benenden churchyard dressed in her best ball gown.  Legacy  Fisher is mentioned in the nursery rhyme Lucy Locket: :\\"Lucy Locket lost her pocket, :Kitty Fisher found it; :But ne'er a penny was there in't :Except the binding round it.\\" Music publisher Peter Thompson also published a country dance bearing her name in Volume II of Thompson's Compleat Collection of 200 Country Dances published in 1764. During her lifetime, numerous books and articles claiming to tell her life story were published, although these were spurious and make it difficult to separate biographical facts from the myth of Kitty Fisher. She was also included as a character in several eighteenth- century novels, including Chrysal by Charles Jonstone. Paulette Goddard played her in the 1945 blockbuster film Kitty, released by Paramount Pictures. A fictionalized version of Fisher appeared in the 1991 Channel Four historic musical fantasy Ghosts of Oxford Street, played by Kirsty MacColl.

Four dams were constructed under this treaty: three in British Columbia, Canada (Duncan Dam, Mica Dam, Keenleyside Dam) and one in Montana in the United States (Libby Dam). The treaty provided for the sharing with Canada of half of the downstream US power and flood benefits, and allows the operation of Treaty storage for other benefits. The long-term impacts of the treaty have been mixed: while the dams have provided enormous economic benefits to British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest through hydroelectric generation and flood control, there are longstanding concerns regarding social and economic impacts to the local communities, and the environmental effects associated with the construction and operation of large dams. Background In 1944, the Canadian and US governments agreed to begin studying the potential for joint development of dams in the Columbia River basin. Planning efforts were slow until a 1948 Columbia River flood caused extensive damage from Trail, British Columbia, to near Astoria, Oregon, completely destroying Vanport, the second largest city in Oregon. The increased interest in flood protection and the growing need for power development initiated 11 years of discussion and alternative proposals for construction of dams in Canada. In 1959, the governments issued a report that recommended principles for negotiating an agreement and apportioning the costs and benefits. Formal negotiations began in February 1960 and the Treaty was signed 17 January 1961 by Prime Minister Diefenbaker and President Eisenhower.\\"Columbia River Treaty Signed: U.S., Canada Pledge Resource Development\\", Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner. 17 January 1961. Page A1. The treaty was not implemented, however, until over three years later because of difficulties in creating arrangements for funding the construction of the Canadian dams and marketing the electrical power owed to Canada which was surplus to Canadian needs during the early treaty years. A Treaty Protocol and a Canada-B.C. agreement were signed in January 1964 that limited and clarified many treaty provisions, defined rights and obligations between the British Columbia and Canadian governments, and allowed for the sale of the Canadian Entitlement to downstream U.S. power authorities (BPA). Instruments of ratification were exchanged and the treaty was implemented on 16 September 1964. = United States = Starting in the 1930s, the United States constructed dams on the lower Columbia River for power generation, flood control, channel navigation, and irrigation in Washington as part of the Columbia Basin Project. Dam construction on the American side of the border thus began prior to the entry into force of the Columbia River Treaty. There were various plans put forward in the early 20th century for major dams on the Columbia, many focused on irrigation, but development did not begin in earnest until the 1930s. During the Great Depression, the US Federal Government provided the impetus for construction, as part of the New Deal make-work program. Construction on the Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams began during this period, but government involvement in Columbia dam construction has continued through to the present. The long range plans for American development of the Columbia for hydroelectricity came together in the late 1930s. In 1937, the US Congress passed the Bonneville Power Act, creating the Bonneville Power Administration. This was a new federal institution meant to build transmission lines and sell the power generated by Bonneville, Grand Coulee and future Columbia Dams. While these projects substantially increased the ability to control floods and generate power, the system was unable to provide full protection or maximize the amount of power generated. American planners realized that the full potential of the river could only be harnessed through transboundary cooperation to create additional storage capacity above the existing lower Columbia complex. With the storage provided in Canada, water releases could be timed to meet power demand, rather than relying on the snowmelt-determined natural flow rates of the river. =Canada= In Canada, British Columbia Premier W.A.C. Bennett and his Social Credit Government were responsible for the development of infrastructure throughout the province during the 1950s and 1960s. Bennett was the Canadian force behind the Columbia River Treaty and as a believer in the development of public power, he created and promoted a \\"Two Rivers Policy\\". This policy outlined the hydroelectric development of two major rivers within the province of British Columbia: the Peace River and the Columbia River. Bennett wanted to develop the Peace River to fuel northern expansion and development, while using the Columbia River to provide power to growing industries throughout the province. The ongoing negotiations of the Columbia River Treaty provided a unique opportunity for W.A.C. Bennett to fulfil his Two Rivers Policy by working around British Columbia's monetary issues. During the 1950s, the government of British Columbia lacked the funds necessary to develop both the Columbia and Peace rivers and privately owned utility BC Electric was unwilling to pay for hydroelectric development on these rivers. Therefore, the BC Energy Board recommended that hydroelectric development be undertaken as a public venture. On 1 August 1961 Bill 5 was proposed to the BC legislature calling for provincial control over BC Electric and creation of the Peace River Power Development Company. Later that month, Bill 5 was passed into law paving the way for the creation of BC Hydro in 1963, completing Bennett's vision of \\"public power\\". BC Hydro thereafter consisted of BC Electric, the Peace River Power Development Company, and the BC Power Commission. The creation of a government owned power entity allowed Bennett to finance the dams and powerhouses on the Columbia at lower interest rates, thus reducing the cost. Next, the BC-Canada Agreement of 8 July 1963 designated BC Hydro as the entity responsible for Canadian dams outlined in the treaty, and annual operations of the treaty. Lastly, Bennett directed the negotiations for a Canadian Entitlement sales agreement which provided the funds to develop both the Columbia and the Peace rivers simultaneously. Since it was illegal for Canada to export power during the 1950s and 1960s, the funds provided by the Columbia River Treaty entitlement were the only affordable way for British Columbia to develop both rivers, thus the Treaty became integral to Bennett's vision of power in British Columbia. With the cash received from the sale of the additional power generation of the Canadian Entitlement (approximately C$274.8 million in Sept. 1964 for the first 30 years) the BC government proceeded to develop power facilities on both the Columbia and Peace Rivers, fulfilling Bennett's 'Two River Policy'. In short, BC pursued the Columbia River Treaty because it provided a unique opportunity for hydroelectric development that otherwise would not have been possible (due to the financial situation of the province during that period). It was the hope that these developments would promote industrial growth within the province and help expand the economy. Treaty provisions Under the terms of the agreement, Canada was required to provide 19.12 km¬≥ (15.5 million acre-feet (Maf)) of usable reservoir storage behind three large dams. This was to be accomplished with 1.73 km¬≥ (1.4 Maf) provided by Duncan Dam (1967), 8.76 km¬≥ (7.1 Maf) provided by Arrow Dam (1968) [subsequently renamed the Hugh Keenleyside Dam], and 8.63 km¬≥ (7.0 Maf) provided by Mica Dam (1973). The latter dam, however, was built higher than required by the Treaty, and thus provides a total of 14.80 km¬≥ (12 Maf) including 6.17 km¬≥ (5.0 Maf) of Non Treaty Storage space. Unless otherwise agreed, the three Canadian Treaty projects are required to operate for flood protection and increased power generation at-site and downstream in both Canada and the United States, although the allocation of water storage operations among the three projects is at Canadian discretion. The downstream power and flood control benefits in the United States created by the operation of Canada's Treaty reservoirs are shared by the two countries in accordance with Treaty provisions. The Treaty also allowed the U.S. to build the Libby Dam on the Kootenai River in Montana which provides a further 6.14 km¬≥ (4.98 Maf) of active storage in the Koocanusa reservoir. Although the name sounds like it might be of aboriginal origins, it is actually a concatenation of the first three letters from Kootenai / Kootenay, Canada and USA, and was the winning entry in a contest to name the reservoir. Water behind the Libby dam floods back into Canada, while the water released from the dam returns to Canada just upstream of Kootenay Lake. Libby Dam began operation in March 1972 and is operated for power, flood control, and other benefits at-site and downstream in both Canada and the United States. The U.S. did not pay Canada for the land submerged by the Libby Dam reservoir and Canada does not pay the U.S. for the resulting power and flood control benefits downstream on the Kootenay River. With the exception of the Mica Dam, which was designed and constructed with a powerhouse, the Canadian Treaty projects were initially built for the sole purpose of regulating water flow. In 2002, however, a joint venture between the Columbia Power Corporation and the Columbia Basin Trust constructed the 185 MW Arrow Lakes Hydro project in parallel with the Keenleyside Dam near Castlegar, 35 years after the storage dam was originally completed. The Duncan Dam remains a storage project, and has no power generation facilities. The Canadian and U.S. Entities defined by the Treaty, and appointed by the national governments, manage most of the Treaty required activities. The Canadian Entity is B.C. Hydro and Power Authority, and the U.S. Entity is the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration and the Northwestern Division Engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Treaty also established a Permanent Engineering Board, consisting of equal members from Canada and the U.S., that reports to both governments annually on Treaty issues, any deviations from the operating plans, and assists the Entities in resolving any disputes. =Payment for U.S. Benefits= As payment for the U.S. benefits realized by the Canadian storage operation, the Treaty required the U.S. to: # deliver to Canada half of the estimated increase in U.S. downstream power benefits, on an ongoing basis (the Canadian Entitlement), and # make a one-time monetary payment as each of the dams were completed for half of the value of the estimated future flood damages prevented in the U.S. The Canadian Entitlement is calculated five years in advance for each operating year using an agreed treaty calculation method, and the amount varies mainly as a function of forecasted power loads, thermal generating resources, and operating procedures. The method gives Canada a \\"first-added\\" storage benefit that ignores U.S. dams built after 1961 (e.g. Libby and Dworshak), limits sales of surplus power to California, and excludes modern fish related constraints at U.S. dams. Without the first two of these limits, the Canadian Entitlement would be slightly less than half of current values. The Canadian Entitlement during the August 2012 through July 2013 operating year is 504.5 average annual megawatts of energy (reduced by 3.4% for transmission losses, net ‚âà 4,269 GWh), shaped hourly at peak rates up to 1321 MW (minus 1.9% for transmission losses, net = 1296 MW). The Canadian Entitlement is marketed by Powerex (electricity). The Canadian Entitlement varies from year to year, but is generally in the range of 4,400 GWh per year and about 1,250 MW of capacity. The Treaty required the U.S. to pay a total of $64.4 million for the flood control benefits due to the operation of 8.45 Maf of Canadian storage. The payment was based on an allocation that: # gives Canada equal credit to U.S. projects existing in 1961 (better than first added), # ignores the flood control benefits provided by Libby and other post-1961 U.S. projects, and # also ignores the flood control benefits provided by the Canadian power storage operation that normally drafts far more than the 8.45 Maf flood control obligation. The estimated annual benefit was capitalized for an up-front payment based on a low U.S. interest rate of 3‚Öû percent for the flood damages prevented until September 2024. The U.S. insisted on determining the payment based on benefits until 2024 because the alternative was to construct U.S. dams that would be fully paid for by then. Canada accepted the calculation method and explained to Parliament that the $64.4 million is 24% greater than the value to Canada at 5¬Ω% interest of annual payments made in perpetuity. Absent any new agreements, the U.S. purchase of an annual operation of Canadian storage for flood control will expire in 2024 and be replaced with an option for the U.S. to \\"Call Upon\\" Canadian storage for flood control needs that cannot adequately be met by U.S. projects, and the U.S. must pay Canada for operating costs and any economic losses due to requested flood control operations. =Termination= The treaty has no end date, but it includes an option for either country to terminate most treaty provisions anytime after 60 years (i.e. 16 September 2024), given at least 10 years advance notice. If the treaty is terminated, several provisions continue including Called Upon flood control, operation and coordination of Libby, and Kootenay River diversion rights. The Canadian and US governments are reviewing the treaty before the 2014 opportunity for notice for earliest termination. Options generally fall into three categories: * Continue the Treaty with the automatic change to called upon flood control, * Terminate the treaty (with continued called upon flood control), or * Negotiate changes to the treaty that modify the flood control and power obligations and/or create new provisions for other benefits, especially environmental objectives. The BCBC Government Review Site and US governments launched websites to inform and engage citizens about the review. Impacts Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker (seated left) and US President Dwight Eisenhower at the signing of the Columbia River Treaty, 1961 There was initial controversy over the Columbia River Treaty when British Columbia refused to give consent to ratify it on the grounds that while the province would be committed to building the three major dams within its borders, it would have no assurance of a purchaser for the Canadian Entitlement which was surplus to the province's needs at the time. The final ratification came in 1964 when a consortium of 37 public and four private utilities in the United States agreed to pay C$274.8 million to purchase the Canadian Entitlement for a period of 30 years from the scheduled completion date of each of the Canadian projects. British Columbia used the funds, along with the U.S. payment of C$69.6 million for U.S. flood control benefits, to construct the Canadian dams. In recent years, the Treaty has garnered significant attention, not because of what it contains, but because of what it is lacking. A reflection of the times in which it was negotiated, the Treaty's emphasis is on hydroelectricity and flood control. The \\"Assured Operating Plans\\" that determine the Canadian Entitlement amounts and establish a base operation for Canadian Treaty storage, include little direct treatment of other interests that have grown in importance over the years, such as fish protection, irrigation and other environmental concerns. However, the Treaty permits the Entities to incorporate a broad range of interests into the \\"Detailed Operating Plans\\" that are agreed to immediately prior to the operating year, and which modify the \\"Assured Operating Plans\\" to produce results more advantageous to both countries. For more than 20 years, the \\"Detailed Operating Plans\\" have included a growing number of fish-friendly operations designed to address environmental concerns on both sides of the border. BC Premier W.A.C. Bennett was a major player in negotiating the treaty and, according to U.S. Senator Clarence Dill, was a tough bargainer. The U.S. paid C$275 million, which accrued to C$458 million after interest. But Bennett's successor Dave Barrett was skeptical about the deal; he observed that the three dams and associated power lines ultimately cost three times that figure, in addition to other costs. Dr. Hugh L. Keenleyside (for whom Keenleyside dam is named) dismissed these claims and other confusion about the Treaty benefits and costs in his 1974 paper \\"Ten Year Later, The Results of the Columbia River Treaty.\\" He explained that the original estimate of the cost of the Canadian dams was about C$411 million in 1963 dollars. Actual cost in 1973 dollars was about C$548 million, and this included $50 million in regional improvement beyond replacement of like for like. This was a 33% increase over ten years, and he noted that during that time the average cost of dams and reservoirs in Canada increased by 80%. The value of the U.S. power and flood control payments in 1973 dollars, which had increased with interest, was C$479 million; leaving a deficit of C$69 million. For this cost, B.C. was then able to add a power house at Mica, and later at Kootenay Canal, Revelstoke and Keenleyside, and construct transmission lines, to delivery power to major load centers far cheaper than alternatives. Since the end of the 30-year sale of the Canadian Entitlement to the U.S. in March 2003, the U.S. delivery of the Entitlement power to B.C. has been a benefit far greater than the C$5 million per year estimate by the Canadian government in 1964. The B.C. government reported in Dec. 2012 that the average annual revenue from the Canadian Entitlement power, which is marketed by POWEREX for the Province, over the previous ten years was C$202 million per year. Those revenues go into the Province's Consolidated Revenue Fund. =Social Impacts=Local Various attitudes were generated from local residents who would be affected directly or indirectly by the construction of the Columbia River Treaty dams. BC Hydro had to relocate and compensate for peoples loss of land, and homes. In Arrow Lake 3,144 properties had to be bought and 1,350 people had to be relocated. With the construction of the Duncan Dam 39 properties were bought and 30 people moved, subsequently at Mica Dam 25 properties including trap lines and other economic resourceful lands were bought. Since Arrow Lake had the largest number of people needing to be relocated it generated the most controversy and varying of opinions. People who worked on the dam felt a sense of pride and purpose for being able to provide for their families on a long term basis. However, due to the exclusion of local hearings for the Treaty and the outcome of the Arrow Dam many residents felt powerless in the provinces decision to flood the area. In response, the Columbia Basin Trust was established, in part, to address the long term socio-economic impacts in British Columbia that resulted from this flooding. J.W Wilson who took part in the settlement agreement for BC Hydro noticed that while they looked at the physical value of the resident's houses they were unable to include the losses that went along with living self-sufficiently, which was a lifestyle that would not be possible in a city or urban area. The kind of wealth that went unnoticed consisted of agriculture, livestock, tourism and lumber. Paying minimal taxes also enabled a self-sufficient lifestyle with little cost. In addition, from an outsiders perspective it seemed as though BC Hydro was being fair with the resident's settlement prices for their land and homes. However many people thought that the settlement prices from BC Hydro were unfair, but were intimidated and felt powerless to challenge them in court, so they accepted the prices begrudgingly. The residents questioned what benefits the dam would have for them if they were just going to be relocated, and lose money in the long run. However, BC Hydro built new communities for those living from Nakusp to Edgewood, as part of the compensation process. These communities came with BC Hydro electricity, running water, telephone services, a school, a church, a park and stores. Finally, building the dam did provide work for many families, and supplied electricity to remote communities that were once out of reach of BC's transmission grid, and dependent on gas and diesel generators. Despite receiving physical reimbursement, Wilson argues that the emotional loss of peoples homes and familiar landscape could not be compensated, and increased the physical and psychological stress of relocating their homes and communities. The emotional loss was especially difficult for the First Nations people living around these areas. The Sinixt people who occupied the Columbia River Valley for thousands of years, lost sacred burial grounds, an extremely devastating experience for their community. Furthermore, the Sinixt were labeled as officially extinct by the Canadian government in 1953 despite many Sinixt people still being alive. It is questionable the timing of labeling these people extinct, with the quick follow up of signing the Columbia River Treat a few years after. With that in mind Indian Affairs of Canada had to power to possibly influence the signing of the dams in particular the Libby and Wardner Dam and potential cost of replacement as well as \\"rehabilitating Indians\\". However, due to the push to assimilate First Nations people into a cash based economy, and no reserves being physically affected by the dams, Indian Affairs had minimal participation and influence. Once again, like BC Hydro, Indian Affairs disregarded hunting, fishing, gathering, and sacred grounds as having either material, emotional or spiritual significance to First Nations people. Provincial The objective of the International Joint Commission (IJC), with regard to the development of the Columbia River Basin, was to accomplish with the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) what would not have been possible through either British Columbia or the U.S. operating individually. It was expected that either additional costs would have been avoided or additional benefits gained by the cooperation between BC/Canada and the US. However, many felt that such expectations were left unrealized by the effects of the actual treaty. Soon after the treaty came into effect, it became apparent that greater combined returns had not necessarily been achieved than had each country continued operating independently. Others dispute that idea. Over the lifespan of the treaty, both positive and negative impacts have been felt by the province of British Columbia (BC). For BC, the positive impacts of the treaty have included both direct and indirect economic and social benefits. Direct benefits came in the form of better flood protection, increased power generation at both new and existing facilities, assured winter flows (for power) and the Canadian Entitlement power currently owed to BC by the U.S. (valued at approximately $300 million annually). At the beginning of the treaty, the province received lump sum payments from the U.S. for the sale of the Canadian Entitlement for 30 years and for the provision of 60 years of assured flood protection to the Northwestern States. Indirect benefits to the province have included the creation of employment opportunities for several thousand people in the construction and operation of dams as well as lower power rates for customers in both BC and the Northwestern U.S. Furthermore, many later developments in BC were made possible by the CRT because of water regulation provided by upstream storage. The Kootenay Canal Plant (1975), Revelstoke Dam (1984), 185 MW Arrow Lakes Generating Station and the Brilliant Expansion Project are examples of these developments. Another project made possible in part by the CRT was the Pacific DC Intertie, which was constructed in the U.S. and to this day remains a key part of the western power grid, facilitating easy trading of power between all parts of western Canada and the western U.S. However, for the province of BC, the impacts of the CRT were not entirely positive. By 1974, only ten years after the signing of the treaty, professors, politicians and experts across BC were divided on how beneficial it was to the province. Many said that the terms of the treaty would never have been accepted in their present day. The negative impacts of the CRT have affected both the economy and the environment of BC. Treaty revenue from U.S. was used to pay in part for the construction of the Duncan, Keenleyside and Mica dams, but the cost to BC to build the three dams exceeded the revenue initially received from the sale of downstream power and flood control benefits. The province also had to pay for improved highway, bridges, railway relocation, as well as welfare increases for the people affected by installation of the dams. Because of this deficit, it is alleged that school and hospital construction suffered, and services such as the Forest Service, highways and water resources were secretly tapped for funds. It has become obvious, in retrospect, that the 30-year sale of the Canadian Entitlement was underestimated at the time of the treaty signing. W.A.C. Bennett's administration has often been criticized for being short- sighted in initial negotiations, but it was difficult to accurately value these agreements at the time. In 1960, Columbia River power produced half a million tons of aluminum for the U.S. By 1974, treaty power had increased this production threefold, hurting BC's own aluminum production, effectively exporting thousands of jobs in this industry. Further negative impacts include the flooding of approximately 600 km2 of fertile and productive valley bottoms to fill the Arrow Lakes, Duncan, Kinbasket and Koocanusa reservoirs. No assessment of the value of flooded forest land was ever made; land which could have produced valuable timber for the BC economy. = Environmental impacts =Canada 250px The Columbia River has the greatest annual drainage as compared to all other rivers along the Pacific coast. Before the introduction of dams on the river, the changes in water level rose and fell predictably with the seasons and a nine-meter displacement existed between the spring snowmelt highs and fall lows. After the dams were built, the river flows changed and in some areas the previous maximum and minimum water levels were altered by several tens of meters. High spring-summer flows were reduced, and fall-winter flows were increased to satisfy United States power demands. After the damming, the water during high floods began to cover much of the valley's arable land - and when it was drawn down to produce power it carried away fertile soil, leaving agricultural land useless. Additionally, it is estimated that the habitat of 8,000 deer, 600 elk, 1,500 moose, 2,000 black bears, 70,000 ducks and geese was flooded due to the creation of the reservoirs. The introduction of a dam affects every living thing in the surrounding area, both up and downstream. Upstream change is obvious as water levels rise and submerge nesting grounds and migration routes for water fowl. As water levels in storage reservoirs change throughout the year, aquatic habitat and food source availability become unreliable. Plankton, a main staple of salmon and trout's diet, is especially sensitive to changes in water level. Nutrient rich sediment, that would previously have flowed downstream, becomes trapped in the reservoirs above dams, resulting in changes in water properties and temperatures on either side of the barrier. A difference in water temperature of 9 degrees Celsius was once measured between the Columbia and its tributary the Snake River. When silt settles to the bottom of the river or reservoir it covers rocks, ruins spawning grounds and eliminates all hiding place for smaller fish to escape from predators. Alteration in water quality, such as acidity or gas saturation, may not be visually dramatic, but can be deadly to certain types of aquatic life. The Columbia River, with its series of dams and reservoirs, is influenced by a complex combination of these effects, making it difficult to predict or understand exactly how the animal populations will react. Salmon and Steelhead trout travel from the ocean upriver to various spawning grounds. The construction of multiple dams on the Columbia threatened this fishery as the fish struggled to complete the migration upstream. All dams on the Columbia River downstream of Chief Joseph have fish ladders installed, from Wells to Bonneville Dam. Migration downriver is also problematic after dams are built. Pre-dam currents on the Columbia efficiently carried fry to the ocean, but the introduction of dams and reservoirs changed the flow of the river, forcing the young fish to exert much more energy to swim through slack waters. In addition, many fish are killed by the dam turbines as they try to swim further downstream. It is unclear exactly how many fish are killed in the turbines, but old estimates range between 8-12% per dam. If a fish hatches high upstream they will have to swim through multiple dams, leading to possible cumulative losses of over 50-80% of the migrating fry. Efforts to make turbines safer for fish to pass through have significantly reduced fish loses to near pre-dam levels. While hatcheries appear to be quite successful for some species of fish, their efforts to increase fish populations will not be effective until up and downstream migration is improved. There is no one solution to improving the salmon and trout populations on the Columbia as it is the cumulative effects of the dams, slack-water reservoirs, loss of habitat, pollution, and overfishing that are killing the fish. From 1965 to 1969, 27, 312 acres were logged along the Columbia River to remove timber from the new flood plain. The slashing of vegetation along the shoreline weakened soil stability and made the land susceptible to wind erosion, creating sandstorms. Conversely, in wet periods, the cleared areas turned into vast mud flats. In the late 1940s, the BC Fish and Wildlife Branch began studying the impacts the dams were having on the area's animal inhabitants. Their findings resulted in a small sum being designated for further research and harm mitigation. Their work, in collaboration with local conservation groups, became focused on preserving Kokanee stock jeopardized by the Duncan Dam which ruined kilometers of spawning grounds key to Kokanee, Bull Trout, and Rainbow Trout survival. Since Rainbow and Bull Trout feed on Kokanee, it was essential Kokanee stock remained strong. As a result, BC Hydro funded the construction of Meadow Creek Spawning Channel in 1967, which is 3.3 km (2 miles) long, and at the time was longest human-made spawning ground and first made for fresh water sport fish. The channel supports 250,000 spawning Kokanee every year, resulting in 10-15 million fry, with the mean egg to fry survival rate at around 45%. BC Hydro has also provided some funding to Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area to help alleviate damage done by Duncan Dam to surrounding habitats. The area is a seasonal home to many unique bird species, such as Tundra Swans, Greater White-Fronted Geese and many birds of prey. Such species are sensitive to changes in the river as they rely on it for food and their nesting grounds are typically found quite close to the water. BC Hydro, in partnership with the Province of BC and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, has also been contributing to the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program since 1988. United States Unlike the Columbia's Canadian reach, the US portion of the river had already been heavily developed by the time the treaty entered into force. Because the US role in the agreement was largely to supply power generating capacity, and that capacity was already in place, it was not obligated to construct any new dams. While in the Upper Columbia, treaty dams meant the filling of large reservoirs, submerging large tracts of land, on the Lower Columbia no new dams had to be built. The local effects of dam construction were limited to those of the Libby Dam in Montana. The US was authorized to build this optional dam on the Kootenay River, a tributary of the Columbia. Lake Koocanusa, Libby Dam's reservoir, extends some distance into Canada. Because this project involved a transboundary reservoir, it was slow to move from planning to construction. By 1966, when construction began, the environmental movement had begun to have some political currency. Environmental impact assessments found that this dam would be deleterious to a variety of large game animals, including big-horned sheep and elk. While the Libby Dam opened the possibilities of downstream irrigation, scientists determined that it would also destroy valuable wetland ecosystems and alter the river hydrology throughout the area of its extent, in the reservoir and far downstream. Under pressure from environmental activist groups, the Army Corps of Engineers developed a mitigation plan that represents a major departure from the previous treaty dams. This plan addressed concerns about fish by building hatcheries, acquired land to serve as grazing areas for animals whose normal ranges were submerged, and implemented a technological fix as part of the dam project that enabled control of the temperature of water released from the dam. The local environmental impact of the Libby Dam was to flood 40,000 acres (around 162 square kilometers), altering downstream and upstream ecosystems. This was the greatest direct environmental effect of the treaty in the United States. While the Libby Dam and Lake Koocanusa were the most visible results of the treaty in the US, there were long-ranging environmental implications of the new management regime. The increased storage capacity in the Upper Columbia dams afforded river managers a much greater degree of control over the river's hydrograph. Peak flows could now be more dramatically reduced, and low flows bolstered by controlled releases from storage. Peak power demands tend to occur in midwinter and midsummer, so river managers calibrate releases to coincide with periods of high demand. This is a dramatic change from the snowmelt-driven summer peak flows of the river prior to its development. See also *Hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River *B.C.

Stoney Point is a popular destination for hikers, equestrians and also with rock climbers because of its large boulders, which afford many opportunities to practice the sport of bouldering. The top of the rock formation offers excellent views of Chatsworth, the Santa Susana Mountains, Coyote Pass, and the entire San Fernando Valley. Wildlife including coyotes, rattlesnakes, red tailed hawks, golden eagles, turkey vultures, rabbits, and skunks can all be found at Stoney Point. When visiting the park, dogs should be kept on a leash for their own safety and a watchful eye should be kept for africanized \\"killer\\" bees. Geology Geologists know Stoney Point as the Chatsworth Formation, which are the giant rock outcroppings in Simi Hills. They are Upper Cretaceous outcroppings, which means they are more than 65 million years old. They originated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, possibly on the continental shelf near Central America, or even near Baja California. They were formed by turbidity currents, giant ‚Äúgravity slides‚Äù that deposited sand in the ocean at the depth of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. These turbidity currents were often ‚Äútens of miles in length and a half a mile or more in width‚Äù which explains the size of the mountains around the Chatsworth Formation, and makes them turbidites. In between this activity, in quiet times, silt from the ocean would settle on the formation, and because silt erodes more quickly, the different turbidity currents that formed the rock are visible. The Chatsworth formation is part of the Pacific Plate, which grinds against the North American Plate, and therefore is continuously pushed northwest at a rate of 2.5 inches per year. The Chatsworth Formation was pushed out of the ocean, and, as part of Simi Hills, created part of the Transverse Ranges. Because any fossils left in the ocean were ground up on the journey up, there are very few fossils to be found in the area. The sandstone is a medium-grained variety, and was originally light gray; however, the mica and clay in the rock oxidizes and turns a tan color. Not all of Chatsworth Formation has oxidized yet, and some is still light gray. History Stoney Point is the site of a Tongva Indian rancheria until the 1790s, with Spanish invasion. It is believed that the Village of Momonga was located at Stoney Point. It is culturally significant because Momonga was multilingual and multiracial, allowing intermarriage of Chumash, Fernandeno and Gabrieleno peoples. A sulphur spring, believed to possess spiritual properties runs adjacent to Stoney Point Park on the Eastern side. It is said that shamans would visit Stoney Point in preparation for the Winter Solstice celebration that drew native people from as far away as Temecula. It was used as a marker by the Southern Pacific Railroad during construction of the railroad through the Santa Susana Mountains. It is also said to have been used as a hideout by the outlaw Tiburcio Vasquez in the 1870s. Historic Site It was designated a historical Los Angeles Historic and Cultural Monument in 1974, because of its historic and cultural value as well as being deemed one of the \\"most picturesque places in Los Angeles.\\" The facility features 81 acres of land, including a five-acre equestrian center which was purchased by the City in 2007 and is home to the Annual Chatsworth Day of the Horse Festival hosted by the Chatsworth Neighborhood Council each Spring. During the land grab that resulted from the McKinley Act, Stoney Point was claimed by the Charlton Family of New York. Stoney Point was the site of the Charlton Quarry,\\"Mines and Mineral Deposits of Los Angeles County,\\" by Thomas E. Gay, Jr., Assistant Mining Geologist, California State Division of Mines, California Journal of Mines and Geology, Vol. 50, Nos. 3 and 4, July - October 1954, pp. 467-709. one of three Chatsworth Quarries that was operated by the Bannon Mining Company. \\"Dimension Stone\\" was quarried for the nearby train tunnel. Remnants of the quarry can still be found on the eastern side of Stoney Point along the Santa Susana Creek. Remnants from the Charlton Quarry Railroad History Stoney Point functions as mile marker on the Southern Pacific Railroad, which links much of Southern California to Northern California. Stoney Point is located at the base of the Simi/Santa Susana Grade. Stone that was quarried at Stoney Point was used in Chatsworth's train tunnels. When inhabited by the Gabrielino-Tongva tribe and the missionaries in the early years, the land was prime for agriculture including fruit, vegetables, wheat, and barley. However, once the railroad was in place, the heavy iron from the tracks and constant land disruption altered the availability of wilderness. Forests and vegetation had to be eliminated in order to lay the track and Native Americans had to be relocated from their homelands. Natives were forced to lose all that they had worked on when they had to leave their fertile soil and efficient irrigation. After the turn of the Century, dry farming resumed and most of the land surrounding Stoney Point was planted with citrus and olives. Today, it is surrounded by horse boarding stables and equestrian homes. Because of a blind curve caused by Stoney Points rock formations, train operators would sound the whistle as they approached the bend. Residents complained and today's engineers sound the whistle either from the Chatsworth train depot or as they exit the tunnel at the top of the grade. The easement that connects Rinaldi Street to Andora Avenue by crossing the railroad tracks was once the \\"Old Mission Trail\\" and was the primary route to the San Fernando Mission from Chatsworth and later became known as North Andora Avenue. Later, the street name was changed to Rinaldi, but an equestrian easement remains. In 1998, Councilmember Hal Bernson included the easement in his \\"Guide to Equestrian Trails\\" and stood behind the community by keeping the easement open when the MTA tried to restrict access. In 2001, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority cut down the ancient Eucalyptus trees that lined the railroad tracks in Stoney Point out of concern for the safety of park visitors should one of the trees fall on the tracks. On September 12, 2008 at 16:22PST, a Metrolink Commuter Train collided with a cargo train resulting in 25 fatalities in what was declared the worst train wreck in U.S. History in over 40 years. The crash site is on the Northeast side of the park and is accessible through the park. In September 2009, Councilmember Mitchell Englander hosted a memorial at Stoney Point and a marker was placed in memory of the victims. Civilian first responders from the local community and passengers who survived the crash were in attendance. Ancient petroglyph on east side of Stoney Point Gabrielino- Tongva Indians Occupy the Land Stoney Point was occupied by Gabrielino- Tongva (Gabrielino) Indians beginning in 6000 BC. The Gabrielino homeland offers an area rich in natural resources as well as an effective system of trade. This tribe was widely known as skilled hunter-gatherers. Faunal and floral resources were abundant and offered a wide variety based on location and season. Food sources were available year round, including rabbits, roots/bulbs, and shellfish. Some crops sprung up only once a year, such as acorns, and were collected in large numbers. Winter was the only time of the year that brought up food stresses in inland communities due to lack of fresh vegetation. The communities closer to the coast, however, fared just fine with the marine food resources. The diversity of resources for the Gabrielino Indians was mainly due to the wide range of biotic zones in their territory. These included beach and coastal regions, fresh and salt water regions, chaparral and grassland zones, and even woodland and mountain regions. Faunal resources included land mammals, fish, insects, reptiles, and sea-mammals. Floral resources included trees, plants, seeds, bulbs, and sea grasses. Mineral resources included obsidian, chert, and other types of stones to make tools and caulking or adhesive compounds. These three resource categories satisfied all the material needs of the Gabrielino Indians. The Gabrielinos developed sustainable diets by using the resources available to them at different times of the year. They were excellent hunters that effectively used their weapons and technology to develop strategies to utilize available resources. Meat hunting was prominent during the winter when fresh plant food wasn‚Äôt available. Fishing and sea-mammal hunting took place in the spring and summer seasons and was avoided during the fall and winter when the fish retreated to the south. At a ritual called the Mourning Ceremony, food and manufactured items were destroyed to restrict the amount of goods available. This Ceremony took place in hopes to maintain the demand for the services as well as skills of the craftsmen of the village. Gabrielino Indians believed that greediness and food hoarding were reprehensible traits and thus the proper management of food resources was evident in their culture. Fishermen and hunters were prohibited from consuming their own kill in order to discourage hoarding. At certain times of the year, large populations of people would get together to collect seasonal crops or collaborate in large-scale hunts. It was important to the Gabrielino Indians that the entire village population participated in harvesting seeds in the plain. The Gabrielinos made sure to minimize their ecological footprint as much as possible to follow their beliefs. These Indians were very interested in the spiritual world, and members of the communities called shamans would interpret the environment. They believed that the universe was always in a state of flux, which explains their desire to maintain the preservation of the environment and the resources it provides them with. They turned to these shamans to continue the proper alignment of forces in the universe as well as tap into heavenly bodies to perform sacred rituals. The only main way they left a significant impact on the land was through rock art, which was harmless to the environment. They used two different techniques: petroglyphs (rock carving) and pictographs (rock paintings). Pictured here is a petroglyph of a rabbit or squirrel, it can be found to the left of the \\"X\\" that is carved into the face of the rock that is at the center of the photo. Most art was created during ceremonies as elaborate rituals. Following generations have preserved the remaining artwork in museums around the region, but some ancient rock art sites of the Gabrielino Indians can still be visited in the area throughout Stoney Point. Water catch basins and mortars used for grinding nuts and seeds can still be found on the uppermost boulders at Stoney Point. It wasn‚Äôt until the creation of the California Missions, built by the Spaniards beginning in 1769, stripped the Indians of their land and turned it into an urban dwellers‚Äô area. The creek bed on the West side of Stoney Point was the western boundary of the San Fernando Mission. By 1834, Ranchos of California were also being created on Indian land. It was actually the construction of railroads and other forms of industrialization by settlers other than the Indians that created the greatest amount of harmful change to the land around Stoney Point. Movies and Television Stoney Point has been the backdrop in many movies and television shows since the silent film era. Doll House, Seinfeld, and CSI: Las Vegas have all used Stoney Point as a location. Rock climbing Climbing development began at Stoney Point in the 1930s when it was discovered by young climbers then active in the Sierra Club. In the '50s and '60s pioneering rock-climbers Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard learned to climb at Stoney Point. Other famous climbers such as Bob Kamps, Ron Kauk, John Long, John Bachar also started to climb at Stoney Point. 200px From 1959 to 1995 one of Americas most accomplished climbers Bob Kamps was a regular to be seen on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. He was always available to teach anyone his art, as was another monumental free-solo climber Michael Reardon. In the '70s the Stonemasters (a local group of climbers determined to put their own stamp on the sport of rock climbing) also frequented Stoney Point. Stoney Point has a long history of association with rock climbing and bouldering yet there are few first ascents recorded. This may be because it is viewed as a practice area and therefore not significant from a first ascent point of view. The rock is sandstone, which makes it less painful on the hands while bouldering, allowing climbers to boulder for long periods of time without worrying about the pain. But after it has rained, and soaked the rock, parts of the rocks are prone to break away. While Stoney Point does not close, climbers are advised to take greater care after a lot of rain. Otherwise the climbing season at Stoney Point lasts all year. Some people have taken advantage of the easiness of the rock to chip, and have created their own chips by breaking off pieces. Climbers look down upon this practice. There is a great variety of bouldering routes to choose from, ranging from easy to hard, based on the Yosemite Decimal System for rock climbing, and the Hueco scale for bouldering. Beginners and advanced climbers will find something for them from among more than 150 routes.

It is basically the aircraft variant of the Reibel machine gun. History In 1934, the Manufacture d'Armes de Ch√¢tellerault (Ch√¢tellerault weapons manufacturing company, often shortened to MAC) completed the development of the MAC 1934 machine gun to replace the Darne mod. 1933 machine gun aboard aircraft of the Arm√©e de l'Air. Essentially a faster-firing variant of the mitrailleuse mle 1931, and using the same 7.5 mm MAS ammunition, the MAC 34 worked by gas operation and was fed from drum magazines. Two main variants, sharing common parts, were introduced: * the type tourelle (turret model), fed from 100-round replaceable magazines, was used in flexible mountings, where it was generally fitted with an Alkan 1935 reflector gunsight. * the type aile (wing model) fed from a 300- or 500-round drum magazine, was used for fixed mountings. Because it used an open bolt action, the MAC 34 could not be fitted with synchronization gear (a closed bolt action is needed for exact synchronization), and was more expensive to manufacture than comparable weapons; but it was compact and had excellent reliability. Originally the Arm√©e de l'Air favoured magazine-fed weapons, but it eventually accepted that the feeding system of the MAC 34 would require too frequent reloadings for dorsal gunners, and was impractical for wing mountings, so it required the development of a belt-fed variant. The resulting weapon was introduced in 1939, and designated as MAC 1934 M39. Overview The MAC 1934 machine gun equipped French aircraft from 1935 until the later 1940s. Like other rifle-calibre machine guns, the MAC 34 proved to be too light for combat in World War II. A weakness of the MAC 34 was its operation at high altitudes. It was found that at altitudes past 20,000 ft the guns had a tendency to freeze up. Heaters were added to the guns on the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 to allow high altitude use. The Arm√©e de l'Air had plans to use several types of heavy aircraft machine guns, including an 11 mm variant of the MAC 34, but none could be completed before the Armistice. Post World War II usage The MAC 1934 was used in Algeria on Morane- Saulnier MS.500 light aircraft for anti guerilla operations around 1957. The Arm√©e de l'Air installed the MAC 1934T as a defensive weapon aiming through the back window was dropped, although some aircraft have then been modified on the field to fire through one of the side windows.

In both, he appears as a philosopher of the Pythagorean school. If there ever existed a historical Timaeus of Locri, he would have lived in the fifth century BC, but his historicity is dubious since he only appears as a literary figure in Plato; all other ancient sources are either based on Plato or are fictional accounts. Historicity In Plato's works, Timaeus appears as a wealthy aristocrat from the Greek colony of Lokroi Epizephyrioi (present-day Locri in Calabria), who had served in high offices in his native town before coming to Athens, where the dialogue of Timaeus is set. Plato does not explicitly label Timaeus a Pythagorean, but leaves enough hints for the reader to infer this. He appears competent in all areas of ancient philosophy, especially natural philosophy and astronomy.Plato, Timaeus 20a, 27a. In antiquity, Timaeus's historical existence was beyond dispute. Cicero reports that Plato traveled to Italy to study with Timaeus and other Pythagoreans.Cicero, De re publica 1,16 and De finibus bonorum et malorum 5,87; Valerius Maximus 8,7 ext. 3 is based on the latter account. The report of this meeting led Macrobius, a writer of late antiquity, to conclude that Timaeus could not have been in a face-to-face dialogue with Socrates, who, by Timaeus's time, was long dead.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1,1,5. Iamblichus lists Timaeus among the notable members of the Pythagorean school. Diogenes La√´rtius in his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, suggests that the character of Timaeus was based on the Pythagorean Philolaus. Further references to Timaeus are found in Proclus, Commentary on Plato's Timaeus (II, 38, I); in commentaries on Aristotle by Simplicius; and in Porphyry, where Timaeus mentions the house of Pythagoras in Croton. Modern scholarship tends to dismiss Timaeus's historicity,E.g., treating him as a literary figure constructed by Plato from features of the Pythagoreans known to him, such as Archytas. The main reason for assigning the status of a literary fiction to Timaeus is the lack of any information that does not stem ultimately from Plato's dialogues. As a counterargument, it has been pointed out that most characters appearing in Plato's dialogues are in fact historical persons. On the Nature of the World and the Soul A work in Doric Greek entitled On the Nature of the World and the Soul (), also called the Timaeus Locrus after its purported author, starts out by declaring that \\"Timaeus of Locri said the following\\" and proceeds to summarize the theories that Timaeus defends in Plato's Timaeus. The book has been preserved fully, in more than fifty manuscripts. It is mostly consistent with Plato; it notably omits the Theory of Forms. On the World and the Soul was first mentioned in sources of the second century AD (Nicomachus and the commentary on Timaeus by Calvisius Taurus) and its authenticity was not doubted in antiquity. The work was even believed to have been a main source for Plato's dialogue; a rumor dating back to the third century BC held that Plato's Timaeus was plagiarized from a Pythagorean book, and this became connected to the Timaeus Locrus. Modern philology has shown that On the World and the Soul is a pseudepigraphon from somewhere between the early first century BC to the early first century AD, and is based on Plato's Timaeus, rather than the other way around. The Pseudo- Timaeus employs a simplified mode of reasoning and presentation, presenting conclusions rather than arguments and omitting any dialogue, meaning that it was perhaps intended as a summary of the notoriously difficult original for use in a classroom setting. While it may have originated in part as a set of lecture notes to the Platonic original, it tends to omit difficult sections of the Timaeus rather than provide explanations. Some of Pseudo-Timaeus's theses are very hard to understand without knowledge of Plato's work. On the World and the Soul shows traces of middle Platonist ideas and terminology; in particular, it resembles works by Eudorus of Alexandria and Philo, making it plausible that the author lived in Alexandria and was familiar with Eudorus's philosophy. He modernized the natural philosophy of Plato's Timaeus by incorporating insights from Hellenistic astronomy and medicine. The book also appears to incorporate material from one or more now-lost commentaries on Timaeus. R. Harder hypothesized that the composition of On the World and the Soul was a two-step process, whereby Pseudo-Timaeus, the author of the preserved version of the book, would have edited an earlier, Hellenistic variant of Timaeus.Harder's hypothesis is accepted by Th. Tobin, by contrast, believes the work to have been composed at once, then translated into Doric. =Reception= On the Nature of the World and the Soul was known to the Neoplatonists Iamblichus, Syrianus, Proclus, and Simplicius. The work of Pseudo-Timaeus supported the widely held Neoplatonist conviction that Pythagoreanism and Platonism constituted a singular theory, reflecting the pseudonymous author's intention of placing Plato in the Pythagorean tradition. Giorgio Valla, in the fifteenth century, translated On the Nature of the World and the Soul into Latin. His translation was printed in Venice in 1498. The Greek text appeared as part of Aldo Manuzio's collected works of Plato, first published in 1513 and reprinted many times. In the sixteenth century, it was considered a Vorlage of the Timaeus (so in Henri Estienne's edition) and often printed along with the works of Plato. Attributions of other works The Suda and various scholia on Plato's Timaeus ascribe to Timaeus of Locri a work entitled Mathƒìmatik√°, of which nothing else is known. This is possibly a false attribution, confusing Timaeus with an astronomer bearing the same name. He is also reported to have authored a biography of Pythagoras, but this may be a confusion with the historian Timaeus of Tauromenium, who devoted part of his history to Pythagoras's life and work.

It followed the life of an imaginary painting by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer as it passes through the hands of various people. The film was based on Girl In Hyacinth Blue, the 1999 novel by author Susan Vreeland, and starred Glenn Close and Ellen Burstyn. The imaginary painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue, the principal object in this film, is painted exactly in Vermeer's painting technique by the American master painter Jonathan Janson, author and webmaster of the world-known website about the life and work of Johannes Vermeer \\"Essential Vermeer\\".http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/misc/girl_in_hyacinth_blue.htm Plot Richard is a new art teacher at a high school. Cornelia Englebrecht (played by Glenn Close) is a history teacher who invites Richard to see a painting of a young girl at a table, which she believes to be a genuine Vermeer, where she tells him stories, which are portrayed as flashbacks about the people who owned the painting in the past. All of the stories take place in the Netherlands, and the flashbacks happen mostly before the one preceding it. The first story, from the late 1800s, involved a romance and had flashbacks within flashbacks. Another story took place in the early 1700s when a baby was abandoned during a flood after a dike break. The painting accompanied the baby and was intended to be sold for the baby's expenses. In the next story, a man left a university to take a job working with the machinery used for the dikes. He got interested in a servant girl who was punished by being put in stocks. It is revealed in this story where the baby came from. The next story was very brief, and in it, a woman, who was unsuccessful in bidding for the painting at an auction, seemed to know more about the painting than the auctioneer. The next story revealed how Vermeer came to paint the girl's picture. Finally, Cornelia tells us how she came in possession of the painting. Tagline: \\"A mystery hidden for generations.

It is a member of the family Araneidae (the orb-weavers) and is endemic to Australia. They are relatively small spiders, reaching a maximum total body length of only around for females, and for males. Their abdomen has six distinctive projections (\\"spines\\") that makes them easy to identify. They are predominantly a shiny black, with variable white, yellow, and orange patterns. Melanistic forms also occur during autumn. They are facultatively gregarious, and can be found in large aggregations of overlapping orb webs. They feed on small flying insects that get entangled in their webs. They are harmless to humans, though the webs can be a nuisance for bushwalkers. They are most abundant during the summer months. Taxonomy and nomenclature Austracantha minax is most commonly known as \\"jewel spiders\\" due to their body colouration. This may sometimes be specified further as \\"Australian jewel spiders\\" due to the common name being shared with the unrelated North American jewel spider Araneus gemmoides, as well as the widespread jewel box spider Gasteracantha cancriformis. In some parts of Australia they are also widely known as \\"Christmas spiders\\" because they are most numerous during the summer months (December and January). Other common names for the species include \\"six-spined spiders\\" and \\"spiny spiders\\" in reference to the spine-like projections on their abdomens. Austracantha minax is classified under the monotypic genus Austracantha of the orb-weaver family Araneidae. The generic name is derived from Latin auster (\\"south\\") and Greek ·ºÑŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∏Œ± (√°kantha, \\"thorn\\"). The specific name is from Latin minƒÅx (\\"jutting out\\" or \\"projecting\\"). It was first described in 1859 by the Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell from a female specimen recovered from Sydney, Australia (then still known as New Holland). He classified it under the genus Gasteracantha. In 1914, the German arachnologist Friedrich Dahl moved it to its own subgenus, Austracantha, within Gasteracantha. Austracantha was elevated to genus in 1974 by the French arachnologist Michel Emerit. Austracantha minax has five recognised subspecies. =Subspecies= The five subspecies of Austracantha minax are the following: ::Synonyms indicated by (=) *Austracantha minax astrigera (L. Koch, 1871) \\\\- Found in mainland Australia. Characterised by an abdomen that is mainly black on top and patterned with yellow on the bottom surfaces. The spines are thicker and curved, with the rear spines visibly longer than the side spines. The sternum (chest) has a bright orange spot. First described by German arachnologist Ludwig Carl Christian Koch in 1871. The subspecific name is from Latin astriger (\\"star-bearing\\" or \\"starry\\"). ::(=) Gasteracantha astrigera L. Koch, 1871 ::(=) Gasteracantha minax astrigera (L. Koch, 1871) *Austracantha minax minax (Thorell, 1859) \\\\- Found in mainland Australia and surrounding islands, including Tasmania. Characterised by yellow to orange colouration being prevalent on the bottom of the abdomen and on the legs. The spines are more slender and are barely arched. The rear spines are almost the same length as the side spines. This is the nominate subspecies. ::(=) Gasteracantha minax Thorell, 1859 ::(=) Gasteracantha flavomaculata Keyserling, 1865 ::(=) Isacantha minax (Thorell, 1859) *Austracantha minax hermitis (Hogg, 1914) \\\\- Endemic to the Montebello Islands. The abdomen is pearl grey on top. The legs, cephalothorax, and the sternum are bright orange. First described by British arachnologist Henry Roughton Hogg in 1914. The subspecific name means \\"from Hermite [Island]\\", one of the islands in the Montebello archipelago. ::(=) Gasteracantha minax hermitis Hogg, 1914b *Austracantha minax leonhardii (Strand, 1913) \\\\- Found in central Australia. Characterised by reddish cephalothorax and mandibles. The legs are brownish-yellow, with only the second and third segments from the last (the tibiae and metatarsi) showing black rings at the tip. First described by Norwegian arachnologist Embrik Strand in 1913. It is named after the German anthropologist Moritz von Leonhardi, from whose spider collection the type specimen was obtained from. ::(=) Gasteracantha minax leonhardii Strand, 1913c *Austracantha minax lugubris (L.

First described by German arachnologist Ludwig Carl Christian Koch in 1871. The subspecific name is from Latin l≈´gubris (\\"mournful\\" or \\"gloomy\\"). ::(=) Gasteracantha lugubris L. Koch, 1871 ::(=) Gasteracantha minax lugubris (L. Koch, 1871) Description Jewel spiders have a distinctive appearance that makes them relatively easy to identify. The cephalothorax is black in colour with a bluish metallic sheen. It is covered with small white hairs (setae). The carapace (upper part of the cephalothorax) is rectangular in shape. The sternum (chest) is brownish black, with a yellow central area. The chelicerae (fangs) are black with four to six small teeth. The maxillae and other mouthparts are black at the base, lightening to brown and bright yellow at the tips. The pedipalps are dark brown. Jewel spiders have eight eyes arranged in two rows. The front row is recurved, with the two middle eyes (anterior median eyes) further in front than the two at the sides (anterior lateral eyes). The back row is procurved, with the two middle eyes (posterior median eyes) further in the back than the two at the sides (posterior lateral eyes). The legs in females are predominantly dirty yellow to orange in color. Black tips are present on the last three segments of the legs (the tibiae, metatarsi, and tarsi). The first pair of legs are longer than the others. In males, the legs are mostly black, with brownish tips. The opisthosoma (abdomen) is large, slightly wider than it is long, and strongly rounded at the front and back. It is shiny black with bright colourful patterns. These colours can vary, but they are usually white, yellow, or yellow-orange. Its most distinctive feature are the three pairs of large \\"spines\\" projecting outwards. The first two pairs on the front are close to each other, forming a V-shape as they point to the sides. They are short and roughly conical. The spines on the rear are longer and point backwards. There are wide spaces between them and the two front pairs. The spines are black or brownish black from above, but has a yellow-orange to rusty red lower surfaces. Jewel spiders are sexually dimorphic. Females are about twice as large as males, reaching in total length. Their carapace (upper part of cephalothorax) is squarish, usually around long and wide. Males are usually only around . The carapace is slightly rectangular, usually around long and wide They are also less colourful than females; with predominantly dark reddish brown bodies. The spines are blunt and are much shorter than the spines of the females. Like all mature male spiders, they are relatively easy to identify because of their greatly enlarged pedipalps used in sperm transfer during mating. morph Jewel spiders exhibit colour polymorphism. They can be found in white, yellow, or red colour morphs. Jewel spiders found later in autumn (from March to April) are also sometimes melanistic, being entirely dark brown to black in coloration. It is believed that the appearance of these colour morphs are triggered by environmental factors, rather than by genetics. For example, it has been speculated that the purpose of the melanistic colour morphs may be to facilitate better heat absorption during the colder months. Distribution Jewel spiders are endemic to Australia. They can be found all throughout the mainland, as well surrounding islands, including Tasmania, Barrow Island (Western Australia), and the Montebello Islands. They are more common on the southern regions of the continent, from southern Queensland and New South Wales, through Victoria and Southern Australia, to Western Australia. Though they can be found in the Northern Territory, they are less common and their place is usually taken by species from the genus Gasteracantha instead. Ecology and behaviourWeb-building and aggregations= Jewel spiders are cathemeral, remaining active both day and night. Females build vertically-oriented orb webs about from the ground and in diameter. They are circular with a very dense spiral pattern woven around twenty to thirty rays attached to support threads. The rays do not meet at the centre, but are connected to a small central ring. A female on its orb web from the Victorian High Country Jewel spiders are unusual in that they deliberately make their support threads visible to larger animals. They do this by adding white silk tufts along the support threads at intervals of about . It is believed that this is to prevent larger animals from inadvertently walking into the webs and damaging them. Nonetheless, the webs may sometimes be encountered damaged and reduced to only a few threads. The webs are more or less permanent, unlike many other orb weaver spiders which regularly destroy and rebuild their webs every day. Females do not make retreats near their webs. Instead they rest in the centre of the web with their head downwards. Males are usually found on nearby vegetation. A large aggregation of jewel spider orb webs enshrouding a fenceline in rural Victoria Jewel spiders are facultatively gregarious. They can often be found living near each other in large overlapping aggregations of orb webs of usually thirty individuals. These can entirely blanket shrubs, tree branches, or man- made structures. A 1997 study observed that aggregations do not seem to increase the amount of prey caught, but it is believed that they still benefit the individual members in other ways. Once such advantage is foraging efficiency. By attaching their webs to neighbouring webs, jewel spiders do not need to produce as much silk as they would have when building solitary orb webs. The use of neighbouring webs for support may also allow them to build webs in prey-rich areas they normally can not reach alone (such as the wide gaps between trees). Prey capture may further be enhanced by the creation of a \\"ricochet effect\\", wherein prey that escapes one web, may be caught by a neighbouring web. Aggregations were also observed to attract more males as well as protect the females from predators. However, the egg sacs in communal webs were attacked more often by parasitoids than the egg sacs laid by solitary females. =Reproduction and life cycle= Egg sacs attached to a grass stalk and a flower (Sydney, 1909) After locating a receptive female, male jewel spiders will begin courtship by first attaching a \\"mating thread\\" from nearby plants to the edge of the female's orb web. It then positions itself in the middle of this thread and begins strumming it with their first and second pair of legs. The female will respond by moving towards the source of the vibrations, eventually climbing unto the mating thread itself. Once this happens, the male will wrap its legs around the female tightly and insert its pedipalps into the female's epigyne, transferring its spermatophores (silk packets containing sperm) into the female's spermathecae. A female jewel spider can mate with multiple males during a single reproductive cycle. If given the chance, the female will still readily mate with other males shortly after a successful mating. To prevent sperm competition, the successful male will defend the female shortly before and after mating. It actively drives away other rival males until the female enters a refractory period and ceases to be receptive to further matings. This usually happens an hour to a day after a successful mating, during which the female will herself aggressively attack and drive away all courting males. Females usually attach their egg sacs on vegetation and other surfaces near the edges of their webs (including grass blades, leaves, and twigs). They are usually bound longitudinally with loose lengths of silk, but they can sometimes be found dangling. The egg sacs are around in length and can vary in shape from circular to pointed at both ends. They are reddish brown to golden brown in colour, though rarely they may also be bright yellow. They are made from closely woven silk. The spiderlings overwinter within the egg sacs until early spring. Females reach sexual maturity at around the middle of January, while males mature earlier in the middle of December. Female with prey wrapped in silk from Central Queensland =Diet= Jewel spiders are opportunistic predators. They prey on small flying insects like flies and mosquitoes that get entangled on their webs. Relationship with humans Jewel spiders are considered harmless, though their web aggregations can be a nuisance to bushwalkers. They are not aggressive and will invariably flee from potential threats. When disturbed, they will try to escape by clambering upside down along their support threads to nearby surfaces (albeit slowly due to their short stubby legs). Failing that, they will drop to the ground. Like almost all spiders, they possess venom glands which they use to subdue prey, but they rarely bite when handled. Their bites are only mildly painful to humans. Temporary reactions like redness, swelling, or itching can sometimes be experienced on the bite area. In Perth and the rest of Western Australia, the appearance of jewel spiders in large numbers in gardens (as well as the flowering of Nuytsia floribunda) is often associated with the coming of Christmas.

Best known for food and travel writing, he was The Sunday Times' restaurant reviewer as well as a television critic. He also wrote for Vanity Fair, GQ, and Esquire, and published numerous books. Gill wrote his first piece for Tatler in 1991, and joined The Sunday Times in 1993. Known for his sharp wit, and often controversial style, Gill was widely read and won numerous awards for his writing. On his death he was described by one editor as \\"a giant among journalists.\\" His articles were the subject of numerous complaints to the Press Complaints Commission. Early life and education Gill was born in Edinburgh to English parents. His father was television producer and director Michael Gill and his mother was actress Yvonne Gilan. He had a brother named Nicholas. The family moved back to the south of England when he was one year old. In 1964, he appeared briefly in his parents' film The Peaches as a chess player. Gill was educated at the independent St Christopher School, Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and later recalled his experiences at the school in his book The Angry Island. After St Christopher's, he moved to London to study at the Saint Martin's School of ArtSt. Martin's School records and the Slade School of Art, nurturing ambitions to be an artist. Following art school Gill spent six years \\"signing on, trying to paint, until one day he realised he wasn't any good\\". At the age of 30, having abandoned his ambitions in art, he spent several years working in restaurants and teaching cookery. Writing Gill began his writing career in his thirties, writing \\"art reviews for little magazines\\". His first piece for Tatler, in 1991, was an account of being in a detox clinic, written under the pseudonym Blair Baillie. In 1993 he moved to The Sunday Times where, according to Lynn Barber, \\"he quickly established himself as their shiniest star\\". He continued to write for the Sunday Times until shortly before his death in 2016. Gill was also a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and GQ. He wrote a series of columns for GQ, on fatherhood and other subjects. He also wrote for Esquire, where he served as an agony uncle, 'Uncle Dysfunctional'. Collections of his travel writing were published as AA Gill is Away (2002), Previous Convictions (2006) and AA Gill is Further Away (2011), his Tatler and Sunday Times food writing as Table Talk (2007) and his TV columns as Paper View (2008). He wrote several books on individual restaurants and their cuisine ‚Äì Ivy (1997), Le Caprice (1999), Breakfast at the Wolseley (2008) and Brasserie Zedel (2016). He also wrote two novels which were generally poorly reviewed ‚Äì Sap Rising (1996) and Starcrossed (1999). Starcrossed was given the Literary Reviews Bad Sex in Fiction Award. He wrote books studying England ‚Äì The Angry Island (2005) ‚Äì and the United States ‚Äì The Golden Door (2012). In 2014 Gill won an Amnesty International Media Award, and a Women on the Move award for a series of Sunday Times Magazine articles on refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan and Lampedusa. In 2014 he also won the 'Hatchet Job of the Year Award' for his scathing review of Morrisey's Autobiography. In 2015 he published a memoir, Pour Me. On his death The Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens described Gill as \\"the heart and soul of the paper\\" and \\"a giant among journalists\\". Controversies Gill's acerbic style led to several media controversies. In 2010, The Sunday Times disclosed that Gill had been the subject of 62 Press Complaints Commission complaints in five years. =Wales= In 1998, in The Sunday Times, Gill described the Welsh as \\"loquacious dissemblers, immoral liars, stunted, bigoted, dark, ugly, pugnacious little trolls\\". His comments were reported to the Commission for Racial Equality. and used as an example of what was described as \\"persistent anti-Welsh racism in the UK media\\" in a motion in the National Assembly for Wales. The CRE declined to prosecute, saying that Gill \\"had not meant to stir up racial hatred.\\" =Isle of Man= Gill's feud with the Isle of Man began in 2006 with a review of Ciappelli's restaurant in Douglas. Gill wrote that the island: > managed to slip through a crack in the space-time continuum [‚Ä¶] fallen off > the back of the history lorry to lie amnesiac in the road to progress [‚Ä¶] > its main industry is money (laundering, pressing, altering and mending) [‚Ä¶] > everyone you actually see is Benny from Crossroads or Benny in drag‚Ä¶. The > weather's foul, the food's medieval, it's covered in suicidal motorists and > folk who believe in fairies. The review was attacked in the Tynwald, the Manx parliament, with House of Keys member David Cannan demanding an apology for the \\"unacceptable and scurrilous attack\\". Gill made further comments regarding the Isle of Man in his Sunday Times column on 23 May 2010, when he described its citizens as falling into two types: \\"hopeless, inbred mouth-breathers known as Bennies\\" and \\"retired, small arms dealers and accountants who deal in rainforest futures\\". His comments were made in the aftermath of Mick Jagger's suggestion that drugs should be legalised in the Isle of Man. Gill added that \\"If ‚Ä¶ they become a hopelessly addicted, criminal cesspit, who'd care? Indeed, who could tell the difference?\\" =England= In February 2011, Gill described the county of Norfolk as \\"the hernia on the end of England\\". In December 2013, his column just before New Year's Eve, was the result of a night on the beat in Grimsby and Cleethorpes and was heavily critical of both towns where Grimsby is \\"on the road to nowhere\\" and Cleethorpes is full of \\"hunched and grubby semi-detached homes\\". Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Grove described Gill as \\"A tweed-suited, Mayfair-based writer, whose only experience of the North of England was his visit to Cleethorpes and his regular trips salmon fishing in Scotland\\". =Killing of a baboon= Gill reported in his Sunday Times column in October 2009 that he shot a baboon dead, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. \\"I know perfectly well there is absolutely no excuse for this\\", he wrote, and that he killed the animal to \\"get a sense of what it might be like to kill someone, a stranger\\". He went on to state, \\"[T]hey die hard, baboons. But not this one. A soft-nosed .357 blew his lungs out\\". =Individuals= In a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, Gill referred to the presenter as \\"a big lesbian\\" and \\"a dyke on a bike\\". Gill's Sunday Times editor, John Witherow, responded to Balding's complaint: \\"In my view some members of the gay community need to stop regarding themselves as having a special victim status and behave like any other sensible group that is accepted by society. Not having a privileged status means, of course, one must accept occasionally being the butt of jokes. A person's sexuality should not give them a protected status\\". Dissatisfied with the response, Balding's subsequent complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) was upheld: they considered use of the word \\"dyke\\" to have been \\"pejorative\\" and \\"used in a demeaning and gratuitous way\\". The PCC considered publication of Gill's piece to be \\"an editorial lapse\\" for which \\"the newspaper should have apologised at the first possible opportunity\\". Reviewing Mary Beard's BBC television series Meet the Romans in April 2012, Gill wrote that the academic \\"should be kept away from cameras altogether\\".John-Paul Ford Rojas \\"Mary Beard hits back at AA Gill after he brands her 'too ugly for television'\\", Daily Telegraph;, 24 April 2012 Beard in response accused him of being \\"frightened of smart women\\" and suggested \\"maybe it's precisely because he did not go to university that he never quite learned the rigour of intellectual argument and he thinks that he can pass off insults as wit.\\" Personal life Gill suffered from severe dyslexia and consequently dictated all of his writing. Gill was a recovering alcoholic who stopped drinking at the age of 29. On 1 April 1984, he shared two bottles of vintage champagne with his father on the train to Wiltshire and checked into the Clouds House addiction treatment centre in East Knoyle. He followed an Alcoholics Anonymous \\"12-step plan\\" to recovery and, in tribute to the organisation, began using the name 'A. A.' Gill professionally. In a 2014 article in The Times, Gill said that he had \\"continued to smoke about 60 a day\\" until the age of 48.\\" From 1982 to 1983, Gill was married to the author Cressida Connolly. From 1990 to 1995, he was married to Amber Rudd, a financial journalist who later became Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The couple had two children. He then had a long-term relationship with Nicola Formby, editor-at-large of Tatler, for whom he left Rudd in 1995, and who appeared in his column as \\"The Blonde\\". They had twins born in 2007. Gill's younger brother Nick, a Michelin-starred chef, disappeared in 1998, telling Gill: \\"I‚Äôm going away now . . . I‚Äôm not coming back.\\" Gill spoke of his sadness at not knowing what happened to Nick, and wrote that he looked for him whenever he visited a new city. Death On 20 November 2016, Gill wrote in his Sunday Times column of his engagement to Formby, and also disclosed that he was suffering from \\"the full English\\" of cancer.

It was named after the castle of Montesa, its headquarters. Templar background The Knights Templar had been received with enthusiasm within the Crown of Aragon from their foundation in 1128. King Alfonso I of Aragon, having no direct heir, bequeathed his dominions to be divided among the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, but this bequest was annulled by his subjects in 1131. The Knights Templar had to be contented with certain castles, the chief of which was Monz√≥n. Although the Aragonese branch of the order was pronounced innocent at the famous trial of the Templars, Pope Clement V's Bull of suppression was applied to them in spite of the protests of King James II of Aragon in 1312. Establishment of new order Ruins of the castle of Montesa, former parent headquarters of the order King James II persuaded Pope John XXII to permit him to regroup the Templar properties in Aragon and Valencia, and to create a new military order not essentially differing from that of the Templars, which should be charged with the defence of the frontier against the Moors and the pirates. The new order was dedicated to Our Lady, and based at Montesa. Pope John XXII approved it on 10 June 1317, and gave it the Cistercian rule. The order derived its title from St. George of Montesa, its principal stronghold. It was affiliated to the Order of Calatrava, from which its first recruits were drawn, and it was maintained in dependence upon that order. The first of the fourteen grand masters was Guillermo d'Eril. In 1485, Philip of Viana renounced the Archbishopric of Palermo to become grand master. He died fighting the Kingdom of Granada in 1488. The office of grand master was united with the Crown by Philip II in 1587.

It is a gendarmerie force performing military and civilian police duties. History A Marechaussee detachment at Wijchen in 1938 The Corps de Mar√©chauss√©e was created by King William I to replace the French Gendarmerie on October 26, 1814. The word gendarmerie had gained a negative connotation, so William called the new force \\"marechauss√©e\\" (he forgot the first acute accent in the document). Mar√©chauss√©e is an alternate French word for gendarmerie. In the French historical context, \\"Mar√©chauss√©e\\" had been the force's name under the Royal Ancien Regime, while the term \\"gendarmerie\\" had been adopted by the French Revolution - making the Royalist term preferable for the Dutch King. At that time, the Marechaussee was a part of the army (landmacht). The Marechaussee was tasked with maintaining public order, law enforcement, and safeguarding the main roads. Although not specifically mentioned, this included police duties for the army. As such, the Marechaussee was part of the national police (rijkspolitie). The Marechaussee was the only police force in many small municipalities, such as Venlo, especially in the southern provinces of Limburg and North Brabant (former Generality Lands). In 1908, Queen Wilhelmina assigned the Marechaussee the task of guarding the royal palaces, which had previously been done by gardeners. To this day, guarding a palace is called \\"klompendienst (clog service). After Kristallnacht in November 1938, the Dutch government officially closed its borders to any Jewish refugees. The Dutch Marechaussee border guards searched for them and returned any found to Germany, despite the horrors of Kristallnacht being well known.. In 1939 Nicholas Winton succeeded with his Kindertransport, thanks to the guarantees he had obtained from Britain. After the first train, the process of crossing the Netherlands went smoothly. On 5 July 1940, the German occupation government merged the Marechaussee with the rijksveldwacht and the gemeenteveldwacht. This meant that the Marechaussee lost its military status and the predicate Royal. These changes did not apply to the Marechaussee outside occupied Dutch territory. About 200 marechaussees guarded the Royal Family and the Dutch government-in- exile, and provided military police services to the Princess Irene Brigade, a brigade formed in the United Kingdom, consisting of Dutchmen. After World War II, the Marechaussee was split into a Korps Rijkspolitie (National Police Corps) (as a replacement of the rijksveldwacht and the gemeenteveldwacht) and the Royal Marechaussee, which regained its military status. The main tasks for the Marechaussee since then have been border protection, military police and guard duties. On July 3, 1956, Princess Beatrix became patroness of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. In 1994, the national and municipal police forces were merged into 25 regional police forces and the Korps landelijke politiediensten (National Police Services Agency). The National Police transferred its airport police and security tasks (primarily Schiphol) to the Marechaussee. In 1998, the Marechaussee became a separate Service within the armed forces. In 2014, a team of 40 Dutch Royal Gendarmes went to eastern Ukraine to assist the investigation into the shooting down of Malaysian airliner MH17. They provided security for the international team and assistance in collecting evidence from the crash site. Emblem The emblem of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee is, as with many other gendarmerie forces, a flaming grenade. In the 17th century, a new weapon was introduced in Europe: the hand grenade. The soldiers who handled grenades were called grenadiers. They became an elite type of soldier in all European armies. In France, the grenade symbol was adopted by the gendarmerie, and this was imitated by similar forces throughout Europe. The flaming grenade (but in this case within an eight-pointed star) was also the emblem of the Rijkspolitie. Present KMar Members of the Marechaussee escorting victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Marechaussee patrol car The present marechaussee is a police organisation with a military status, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, but mostly working for the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.

It is located approximately 41 km east of Cologne. The neighbouring municipalities Reichshof, Waldbr√∂l, N√ºmbrecht, Much, Engelskirchen and Gummersbach border on the town. Geography Between the highway and Wiehl lies the biggest Wiehl industrial area, covering about 81 ha: Wiehl-Bomig. The river of the same name, Wiehl, flows by the town in an east‚Äìwest direction. History Wiehl is first recorded in 1131 under the name of Wila. On the 1575 Mercator map it is shown as Wiell. Wiehl was eventually allocated in the 1604 Treaty of Siegburg to the Barony of Homburg and was subordinated with it to the House of Sayn-Wittgenstein. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna assigned the little Homburg territory, which practically only consisted of the municipalities of Wiehl and N√ºmbrecht, to Prussia. At that time, Wiehl was still an agriculturally oriented settlement with a village character. Those in the population who could not earn a living from the land had to serve as migratory labour. Not until the second half of the 19th century were the conditions created for a significant increase in population. In 1860, the water power of the River Wiehl was first utilised by the Ohler Hammer Mill; in 1895, the river was used to generate electricity; the place was connected to the railway network in 1897 and the BPW Bergische Achsen factory was founded in 1898. The Nazi era left Wiehl a new town hall (today called the \\"Old Town Hall\\"). After the Second World War Wiehl integrated the influx of refugees who had been bombed out or expelled. In the municipal reorganisation in 1969, it was combined with Bielstein and Drabenderh√∂he and, in 1971, 840 years after its first record, it was granted town rights. Since that time it has grown steadily, partly through the arrival of immigrants and through policies encouraging the growth of industry. Coat of arms  The coat of arms served the power Homburg as a basis of today's Wiehler coat of arms. It consists of a two tower castle with open gate and portcullis. The unresolved Knight of St John of Jerusalem cross over the right lower tower was taken at the association of the municipalities of Wiehl and Bielstein from the Bielsteiner coat of arms.

It consists of four hotels (The Resort Hotel, Manor House Hotel, Coldra Court Hotel and T≈∑ Hotel), a country inn, luxury lodges, two spas, six restaurants, three championship golf courses (The Twenty Ten Course, The Montgomerie Course and Roman Road Course), two golf and country clubhouses (the Twenty Ten clubhouse and the Lodge clubhouse), high ropes courses, adventure golf, laser tag, archery and a multi-purpose conference centre. It was the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup, the first to be held in Wales, and hosted the 2014 NATO summit. Location The resort, owned by Sir Terry Matthews, is located on the south-facing side of Christchurch Hill in eastern Newport, overlooking Junction 24 of the M4 motorway. The golf courses extend over the ridge and down the north-facing side of the hill into the Vale of Usk, with views up to the Wentwood escarpment. The resort covers of land. History The earliest record of a building on the resort site was 1634, when it was the residence of the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire, Lewis Van. The manor house was built in 1860 by Thomas Powell, the largest coalmine owner in the South Wales coalfield, the world's biggest coal exporter and the first coal millionaire. Powell's son, Thomas Powell Jnr, and his bride Julia Jenkins were given the mansion as a wedding gift when they married in 1859. They named it Coldra Hall. After Thomas and Julia Powell's deaths on safari in Africa, Coldra Hall was leased to a number of tenants, including the Firbank family from 1900 until 1915. Charles Firbank was also a High Sheriff of Monmouthshire and well known for his generosity, entertaining parties of a hundred or more blind and disabled people. On Firbank's death in 1915, the hall was sold to Sir John Wyndham, a colliery and shipping entrepreneur, who added an additional wing. In 1930 Wyndham donated the house to the local health authority and, in 1940, it became the Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital, named in honour of his mother. Over 60,000 babies were born there, including the present owner Sir Terry Matthews. It closed as a hospital on 1 March 1977. Matthews bought the Manor House in 1980, investing ¬£100m in a redevelopment and refurbishment project. The house was renovated, retaining all its best older features. Initially with 17 bedrooms, the Celtic Manor Hotel opened in 1982. With the addition of a modern three-storey extension, by the early 1990s the hotel's capacity was expanded to 70 bedrooms. It received Egon Ronay Guide awards for the best hotel in Wales for five consecutive years. Celtic Manor Resort In 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre on land between the Manor House and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with the late golf-course architect Robert Trent Jones whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the Roman Road course in 1992 ‚Äì named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent which crosses the land. By 1994, work had commenced on the 400-bedroom Resort Hotel; as well as a ¬£10-million golf clubhouse and the Coldra Woods golf course. The new development was completed and opened in 1999. The former Celtic Manor Hotel was renamed \\"The Manor House\\" to distinguish it from the new \\"Resort Hotel.\\" The Twenty Ten Bridge To prepare for the 2010 Ryder Cup, The Twenty Ten Course, designed by Ross McMurray, was built, as part of a ¬£16 million development. This was the first golf course in history to be purpose-built for the event. The development included a 120-metre-long ¬£2m twin-suspension bridge, the course and a new clubhouse and surrounding infrastructure, which was promised as part of the bid to host the event in 2001. The new bridge, The Twenty Ten Bridge, links the practice ground to the golf course across the River Usk and was officially opened by the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. Rowecord Engineering of Newport, provided all the steelwork and structure and Andrew Scott was the main construction contractor.Celtic Manor Resort Unveils Twenty Ten Bridge In 2019 the Twenty Ten Bridge was closed to the public in the form of two high sided gates. The Resort stated that any users accessing the bridge would be at risk of being hit by stray golf balls, due to the bridge being built next to the driving range.Celtic Manor footbridge to stay closed to the public The closure has left the village of Caerleon with no pathway access to the Resort and its facilities, requiring patrons to take vehicular transport. =Archaeological and heritage site= In July 2010 a bitter dispute developed between Matthews and Newport City Council's planning committee which refused permission for Matthews to demolish or move a ruined Grade-II listed building from a position overlooking the 18th green, a farmhouse dating back to 1630, described by Matthews as \\"damaging to the image of the entire nation\\". The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings said: \\"The problematic situation is entirely of the owner‚Äôs own making and refusal to safeguard the listed building over many years. It cannot be right to reward this by agreeing to a proposal to simply move a listed building out of the way.\\"Sion Barry \\"Get rid of Ryder Cup eyesore, says Sir Terry\\" at WalesOnline News It being known that a Roman settlement had been located at Great Bulmore, the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust was appointed by the Celtic Manor Resort to oversee archaeological considerations prior to the course construction. The Trust worked closely with the designers to ensure the preservation of historic material and features. When a Roman pottery kiln was found during the construction of one of the greens, Abernant kiln, Celtic Manor Resort, Newport at Scribd.com the green was redesigned to avoid it.Background to Celtic Manor area at Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust While as much as possible of the potential archaeology was identified at the design stage, watching briefs were carried out during construction, since other structures might be discovered. As a result, construction work was halted in sensitive areas to give time to excavate features, including a second Roman pottery kiln with a probable workshop building and a Roman drying kiln. On the site of the new coach park, a small square tower-like building was found well to the north of any Roman activity previously discovered. It lay alongside a lightly metalled track, that must have branched off the Caerleon to Usk road. There has been some argument as to whether it was military‚Äîa Roman watch tower (Castellum) for example‚Äîor whether it was a mausoleum where someone of importance had been buried.Fascinating discovery on the site of the new Celtic Manor Golf Resort Coach Park at The Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Ltd, 11 December 2009 In the rubble that overlay the building were two pieces of an inscription, with a few letters on each.

Life A descendant of General Israel Putnam, he was born December 10, 1898 at Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, the son of Frederick H. Putnam and Jenet Hallowell.Family Search birth record He attended Harvard University and was to graduate Harvard Class of 1920, but instead went overseas and joined the French Foreign Legion. He was posthumously awarded a War Degree (S.B.) by Harvard. He joined the Lafayette Flying Corps of the French Air Service in 1917. In June of the following year, he joined the United States Air Service.Over the Front, p. 66. Camp Becket Putnam attended Camp Becket-in-the-Berkshires, as a camper from 1914‚Äì1916, and counselor in 1917 when he was a Harvard freshman. Swimming was one of his passions and he became captain of the Life Saving Crew and assistant swimming instructor. He was also an exceptional tennis player. He was popular among campers and received the 1915 Honor Emblem and 1916 Honor Button, the camp‚Äôs highest award. He is described in the camp newspaper Seen and Heard as ‚ÄúModest and unassuming, yet genial and a good mixer, of high moral standard; he was without question the most popular boy in the camp.‚Äù Becket director, Henry W. Gibson affirms that: ‚ÄúThe sense of fair play, of consideration for the other fellow, of physical bravery, of moral courage‚Äîall of these qualities were given a chance to express themselves in his camp life.‚Äù Military service Henry Gibson recalled that Putnam approached him at his tent and said, \\"I am going across the seas to get in the big fight.\\" He did indeed, by way of a cattle boat, and joined the French Foreign Legion on May 31, 1917. He was transferred to the air service and trained at Avord. Putnam was assigned to Escadrille SPA 94 on 12 December 1917, and was posted to SPA 156 on 7 February 1918. While with the latter unit, he shot down four planes before being transferred to SPA 38 on 1 June 1918, where he claimed two more planes shot down. He was discharged in June 1918. When the United States entered the war, Putnam joined the United States Army Air Service as a first lieutenant and briefly assumed command of the 134th Aero Squadron before joining the 139th Aero Squadron as a flight commander. As a gesture of respect, his aviators gave him a dinner in Paris, all 150 under his command. Wine was to be served and he abstained from alcohol, to which end he turned over his glass, and the others followed suit. With the 139th, Putnam scored his last three victories before he was killed in action. He wrote to Henry Gibson, director of Camp Becket-in-the-Berkshires, where Putnam had been a camper and counsellor, \\"Can you imagine anyone falling 20,000 feet, nearly four miles, smashing a machine to kindling wood and only getting a broken tooth out of it all? No! Well, I am afraid you are going to try, for that is just what I did yesterday morning.\\" Death Just before his own death, Putnam remarked to his mother in a letter in light of a death of a friend, \\"Isn‚Äôt it glorious to give up your life for the great cause? What more could one ask?\\" Putnam‚Äôs SPAD XIII was shot down by German ace Lt. Georg von Hantelmann. He was shot in the heart. He was scheduled to return home before his death. The official cablegram read, \\"Lieutenant David Endicott Putnam, killed September 12, 1918; buried September 14, at Toul in a field golden with buttercups, beside Luftbury, Blair, and Thaw.\\" During his time abroad, Becket director, Henry W. Gibson corresponded with Putnam until the former received a returned letter in his name, with the words ‚Äòdeceased‚Äô written on the envelope. Gibson never opened it, and later used it to illustrate in the camp chapel service: we must never delay telling what is on our hearts before it is too late. Awards and decorations Putnam shot down thirteen confirmed planes, but unconfirmed totals range from twenty- six to thirty in German territory. He was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross (posthumously), the Croix de Guerre, with palms and stars, the M√©daille militaire, the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and the American Areo Club Medal. A French battleship was named after him. He was also recommended for the Medal of Honor.

The station is operated by London Overground, with Overground and Southern trains serving the station. It is down the line from , in Travelcard Zone 4. The main building on the down side (which is only open weekday/Saturday mornings) replaced an original building which was on the up platform. This was in turn replaced by two shelters on the Up platform. There is a bridge connecting the two platforms. Four lines run through the station, the central pair being the Up and Down through lines. The station stands off Anerley Road (A214). History A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the Brighton main line between South Croydon and Selhurst/Forest Hill, as well as surrounding lines The station was opened originally as Anerley Bridge by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839. It was situated in a largely unpopulated area, but was built as part of an agreement with the local landowner. According to local lore, the landowner was a Scotsman and, when asked for the landmark by which the station would be known, he replied \\"Mine is the annerly hoose\\". The timetable of the day seems to back this up since it says \\"There is no place of that name\\". The London and Croydon Railway amalgamated with the London and Brighton Railway to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in July 1846, and the station was rebuilt during the widening of the main line during 1849/50. During the Grouping of 1923 the station became part of the Southern Railway, and then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the Privatisation of British Rail. Anerley formed part of the new southward extension to the East London line that opened on 23 May 2010, making Anerley part of the London Overground network. At the same time, management of the station passed from Southern to London Overground.

It was designed to provide several extensions to the BASIC interpreter on the computer, mostly to help with programming graphics and sound. It also provided of extra RAM (of which 136 bytes were used by the cartridge itself). The cartridge was created by Commodore Business Machines (CBM) and released in 1981.  Description  The dialect of BASIC bundled with the VIC-20, Commodore BASIC V2.0, was notorious for its sparse functionality. It didn't even match the features of Commodore's older line of computers, the PET which, at that time, already featured Commodore BASIC version 4.0. As a result, it was outdated by the VIC-20's release and seemed quite primitive compared to BASIC dialects available on other microcomputers. To be fair, the decision by Commodore to recycle the old BASIC, and the fact that it could fit in just ROM (including the KERNAL), helped keep the VIC-20's price to a minimum and so contributed to its huge success. Plus it was stable and almost entirely bug-free, which could not be said of some competing BASICs. Nevertheless, not only did \\"VIC BASIC\\" lack commands considered fundamental to the BASIC language, such as \\"else\\" and \\"renum\\", but graphics and sound effects were completely unsupported. To use VIC-20's graphics and sound programmers had to \\"PEEK and POKE\\" bytes directly from/to the VIC-20's graphics/sound hardware, the 6560 Video Interface Chip (VIC). This made programming quite tedious and error prone since cryptic memory addresses and codes had to be used constantly, mistakes in these would usually crash the computer instead of giving an error message, and many statements were required to do even simple tasks. Such a thing was death in the tiny RAM and slow interpreted BASIC paradigm of the day. Programmers could mitigate these problems by using machine code, to an extent, but this in itself was a tedious process with a rather steep learning curve. So to address these shortcomings Commodore created the Super Expander cartridge. It provided extra BASIC commands to facilitate using graphics and sound on the VIC-20. It also had commands to read the joystick and lightpen, and unlocked the use of function keys.  Graphics  The VIC-20 did not support high resolution graphics directly. Hi-res graphics were implemented by \\"painting\\" the display with characters, and \\"redefining\\" the character bitmaps on the fly. This was a complex and long-winded process; implementing it in a BASIC program was virtually useless due to the execution time required to draw anything. The Super Expander took care of all the hard work. It allowed the programmer to draw points, lines, ellipses and arcs, and to paint enclosed regions, with one-line statements. All the VIC-20's 16 colours could be used, although with restrictions due to limitations of the 6560 chip. Display resolution was 160√ó160 pixels, throttled down from 192√ó200 allowed by the 6560 chip, in order to permit per-pixel addressability. Multicolor hi-res was supported (with a resolution of 80√ó160) and could be mixed with normal hi-res.  Sound  The VIC-20's sound capability was fairly simplistic, so programming sound effects using \\"PEEK and POKE\\" was not so much of a chore as programming graphics. Even so, the Super Expander provided a command to play simple tones on the VIC-20's four voice channels, and to control the volume. Music playback was unsupported on the VIC-20; the usual way of implementing a musical note was to play a tone inside a for loop time delay. In contrast, with Super Expander musical scores could played by simply PRINTing a string of characters. (Music strings were distinguished from regular strings using a special reverse-control-character, familiar to anyone who has used colours or cursor controls in VIC-20 programs.) Each of the VIC-20's four voice channels could play their own scores simultaneously, giving harmonious effects which could be striking by the standards of the time.  Other devices  Super Expander provided commands to read the status of the joystick and paddles, and the position of the lightpen. In the case of the joystick, since it was the \\"digital\\" or \\"switch\\" type, further bit-fiddling was required to decode its position.  Function keys  Ordinarily the VIC-20's function keys could only be used in a program, by scanning for the appropriate key code when reading the keyboard. In the VIC-20's direct mode they were not available to do anything. With the Super Expander the function keys could be assigned to execute commands in immediate mode. By default they came pre-programmed with the most common BASIC commands, in a similar fashion to GW-BASIC on the IBM PC. The user could then assign their own commands, or any arbitrary string in fact, to the function keys.  Drawbacks  * Commodore designed the Super Expander to map the graphics display to a 1024√ó1024 coordinate system. Under this scheme, each video pixel was 6.4 (or 12.8) \\"virtual\\" pixels in size. This meant that in order to place pixels in exact positions on the screen a further scaling operation had to be coded in. Similar functionality was provided on BASIC 3.5 and 7.0 via the \`SCALE\` command, but in these versions of BASIC, scaling was optional and could be done to any arbitrary user-specified size. * The aspect ratio of the output device (i.e. television set) was not taken into account by the coordinate system. So on NTSC, a circle sized, say, 300√ó300 would appear elliptical. Similarly, a line drawn from (0,0) to (300,300) would not be displayed as 45¬∞. * When drawing circle arcs, the starting and ending angles had to be specified in \\"gradians\\". In this \\"metric\\" angular system there are 400 gradians (also called \\"grads\\" or \\"gons\\") to the circle, as opposed to the familiar 360 degrees. (One can use gradians on most scientific calculators and even with Microsoft Calculator, but the only profession that makes somewhat regular use of this unit is surveying.) It is a mystery why Commodore chose this obscure and unconventional unit of measure, and in any case, Commodore did not implement it properly, dividing the circle into 100 gradians rather than 400. * The Super Expander had no capability to put a bitmap to the display. This meant arbitrary bitmaps, as might be used in a hi-res game, had to be drawn pixel-by-pixel. The slowness of the BASIC interpreter made this unsuitable for applications like arcade-style games. As a result, Super Expander‚Äôs usefulness was really hamstrung, consigning it to shape-centric drawings such as charts and simple pictures, or adventure-style games with static images. * Programs written using the extra Super Expander commands were not portable. A user needed to own the cartridge and have it installed before a program written with the additional commands would run. Loading the program onto an unexpanded VIC-20 gave errors. Therefore, the range of software released to take advantage of the Super Expander‚Äôs capabilities, including type-in programs published in magazines, was very small. This limited the Super Expander‚Äôs appeal and usefulness. In spite of the above, the Super Expander‚Äôs features filled many of the gaps in the VIC-20's programming environment. Additionally, similar microcomputers on the market suffered the same, or equivalent, shortcomings.

A fast bowler, Richardson relied to a great extent on the break-back (a fast ball moving from off to leg), a relatively long run-up and high arm which allowed him to gain sharp lift on fast pitches even from the full, straight length he always bowled. He played 358 first-class cricket matches including 14 Tests, taking a total of 2,104 wickets. In the four consecutive seasons from 1894 to 1897 he took 1,005 wickets, a figure surpassed over such a period only by the slow bowler Tich Freeman. He took 290 wickets in 1895, again a figure only exceeded by Freeman (twice).Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 2008 edition, p322. In 1963 Neville Cardus selected him as one of his \\"Six Giants of the Wisden Century\\". Early career Richardson was born in Byfleet, England, and first played for his native county in 1892. He showed promise with some strong performances in minor matches, notably fifteen wickets against Essex.Pardon, Sydney H. ed. (1913) John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketer‚Äôs Almanac. Jubilee Edition; part I, p. 197 However, his first-class record that season was only moderate. With Surrey's bowling mainstay for the previous decade George Lohmann declining rapidly in health, Richardson made a totally unexpected advance to be the second-highest wicket-taker in the country in 1893. Performances of 11 for 95 for Surrey against the touring Australians and 10 for 156 in the third Test, and especially the speed and stamina showed in them, already marked Richardson as one of the game's top bowlers.Pardon, Sydney H. ed.

Jubilee Edition; part I, p. 157 In 1894, Richardson cemented his reputation with consistent performances: he would have reached 200 wickets but for a thigh strain in June and his average of 10.32 has never been equalled since,Webber, Roy ed. (1951) The Playfair Book of Cricket Records. Haymarket Books. p. 173. whilst his astonishing strike rate of 23 balls per wicket has never been approached subsequently. It was his performances in Australia during the 1894/1895 tour ‚Äì maintaining speed under hot weather ‚Äì that attracted attention. In the first Test at the SCG, he bowled 55 overs without losing his speed, and in the last his energetic bowling without help from the pitch directly won England the match. The following year saw Richardson go from strength to strength both in dry weather and when the pitches became treacherous after mid-July. Despite having to bowl 8,491 balls at a great pace, he never showed any sign of losing his form and set a new record in taking 290 wickets (bettered only by Tich Freeman, a slow bowler, in 1928 and 1933). In 1896, Richardson's bowling at Lord's dismissed Australia for 53 and won England the match. During the following Test at Old Trafford, which England lost by three wickets, after bowling 390 balls in the first innings in perfect batting conditions (taking seven for 168), when Australia were set 125 to win on a pitch showing no sign of wear, Richardson was able to bowl 178 balls without a rest, take six for 76 and almost win England a seemingly lost game. It is said that he did not bowl one bad ball during this spell of three hours and J.T. Hearne dropped a catch off his bowling when Australia were 99 for 7. Neville Cardus recorded the scene when Australia crept home by three wickets: \\"His body still shook from the violent motion. He stood there like some fine animal baffled at the uselessness of great strength and effort in this world... A companion led him to the pavilion, and there he fell wearily to a seat.\\" David Frith suggests the truth was somewhat more prosaic. Richardson was the first off the field and had sunk two pints before anyone else had their boots off. Although he was not required on a wet wicket in the last Test (and nearly withdrew over a pay dispute), Richardson was named a Cricketer of the Year and in 1897 took 273 wickets at the same cost as in 1895. In the four consecutive seasons 1894 to 1897 he took 1,005 wickets, a figure unequalled by any fast bowler before or since.Wright, Graeme ed. (1987) Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. pp. 157‚Äì158 , see also List of first-class cricket records Decline Richardson was chosen to tour Australia in 1897/1898, but this was where his successful years ended. Richardson was always a heavy drinker, but around this time the habit became unmanageable and his weight began increasing, thus reducing his speed and stamina. He produced one great performance on the disappointing 1897/1898 tour with eight wickets for 94 in the first innings of the fifth Test, but as soon as he returned to England his decline was plain for all to see. Indeed, in the first two months of the season Richardson accomplished almost no performance of note, and even when he improved from the beginning of July onwards, Surrey could no longer rely on him to bowl over after over on the extremely true Oval pitches; his body could no longer carry the workload of previous years. In a few games late in the season at the Oval, against Yorkshire (when Surrey inflicted that county's biggest defeat) and Warwickshire (when he took a career-best 15 for 83 on a pitch offering no help), he appeared as potent as the bowler of 1897. Nevertheless, his haul of wickets in the County Championship fell from 237 to 126 and their cost from about 14 runs per wicket to over 21. Later career Prevented from playing the first few games by injury and unable to contain his excessive drinking and increasing weight, Richardson declined still more sharply in 1899. Though after returning to the Surrey eleven he produced some impressive performances (notably against Kent at the Oval), Richardson failed to take 100 wickets for the season. As a result, he was out of the running for Test selection, and the benefit Surrey gave him for his service between 1893 and 1897 was much less lucrative than everybody had hoped despite Surrey winning the Championship. However, Richardson showed some improvement in 1900, increasing his haul of wickets from 98 to 122 and taking 14 wickets for 185 runs at Leyton, whilst in 1901 on the best of wickets almost throughout the year he took 159 wickets including impressive performances against the South Africans (11 for 125) and Yorkshire (7 for 105 in one innings). The following two summers were all against fast bowlers, and Richardson naturally suffered. He remained a strenuous worker, and when helped by the pitch (as at Sheffield in 1903) Richardson could still show glimpses of the great mid-1890s bowler. Nonetheless, it was clear to all who observed him that his weight would catch up with him soon, and in 1904 Richardson bowled so ineffectively that he was dropped at the end of May and not re-engaged by Surrey at the end of the year. At the time he lived in Bath, and played once for Somerset in 1905, but it was clear from his failure then that he could no longer play serious cricket. His weight gain, combined with a congenital heart abnormality, resulted in a fatal heart attack at the age of 41, whilst on a summer walking holiday in Chamb√©ry, France. According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker.Ralph Barker, Ten Great Bowlers, Chatto and Windus, 1967, pp123-126. Richardson was buried in Richmond Cemetery. Honoured by Wisden In the 1963 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Richardson was selected by Neville Cardus as one the Six Giants of the Wisden Century.Six Giants of the Wisden Century Neville Cardus, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1963. Retrieved on 8 November 2008. This was a special commemorative selection requested by Wisden for its 100th edition.

Etymology and history The lake's name means \\"lake of learning\\" probably in reference to the monastery on Innisfallen, an island in the lake. Innisfallen was a centre of scholarship in the early Middle Ages, producing the Annals of Innisfallen and, according to legend, educating King Brian Boru. Another historic site, the tower house Ross Castle sits on Ross Island in the lake. Ross Island is rich in copper.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/30001669 Geography Ducks on Lough Leane Lough Leane is approximately in size. It is also the largest body of fresh water in the region. It has become eutrophic as a result of phosphates from agricultural and domestic pollution entering Lough Leane Reedbed, an important habitat on the edge of Lough Leane. This nutrient enrichment has caused several algal blooms in recent years. The blooms have not yet had a severe effect on the lake's ecosystem. To prevent further pollution causing a permanent change in the lake's ecosystem, a review of land use in the catchment area is being carried out. Water quality in the lake appears to have improved since phosphates were removed from sewage in 1985. As of August 2007, several large hotels and businesses have stated their intention to stop using phosphate detergents, in an effort to preserve the quality of the lake water. Lake cruises for tourists leave from Ross Castle, and boats can be hired for the trip to Innisfallen Island.

Gunnar Valfrid Jarring (12 October 1907 ‚Äì 29 May 2002) was a Swedish diplomat and Turkologist. Early life Jarring was born in Brunnby, Malm√∂hus County, Sweden, the son of Gottfrid J√∂nsson, a farmer, and his wife Betty (n√©e Svensson). He had four siblings. Jarring earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lund University in 1928, a Licentiate Degree in 1931, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1933 with his dissertation Studien zu einer ostt√ºrkischen Lautlehre (\\"Studies in Eastern Turkic Phonology\\"). The same year he was appointed docent in Turkish linguistics at Lund University. Jarring also served as curator of Helsingborgs-Landskrona Student Nation at Lund University in 1933. He taught Turkic languages at the university for the rest of the 1930s. Jarring was also a board member of the Svenska orients√§llskapet (\\"Swedish Oriental Society\\") from 1936 to 1940 and of the Centralbyr√•n i Lund f√∂r popul√§ra vetenskapliga f√∂rel√§sningar (\\"The Central Office in Lund for Popular Scientific Lectures\\") at Lund University from 1939 to 1941. He conducted study trips to, among others, Chinese Turkestan 1929-1930, to Moscow and Leningrad in 1934, to the Northwest India and Afghanistan 1935-1936, and to the Near East in 1940. Diplomatic career Gunnar Jarring (far left) with his wife, Agnes Charlier, Prime Minister of Sweden Tage Erlander and wife Aina Erlander and President John F. Kennedy, 1961. Jarring entered the Swedish diplomatic service and worked for the Swedish foreign service as attach√© at their embassy in Ankara in 1940. He was head of Department B at the Swedish legation in Tehran in 1941 and acting charg√© d'affaires in Tehran and Baghdad in 1945. Jarring served as acting first legation secretary in 1945 and acting legation counselor and acting charg√© d'affaires in Addis Abeba in 1946. Jarring was then Swedish envoy to India in 1948 and to Ceylon in 1950 as well as to Iran, Iraq and Pakistan in 1951. He served as Director (Utrikesr√•d) and head of the Political Department at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm from 1952 to 1956 and as an expert in the United Nations General Assembly in 1955. After several other diplomatic missions, he was Sweden's Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1956 to 1958, and sat in the Security Council for the last two of those years. He was ambassador to the United States from 1958 to 1964, and to the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1973, as well as Mongolia from 1965 to 1973. In that capacity he signed on behalf of his country on the Outer Space Treaty in January 1967. After the 1967 Six-Day War and the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 242, Jarring was appointed by the UN Secretary-General U Thant as a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Middle East peace process, the so-called Jarring Mission. Jarring's methods of negotiation were used unsuccessfully until the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The mission officially lasted until 1991. The role of mediator in the Middle East conflict made Jarring decide not to give any interviews or comments, giving him the famous nickname \\"The Clam\\", sometimes even \\"The Super Clam\\". Gunnar Jarring continued to publish studies on Eastern Turkic languages throughout his diplomatic career and after retirement. He is one of the few people to ever be mentioned by name in a United Nations Security Council Resolution, appearing in Resolution 331.His mention has also been made in the UN Security Councils's Resolution 123 dated 21 February 1957 on the issue of Jammu & Kashmir. Personal life In 1932, he married Agnes Charlier (born 1909), the daughter of professor Carl Charlier and Siri Dorotea (n√©e Leissner). He was the father of Eva (born 1949).

Plot After college professor Richard Wanley sends his wife and two children off on vacation, he goes to his club to meet friends. Next door, Wanley sees a striking oil portrait of Alice Reed in a storefront window. He and his friends talk about the beautiful painting and its subject. Wanley stays at the club and reads Song of Songs. When he leaves, Wanley stops at the portrait and meets Reed, who is standing near the painting watching people gaze at it. Reed convinces Wanley to join her for drinks. Later, they go to Reed's home, but an unexpected visit from her rich clandestine lover Claude Mazard, known to Reed initially only as 'Frank Howard', leads to a fight in which Wanley kills Mazard. Wanley and Reed conspire to cover up the murder, and Wanley disposes of Mazard's body in the country. However, Wanley leaves many clues, and there are a number of witnesses. One of Wanley's friends from the club, district attorney Frank Lalor, has knowledge of the investigation, and Wanley is invited back to the crime scene, as Lalor's friend, but not as a suspect. There are several comic dialogues in which Wanley appears to know more about the murder than he should. As the police gather more evidence, Reed is blackmailed by Heidt, a crooked ex-cop who was Mazard's bodyguard. Reed attempts to poison Heidt with a prescription overdose when he returns the next day, but Heidt is suspicious and takes the money without drinking the drugs. Reed tells Wanley, who overdoses on the remaining prescription medicine. Heidt is killed in a shootout immediately after leaving Reed's home, and police believe Heidt is Mazard's murderer. Reed, seeing that the police have killed Heidt, races to her home to call Wanley, who is slumped over in his chair, and apparently he dies. In an impossible match on action, Wanley awakens in his chair at his club, and he realizes the entire adventure was a dream in which employees from the club were main characters. As he steps out on the street in front of the painting, a woman asks Wanley for a light. He adamantly refuses and runs down the street. Cast * Edward G.

The two films also share the same cinematographer (Milton R. Krasner) and several supporting actors. In the final scene, Robinson wore a tear-away suit with his original suit underneath. The crew changed the set behind him to complete the return to his club while Robinson remained in the chair. ReceptionCritical response= Joan Bennett as Alice Reed When the film was released, the staff at Variety magazine lauded the film and wrote, \\"Nunnally Johnson whips up a strong and decidedly suspenseful murder melodrama in Woman in the Window. The producer, who also prepared the screenplay (from the novel Once off Guard by J.H. Wallis), continually punches across the suspense for constant and maximum audience reaction.

In use by consumers worldwide since the 1960s, these bags are sometimes called single- use bags, referring to carrying items from a store to a home. However, reuse for storage or trash is common, and modern plastic shopping bags are increasingly recyclable. In recent decades, numerous countries have introduced legislation restricting the sale of plastic bags, in a bid to reduce littering and plastic pollution. Some reusable shopping bags are made of plastic film, fibers, or fabric. History American and European patent applications relating to the production of plastic shopping bags can be found dating back to the early 1950s, but these refer to composite constructions with handles fixed to the bag in a secondary manufacturing process. The modern lightweight shopping bag is the invention of Swedish engineer Sten Gustaf Thulin.European Plastics News: Plastic Brief Carrier Bag (1965) . 26 September 2008. Retrieved 17 April 2012. In the early 1960s, Thulin developed a method of forming a simple one-piece bag by folding, welding and die-cutting a flat tube of plastic for the packaging company Celloplast of Norrk√∂ping, Sweden. Thulin's design produced a simple, strong bag with a high load-carrying capacity, and was patented worldwide by Celloplast in 1965. As his son Raoul said later, Sten believed that durable plastic bags will be not single-used but long-term used and could replace paper bags which need chopping of trees. Hasminin was a well-established producer of cellulose film and a pioneer in plastics processing. Amer Mansour was the CEO of this company. The company's patent position gave it a virtual monopoly on plastic shopping bag production, and the company set up manufacturing plants across Europe and in the US. However, other companies saw the attraction of the bag, too, and the US petrochemicals group Mobil overturned Celloplast's US patent in 1977. The Dixie Bag Company of College Park, Georgia was one of the first companies to exploit this new opportunity in the 1980s, along with similar firms such as Houston Poly Bag and Capitol Poly. Kroger, a Cincinnati-based grocery chain, began to replace its paper shopping bags with plastic bags in 1982,\\"It's Not My Sag, Baby!\\" Natural Resource Defense Council. 2003. Retrieved 22 January 2013. and was soon followed by its rival, Safeway. Without its plastic bag monopoly, Celloplast's business went into decline, and the company was split up during the 1990s. The Norrk√∂ping site remains a plastics production site, however, and is now the headquarters of Milj√∂s√§ck, a manufacturer of waste sacks manufactured from recycled polyethylene. From the mid-1980s onwards, plastic bags became common for carrying daily groceries from the store to vehicles and homes throughout the developed world. As plastic bags increasingly replaced paper bags, and as other plastic materials and products replaced glass, metal, stone, timber and other materials, a packaging materials war erupted, with plastic shopping bags at the center of highly publicized disputes. In 1992, Sonoco Products Company of Hartsville, SC patented the \\"self-opening polyethylene bag stack.\\" The main innovation of this redesign is that the removal of a bag from the rack opens the next bag in the stack via a minimal adhesive placed between the bags on a tab at the center-top. This team was headed by Wade D. Fletcher and Harry Wilfong. This design and later variations upon it are commonplace through modern grocers, as they are space-efficient and customer-friendly. Production Although few peer-reviewed studies or government surveys have provided estimates for global plastic bag use, environmental activists estimate that between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide. In 2009, the United States International Trade Commission reported that 102 billion plastic bags are used annually in the United States alone. Manufacture and composition Traditional plastic bags are usually made from polyethylene, which consists of long chains of ethylene monomers. Ethylene is derived from natural gas and petroleum. The polyethylene used in most plastic shopping bags is either low- density (resin identification code 4) or, more often, high-density (resin identification code 2).\\"US Life Cycle Inventory Database\\". US Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Retrieved 14 February 2015. Color concentrates and other additives are often used to add tint to the plastic. Plastic shopping bags are commonly manufactured by blown film extrusion. =Biodegradable materials= Some modern bags are made of vegetable-based bioplastics, which can decay organically and prevent a build-up of toxic plastic bags in landfills and the natural environment. Bags can also be made from degradable polyethylene film or from polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer derived from lactic acid.\\"Notes from the Packaging Laboratory: Polylactic Acid ‚Äì An Exciting New Packaging Material\\" (PDF). University of Florida. Retrieved 14 February 2015. However, most degradable bags do not readily decompose in a sealed landfill,\\"Biodegradable plastic bags carry more ecological harm than good\\". The Guardian. 18 June 2009. Retrieved 7 June 2012. and represent a possible contaminant to plastic recycling operations. In general, biodegradable plastic bags need to be kept separate from conventional plastic recycling systems. Biodegradable plastics are plastics that are decomposed by the action of living organisms, usually bacteria. Two basic classes of biodegradable plastics exist: * Bioplastics, whose components are derived from renewable materials, and many of which are biodegradable. * Plastics made from petrochemicals containing biodegradable additives which enhance biodegradation or photodegradation . Environmental concerns Groceries in multiple plastic bags. Because plastic bags are so durable, this makes them a concern for the environment. They will not break down easily and as a result are very harmful to wildlife. Each year millions of discarded plastic shopping bags end up as plastic waste litter in the environment when improperly disposed of. The same properties that have made plastic bags so commercially successful and ubiquitous‚Äînamely their low weight and resistance to degradation‚Äîhave also contributed to their proliferation in the environment. Due to their durability, plastic bags can take centuries to decompose. According to The Outline, it can take between 500 - 1,000 years for a plastic shopping bag to break down. The use lifespan of a bag is approximately 12 minutes of use. On land, plastic bags are one of the most prevalent types of litter in inhabited areas. Large buildups of plastic bags can clog drainage systems and contribute to flooding, as occurred in Bangladesh in 1988 and 1998 and almost annually in Manila. Littering is often a serious problem in developing countries, where trash collection infrastructure is less developed than in wealthier nations. According to Sharma, Moser, Vermillion, Doll, and Rajagopalan (2014), they have noted that in the year 2009 only 13% of one trillion single-use plastic bags produced were recycled, the rest were thrown away, which means they end up in landfills and because they are so lightweight end up in the atmosphere blown into the environment. The number of plastic grocery bags disposed of in the U.S. apart from the rest of the world is a number that is difficult to comprehend, this is why it is important that solutions are considered, weighed and measured to address this growing problem. Phasing out plastic bags is a viable option, however, there are many that argue that this puts a strain on businesses and makes it more difficult for the customer to take goods home. There are alternatives such as purchasing cloth grocery bags so that those who don't agree with using plastic reusable bags can still have a bag that can be used many times over; however, government studies have found that cloth bags have a high carbon footprint. Many states have used legislation to stop the banning of plastic bags. Plastic bags were found to constitute a significant portion of the floating marine debris in the waters around southern Chile in a study conducted between 2002 and 2005. Plastic bags don't do well in the environment, but several government studies have found them to be an environmentally friendly carryout bag option. According to the Recyc-Quebec, a Canadian government agency, \\"The conventional plastic bag has several environmental and economic advantages. Thin and light, its production requires little material and energy. It also avoids the production and purchase of garbage/bin liner bags since it benefits from a high reuse rate when reused for this purpose (77.7%).\\" Government studies from Denmark and the United Kingdom, as well as a study from Clemson University, came to similar conclusions. =Reduction, reuse and recycling= Plastic shopping bags are in most cases not accepted by standard curbside recycling programs; though their composition is often identical to other accepted plastics, they pose problems for the single-stream recycling process, as most of the sorting equipment is designed for rigid plastics such as bottles, so plastic bags often end up clogging wheels or belts, or being confused as paper and contaminating the pulp produced later in the stream. Plastic bags are 100% recyclable. They need to be taken to a location that recycles plastic film, usually a grocery store or major retail chain. Some large store chains have banned plastic shopping bags such as Whole Foods in the U.S. and IKEA in the U.S. and the U.K. Heavy- duty plastic shopping bags are suitable for reuse as reusable shopping bags. Lighter weight bags are often reused as trash bags or to pick up pet feces. All types of plastic shopping bag can be recycled into new bags where effective collection schemes exist. By the mid-1900s, the expansion of recycling infrastructure in the United States yielded a 7% annual rate of plastic bag recycling. This corresponded to more than of bags and plastic film being recycled in 2007 alone. Each ton of recycled plastic bags saves the energy equivalent of 11 barrels of oil, although most bags are produced from natural-gas-derived stock. In light of a 2002 Australian study showing that more than 60% of bags are reused as bin liners and for other purposes,Plastic shopping bags in Australia. Environment.gov.au (2010-06-13). Retrieved on 2010-11-23. the 7% recycling rate accounts for 17.5% of the plastic bags available for recycling. According to the UK's Environment Agency, 76% of British carrier bags are reused. A survey by the American Plastics Counsel found that 90% of Americans answer yes to the question \\"Do you or does anyone in your household ever reuse plastic shopping bags?\\" UK Environment Agency published a review of supermarket carrier bags and compares energy usage of current styles of bag. =Bag legislation= As of August 2018, over 160 countries, regions, and cities had enacted legislation to ban or put a fee on plastic bags with the aim to reduce the overall use of disposable plastic bags. Outright bans have been introduced in some countries, notably China which banned very thin plastic bags nationwide in 2008. Several other countries impose a tax at the point of sale.

The station's studios and transmitter facilities are shared with co-owned WNTP (990 AM) in Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania. The station's daytime coverage includes Philadelphia and portions of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, as well as parts of New Jersey and Delaware. WFIL is immediately adjacent to sister station WMCA (at 570) in New York City, and the two stations have similar histories: both were Top 40 stations in the 1960s, both underwent a format evolution as AM radio faded as a music medium, and both have a Christian/religious format today. WFIL and WMCA are both 5,000-watt radio stations, but each one puts less than 5 kW of power in the specific direction of the other, because they are located next to each other on the dial, and are not allowed, by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to interfere with each other. Both stations also maintained Call For Action telephone help lines, being among the first radio stations in the United States to do so. The telephone number of WFIL's Call For Action line was GReenwood 7-5312. (Under the present-day North American Numbering Plan, the primary telephone numbering plan in the United States, this number would have corresponded to (215) 477-5312.) History WFIL was formed by a merger of two stations that were launched in 1922. One used the call letters WFI; the other was originally WDAR. Each was owned by a major Philadelphia department store; WFI was operated by Strawbridge and Clothier, while WDAR was run by Lit Brothers. While operated independently of each other, the two were able to work out amicable share-time agreements (hundreds of other American stations at the time were unable to do so, and frequently engaged in \\"jamming wars\\"). Around 1924, WDAR applied for and received the custom call-sign WLIT. By the late 1920s, the two stations were working jointly on various programs, promotions, and sponsorship efforts. In 1935, the two operators agreed to merge with each department store having representation on the new board of directors. The new call-sign became WFIL, a combination of the two previous identifiers (the fact that the new call letters were close to a phonetic spelling of \\"Philadelphia\\" was merely a happy coincidence). The new WFIL was an affiliate of NBC; some sources say the station never became established as either a \\"basic Red\\" or \\"basic Blue\\" outlet, but at least one early WFIL advertisement claimed that it was a \\"basic Blue\\" station. Westinghouse's KYW had replaced WFI-WLIT as the NBC primary for Philadelphia when it moved in from Chicago, Illinois a few years before. Starting in December 1944 the station produced Hayloft Hoedown, picked up by ABC Radio in 1945. WFIL was purchased in 1947 by Walter Annenberg's Triangle Publications, which also owned The Philadelphia Inquirer. By then WFIL was an affiliate of the newly named ABC Radio Network. WFIL's sister stations under Triangle Publications ownership were WFIL-FM and WFIL-TV in Philadelphia; WNHC AM-FM-TV in New Haven, Connecticut; KFRE AM-FM-TV in Fresno, California; WFBG AM-FM-TV in Altoona, Pennsylvania; WNBF AM-FM-TV in Binghamton, New York; and WLYH-TV in Lancaster/Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Triangle Publications sold WFIL AM-FM-TV to Capital Cities Broadcasting in 1971 with the radio stations spun off to new owners, WFIL to LIN Broadcasting and WFIL-FM to Richer Communications which changed the call letters to WIOQ. WFIL-TV took on the new call letters of WPVI-TV. Emergence of two rock and roll legends Studios for the early WFIL radio stations were in the Widener Building in downtown Philadelphia. Under Triangle Publications' ownership the stations were moved to a new broadcast facility at 46th and Market Street in West Philadelphia adjacent to the Arena, the first broadcast facility in the nation specifically designed for television broadcasting. It was in this new broadcast center that Triangle began broadcasting Bandstand (later called American Bandstand), first with Bob Horn, then with Dick Clark as host. Clark started on WFIL radio as a disc jockey in 1952, arriving from Utica, New York. He continued hosting the TV program for 31 years, the last 30 as a national show carried by the ABC Television Network. Clark moved the program to Hollywood in 1964. Shortly after Clark's emergence on the national stage, he became a major figure in the early days of rock and roll as \\"Bandstand\\" proved pivotal in helping promote the major stars of the era. The WFIL studio at 4548 Market Street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 for its significance as one of the first buildings constructed specifically for television broadcasting, as well as being the site for American Bandstand. Settling into a new home In February 1964, Triangle moved the WFIL stations to a new state-of-the-art broadcast center at the corner of City and Monument Avenues in Philadelphia, from which WPVI continues to broadcast. Starting on September 18, 1966, WFIL began playing \\"Top 40\\" rock and roll. It quickly became the most successful non-RKO \\"Boss Radio\\" formatted station, known locally as \\"The Pop Music Explosion\\". The original line up of air personalities, or \\"Boss Jocks\\" were scheduled as follows: 6-10am: Chuck Browning 10am-2pm: Jay Cook (\\"Captain Jay Cook\\") 2-6pm: Jim Nettleton (\\"Diamond Jim\\" Nettleton) 6-10pm: George Michael (\\"King George\\" Michael) 10pm-2am: Long John Wade 2-6am: Dave Parks (\\"Dave the Rave\\" Parks) Weekends: Frank Kingston Smith WFIL announcers heard in later years of the Top 40 era included Dr. Don Rose, Jim O'Brien (who later also became a WPVI-TV weather broadcaster and station personality), Dan Donovan, J. J. Jeffrey, Dick Heatherton, Tom Dooley, \\"Tiny\\" Tom Tyler, Mitch \\"K.C.\\" Hill, \\"Big\\" Ron O'Brien, Kris Chandler, Geoff Richards, Joel Denver, Brother Lee Love (Alan Smith), and Banana Joe Montione. The format evolved into an adult contemporary sound in the fall of 1977. At some point after that, the WFIL studios were relocated to Domino Lane in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia; they moved into the building of FM station WUSL, which WFIL owner LIN Broadcasting had acquired in late 1976. Growing competition from FM stations in this period did serious damage to WFIL's ratings. In September 1981 country music was tried, but this failed to reverse the downward trend. The station switched to an \\"oldies\\" format in September 1983, called \\"The Boss is Back,\\" with a new line up of \\"Boss Jocks,\\" playing the hits of 1955 through 1973. This format lasted until April 8, 1987, when new owner WEAZ Inc. discontinued locally originated music programming in favor of Transtar's \\"Oldies Channel,\\" a satellite-delivered service. The end of live programming was marked by a production piece consisting of a portion of the song American City Suite by Terry Cashman and Tommy West interspersed with old WFIL airchecks. The \\"Epilogue to WFIL\\" was produced by Charlie Mills, who at the time was working cross-town at WPEN, and had been an avid fan of WFIL during his teen years. In November 1987 FM stations WOGL and WIOQ both adopted oldies formats and quickly won the majority of the potential oldies audience. The Oldies Channel format continued with minimal success and listenership until 1989, when WFIL quietly began simulcasting sister station Easy 101.1 WEAZ (which had a soft adult contemporary format by then). Soon thereafter, the FM became WEAZ-FM so that WFIL could become WEAZ. In September 1991, the AM launched a mostly automated \\"beautiful music\\" format known as \\"Wish,\\" a play on the old WWSH station which had a similar format in Philadelphia back in the 1970s. Then on May 26, 1993, WEAZ became WBEB while WEAZ-FM became WBEB-FM. The AM station was sold for $4 million in October 1993 to Salem Communications (which had almost bought the station three years earlier for $6.5 million but backed out of the deal at the last minute) and on November 1, 1993, the station was renamed WPHY, with a religious format focusing on Christian talk and teaching. WBEB-FM then became WBEB and to this day, continues on with its adult contemporary format. The Christian teaching and talk format is still in use today. When a TV station in South Carolina that had been using the WFIL call letters dropped them, Salem immediately moved to reclaim the famous call sign. The call letters officially reverted to WFIL on September 6, 1994. In its rock-and-roll heyday, the station was known colloquially as \\"Famous 56\\" and employed the slogan \\"Rockin' in the Cradle of Liberty.\\" Its 5000-watt transmitter enabled its signal to be heard as far away at times as Staten Island, the southernmost borough of New York City. During its top 40 years, WFIL also consistently showed strongly in the ratings books in nearby Wilmington, Delaware, where it has an excellent signal. In addition, WFIL was a popular listening choice in Reading and Allentown, both in Pennsylvania. Today, WFIL is locally co-owned with Salem's WNTP (990 AM). WNTP is the former WIBG. WIBG was WFIL's main rock 'n roll rival in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The studios, offices and transmitters of both stations are located at the former WIBG complex on Ridge Pike in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania.

A plastic bag, poly bag, or pouch is a type of container made of thin, flexible, plastic film, nonwoven fabric, or plastic textile. Plastic bags are used for containing and transporting goods such as foods, produce, powders, ice, magazines, chemicals, and waste. It is a common form of packaging. Most plastic bags are heat sealed at the seams, while some are bonded with adhesives or are stitched. Many countries are introducing legislation to phase-out lightweight plastic bags, because plastic never fully breaks down,https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/.../plastics-in-the-ocean.html causing everlasting pollution of plastics and environmental impacts. Every year, about 1 to 5 trillion plastic bags are used and discarded around the world. From point of sale to destination, plastic bags have a lifetime of 12 minutes. Approximately 320 bags per capita were used in 2014.  Packages  handle die-cut through the thick plastic to allow carrying Stand-up pouch containing nuts Several design options and features are available. Some bags have gussets to allow a higher volume of contents, special stand-up pouches have the ability to stand up on a shelf or a refrigerator, and some have easy- opening or reclosable options. Handles are cut into or added into some. Bags can be made with a variety of plastics films. Polyethylene (LDPE, LLDPE, etc.) is the most common. Other forms, including laminates and co-extrusions can be used when the physical properties are needed. Plastics to create single use bags are primarily made with Fossil fuels. Plastic bags usually use less material than comparable to boxes, cartons, or jars, thus are often considered as \\"reduced or minimized packaging\\". In June 2009 Germany‚Äôs Institute for Energy and Environmental Research concluded that oil-based plastics, especially if recycled, have a better life-cycle analysis than compostable plastics. They added that \\"The current bags made from bioplastics have less favourable environmental impact profiles than the other materials examined\\" and that this is due to the process of raw-material production. Depending on the construction, plastic bags can be suited for plastic recycling. They can be incinerated in appropriate facilities for waste-to-energy conversion. They are stable and benign in sanitary landfills. If disposed of improperly, however, plastic bags can create unsightly litter and harm some types of wildlife. Plastic bags have low recycling rates due to lack of separation ability. Mixed material recycling causes contamination of the material. However, plastic bags are reused before discard at a rate of 1.6 times. Bags are also made with carrying handles, hanging holes, tape attachments, or security features. Some bags have provisions for easy and controlled opening. Reclosable features, including press-to-seal zipper strips, are common for kitchen bags bought empty and for some foods. Some bags are sealed for tamper- evident capability, including some where the press-to-reseal feature becomes accessible only when a perforated outer seal has torn away. Boil-in-bags are often used for sealed frozen foods, sometimes complete entrees. The bags are usually tough heat-sealed nylon or polyester to withstand the temperatures of boiling water. Some bags are porous or perforated to allow the hot water to contact the food: rice, noodles, etc. Grocery stores are the single largest supplier of single-use plastic bags. Bag-in-box packaging is often used for liquids such as box wine and institutional sizes of other liquids.  Medical uses  Plastic bags are used for many medical purposes. The non-porous quality of plastic film means that they are useful for isolating infectious body fluids; other porous bags made of nonwoven plastics can be sterilized by gas and maintain this sterility. Bags can be made under regulated sterile manufacturing conditions, so they can be used when the infection is a health risk. They are lightweight and flexible, so they can be carried by or laid next to patients without making the patient as uncomfortable as a heavy glass bottle would be. They are less expensive than re-usable options, such as glass bottles. Moderate quality evidence from a 2018 systematic review showed that plastic wraps or bags prevented hypothermia compared to routine care, especially in extremely preterm infants.  Waste disposal bags  Flexible intermediate bulk container  FIBC; Bulk bag Flexible intermediate bulk containers are large industrial containers, usually used for bulk powders or flowables. They are usually constructed of woven heavy-duty plastic fibers.  Plastic shopping bags  Open bags with carrying handles are used in large numbers. Stores often provide them as a convenience to shoppers. Some stores charge a nominal fee for a bag. Heavy-duty reusable shopping bags are often considered environmentally better than single-use paper or plastic shopping bags. Because of environmental and litter problems, some locations are working toward a phase-out of lightweight plastic bags. = History = A German plastic shopping bag, freshly folded (left) and used (right) Milk bags Different meat products of Thailand in plastic bags American and European patent applications relating to the production of plastic shopping bags can be found dating back to the early 1950s, but these refer to composite constructions with handles fixed to the bag in a secondary manufacturing process. The modern lightweight shopping bag is the invention of Swedish engineer Sten Gustaf Thulin.European Plastics News: Plastic T-Shirt Carrier Bag (1965) . 26 September 2008. Retrieved 17 April 2012. In the early 1960s, Thulin developed a method of forming a simple one-piece bag by folding, welding and die-cutting a flat tube of plastic for the packaging company Celloplast of Norrk√∂ping, Sweden. Thulin's design produced a simple, strong bag with a high load-carrying capacity, and was patented worldwide by Celloplast in 1965. From the mid-1980s onwards, plastic bags became common for carrying daily groceries from the store to vehicles and homes throughout the developed world. As plastic bags increasingly replaced paper bags, and as other plastic materials and products replaced glass, metal, stone, timber and other materials, a packaging materials war erupted, with plastic shopping bags at the center of highly publicized disputes. In 1992, Sonoco Products Company of Hartsville, SC patented the \\"self-opening polyethylene bag stack\\". The main innovation of this redesign is that the removal of a bag from the rack opens the next bag in the stack. = International usage = The number of plastic bags used and discarded worldwide has been estimated to be on the order of one trillion annually. The use of plastic bags differs dramatically across countries. While the average consumer in China uses only two or three plastic bags a year, the numbers are much higher in most other countries: Denmark: four; Ireland: 20; Germany: 65; Poland, Hungary, Slovakia: more than 400. A large number of cities and counties have banned the use of plastic bags by grocery stores or introduced a minimum charge. In September 2014, California became the first state to pass a law banning their use. Local manufacturers of plastic bags, under the legislation, would receive financial support to assist them to make more durable multi-use bags, that would be sold by grocery stores rather than given away, as were the plastic bags. In India, the government has banned the use of plastic bags of a thickness below 50 microns. In 2018, Montreal, Canada, also banned plastic bags with Ottawa expected to also put the ban into effect. = Plastic bags and the environment = Non-compostable plastic bags can take up to 1000 years to decompose. Plastic bags are not capable of biodegradation but rather they photodegrade, a process by which the plastic bags are broken down into smaller toxic parts. In the 2000s, many stores and companies began to use different types of biodegradable bags to comply with perceived environmental benefits.\\"The supermarket chain Aldi S√ºd of Germany is now offering its customers shopping bags made of BASF's biodegradable plastic ecovio¬Æ. (Industry News and Notes, brief article).\\" Plastics Engineering 65.6 (June 2009): 54(2) When plastic shopping bags are not disposed of properly, they can end up in streams, which then lead them to end up in the open ocean. To mitigate marine plastic pollution from single-use shopping bags, many jurisdictions around the world have implemented bans or fees on the use of plastic bags.Xanthos, D., Walker, T. R. (2017). International policies to reduce plastic marine pollution from single-use plastics (plastic bags and microbeads): a review. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 118(1-2), 17-26. An estimated 300 million plastic bags end up in the Atlantic Ocean alone. The way in which the bags float in open water can resemble a jellyfish, posing significant dangers to marine mammals and Leatherback sea turtles, when they are eaten by mistake and enter the animals' digestive tracts. After ingestion, the plastic material can lead to premature death. Once death occurs and the animal body decomposes, the plastic reenters the environment, posing more potential problems. Marine animals are not the only animals affected by improper plastic bag disposal. Sea birds, when hunting, sense for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) which is produced by algae. Plastic is a breeding ground for algae, so the sea birds mistakenly eat the bag rather than the fish that typically ingests algae. (National Geographic) Plastic bags do not do well in the environment, but several government studies have found them to be an environmentally friendly carryout bag option. According to the Recyc- Quebec, a Canadian recycling agency, \\"The conventional plastic bag has several environmental and economic advantages. Thin and light, its production requires little material and energy. It also avoids the production and purchase of garbage/bin liner bags since it benefits from a high reuse rate when reused for this purpose (77.7%).\\" Government studies from Denmark and the United Kingdom, as well as a study from Clemson University, came to similar conclusions. Even though the bags are plastic, they typically cannot be recycled in curbside recycling bins. The material frequently causes the equipment used at recycling plants to jam, thus having to pause the recycle machinery and slow down daily operations. However, plastic bags are 100% recyclable. To recycle them the user needs to drop them off at a location that accepts plastic film. Usually, this means taking them back to the grocery store or another major retail store.  Danger to children  Thin, conformable plastic bags, especially dry cleaning bags, have the potential to cause suffocation. Because of this, about 25 children in the United States suffocate each year due to plastic bags, almost nine-tenths of whom are under the age of one. This has led to voluntary warning labels on some bags posing a hazard to small children.

Unleashed MCW's television show Unleashed! aired on WLMT-TV every Saturday morning at 11:00 am and early Sunday morning at 1:30 am. The show was hosted by Lance Russell, David Webb, David Jett, with Kevin Kelly also later hosting. After the promotion closed, the MCW television show was made up of candid interviews with many of the departing talents. Later, these television shows were made up of old replays before it was eventually dropped by the television station.

It is down the line from . The station is managed by London Overground and trains are operated by London Overground, Thameslink and Southern. History The station has occupied two sites under three different names. = Jolly-sailor and Norwood stations = Jolly-sailor station in 1845, showing the atmospheric railway pumping station, with its Gothic chimney vent, in the foreground. In 1839 the London and Croydon Railway opened Jolly-sailor station ‚Äî \\"Jolly-sailor near Beulah Spa\\" on fares lists and timetables ‚Äî at the north end of the High Street, adjacent to the Portland Road level crossing. From 1841 the lines through Norwood were used by the London and Brighton Railway and from 1842 the South Eastern Railway, but neither of these companies used the station. (The Jolly Sailor is a pub ‚Äî originally the Jolly Sailor Inn ‚Äî on the corner of Portland Road and High Street. The original pub was rebuilt around the late 1860s.) In 1844 the L&CR; was given parliamentary authority to test an experimental atmospheric railway system on the railway. A pumping station was built on Portland Road to create a vacuum in a continuous pipe located centrally between the rails. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, with trains blown towards the pumping station by atmospheric pressure. The pumping station was in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower that served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion tube. As part of the works for the atmospheric system, the world's first railway flyover was constructed beyond the south end of the station to carry the atmospheric line over the conventional London & Brighton Railway steam line. At the same time the level crossing at Portland Road was replaced by a low bridge across the road. In July 1846 the L&CR; merged with the L&BR; to form the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, London Brighton and South Coast Railway and the station was renamed Norwood in the same year - it became Norwood Junction by 1856. The LB&SCR; abandoned atmospheric propulsion in 1847. Following construction of lines to Crystal Palace the station closed on 1 June 1859 and was replaced by the current station located at the end of a short approach road off the south side of the A213 road. The original station building was used as a private house until the 1960s, when it was demolished. =Norwood Junction rail accident= The Norwood Junction railway crash occurred on 1 May 1891, when the cast-iron bridge over Portland Road fractured under an express train from Brighton to London. The present station The current station opened on 1 June 1859 by the LB&SCR.; It was renamed Norwood Junction and South Norwood on 1 October 1910 but reverted to its original name on 13 June 1955 though some tickets and publications continued to use the pre-1955 name for sometime thereafter.Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley There are seven platforms but only five are in use. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. The LB&SCR; goods shed built in 1865 remains in place, now used as railway offices. = Platforms 1 = Platform 1 is the first platform when entering via the main entrance and is the only platform accessible without having to negotiate the subway via stairs. Its main use is for trains northwards to , and London Victoria; most stop at all stations. They mainly come from West Croydon, , Sutton and Epsom. The platform is also used for London Overground and Southern trains. = Platform 2 = Platform 2 serves the same track as Platform 1 but passengers are not able to join or alight as the doors open only on the Platform 1 side. This is due to the live rail being on the side nearest to Platform 2. Platform 2 also is used for platform alteration. = Platform 3 = Platform 1,2 & 3 at Norwood Junction when the station was managed by Southern. (view from Platform 1) Platform 3 is mainly used for trains going Northbound terminating at Bedford via London Bridge. Many passengers use this platform to go to central London, London St Pancras International & Luton Airport Parkway. Trains mainly come from Gatwick Airport. Many trains pass this platform going to London Bridge, Cambridge or Peterborough. This platform is mainly used by Thameslink. View from platform 6, 2018 = Platforms 4 = Platforms 4 & 5 (the bridge in the background was replaced in 2015) Platforms 4 is mainly used for trains going Southbound terminating at Gatwick Airport. Many trains pass this platform coming Northbound (mainly from Bedford, which stops at Norwood Junction). This platform is also mainly used by Thameslink. = Platform 5 = Platform 5 is mainly used for trains going Southbound terminating at West Croydon, Epsom and Sutton. Normally ,trains stop at this platform and people alight at the platform. Trains come from London Bridge, Highbury & Islington and London Victoria. This platform is also used by both Southern & London Overground. = Platform 6 = Platform 6 is also mainly used for trains going southbound terminating at Coulsdon Town, West Croydon, Caterham and Tattenham Corner. This platform is normally used for platform alterations. Also many trains stop at this platform and passengers alight from the train to the platform. Trains come from London Victoria and London Bridge. This platform is mainly only used by Southern. = Platform 7 = Platform 7 is disused and the line is covered by vegetation. However, with the planned two-year blockade of Thameslink trains through Central London while London Bridge station is under reconstruction Network Rail considered reinstating and electrifying this line as a 'dead-end'. The object was to terminate some additional services arriving via Crystal Palace which would otherwise need to go on to Beckenham Junction to terminate, thus obviating unnecessary occupation of the of single bi- directional line east of Birkbeck Junction and also save a carriage set. To achieve the change the lead to the down spur at Bromley Junction would have been being removed to the up line and a facing crossover put into place west of it. To provide the necessary pathing northbound the trains would use the same spur line, which would have become reversible to the resited point on the up line at Bromley Junction. Despite safety problems for the user-operated level crossing into the track maintenance depot on the former steam shed site because of restricted sighting under Goat House bridge having apparently been resolved the changes have been postponed until the work at London Bridge is complete. This is mainly because it was judged the cost did not justify the change, at least until a general renewal of the signal and control installation is undertaken. Services Services at Norwood Junction are operated by Southern, Thameslink and London Overground. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: Southern * 4 tph to London Bridge (2 of these run non-stop and 2 are stopping services via ) * 2 tph to London Victoria via * 2 tph to West Croydon * 2 tph to via Sutton * 2 tph to via Southern services at Norwood Junction are operated using Class 377 and Class 455 EMUs. Thameslink * 2 tph to via London Bridge * 2 tph to via Thameslink services at Norwood Junction are operated using Class 700 EMUs. London Overground * 4 tph to Highbury & Islington via * 4 tph to West Croydon London Overground services at Norwood Junction are operated using Class 378 EMUs. Marshalling yard The LB&SCR; constructed a large marshalling yard to the south of the station during the 1870s, extended in the early 1880s. At their height the yards on both sides of the line each had over 30 carriage roads. Because of the narrow nature of the site they were laid in clusters of six to eight, one beyond another, with the lead to each forming an individual headshunt. With dwindling freight traffic the yard fell into disuse by the 1980s and the tracks were relaid to accommodate an enlarged Selhurst Depot. Motive Power Depot/Norwood Cable Depot Norwood Junction Locomotive Depot on 12 March 1960. The Southern Railway opened a five-road motive power depot with a 65 ft (19.8 metre) turntable in 1935, to serve the marshalling yard. It replaced a shed at West Croydon. This depot was closed in 1964 and demolished in 1966. Following the demolition of the locomotive depot British Rail then redeveloped the site into a traction cable depot for maintaining the railway. Connections Norwood Junction is well served by bus routes, with three bus stops including two bus stands close by. On the Portland Road side are two stops for routes 197 (Croydon Town Centre - Norwood Junction - Peckham) and 312 (South Croydon, Bus Garage‚Äì East Croydon - Norwood Junction).Norwood Junction Rail Station - Bus The High Street 'Clocktower' stop serves routes 75 (Croydon Town Centre ‚Äì Penge - Lewisham Station), 157 (Morden ‚Äì West Croydon - Crystal Palace) and 410 (Wallington ‚Äì Croydon - Crystal Palace). The Grosvenor Road stop serves routes 130 (New Addington‚Äì Addington Village - Thornton Heath, Parchmore Road) and 196 (Norwood Junction ‚Äì Brixton - Elephant and Castle). Route 75 was formerly a 24-hour route but that facility was withdrawn in favour of a higher frequency of buses on a SundayLondon Bus Route 75 - Croydon Town Centre - Selhurst - Anerley - Penge - Newlands Park - Sydenham - Mayow Road - Woolstone Road - Catford - Lewisham, Shopping Centre (Route History) by Selkent when it took the service over from Stagecoach London. Metrobus won the contract from April 2009 and works the route from its Croydon garage. Nowadays, the route is operated by Stagecoach London. The stop on Night Bus route N68 is half a mile away on White Horse Lane. Other service operators are Arriva London, Abellio and Metrobus. Latest ImprovementsThameslink Programme= The Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a ¬£3.5 billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 stations extending northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn and southwards to Guildford, Eastbourne, Horsham, Hove to Littlehampton, East Grinstead, Ashford and Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaducts) and additional rolling stock. The new Thameslink timetable for Norwood Junction started 20 May 2018. \\"Norwood Junction gain[ed] an all-day-long Thameslink service to Bedford via Blackfriars and St Pancras, with two trains per hour to Epsom via Sutton\\" and timetables will continue being expanded and adjusted into 2019. In literature It is from this station that Jonas Oldacre takes his train to London Bridge in Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story \\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\\" (1903).Duncan, Alistair (2009).

It comprises the Foreign Affairs Ministers of all the member states, or their permanent diplomatic representatives in Strasbourg. It is both a governmental body, where national approaches to problems facing European society can be discussed on an equal footing, and a collective forum, where Europe-wide responses to such challenges are formulated. In collaboration with the Parliamentary Assembly, it is the guardian of the Council's fundamental values, and monitors member states' compliance with their undertakings. Members of the Committee of Ministers The Minister of Foreign Affairs of each Council of Europe member state sits on the Committee of Ministers. In May 1951 the Committee of Ministers invited each member state to appoint a Permanent Representative who would be in constant touch with the organisation. All Permanent Representatives reside in Strasbourg. They are usually senior diplomats with ambassadorial rank, occasionally charg√©s d'affaires. In 1952 the Committee of Ministers decided that each Minister could appoint a Deputy. The Ministers' Deputies have the same decision-making powers as the Ministers. A Deputy is usually also the Permanent Representative of the member State. The second in rank in a delegation usually has the title \\"Deputy Permanent Representative\\", not to be confused with \\"Ministers' Deputy\\". Meetings of the Committee of Ministers The Committee meets at ministerial level once a year, in May or in November. The meetings, known as \\"sessions\\", are normally held in Strasbourg and usually last one full day or two half days. While the greater part of each session is usually devoted to political dialogue, the Ministers may discuss all matters of mutual interest with the exception of national defence. Although the records of the sessions are confidential, a final communiqu√© is issued at the end of each meeting. The Ministers may also issue one or more declarations. \\"Meetings of the Ministers' Deputies\\" are usually held in the Committee of Ministers' meeting room once a week. The Deputies also meet several times a week in subsidiary groups. The role of the Committee of Ministers The Committee of Ministers performs a triple role; as the emanation of the governments which enables them to express on equal terms their national approaches to the problems confronting Europe's societies; as the collective forum where European responses to these challenges are worked out, alongside the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and as guardian of the values for which the Council of Europe exists. The work and activities of the Committee of Ministers include political dialogue, developing public international law through Council of Europe conventions, interacting with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, interacting with the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. =Admitting new member States= The Committee of Ministers has the authority to invite European States to become members of the Council of Europe (Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Statute). It may also suspend or terminate membership. The process of admission begins when the Committee of Ministers, having received an official application for membership, consults the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (under Statutory Resolution (51) 30). The Assembly adopts an opinion which is published in the Assembly's texts adopted. If the Committee decides that a state can be admitted, it adopts a resolution inviting that state to become a member. The invitation specifies the number of seats that the state will have in the Assembly as well as its contribution to the budget. Recently the invitations have included a number of conditions concerning the implementation of democratic reforms in the applicant state. Once invited, a state becomes a member by depositing, normally by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, an instrument of accession with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The only European states which are not members of the Council of Europe and thus could in principle be admitted are Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Vatican as well as Kosovo pending clarification of its international legal status. Once the European Union has attained full legal personality, it could also accede to the Council of Europe. So far, the European Community has only signed Council of Europe treaties. =Monitoring respect of commitments by member statesConcluding Conventions and agreements= Article 15.a of the Statute states that the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe \\"shall consider the action required to further the aim of the Council of Europe, including the conclusion of conventions and agreements\\". Over 190 treaties have now been opened for signature. The European Convention of Human Rights of 1950 is one of the best known Council of Europe treaties and the one with the strongest supervision mechanism by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Committee of Ministers. The text of any treaty is finalised when it is adopted by the Committee. Under Article 20 of the Statute adoption of a treaty requires: * a two-thirds majority of the representatives casting a vote; * a majority of those entitled to vote. The same majorities are required to authorise the publication of any explanatory report. The Committee also fixes the date that the treaty will be opened for signature. Conventions are legally binding for those States which ratify them. =Adopting recommendations to member states= Article 15.b of the Statute provides for the Committee of Ministers to make recommendations to member states on matters for which the Committee has agreed \\"a common policy\\". Under Article 20 of the Statute, adoption of a recommendation requires a unanimous vote of all representatives present and a majority of those entitled to vote. However, at their 519 bis meeting (November 1994) the Ministers' Deputies decided to make their voting procedure more flexible and made a \\"Gentleman's agreement\\" not to apply the unanimity rule to recommendations. Recommendations are not binding on member States. Since 1993 the Committee has also adopted recommendations in accordance with its role in the implementation of the European Social Charter (Article 29 of the Social Charter). Recommendations adopted before 1979 were issued in the \\"Resolutions\\" series of texts adopted. The Statute permits the Committee of Ministers to ask member governments \\"to inform it of the action taken by them\\" in regard to recommendations (Article 15.b). In 1987, at their 405th meeting, the Ministers' Deputies adopted a message to the intergovernmental committees (steering committees and committees of experts), urging them to improve their monitoring of the implementation of recommendations and resolutions. =Adopting the budget= Under Article 38.c of the Statute the Secretary General is required to prepare a draft budget each year and submit it to the Committee of Ministers for adoption. The draft budget is presented to the Deputies in November of each year. It is adopted, along with the Programme of Activities, in the form of resolutions. Under Article 29 of the Financial Regulations (revised in May 1997) the Deputies are assisted by a Budget Committee composed of eleven independent experts, appointed by the Committee of Ministers acting on proposals from member governments. An abridged version of the adopted budget is available in electronic form. =Communication= In 2006 the Committee of Ministers launched the \\"Council of Europe Communication Strategy\\", the first time that the Council of Europe had had a proper communication policy. Adopting and monitoring the Programme of Activities Since 1966 the Council of Europe has organised, planned and budgeted its activities according to an annual work programme, published as the \\"Intergovernmental Programme of Activities\\". The Deputies adopt the programme towards the end of each year and are entrusted with overseeing its implementation. Article 17 of the Statute authorises the Committee of Ministers to set up \\"advisory or technical committees\\". This has led to the creation of some 30 steering committees and a large number of ad hoc expert committees, which assist the Committee of Ministers in the implementation of the programme of activities. Implementing cooperation and assistance programmesSupervising the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights In accordance with Article 46 of the Convention as amended by Protocol No. 11, the Committee of Ministers supervises the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. This work is carried out mainly at four regular meetings (DH/HR meetings) every year. Documentation for these meetings takes the form of the Annotated Agenda and Order of Business. These documents are made public, as are, in general, the decisions taken in each case. The Committee of Ministers' essential function is to ensure that member states comply with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The Committee completes each case by adopting a final resolution. In some cases, interim resolutions may prove appropriate. Both kinds of Resolutions are public.

Believing that individuals create social reality through collective and individual action, he was an avid interpreter and proponent of George Herbert Mead's social psychology, which he labelled symbolic interactionism. Blumer elaborated and developed this line of thought in a series of articles, many of which were brought together in the book Symbolic Interactionism. An ongoing theme throughout his work, he argued that the creation of social reality is a continuous process. Blumer was also a vociferous critic of positivistic methodological ideas in sociology. Personal history Blumer was born March 7, 1900 in St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up in Webster Groves, Missouri, with his parents. He moved to Webster Groves with his family in 1905 onto a farm, but his father commuted to St. Louis every day to run a cabinet-making business. Blumer attended Webster Groves High School and later the University of Missouri from 1918 to 1922. Herbert Blumer was constantly being grounded in the world of economics and labor, insofar as having to drop out of high school to help his father's woodworking shop. Moreover, during the summer, Blumer worked as a roustabout to pay for his college education. While studying undergraduate at the University of Missouri, Blumer was fortunate enough to work with Charles Ellwood, a sociologist, and Max Meyer, a psychologist. Upon graduating, Blumer secured a teaching position at the University of Missouri. Then, in 1925, he relocated to the University of Chicago, a university where he was greatly influenced by the social psychologist George Herbert Mead and sociologists W. I. Thomas and Robert Park. Upon completing his doctorate in 1928, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Chicago, where he continued his own research under Mead and became captivated with the prospects of examining the interactions between humans and the world. Blumer taught at this institution from 1927‚Äì1952.Mann, Douglass. Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Oxford University Press. 2008 Blumer was the secretary treasurer of the American Sociological Association from 1930‚Äì1935 and was the editor of the American Journal of Sociology from 1941‚Äì1952. In 1952, he moved from the University of Chicago and presided and developed the newly formed Sociology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. During World War II, he had a role as an arbitrator for the national steel industry. Blumer was appointed the first chair of the Department of Sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, a post he held until he retired in 1967. In 1952, he became the president of the American Sociological Association and he received the association's award for a Career of Distinguished Scholarship in 1983. Blumer served as the 46th president of the American Sociological Association and his Presidential Address was his paper \\"Sociological Analysis and the 'Variable'\\". With Emeritus Professor status until 1986, Blumer continued to be actively engaged in writing and research until shortly before his death on April 13, 1987. =Professional football career= During much of the period that Blumer was at the University of Chicago from, 1925 through 1933, including all of the years that he was completing his doctorate,Cf. Herbert Blumer, 1928, Method in Social Psychology, Ph. D. Dissertation, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Chicago. Blumer played football professionally for the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), a team in the American Professional Football Association which would later become the NFL. Blumer played as an end, guard and a series of other positions. During his first year of his doctorate, he also scored two touchdowns for the Cardinals. During that season, the Cardinals won the league championship‚Äîalthough that victory remains controversial due to the disqualification of the Pottsville Maroons, a team with a better record. Blumer was selected to the 1929 All-Pro Team. Intellectual contributionsSymbolic interactionism= Although Blumer devised the term symbolic interaction in 1937, the early development of this theoretical approach to social analysis is largely credited to the work of George Herbert Mead during his time at the University of Chicago. Blumer played a key role in keeping the tradition of symbolic interactionism alive by incorporating it into his teachings at the University. He presented his articles on symbolic interactionism in a single volume in which he conceptualized symbolic interaction into three main points: *Humans act towards things (including other individuals) on the basis of the meanings they have for them. **There is a particular emphasis on the consciousness of actors as they interpret their actions. **It is important to recognize that the meaning or value of an object to one person may differ with another person- sociologists should not reduce human action to social rules and norms. **Blumer stresses this point because of the fear that our subjective meaning of our actions could be overshadowed by the norms and rules of society *The meaning of things arises out of the social interactions one has with one's fellows. **The meaning of something is a social product, therefore it is not inherent in things. *Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process a person uses in dealing with the things he or she encounters. **Meanings are seen as a series of interpretive actions by the actor. **The actor gives objects meanings, act accordingly based on these meanings, and then revises the meanings to guide his future action. **The actor has an internal conversation with himself to determine the meanings, especially when encountering something out of the ordinary. Blumer believed that what creates society itself is people engaging in social interaction. It follows then that social reality only exists in the context of the human experience. His theory of symbolic interaction, some argue, is thus closer to a theoretical framework (based on the significance of meanings and the interaction between individuals) than an applicable theory. According to Blumer's theory, interaction between individuals is based on autonomous action, which in turn is based on the subjective meaning actors attribute to social objects and/or symbols. Thus individual actors regulate their behavior based on the meaning they attribute to objects and symbols in their relevant situation. Blumer theorized that assigning objects meaning is an ongoing, two-fold process. First, is the identification of the objects that have situational meaning. Second, is the process of internal communication to decide which meaningful object to respond to. Acknowledging that others are equally autonomous, individuals use their subjectively derived interpretations of others (as social objects) to predict the outcome of certain behaviors, and use such predictive insight to make decisions about their own behavior in the hopes of reaching their goal. Thus, when there is consensus among individual actors about the meaning of the objects that make up their situation, social coordination ensues. Social structures are determined as much by the action of individual actors as they determine the action of those individuals. Based on this, Blumer believed that society exists only as a set of potentials, or ideas that people could possibly use in the future.Allan, Kenneth. Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World. Pine Forge Press. 2005 This complex interaction between meanings, objects, and behaviors, Blumer reiterated, is a uniquely human process because it requires behavioral responses based on the interpretation of symbols, rather than behavioral responses based on environmental stimuli. As social life is a \\"fluid and negotiated process,\\" to understand each other, humans must intrinsically engage in symbolic interaction. Blumer criticized the contemporary social science of his day because instead of using symbolic interactionism they made false conclusions about humans by reducing human decisions to social pressures like social positions and roles. Blumer was more invested in psychical interactionism that holds that the meanings of symbols are not universal, but are rather subjective and are \\"attached\\" to the symbols and the receiver depending on how they choose to interpret them. =Blumer's 3 types of objects= The importance of thinking to symbolic interactionists is shown through their views on objects. Blumer defined objects as the things \\"out there\\" in the world. The significance of objects is how they are defined by the actor. In other words, different objects have different meanings depending on the individual. *Physical (a chair, a tree) *Social (student, mother, friend) *Abstract (ideas or moral principals) =Summary principles of symbolic interactionism= *Human beings are capable of thought. *This capacity for thought is shaped by social interaction. *We learn the meanings and the symbols through social interaction, exercising the human capacity for thought. *These meanings and symbols provide the basis for distinctive human action and interaction. *Modification of meanings and symbols occur through the interpretation of situations. *Humans' capability of modification is due to their ability to interact with themselves. *The intertwining of interaction and action make up groups and societies. Methodological contributions to sociology According to Herbert Blumer, the most valid and desirable social research is conducted through qualitative, ethnographic methodology. He persistently critiqued the idea that the only form of valid knowledge is derived through a totally objective perspective. Blumer believed that theoretical and methodological approaches to studying human behavior must acknowledge human beings as thinking, acting, and interacting individuals and also must employ that represent the humanly known, socially created, and experienced world. As this directly challenges the thought process of traditional, positivism-based approach to sociological method, much controversy surrounds Blumer's sociological approach to empirical research. Blumer believed that when positivistic methods were applied to social research, they created results that were ignorant to the empirical realities of the social world. Because people act towards the world based on the subjective meanings they attribute to different objects (symbolic interactionism), individuals construct worlds that are inherently subjective. Therefore, \\"objective\\" analysis is intrinsically subjugated to the researcher's own social reality, only documents the researchers own personal assumptions about social interaction, and ultimately yields biased findings. For a researcher to truly understand sociological phenomena, Blumer asserted, they must understand their subject's subjective interpretations of reality. Following this logic, Blumer discounted social research that blindly applies methods that have been traditionally used in the natural sciences. Such quantitative, objective analysis, he argued, does not acknowledge the difference between humans and animals ‚Äì specifically the difference in cognitive ability to consciously entertain opinions and to apply meanings to objects, both which enables humans to take an active role in shaping their world. Because society is composed of interactions between individuals or \\"joint actions/transactions\\",Blumer explains social interaction as a mutual presentation of actions by actors. He classifies social interactions into two categories, i.e., \\"symbolic interaction\\" and \\"non-symbolic interaction.\\" The former is mediated by self-interaction, the latter is not. It has been thought that symbolic interaction is the equivalent of \\"the use of significant symbols,\\" in Mead's terminology, and that non-symbolic interaction is the equivalent of Mead's \\"conversation of gestures.\\" However, the greater precision of Kuwabara's analysis demonstrates the existence of at least two types of symbolic interaction, distinctly different from each other: symbolic interaction in which significant symbols do not yet exist but participants in the interaction are trying to call them into being, and symbolic interaction mediated by significant symbols called into being by participants in a preceding interaction. The latter is called \\"a real form of interaction\\" or transaction/joint action. Cf. Kuwabara T., and K. Yamaguchi, 2013, An Introduction to the Sociological Perspective of Symbolic Interactionism, The Joint Journal of the National Universities in Kyushu, Education and Humanities, 1(1), pp. 1‚Äì11. the only empirical reality is that which stems from human interaction. Therefore, contextual understanding of human action is intrinsic to valid social research. Thus Blumer advocated for sociological research that sympathetically and subjectively incorporates the viewpoints of the subject, therefore pushing for a micro-sociological approach. Concluding that there is little validity in research that attempted to understand the social world objectively, Blumer felt that objective interpretations of society are intrinsically bias to the researchers social location and thus have little empirical value. To truthfully uncover the social realities of individuals different from one's self, an observer must be mindful of their framework and be open to different understanding of social reality. =Macrostructures and microstructures= Blumer believed that society is not made up of macrostructures, but rather that the essence of society is found in microstructures, specifically in actors and their actions. These microstructures are not isolated, but consist of the collective action of combination, giving rise to the concept of joint action. Joint action is not just the sum of individual actions, but takes on a character of its own. Blumer did not reject the idea of macrostructures, but instead focused on the concept of emergence-our larger social structures emerge from the smaller. Blumer admitted that macrostructures are important, but that they have an extremely limited role in symbolic interactionism. Therefore, he argued that macrostructures are a little more than \\"frameworks\\" within which the really important aspects of social life (action and interaction) take place. Moreover, according to Blumer, macrostructures are important because they shape the situations in which individuals act and supply to actors a certain set of symbols that allow them to act. Also, he did not deny systems such as culture and social order. In sum, Blumer said that large scale structures are the frameworks for what is crucial in society, action and interaction. He is not denying that social structures influence our actions, just that they do not determine our actions. =Techniques Blumer advocated= *Direct observation of social life *Interviewing and listening to people's conversations *Listening to the radio and watching television *Reading newspapers *Reading diaries, letters, and other written life histories *Reading public records *Finding well-informed participants =Sociological analysis and the \\"variable\\"= In 1952, Herbert Blumer became President of the American Sociological Association and his Presidential Address was his paper \\"Sociological Analysis and the 'Variable'. In this paper, Blumer addresses the shortcomings with variable analysis that he sees in social research. Herbert Blumer says \\"there is a conspicuous absence of rules, guides, limitations and prohibitions to govern the choice of variables.\\" Overall, he felt that variable analysis needed to be looked at more carefully and precisely to see if the variables are correct and connected to the social research at hand. Generic variables Blumer does not find generic: * The frequent variable that stands for a class of object that is tied down to a given historical and cultural situation. * Abstract sociological categories. Example- \\"social integration\\" * Special set of class terms. Examples- \\"Age, time, authority\\" Blumer believed these shortcomings are serious but not crucial, and that with increased experience they can be overcome. This address was meant to question how well variable analysis is suited to the study of human group life in its fuller dimensions. =Blumer's criticisms of Thomas and Znaniecki= In 1939, Blumer published Critiques of Research in the Social Sciences: An Appraisal of Thomas and Znaniecki's The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, criticizing what at the time was a popular social theory. Blumer claimed that Thomas and Znaniecki failed to properly distinguish between attitude as subjective and value as a societal collective element. He said they used the terms interchangeably, and therefore making the theory unreliable. It is difficult to disentangle subjective factors and objective correlates because the objective world is dealt with only to the extent that it enters subjective experiences. Blumer said, In conclusion, Blumer recognized that in society there was no clear distinction between attitude and value, and that even social theorists have difficulty distinguishing between the two. =Collective behavior= Based on the work of Robert E. Park, Blumer, in a 1939 article, called to attention a new subfield of sociology: collective behavior. This now developed area of inquiry is devoted to the exploration of collective action and behavior that is not yet organized under an institutional structure or formation. Blumer was particularly interested in the spontaneous collective coordination that occurs when something that is unpredicted disrupt standardized group behavior. He saw the combination of events that follows such phenomena as a key factor in society's ongoing transformation. Relationship with George Herbert Mead Blumer is well known for his connection with George Herbert Mead. Blumer was a follower of Mead's social- psychological work on the relationship between self and society, and Mead heavily influenced Blumer's development of Symbolic Interactionism. Mead transferred the subject field of social psychology to Blumer's sociology. One important aspect Blumer learned from Mead was that in order for us to understand the meaning of social actions, we must put ourselves in others' shoes to truly understand what social symbols they feel to be important. However, Blumer also deviated from Mead's work. Blumer was a proponent of a more micro-focused approach to sociology and focused on the subjective consciousness and symbolic meanings of individuals. Influence of Charles Ellwood Similar to George Mead, sociologist Charles Ellwood also influenced the development of Herbert Blumer and symbolic interactionism. There are four prominent areas where Ellwood's ideas can be found in both Blumer's work and symbolic interactionism: interactionism, methodology, emotions, and group behavior. The concepts of \\"interstimulation and response,\\" \\"intercommunication,\\" and \\"coadaptation\\" function in Ellwood's social psychology in the same way that \\"self-indications\\" and \\"interpretations\\" that are found in Blumer's symbolic interactionism. There are six areas where Ellwood and Blumer are similar when addressing methodology: studying human behavior in context, a disdain for the physical science method, understanding the people being studied, using sociology to assist humanity, using inductive reasoning, and avoiding hypotheses. Looking at their ideas on emotion, both Ellwood's and Blumer's ideas deal with the relationship between emotion and interaction, with Ellwood stating, all our social life and social behavior are not only embedded in feeling, but largely guided and controlled by feeling.\\" Similar to that, Blumer states that feeling is intrinsic to every social attitude.\\" Both Ellwood and Blumer were social nominalists and positioned that reality is reduced to properties of individuals and their interrelations. Scholarly critiques of Blumer Many have argued that Blumer's theory is a simplified and distorted version of Mead's. Many contemporary positions see \\"Blumerian interactionism\\" as \\"old hat,\\" because it is gender blind (as argued by feminists) and is too conservative. It is also contested that symbolic interaction needs to adopt an agenda that takes race, class and gender into consideration more. Moreover, it is argued that the social constructionist perspective of Blumerian interactionism provides an \\"over-socialized\\" account of human life, and downplays and ignores our unconscious. =Theory of symbolic interaction= * Too subjective *Too much emphasis on day-to-day life and the social formation of the individual while ignoring social structure. * Symbolic interactionism deflects attention away from the impact social structures (like the state, culture, and the economy) have on individual behavior *Tended to ignore class relations and the restraints brought about by differing social classes. =Perspective of empirical research= * Methodological contributions are hard to implement in practice * Since Blumer rejected the behaviorist approach to the study of meaning, societal research within a symbolic interactionist framework poses empirical challenges Quotes *\\"The full expanse of human action isn't just following pre- established rules and patterns. New situations arise constantly.\\" *\\"Repetitive and standard actions are just as much the product of an interpretative process as are the ones based on creative thinking. It's social action that upholds the rules, not the rules which uphold the social action.\\" *\\"New joint action always arise out of a background of previous actions. We can't slice off a given action from its historical linkages.\\" *\\"The nature of an object...consists of the meaning that it has for the person for whom it is as object.\\"Ritzer, George. Sociological Theory. McGraw-Hill. 2011. *Concerning the term self, \\"Nothing esoteric is meant by this expression. It merely means that a human being can be an object of his own action...he acts towards himself and guides himself in his actions towards others on the basis of the kind of object he is to himself.\\" *\\"It is the social process in group life that creates and upholds the rules, not the rules that create and uphold group life.\\" *\\"A network or an institution does not function automatically because of some inner dynamics or system requirements; it functions because people at different points do something, and what they do is a result of how they define the situation in which they are called on to act.\\" Selected works *Movies, Delinquency, and Crime (1933) *Movies and Conduct. New York, Macmillan and Company (1933) One of Blumer's best-known studies, \\"Movies and Conduct\\" (1933), was part of the Payne Fund research project. The project, which included more than 18 social scientists who produced eleven published reports, was initiated out of fear about the effect movies might have on children and young adults. Blumer thus conducted an ethnographic, qualitative study on more than fifteen hundred college and high school students by asking them to write autobiographies of their movie-going experiences. His findings were that children and young adult spectators reported that they learned from movies life skills such as attitudes, hairstyles, how to kiss, and even how to pickpocket. *The Human Side of Social Planning (1935) *\\"Social Psychology,\\" in Man and Society: A Substantive Introduction to the Social Science, by Emerson Peter Schmidt (ed.).

It was chaired by the Procurator General, who served as the link between the sovereign and the Senate; he acted, in the emperor's own words, as \\"the sovereign's eye\\". Originally established only for the time of Peter's absence, it became a permanent body after his return. The number of senators was first set at nine and, in 1712, increased to ten. Any disagreements between the Chief Procurator and the Senate were to be settled by the monarch. Certain other officials and a chancellery were also attached to the Senate. While it underwent many subsequent changes, it became one of the most important institutions of imperial Russia, especially for administration and law. The State Council, created by Alexander I, was supposed to inherit the executive power of the Senate. An envisioned parliament was to inherit legislative power, but that never happened. In the 19th century, the Senate evolved into the highest judicial body in Russia. As such, it exercised control over all legal institutions and officials throughout the country. The Senate was composed of several departments, two of which were Courts of Cassation (one for criminal cases, one for civil cases). It also included a Department of Heraldry, which managed matters relating to the rights of the nobles and honorary citizens.

ACM Vol 19, No. 5, May 1976 provided a method for controlling access to data which is still used today. Detecting intruders is key to protecting computer systems. While at SRI International Dorothy Denning and Peter G. Neumann developed an intrusion detection system (IDS) model using statistics for anomaly detection that is still the basis for intrusion detection systems today. SRI's Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES)Denning D. and Neumann, P. \\"Requirements and Model for IDES- A Real-Time Intrusion- Detection Expert System, Final Report, SRI International, Aug. 1985 ran on Sun workstations and considered both user and network level data. It combined a rule-based Expert System to detect known types of intrusions with a statistical anomaly-detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. (An artificial neural network was proposed as a third component; All three components would then report to a resolver). SRI followed IDES in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).Excerpted from Intrusion detection The Multics Intrusion Detection and Alerting System (MIDAS), which protected NSA's Dockmaster System from 1998‚Äì2001, is an example of a fielded expert-system-based IDS.Tsirka, Maria, IDS portal, 12 May 2016 Denning improved data security via encryption technology.

She was criticized when she found positive things to say about their actions and wrote a 1995 postscript. Denning was widely criticized for her role in NSA's controversial Clipper Chip initiative to give the government authorized access to encrypted private communications through a key escrow system. At the government's request Denning privately reviewed the classified Skipjack block cipher, and testified in Congress that general publication of the algorithm would enable someone to build a hardware or software product that used SKIPJACK without escrowing keys. In public forums, such as the Usenet forum comp.risks, she defended the Clipper chip and other approaches to key escrow that offered strong security while enabling law enforcement to decrypt without a warrant. However, she did not advocate making key escrow mandatory. Eventually, Clipper was dropped and Skipjack was declassified and published.

Sonneck, Report on \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\", \\"Hail Columbia\\", \\"America\\", \\"Yankee Doodle\\" (Minerva, 2001), p. 116. Origins and meaning Historically, the term \\"pocket\\" referred to a pouch worn around the waist by women in the 17th to 19th centuries. Skirts or dresses of the time had a slit at the waistline to allow access to the pocket which hung around the woman's waist by a ribbon or something similar. The rhyme was first recorded by James Orchard Halliwell in 1842, but there is evidence that it was popular in Britain and America at least in the early nineteenth century. Various persons have been identified with Lucy Locket and Kitty Fisher. Halliwell suggested that they were \\"two celebrated courtesans of the time of Charles II\\", but no supportive evidence has been found. The name Lucy Locket was used by John Gay in Beggar's Opera (1728), but may have already been proverbial. Kitty Fisher may have been Catherine Marie Fischer (d. 1767) a British courtesan who was the subject of three unfinished portraits by Joshua Reynolds and a number of songs, including an air recorded in Thompson's Country Dances (1760).D.

Origins He was the eldest son and heir of Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford (1176-1220) by his wife Maud de Mandeville (alias Maud FitzGeoffrey), daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex. Career He was one of the nine godfathers of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I of England. He served as Sheriff of Kent for 1239‚Äì40. In 1258 after returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal cause to that of the barons. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the \\"committee of twenty-four\\" which was appointed in the Oxford Parliament of that year, to create the Provisions of Oxford to reform the administration. The alliance of Simon de Montfort with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of North Wales brought Bohun back to royal allegiance. He headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the party of the opposition (1263), and was amongst the captives whom the Montfortians took at the Battle of Lewes in 1264. He was amongst the victors at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, which extinguished the power of de Montfort, at which however his eldest son Humphrey V de Bohun was mortally wounded. Humphrey was selected as one of the twelve arbitrators to draw up the Dictum of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited rebels were allowed to make their peace. Marriages and issue He married twice: *Firstly in about 1236 to Maud de Lusignan (c.1210 ‚Äì 14 August 1241), daughter of Raoul I of Lusignan, Comte d'Eu, second husband of Alix d'Eu, 8th Comtesse d'Eu.

The Black Book of Communism, a book edited by Courtois, has been translated into numerous languages, sold million of copies, and is considered one of the most influential, although one of the most controversial books written about communism.Ronald Grigir Suny.

History and Theory, Vol. 42, No. 2 (May, 2003), pp. 222-245 In the first chapter of the book, Courtois argued that Communism and Nazism are similar totalitarian systems and that Communism was responsible for the murder of around 100 million people in the 20th century. Courtois is a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, in the G√©ode (group of study and observation of democracy) at Paris West University Nanterre La D√©fense as well as a Professor at the Catholic Institute of Higher Studies ‚Äì ICES. He is editor of the journal Communisme, which he cofounded with Annie Kriegel in 1982, and part of the Cercle de l'Oratoire think tank. As a student, from 1968 to 1971, Courtois was a Maoist, but he later became a strong supporter of democracy, pluralism, human rights, and the rule of law.Christophe Bourseiller, Les Mao√Østes. La folle histoire des gardes rouges fran√ßais, Paris, Plon, 1996, p. 277. Maoist activism (1968‚Äì1971) He was an activist in the Maoist Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organization Vive communism from 1968 to 1971, which changed its name in 1969 to Vive la Revolution with Roland Castro. At this time he directed the organisation's bookstore at rue Geoffroy-Saint- Hilaire in Paris. He describes himself as having been \\"anarcho-Maoist,\\" but many \\"repented\\" of the extreme left and later became supporters of democracy and multi-party democracy and often anti-communists.Christophe Bourseiller, The Maoists. The mad history of the French Red Guards, Paris, Plon, 1996, p. 277 (Fr). =Communist Party at war and Communisme journal= Having taken legal studies and history, he became known in 1980 with the publication of his thesis, the PCF at war under the direction of Annie Kriegel. It was with her that he founded in 1982 the journal Communisme to bring together anticommunist specialists on French communism. After the death of Kriegel, he became the main organiser of the magazine. He was appointed Director of Research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), where he was responsible for the \\"Group observations and studies of democracy\\" (GEODE). That period at Communisme was seen as an extremely rich period for research of all kinds, the crucible of important work published in the 1980s.Bruno Groppo and Bernard Pudal, article Three issues under debate in the Century of Communism, ed. de l'Atelier, 2000, paperback Points-Seuil, 2004, p. 107-108 (Fr) =Visits to archives of the Comintern in Moscow (1992‚Äì1994)= Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and of the \\"Iron Curtain\\", the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991 following the communist regimes in the countries of Eastern Europe, the archives of the Comintern were opened not only to Russian historians but also to western researchers. The opening represented an opportunity for him to access unpublished sources to rewrite the history of communism, which, until then, had been impregnated by the propaganda of Soviet-style regimes, countered only by unverifiable assertions of their opponents. Courtois described the historiographical turning point as a \\"true revolution in documentation\\".¬´ Chapter 20. - \\"History of Communism: the documentation revolution\\" in Communism and Totalitarianism, St√©phane Courtois, Perrin, Paris, 2009, p. 401 For example, a historical study of the PCF had been made for decades not on genuine archival documents but on the basis of stories, such as memoirs published by PCF members, including Jacques Duclos, because the original PCF records were kept not at party headquarters in Paris, but in Moscow, in accordance with the central clauses governing their admission to the Comintern (conditions of admission to the Third International). In 2006, Courtois wrote a book entitled Communism in France: The revolution in documentation and revised historiography. He made his first visit to the archives of the Comintern in Moscow in September 1992. Later he made three more visits, the last in December 1994. In 2009, at a conference, St√©phane Courtois said: \\"I did not go to promote The Black Book of Communism in Russia.... In any case, I do not go back again for quite some time.... I quickly became aware that I was under constant surveillance in the archives\\". Courtois gleaned some spectacular information from the archives and in deliberately provoking controversy, which led in the eyes of some at the Communisme journal to a divisive position with the complementary scientific researches there. Since 1993, a large part of the editorial board of Communisme left the journal. =Orientation of works after publication of The Black Book= If the historiographic production of Courtois before 1995 mainly concerned the PCF, afterward, it focused more on the Comintern and the history of communist regimes in Eastern Europe. In the Black Book, he was concerned with the criminal aspects of the actions of the Comintern. In his book on Eugen Fried, which he cowrote with Annie Kriegel in 1997, the emphasis was more on the control by the Comintern on the national communist parties and the mass anti-fascist organizations such as Amsterdam-Pleyel, Secours Rouge, and the Universal Gathering for peace. In the foreword of Eugen Fried, he indicated that the project initiated in 1984‚Äì1985 had to be suspended in 1991 when the archives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were transferred to the State Archives of the Republic of Russia. \\"In 1992, Annie Kriegel and St√©phane Courtois were there in Moscow. They made several trips to the Russian capital and brought back thousands of pages on microfilm....\\"Annie Kriegel and St√©phane Courtois, Eugen Fried, Le Seuil, 1997, p. 7 In a communication to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, Courtois defended the thesis that Stalin was perfectly representative of the Soviet regime introduced in the 1917 Revolution led by Lenin: \\"The fact remains that in the foundation phase of the system, from 1917 to 1953, it was the ideology that dictated the conduct of Lenin and then of Stalin.... Stalin was an authentic Bolshevik ‚Äî pupil of the school of Leninism.... Stalin was not the obscure apparatchik described by Trotsky, but one of the direct collaborators of Lenin and among the most appreciated for his unwavering support of the leader, his sense of discipline, his composure and exceptional firmness of character, his determination, and his total lack of scruples or compassion in his actions\\".St√©phane Courtois, How to understand Stalin, conference of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, 24 Febnruary 2003 After the publication of Eugen Fried, Courtois led many joint editorial projects, such as A clean sweep From the past! History and Memory of Communism in Europe (2002), which came at the end of the Black Book of Communism and provided additions to the book, mostly written by foreign authors, and the Dictionary of Communism (2007). In 2008, he contributed to the Black Book of the French Revolution, in a chapter devoted to the relationship between Jacobinism and Bolshevism. In 2009, he returned again to the question of communism with the book Communism and totalitarianism, which was a collection of a series of his articles on the subject. He has also expanded his work to include all totalitarian regimes. He organises many international conferences on this theme and maintains a collection of the √âditions du Seuil and the √âditions du Rocher. Major worksMethodological influences= Alumnus of Kriegel, Courtois said that his book Communism and Totalitarianism (2009) is built on the model of several books by her, including The Bread and the Roses: foundations for a history of socialism (1968) and French communism in the mirror (1974). The methodology, developed by her and adopted by him, consisted of an accumulation of stages of thought of the researcher in the form of texts that are grouped by topic and published regularly. Taking up the concept of a \\"history workshop \\"developed by the historian Fran√ßois Furet, in his eponymous book published in 1982, St√©phane Courtois said that \\"the serious historian is an artisan who constantly works on the job, because he is dependent on sources, archives, etc.... And of course, these sources, archives, they are constantly changing. Thus, the evolution of this process permits a construction of a united vision more comprehensive and nuanced than at the start. =The Journal Communisme (1982‚Äì)The Black Book of Communism (1997)= After many contributions and publications on various aspects of communism, both in France and internationally, Courtois participated in the Black Book of Communism, a project published in November 1997, where he was the coordinator and wrote the preface. Also participating in this work were Nicolas Werth (professor of history and a researcher at the Institute of Modern History (IHTP) where he specialises in the Soviet Union), Jean-Louis Pann√© (historian and editor at Gallimard, also the author of a biography of Boris Souvarine), Karel Bartosek (researcher at CNRS and editor of the journal New Alternative), Andrzej Paczkowski (Professor of Political Science and member of the board of the archives for the Ministry of Interior). Courtois himself was the co-author of an article on the Comintern. =Content= The book takes stock of the crimes committed by the various forms of power exercised by communism. The introduction by Courtois is entitled \\"The Crimes of Communism\\", which was responsible for the deaths of nearly 100 million human beings.The Black Book of Communism. Crimes, Terror, Repression (dir.), Robert Laffont, Paris, 1998, p. 8. \\"The crimes of communism have not been subject to a legitimate and normal assessment from a historical or a moral point of view. Without doubt this is here one of the first times that we try an approach to communism in questioning whether its criminality is both central and global to its existence\\".St√©phene Courtois, The Crimes of Communism in The Black Book of Communism, Robert Laffont, 1997, p. 13 The book is part of an essentialist vision of communism developed by Ernst Nolte that it would have as its essence a general criminal nature.Serge Wolikow, article Three issues under debate in The Century of Communism, √©d. de l'Atelier, 2000, paperback Points-Seuil, 2004, pp. 710‚Äì711 (Fr) =Controversy over number of victims= One of the contributors to the Black Book, Nicolas Werth criticised Courtois for having, in his preface, the figure of 20 million economic or political victims of socialism in the USSR while they did not number more than 15 million victims. Another contributor, Jean-Louis Margolin noted that he had never talked about 1 million deaths in Vietnam contrary to what was claimed by Courtois in his text. How to calculate in an unbiased fashion the numbers of disparate victims who died in civil wars, economic crises or even common criminals on five continents by various regimes for more than 70 years, was also discussed. The authors of the Century of Communism (2000), led by Claude Pennetier, challenged the uniqueness of communism underpinned by the Black Book \\"If it is a presupposition that this book would definitely wish to call in question, as well as prejudice, it contains some truth. It is the uniqueness of what is called the \\"communism of the 20th century. From \\"Past of an Illusion,This is the book by Fran√ßois Furet \\"Crimes of Communism,This is the introduction by Courtois in the Livre noir the first error is the non- critical use of a single article and will consequently reduce Communism to \\"one\\" fundamental property.First paragraph of the Introduction to The Century of Communism, 2000 \\"The authors of this book did not have much in common with the Hungary of J√°nos K√°d√°r and the Cambodia of Pol Pot. =Controversy on comparison with Nazism= It is less the number of deaths caused by dictatorships who claim to be communist as the comparison with Nazism that has caused controversy in France, which has very similar terms to the famous \\"quarrel of historians\\" who tied up Germany in the mid-1980s because of an article by Ernst Nolte.Ernst Nolte, A past that does not happen, published in 1986 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published in France in the collection of texts Fascism & Totalitarianism, Robert Laffont, et al. \\"Mouthpieces\\" texts compiled by St√©phane Courtois. Some writers and commentators were surprised that Courtois made the comparison with Nazism a theme of part of the preface, when no contributions referred to the question. Courtois raised the comparison between Nazism and Communism as an issue to be dealt with by historians and called for the establishment of an equivalent of the Nuremberg tribunal to try those Communists responsible. He compared the organisation of the two movements, and the number of victims attributed to communism to the number of deaths from Nazism. He draws a parallel between Nazi \\"race genocide\\" and what he calls, following Ernst Nolte, \\"class genocide\\".Fascism & Totalitarianism, pp. 14‚Äì15 For its supporters, Communism was a humanist and egalitarian ideology unlike Nazism and many historians, starting with some authors of the book, expressed their disagreement with Courtois. In particular, Nicolas Werth said that \\"the more you compare communism and Nazism, the more obvious are the differences\\".Le Monde, 21 September 2000. According to Annette Wieviorka, director of research at CNRS, \\"St√©phane Courtois shows the comparison between the acute awareness of the Jewish genocide and that of Communism which is a tissue of falsehoods and approximations\\", highlightened that the Holocaust was not to become a privileged object of historical research until the 1970s and imposed itself on the collective memory only in the 1980s. He also cites Fran√ßois Furet, who would have written the foreword had he not died prematurely, who said that the Genocide of Jews had \\"the awful distinction of being an end in itself\\".Annette Wieviorka, Le Monde of 27 November 1997 Despite repeated denials of a conflict of interest, some saw this comparison as assimilation pure and simple and as such have seen fit to denounce it. The journalist Beno√Æt Rayski accused some intellectuals, including St√©phane Courtois, Alain Besan√ßon, Ernst Nolte and Jean-Fran√ßois Revel, of wanting to confound the West about the issue of Nazism to promote their own anticommunism.Benedict Rayski, The Jewish child and the Ukrainian child. Reflections on blasphemy. See also the report of Dominique Vidal, \\"The Jewish child and the Ukrainian child. Reflections on a blasphemy, Le Monde Diplomatique, February 2002 Main thesesHistoriographical influences= Courtois's works, especially The Black Book of Communism, were a continuation of the \\"turn\\" in historiography begun in 1995 with the publication of the essay by the excommunist activist historian and member of the Communist Party from 1947 to 1959, Fran√ßois Furet dealing with the \\"communist illusion\\" and entitled The Past of an Illusion. Essay on the Communistidea in the 20th century.One day in History - One extra long night: The climax of the totalitarian regimes of Europe, 1935-1953, St√©phane Courtois and Christophe Dick√®s, Canal Acad√©mie, 1 January 2005, Furet had also agreed to write the preface to the Black Book of Communism but he died in July 1997.audio recording of the Conference on The Black Book of the French Revolution in Paris Thursday, 24 January 2008 , =\\"Communism is a form of totalitarianism\\"= For Courtois, communism is a form of totalitarianism, and the same for Italian fascism and German Nazism. In that sense, he opposed Hannah Arendt and George L. Mosse. The first matches the birth of totalitarianism in Russia with the rise of Stalin (not Lenin); from there, it reduced to communist totalitarianism in a very short time to \\"Stalinism\\". Historiography based on this theory from Hannah Arendt, designed in the 1950s, is, according to Courtois, the mainstream in the teaching of the totalitarian phenomenon in France in the 21st century but Courtois says \\"campaign\\" against the historiographic orientation in which he opposes the idea of a totalitarian communism whose beginnings are the publication of What to do? by Lenin in 1902. This thesis is outlined in his publication Communism and totalitarianism (Perrin, 2009) which dealt with the subject chronologically (thematic in the last installment) in a four-part series of discussions dedicated to the totalitarian regimes in Europe: *When night falls: Origins and emergence of totalitarian regimes in Europe (1900-1934) (L'Age d'Homme, 2001) *Such a long night: The peak of the totalitarian regimes in Europe (1935-1953) (Editions du Rocher, 2003) *The day rises: Legacy of totalitarianism in Europe (1953-2005) (Editions du Rocher, 2003) *The totalitarian logic in Europe (Editions du Rocher, 2006). =\\"Lenin was the inventor of totalitarianism\\"= Courtois mainly described this thesis in his biography: Lenin, the inventor of totalitarianism (Perrin, 2007). It is included in a chapter on Communism and totalitarianism (Perrin, 2009). =\\"Glorious memory\\" and \\"tragic memory\\" of communism in Europe= According to Courtois, there is a clear dichotomy in the history of communism between a \\"positive memory\\" of communism in Western Europe (France, Italy, Spain, etc..) and a \\"tragic memory\\" in Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, the Baltic States, etc.). This theory was developed in the book that followed the Black Book of Communism and is entitled Make a clean sweep of the past! History and Memories of Communism in Europe (2002).Make a clean sweep of the past! History and memories of communism in Europe, St√©phane Courtois, Perrin, Tempus collection, Paris, 2002, In France, the \\"positive memory\\" would be echoed in the social conquests of the Popular Front, the participation of the communists in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, the resistance to the German occupation during World War II, and the Soviet victory over Nazism, which Courtois called \\"the universal appeal of Stalingrad\\" (the Soviet victory at Stalingrad marked the \\"turning point of the war\\" in favour of the Allies). He took here the concept coined by Furet the \\"Universal appeal of October\\" in reference to the acclaim around the October Revolution. To oppose this was a \\"tragic memory\\", which, in Poland, comes from its annexation after the Nazi-Soviet pact and the Katyn massacre, in the Baltic countries, from annexations by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1990, and in Romania, from annexation by the Soviet Union of the regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and the establishment of a long dictatorship (45 years). According to the historical Commissions report in 1991 on Roumania, nearly two million people were killed and nearly 300,000 people were deported to labour camps either within Romania itself, or to Siberia or Kazakhstan.For Romania: Raportul Comisiei Preziden≈£iale pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din Rom√¢nia (Report of the Presidential Commission for the Analysis of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania) Raportul Comisiei Preziden≈£iale pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din Rom√¢nia and Traian BƒÉsescu: condemned explicit ≈üi Categoric sistemul comunist din Rom√¢nia ; see also Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova: Raportul Comisiei pentru studierea ≈üi bilan≈£ul regimului din Republica Moldova comunist (Report of the Commission for the study and assessment of the communist regime in the Republic of Moldova) on This deep trauma resulted in Romania, by the creation in 1993 at Sighet, a prison used by the Romanian communist regime, a place of memory (research institute, library, museum and summer university) unique of its kind: the \\"Memorial to the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance\\" (Memorial to the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance) (Memorialul Victimelor Comunismului ≈üi al Rezisten≈£ei).

In 2006, in the magazine Brave New World, he published an article Famine in Ukraine (Holodomor): you said \\"denial\\"? (republished on the website of the historical journal ArkheiaFamine in Ukraine (Holodomor): you said \\"denial?, St√©phane Courtois, Arkheia, www.arkheia- revue.org) in which he publicly accused the French historian and militant communist, Annie Lacroix-Riz of denying the Holodomor in Ukraine in 1932‚Äì1933. The famine was reported in the Western world in 1933 by Welsh journalist Gareth Jones and in 1935 by Boris Souvarine, and many years later by Alexander Solzhenitsyn in 1973 in The Gulag Archipelago. However, after a carefully sanitized in the summer of 1933 by Prime Minister of France √âdouard Herriot, the latter declared there to be no famine. The great famine was confirmed by the opening of Soviet archives in the early 1990s. According to him, Annie Lacroix-Rice tried to downplay the event as one of \\"scarcity\\" a famine in which several million people died.Famine in Ukraine (Holodomor): you said \\"denial\\"?, St√©phane Courtois, Brave New World No. 1, Paris, Den√´ol, 2006. This article was issued in response to the creation by Annie Lacroix-Riz, of \\"a website to appeal to his colleagues to mobilize against an unspeakable lie that ran the world for seventy years: No, ladies and gentlemen, there was no famine in Ukraine in 1932-1933, much less a famine that would have caused millions of deaths, and especially not a famine organized by the Soviet regime itself\\". Subsequently, in 2007 and in 2008 respectively, historians Annie Lacroix-Riz (Militant Communist) and (Militant Trotskyist) criticized St√©phane Courtois for having expressed his views in an interview with the extreme right monthly '.Interview with St√©phane Courtois Communism equivalence to Nazism is finally allowed! Le Choc du mois 17 November 2007Letter from Annie Lacroix- Riz, \\"St√©phane Courtois in his works\\", in Journal of the labour movement No. 37, first quarter 2008 In 2009, he criticized the militant Trotskyist and historian Jean-Jacques Marie for the contents of chapter entitled: \\"1922: the year of serenity\\", published in his biography Lenin, 1870-1924 (Balland, Paris, 2004).Conference on \\"Communism and Totalitarism\\", St√©phane Courtois, Institut d'histoire sociale, 22 October 2009, . Courtois accuses Jean-Jacques Marie for apologising for Lenin for whom 1922, on the contrary, was \\"the year of transition to paranoia\\". This showed itself on the one hand, by the note from Lenin to the Politburo on 19 March 1922 in which he wanted to use the Soviet famine of 1921‚Äì1922 to destroy the Orthodox Church: \\"It is precisely now when the famine-struck regions eat human flesh, and thousands of corpses litter the roads, that we need to enforce the confiscation of church property with savage energy and most unforgivingly, and crush any hint of resistance, with such brutality that it will be talked about for decades\\".Lenin 19 March 1922 quoted in Major manipulations of modern times, Barnard Raquin, Trajectories, Paris, 2005, p. 43 This \\"paranoia\\" is also reflected in the Terror against the Socialist-Revolutionaries (death sentences, gulag, etc..) as well as the expulsion (or sometimes internal exile) of the Russian intelligentsia. This last event is described by him in the chapter, \\"Lenin and the destruction of the Russian intelligentsia\\", in his book Communism and totalitarianism (pre-published in Societal magazine No. 55 to 59): \\"the deportees were warned that any illegal return to Russia would automatically entail the death penalty\\".Chapter VII: Lenin and the destruction of the Russian intelligentsia in Totalitarianism and Communism St√©phane Courtois, Perrin, Paris, pp. 133‚Äì134 On 25 May 1922, Lenin addressed himself to Stalin in the following terms: \\"hundreds of these gentlemen must be expelled without mercy. We are going to clean up Russia once and for all.... They should all be turned away from Russia\\". In September 1922, Lenin justified his act to Maxim Gorky: \\"the intellectuals, the lackeys of capitalism, think they are the brains of the nation. In reality, they are not the brain, they are crap\\".Chapter VI: Terror: ordinary means of government in Totalitarianism and Communism, St√©phane Courtois, Perrin, Paris, p. 125 Influence abroad Although sometimes contested in France, his works are generally more favourably received abroad, especially in the former communist regimes of Eastern Europe. =Romania=Translation of his work As proof of his ideologic influence, an important part of his work has been translated into Romanian (The Black Book of Communism, Such a long night, Dictionary of communism, Communism and Totalitarianism, The blind spot in European history, etc.).

The early Russian system of government instituted by Peter the Great, which consisted of various state committees, each named Collegium with subordinate departments named Prikaz, was largely outdated by the 19th century. The responsibilities of the Collegia were chosen very randomly and often overlapped. Soon after Alexander I inherited the throne in 1801, he formed a Privy Committee (–ù–µ–≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç) which consisted of Viktor Kochubey, Nikolay Novosiltsev, Pavel Stroganov and Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. Mikhail Speransky took an active part in the Committee, although he was not a formal member. The reforms proposed by Speransky were to introduce a parliament and a State Council as legislative and executive bodies of the Tsar and to relieve the Governing Senate of these functions, transforming it to a kind of Supreme Court. Speransky even prepared the Constitution project. The reforms were stopped by 1810 because of the Napoleonic wars and growing resistance from conservative nobility, as voiced by Nikolai Karamzin.

The Soviet Union disapproved of the invasion and ceased its support of Somalia, instead starting to support Ethiopia. Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory through a massive airlift of military supplies worth $1 billion, the arrival of between 16,000-24,000 Cuban troops sent by Fidel Castro to win a second African victory (after his first success in Angola in 1975‚Äì76), and 1,500 Soviet advisors, led by General Vasily Petrov. The Ethiopians and Cubans (using 300 tanks, 156 pieces of artillery, and 46 combat aircraft) prevailed at Harar, Dire Dawa and Jijiga, and began to push the Somalis systematically out of the Ogaden. By March 1978, the Ethiopians and Cubans had captured almost all of the Ogaden, prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region. The Somalis took a terrible beating from Cuban artillery and aerial assaults. A third of the initial Somali National Army invasion force was killed, and half of the Somali Airforce destroyed; the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population. All of these conditions led to a revolt in the army which eventually spiraled into a civil war. BackgroundTerritorial partition= Following World War II, Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1950, as a result of the Paris Peace Treaties, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition‚Äîfirst proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL)‚Äîthat Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis,Federal Research Division, Somalia: A Country Study, (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p. 38 the British returned the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British, French and Italians agreed upon the territorial boundaries of Ethiopia with the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against raids by hostile clans.Laitin, p. 73 Britain included the provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area.Zolberg, Aristide R., et al., Escape from Violence: Conflict and the Refugee Crisis in the Developing World, (Oxford University Press: 1992), p. 106 This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali- inhabitedFrancis Vallat, First report on succession of states in respect of treaties: International Law Commission twenty-sixth session 6 May ‚Äì 26 July 1974, (United Nations: 1974), p. 20 Northern Frontier District (NFD) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic.Laitin, p. 75 Flag of the Somali Youth League (SYL), Somalia's first political party. A referendum was held in neighboring Djibouti (then known as French Somaliland) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later.Barrington, Lowell, After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States, (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as Djibouti's first president (1977‚Äì1991). British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: 2002), p. 835 On July 1, 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic. A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister (later to become President from 1967‚Äì1969). On 20 July 1961, through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution that had been first drafted the previous year.Greystone Press Staff, The Illustrated Library of The World and Its Peoples: Africa, North and East, (Greystone Press: 1967), p. 338 On 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'√©tat on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition‚Äîessentially a bloodless takeover. The coup was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.Moshe Y. Sachs, Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations, Volume 2, (Worldmark Press: 1988), p. 290. =Supreme Revolutionary Council= Alongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel. Kediye officially held the title of \\"Father of the Revolution\\", and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic,J.

In addition to previous Soviet funding and arms support to Somalia, Egypt sent millions of dollars in arms to Somalia, established military training and sent experts to Somalia. =Somali National Army Plan= Under the leadership of General Mohamed Ali Samatar, Irro and other senior Somali military officials were mandated in 1977 with formulating a national strategy in preparation for the Ogaden campaign in Ethiopia. This was part of a broader effort to unite all of the Somali-inhabited territories in the Horn region into a Greater Somalia (Soomaaliweyn). A distinguished graduate of the Soviet Frunze Military Academy, Samantar oversaw Somalia's military strategy. In the late 1970s, Samatar was the Chief Commanding Officer of the Somali National Army during the Ogaden Campaign. He and his frontline deputies faced off against their mentor and former Frunze alumnus, General Vasily Ivanovich Petrov, who was assigned by the USSR to advise the Ethiopian Army, in addition to 15,000 Cuban troops supporting Ethiopia, led by General Arnaldo Ochoa. General Samatar was assisted in the offensive by several field commanders, most of whom were also Frunze graduates: General Yussuf Salhan commanded SNA in Jigjiga Front assisted by Col. A. Naji, capturing the area on August 30, 1977. (Later became Minister of Tourism. Salhan was eventually expelled from the Somali Socialist Party in 1985) Col. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed commanded SNA in Negellie Front. (Later the leader of SSDF rebel group based in Ethiopia. Col Ahmed was arrested by Ethiopia's Mengistu. He was released after the collapse of the Mengistu regime in 1991) Col. Abdullahi Ahmed Irro commanded SNA in the Godey Front. (Retired and became a Professor of Strategy in Mogadishu Somalia) Col. Ali Hussein commanded SNA in two front's, Qabri Dahare and Harrar. (Eventually joined the SNM late 1988) Col. Farah Handulle commanded SNA in the Warder Front. (Became a civilian administrator and Governor of Sanaag, later killed in Hargheisa as the new appointed Governor of Hargheisa in 1987 one day before he took over the Governorship) General Mohamed Nur Galaal assisted by Col.Mohamud Sh. Abdullahi Geelqaad commanded Dirir-Dewa. The SNA retreated from Dirir-Dewa. ( Galaal became Minister of Public Works and Leading member of the ruling Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party) Col. Abdulrahman Aare and Col. Ali Ismail co-commanded the Degeh-Bur Front. (Both Officers were lLater chosen to reinforce the Harar campaign; Col Aare eventually became a military attache and retired as a private citizen after the collapse of SNA in 1990) Col. Abukar Liban 'Aftooje' Initially served as acting logistics coordinator for the Southern Command and later commanded the SNA in the Iimeey Front. ( Aftoje became a General and a military attache to France). =Derg= Party badge of Ethiopia's Derg regime (c. 1979). As Somalia gained military strength, Ethiopia grew weaker. In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg (the military council), marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia. One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. WSLF had control of most of the Ogaden, the first time since the Second World War that all Somalia was united with the exception of the NFD region in Kenya. The victory in Ogaden was mostly because of support from the Harari populace who had aligned with the WSLF. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror (or Qey Shibir in Amharic). Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist‚ÄìLeninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977. In June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, Barre strongly denied this, saying SNA \\"volunteers\\" were being allowed to help the WSLF. =Castro siding with Ethiopia= When the Cubans and the Soviets learned of the Somali plans to annex the Ogaden, Castro flew to Aden in March 1977 where he suggested an Ethiopian-Somali-Yemeni Socialist Federation. Castro's plan didn't get any support and two months later Somali forces attacked the Ethiopians. Cuba, supported by troops from the USSR and South Yemen, sided with Ethiopia. Course of the war Approximate extent of Greater Somalia. Ethiopian territory occupied by Somalia in 1977. =Invasion and Initial stage (July‚ÄìAugust)= The Somali National Army committed to invade the Ogaden on July 12, 1977, according to Ethiopian Ministry of National Defense documents (some other sources state July 13. or 23 July).. According to Ethiopian sources, the invaders numbered 70,000 troops, 40 fighter planes, 250 tanks, 350 APCs, and 600 artillery, which would have meant practically the whole Somali Army. By the end of the month 60% of the Ogaden had been taken by the SNA-WSLF force, including Gode, on the Shabelle River. The attacking forces did suffer some early setbacks; Ethiopian defenders at Dire Dawa and Jijiga inflicted heavy casualties on assaulting forces. The Ethiopian Air Force (EAF) also began to establish air superiority using its Northrop F-5s, despite being initially outnumbered by Somali MiG-21s. However, Somalia was easily overpowering Ethiopian military hardware and technology capability. Army- general Vasily Petrov of the Soviet Armed Forces had to report back to Moscow the \\"sorry state\\" of the Ethiopian Army. The 3rd and 4th Ethiopian Infantry Divisions that suffered the brunt of the Somali invasion had practically ceased to exist.. The USSR, finding itself supplying both sides of a war, attempted to mediate a ceasefire. When their efforts failed, the Soviets abandoned Somalia. All aid to Siad Barre's regime was halted, while arms shipments to Ethiopia were increased. Soviet military aid (second in magnitude only to the October 1973 gigantic resupplying of Syrian forces during the Yom Kippur War) and advisors flooded into the country along with around 15,000 Cuban combat troops. Other communist countries offered assistance: the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen offered military assistance and North Korea helped train a \\"People's Militia\\"; East Germany likewise offered training, engineering and support troops. (As the scale of communist assistance became clear in November 1977, Somalia broke diplomatic relations with the USSR and expelled all Soviet citizens from the country.) Not all communist states sided with Ethiopia. Because of the Sino-Soviet rivalry, China supported Somalia diplomatically and with token military aid. Romania under Nicolae Ceau≈üescu had a habit of breaking with Soviet policies and maintained good diplomatic relations with Siad Barre. By 17 August elements of the Somali Army had reached the outskirts of the strategic city of Dire Dawa. Not only was the country's second largest military airbase located here, as well as Ethiopia's crossroads into the Ogaden, but Ethiopia's rail lifeline to the Red Sea ran through this city, and if the Somalis held Dire Dawa, Ethiopia would be unable to export its crops or bring in equipment needed to continue the fight. Gebre Tareke estimates the Somalis advanced with two motorized brigades, one tank battalion and one BM battery upon the city; against them were the Ethiopian Second Militia Division, the 201 Nebelbal battalion, 781 battalion of the 78th Brigade, the 4th Mechanized Company, and a tank platoon possessing two tanks.. The fighting was vicious as both sides knew what the stakes were, but after two days, despite that the Somalis had gained possession of the airport at one point, the Ethiopians had repulsed the assault, forcing the Somalis to withdraw. Henceforth, Dire Dawa was never at risk of attack.. =Somali victories and siege of Harar (September‚ÄìJanuary)= A heavily damaged Somali National Army T-34 going through repairs Cuban soldiers The greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the Battle of Jijiga), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non- Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place. From October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the Battle of Harar, where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied artillery and armor; backed by 1,500 Soviet advisors and 16,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack. Casualties among the Somalis may have totaled as many as 40,000 since the start of the war. =Ethiopian-Cuban counter-attack (February‚ÄìMarch)= Tiglachin memorial in Addis Ababa, commemoring the Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers involved in the Ogaden War The expected Ethiopian-Cuban attack occurred in early February; however, it was accompanied by a second attack that the Somalis did not expect. A column of Ethiopian and Cuban troops crossed northeast into the highlands between Jijiga and the border with Somalia, bypassing the SNA-WSLF force defending the Marda Pass. Mil Mi-6 helicopters airlifted Cuban BMD-1 and ASU-57 armored vehicles behind enemy lines. The attackers were thus able to assault from two directions in a \\"pincer\\" action, allowing the re-capture of Jijiga in only two days while killing 3,000 defenders. The Somali defense collapsed and every major Somali town was recaptured in the following weeks. Recognizing that his position was untenable, Siad Barre ordered the SNA to retreat back into Somalia on 9 March 1978, although Rene LaFort claims that the Somalis, having foreseen the inevitable, had already withdrawn their heavy weapons.. The last significant Somali unit left Ethiopia on 15 March 1978, marking the end of the war. Effects of the war Following the withdrawal of the SNA, the WSLF continued their insurgency. By May 1980, the rebels, with the assistance of a small number of SNA soldiers who continued to help the guerrilla war, controlled a substantial region of the Ogaden. However, by 1981 the insurgents were reduced to sporadic hit-and-run attacks and were finally defeated. In addition, the WSLF and SALF were significantly weakened after the Ogaden War. The former was practically defunct by the late 1980s, with its splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) operating from headquarters in Kuwait. Even though elements of the ONLF would later manage to slip back into the Ogaden, their actions had little impact. The version at samaynta.com lacks references. For the Barre regime, the invasion was perhaps the greatest strategic blunder since independence,. and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units and half of the Somali Air Force (SAF) were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified Greater Somalia. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), was formed by army officers in 1979. The United States adopted Somalia as a Cold War ally from the late 1970s to 1988 in exchange for use of Somali bases, and a way to exert influence upon the region. A second armed clash in 1988 was resolved when the two countries agreed to withdraw their militaries from the border.

It is generally represented as a vector of components, with the special case of uni-dimensional value as a synthetic measure. History The term was coined by the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry in the late 1980s. QoR was meant to be an indicator of the performance of integrated circuits (chips), and initially measured the area and speed of a chip. As the industry evolved, new chip parameters were considered for coverage by the QoR, illustrating new areas of focus for chip designers (for example power dissipation, power efficiency, routing overhead, etc.). Because of the broad scope of quality assessment, QoR eventually evolved into a generic vector representation comprising a number of different values, where the meaning of each vector value was explicitly specified in the QoR analysis document. Currently the term is gaining popularity in other sectors of technology, with each sector using its own appropriate components. Current trends in EDA Originally, the QoR was used to specify absolute values such as chip area, power dissipation, speed, etc. (for example, a QoR could be specified as a {100 MHz, 1W, 1 mm¬≤} vector), and could only be used for comparing the different achievements of a single design specification. The current trend among designers is to include normalized values in the QoR vector, such that they will remain meaningful for a longer period of time (as technologies change), and/or across broad classes of design. For example, one often uses - as a QoR component - a number representing the ratio between the area required by a combinational logic block and the area required by a simple logic gate, this number being often referred to as \\"relative density of combinational logic\\". In this case, a relative density of five will generally be accepted as a good quality of result - relative density of combinational logic component - while a relative density of fifty will indicate severe design problems (routability, technology that is being used, etc.) which should be investigated and addressed. Note: A new term \\"Quality of Silicon\\" (QoS) is being promoted by the EDA industry in an attempt to measure the performance of backend EDA tools in isolation from the human designer's own performance in the frontend design stage. It is claimed that for historical reasons QoR is, and should remain, a measure of frontend design performance, while QoS should be reserved for analysing the performance of the backend-related flow. However, with front-end designers being increasingly concerned with and involved in various backend stages of the design, a large number of QoS parameters are also being included in the QoR analysis vectors.

He was probably best-known as the announcer on the long running game show Let's Make a Deal, in which he appeared throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Other shows for which he announced regularly include the Reg Grundy productions Scrabble and Sale of the Century, as well as the Jack Barry-Dan Enright productions The Joker's Wild, Tic-Tac-Dough and Bullseye. Stewart committed suicide in 1989.  Education and early career  Born in Summitville, Indiana, Stewart broke into show business as a saxophone player. He attended Butler University and won a 1939 award as one of the outstanding Sigma Chi graduates in the United States. After graduation he landed radio announcing jobs at WBOW in Terre Haute and WLW in Cincinnati. In 1943 Stewart moved to Los Angeles, where he continued his career as a radio announcer. In 1953 Stewart became the host of NBC Radio's It Pays To Be Married. Stewart was one of the hosts for Town Hall Party, a Los Angeles-based country music program airing from 1952 to 1961 and carried by KFI radio and KTTV-TV television. He was also an announcer for The Mike Douglas Show when production moved to Los Angeles in 1978. Stewart was originally married to Beverly Barnes Fix. The two had two daughters, Jamie and Julie Fix (now Julie Bratspis). After divorcing, Jay later married Phyllis Kiser. Later in life, youngest daughter, Julie had two children, Emily Bratspis (now Liebenberg) and Andrew Bratspis.  Career highlights  Stewart was perhaps best known for his work on Let's Make a Deal and in the 1980s on $ale of the Century. Let's Make a Deal host Monty Hall called Stewart \\"the best second banana you ever found in your life\\" and said that \\"it was a very, very good feeling between us.\\" On Let's Make a Deal Stewart participated onstage as well as announcing, often seen modeling the show's \\"zonk\\" prizes (a practice also used by current announcer Jonathan Mangum). Includes material from NBC and The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows. Stewart was also the primary announcer for all Barry & Enright game shows from 1977 until 1981, including The Joker's Wild, Tic-Tac-Dough, and Bullseye. Stewart was even the announcer in the trailers and TV spots for the company's controversial 1981 sex comedy Private Lessons. Charlie O'Donnell took over the role on the Barry-Enright shows starting in the 1981‚Äì82 season, when Stewart left due to his daughter's suicide. In 1981, Jay was selected by Mark Goodson to announce approximately four to six weeks worth of episodes on Card Sharks, pairing him with future Sale of the Century host Jim Perry. It was Stewart's only announcing assignment for Mark Goodson Productions, occurring while he was still employed with Barry & Enright. Both Stewart and Johnny Olson were brought in to substitute for regular announcer Gene Wood, who was recovering from a serious automobile accident. Besides his duties on the NBC and syndicated versions of $ale of the Century, Stewart announced the first year of Scrabble before being replaced by Charlie Tuna in 1985. A year later, in 1986, he made a cameo appearance on the series finale of The All-New Let's Make a Deal alongside original LMaD prize model Carol Merrill; Stewart's appearance, like many of his on-screen appearances on the original series, was modeling a zonk a player had just won (although that time, he wore a business suit rather than a zonk-related costume as he did on the original series). In addition, between his stints with Barry & Enright and Reg Grundy Productions, Stewart was the voice-over for National Enquirer commercials, which he continued to do until around 1986. Stewart left Sale of the Century in 1988. His final announcing position was on Blackout shortly after his departure from Sale, where he filled in for an ill Johnny Gilbert as the show's announcer for its final two weeks.  Later work and declining health In late 1981, Stewart's daughter Jamie committed suicide. During this time, he took a year- and-a-half respite from announcing and found religion, appearing on The 700 Club to proclaim his newfound faith, which led to him doing voiceover promos for host Pat Robertson's CBN Cable Network (formerly CBN Satellite Service and now Freeform). He returned to the game show arena in 1983 as the announcer of $ale of the Century, which he held for five years. Stewart also co-hosted with Jim Perry for a week around late 1983, when then-hostess Lee Menning was on maternity leave, and participated in several Instant Bargains during the course of his tenure on Sale. That same year, Stewart announced for a pilot of the revival of Jeopardy! hosted by Alex Trebek, but the job eventually went to Johnny Gilbert, who announced for a later pilot and all subsequent episodes, he remains to this day. Stewart could not overcome the pain of his daughter's death and turned to alcohol, which ultimately led to his departure from $ale of the Century in January 1988. During this time, he moved into the managerial field; one of his clients was Harry Stevens, who announced the syndicated version of Finders Keepers and the 1989 version of Pictionary. Death On September 17, 1989, Stewart died by suicide by shooting himself in the carport of his home 11 days after his 71st birthday. An explanatory note and a last will and testament was discovered in his possession. He had been experiencing severe depression and he also suffered from chronic, intractable back pain for years, reportedly due to frequent heavy lifting during his work on Let's Make a Deal (Stewart had to carry prize display tables to and from the audience area whenever a game on Let's Make a Deal called for them; he would bring out the prizes, announce them, then take them back offstage when done).LA Times: Television Announcer Jay Stewart Kills Self Stewart is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.

The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II. In January 1942, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. The commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese army. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The Bataan Peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region. Despite a lack of supplies, American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward. As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific. The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.Robertson, p. 606. Soon afterwards, U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March.William L. O'Neill, A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II, p 115 Background The capture of the Philippine Islands was crucial to Japan's effort to control the Southwest Pacific, seize the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asian flank. In late summer 1941, the Roosevelt Administration began a series of moves toward Japan that could only conclude with war. It began supplying arms to Chiang Kai-Shek in China, began a massive military build-up in the Philippines and imposed a series of embargoes, most importantly a refusal to sell Japan petroleum unless they evacuated all of China, including Manchuko (Manchuria). This \\"ultimatum\\" was rejected by Japan and the fuse was lit. After Japanese carrier planes attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941 (8 December, Manila time), Taiwan-based aircraft, within seven hours, pounded the main bases of the American Far East Air Force at Clark Field in Pampanga, Iba Field in Zambales, Nichols Field near Manila, and the headquarters of the United States Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines, at Cavite. Many American planes were caught on the ground and summarily destroyed. In one day, the Japanese had gained air superiority over the Philippine Islands. This forced the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to withdraw its surface ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreat southwards, leaving only the submarine force to resist the Japanese with untested, faulty torpedoes. From 8 to 10 December, scattered resistance by ground troops and remaining American air and naval forces failed to stop preliminary landings to seize airfields at Batan Island, Aparri, and Vigan City. Army air force B-17s, often with little if any fighter escort, attacked Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga and the Vigan landings on Luzon with no effect. Submarines of the Asiatic Fleet were also assigned to the effort. In one last coordinated action by the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, and a destroyer, and sank one minesweeper. Army Air Corps pilot Sam Marrett was killed while on his successful attack against the minesweeper. These air attacks and naval actions, however, did not significantly delay the Japanese assault.cite: Jerry Kruth researching \\"The Bamboo Soldiers.\\" These small-scale landings preceded the main assault on 22 December 1941, at Lingayen Gulf in Pangasinan and Lamon Bay, Tayabas, by the 14th Japanese Imperial Army, led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma. By effectively neutralizing U.S. air and naval power in the Philippines, the Japanese gained supremacy that isolated the Philippines from reinforcement and resupply, and provided itself with both airfields for support of its invasion forces and staging bases for further operations in the Dutch East Indies. War Plan Orange-3 When MacArthur returned to active duty, the latest revision plans for the defense of the Philippine Islands had been completed in April 1941 and was called WPO-3, based on the joint Army- Navy War Plan Orange of 1938, which involved hostilities between the United States and Japan. Under WPO-3, the Philippine garrison was to hold the entrance to Manila Bay and deny its use to Japanese naval forces and ground forces were to prevent enemy landings. If the enemy prevailed, they were to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula, which was recognized as the key to the control of Manila Bay. It was to be defended to the \\"last extremity\\". In addition to the regular U.S. Army troops, the defenders could rely on the Philippine Army, which had been organized and trained by General MacArthur. However, in April 1941, the Navy estimated that it would require at least two years for the Pacific Fleet to fight its way across the Pacific. Army planners in early 1941 believed supplies would be exhausted within six months and the garrison would fall. MacArthur assumed command of the Allied army in July 1941 and rejected WPO-3 as defeatist, preferring a more aggressive course of action. He recommended‚Äîamong other things‚Äîa coastal defense strategy that would include the entire archipelago. His recommendations were followed in the plan that was eventually approved. Due to MacArthur's decision, with tacit approval from Washington, to change the plan under War Plan Rainbow 5, it was ordered that the entire archipelago would be defended, with the necessary supplies dispersed behind the beachheads for defending forces to use while defending against the landings. With the return to War Plan Orange 3, the necessary supplies to support the defenders for the anticipated six-month-long defensive position were not available in the necessary quantities for the defenders who would withdraw to Bataan. Battle When the Japanese made their first landings on 10 and 12 December at the northern and southern extremities of Luzon, General MacArthur made no disposition to contest them. He correctly surmised that these landings were designed to secure advance air bases and that the Japanese had no intention of driving on Manila from any of these beachheads. He did not regard the situation as serious enough to warrant a change in his plan to oppose the main attack, when it came, with an all-out defense at the beaches. The MacArthur Plan, then, remained in effect. On December 20, US Navy submarine spotted a large convoy of troop ships with escorts. This was General Homma's landing force, and included 85 troop transports, two battleships, six cruisers, and two dozen destroyers. The convoy was engaged by three submarines: USS Stingray, , and , who fired torpedo after torpedo into the convoy, most of which failed to explode, due to the Mark XIV torpedo's defective detonators. In all, just two troop ships were sunk before Japanese destroyers chased the submarines away. =Fighting retreat= Japanese troops occupy Manila, as it is declared an open city to avoid its destruction, 2 January 1942. General MacArthur intended to move his men with their equipment and supplies in good order to their defensive positions. He charged the North Luzon Force under Maj. Gen. Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV with holding back the main Japanese assault and keeping the road to Bataan open for use by the South Luzon Force of Maj. Gen. George Parker, which proceeded quickly and in remarkably good order, given the chaotic situation. To achieve this, Wainwright deployed his forces in a series of five defensive lines outlined in WPO-3: * D1: Aguilar to San Carlos to Urdaneta City * D2: Agno River * D3: Santa Ignacia to Gerona to Guimba to San Jose * D4: Tarlac to Cabanatuan City * D5: Bamban to Sibul Springs Layac Line WWII First Line of Defense Memorial (Dinalupihan, Bataan, Philippines) The main force of General Masaharu Homma's 14th Area Army came ashore at Lingayen Gulf on the morning of 22 December. The defenders failed to hold the beaches. By the end of the day, the Japanese had secured most of their objectives and were in position to emerge onto the central plain. Facing Homma's troops were four Filipino divisions: the 21st, the 71st, the 11th, and the 91st, as well as a battalion of Philippine Scouts backed by a few tanks. Along Route 3‚Äîa cobblestone road that led directly to Manila‚Äîthe Japanese soon made contact with the Filipino 71st Division. At this point the action of the American artillery stalled the Japanese attack. However, Japanese planes and tanks entering the action routed the Filipino infantry, leaving the artillery uncovered. A second Japanese division landed at Lamon Bay, south of Manila, on December 23 and advanced north. It was now evident to General Wainwright that he could no longer hold back the Japanese advance. Late on the afternoon of the 23rd, Wainwright telephoned General MacArthur's headquarters in Manila and informed him that any further defense of the Lingayen beaches was \\"impracticable.\\" He requested and was given permission to withdraw behind the Agno River. MacArthur weighed two choices: either make a firm stand on the line of the Agno and give Wainwright his best unit, the Philippine Division, for a counterattack; or withdraw all the way to Bataan in planned stages. He decided on the latter, thus abandoning his own plan for defense and reverting to the old ORANGE plan. Having made his decision to withdraw to Bataan, MacArthur notified all force commanders on the night of 23 December that \\"WPO-3 is in effect.\\" Meanwhile, Manuel L. Quezon, the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, together with his family and government staff were evacuated to Corregidor, along with MacArthur's United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) headquarters, on the night of 24 December 1941, while all USAFFE military personnel were removed from the major urban areas. On the 26th Manila was officially declared an open city and MacArthur's proclamation was published in the newspapers and broadcast over the radio. The Japanese were not notified officially of the proclamation but learned of it through radio broadcasts. The next day, and thereafter, they bombed the port area, from which supplies were being shipped to Bataan and Corregidor. Defense of the Layac Junction approach to Bataan 2‚Äì6 January 1942 After General Douglas MacArthur had withdrawn his army down the island of Luzon's central plain into the Bataan Peninsula, one last line existed before the Japanese invaders reached the main line of resistance. The Americans attempted to slow the Japanese entry into Bataan by fighting a delaying action at Layac, thus gaining time and deceiving the enemy as to the location of the main defensive positions. For the first time in World War II, American troops faced Japanese soldiers on the ground. Porac‚ÄìGuagua Line Historical Marker (6 January 1942) From 1 to 5 January 1942, as the entire USAFFE converged from south and north, delaying actions were fought to allow the struggling withdrawal to Bataan. The fiercest fighting occurred at the hastily emplaced Porac‚ÄìGuagua Line, where the 11th and 21st divisions, respectively led by Brigadier Generals William E. Brougher and Mateo Capinpin, with the 26th Cavalry Regiment of Colonel Clinton A. Pierce in reserve, held the line, mostly on open and unprepared ground, against massive aerial and artillery bombardment, strong tank assaults, and infantry banzai attacks by the Takahashi and Tanaka detachments. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Overlooked in this report are the actions of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the PA, led by senior instructor Col. Wallace A Mead. The 23rd Regiment established the defensive line at Porac-Pampanga on or around 2 January 1942. Colonel Mead was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions there. The 23rd's defense allowed Capinpin's forces to withdraw and establish new defensive positions. It was Capinpin's recount of the fighting that day that was offered as support for Mead's citation. Abucay‚ÄìMauban Line The Abucay Line 9‚Äì23 January 1942 War Plan Orange 3 called for two defensive lines across Bataan. The first extended across the peninsula from Mauban in the west to Mabatang, Abucay in the east. General Wainwright, commanding the newly organised I Philippine Corps of 22,500 troops, held the western sector. I Corps included the Philippine Army's 1st Regular, 31st, and 91st Divisions, the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts (PS)) and a battery of field artillery and self-propelled guns. General Parker and the new II Philippine Corps, which included the Philippine Army's 11th, 21st, 41st, and 51st divisions and the 57th Infantry (PS), and numbered 25,000 men, defended the eastern sector. All of the divisions, already under strength at the onset of war, had suffered serious combat losses, particularly to desertions. The U.S. Army's Philippine Division, made up of the 31st Infantry, the 45th Infantry (PS), and supporting units became the \\"Bataan Defense Force Reserve\\". Mount Natib, a -high mountain that split the peninsula, served as the boundary line between the two corps. The commanders anchored their lines on the mountain, but, since they considered the rugged terrain impassable, they did not extend their forces far up its slopes. The two corps were therefore not in direct contact with each other, leaving a serious gap in the defense line. With the fighting withdrawal completed, the Abucay‚ÄìMauban Line, the USAFFE's main battle position was now in place. =Stand= The Mauban Line positions 18‚Äì25 January 1942 On 9 January, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General Susumu Morioka assaulted the eastern flank of the Abucay‚ÄìMauban Line, and were repulsed by the 91st Division of Brigadier General Luther Stevens and Colonel George S. Clark's 57th Infantry (PS). On 12 January, amid fierce fighting, 2nd Lieutenant Alexander R. Nininger, a platoon leader in the 57th Infantry, sacrificed his life when, armed with only a rifle and hand grenades, he forced his way into enemy foxholes during hand-to-hand combat, permitting his unit to retake Abucay Hacienda; for his actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Another extreme act of bravery was put forth by a Filipino named Narcisco Ortilano. He was on a water-cooled heavy machine gun when the Japanese burst out of a canebrake in a banzai attack. He shot dozens of the Japanese with his machine gun, then pulled out his Colt .45 and shot five more when the machine gun jammed. Then, when one Japanese soldier stabbed at him with a bayonet, he desperately tried to grab the gun, got his thumb cut off, but still held on, and then with a sudden burst of adrenaline he turned the gun on the enemy soldier and stabbed him in the chest. When another Japanese soldier swung a bayonet at him, he turned his rifle on the soldier and shot him dead. Narcisco received the Distinguished Service Cross. Another attack on 14 January at the boundary of positions held by the 41st and 51st Divisions of Brigadier Generals Vicente Lim and Albert M. Jones, respectively, aided by the 43rd and Colonel Wallace A Mead's 23rd Infantry, stubbornly refused the Japanese their left flank. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River Valley through a gap made by the 51st Infantry's withdrawal. But a patrol discovered the infiltration, and units of the 21st Division rushed to the valley and repulsed the attackers after a savage encounter. At another engagement farther to the west, a Japanese force surprised and routed the 53rd Infantry of Colonel John R. Boatwright. This force also penetrated deep behind the Abucay‚ÄìMauban Line along the Abo-Abo River Valley, but their advance was held up by combined units of the 21st and 51st Divisions, the 31st Division of Brigadier General Clifford Bluemel, and Colonel John H. Rodman's 92nd Infantry at the Bani-Guirol Forest area. The 31st Infantry and the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts of Colonel Thomas W. Doyle, partially restored the abandoned line of the 51st Division. On 15 January, the reinforced 1st Regular Division of Brigadier General Fidel Segundo, defending the Morong sector, came under heavy bombardment, but held the line. The Japanese penetrated through a huge gap in the Silangan-Natib area and established a roadblock on Mauban Ridge, threatening to cut off the division's rear. Repeated attacks by the 91st Division and 71st Division, and 92nd Infantry failed to dislodge the Japanese. The attackers' nightly raids and infiltration tactics became more frequent. Previously, General Parker's II Corps had prevented a similar encirclement at the Salian River battle, but the position of General Wainwright's I Corps was deemed indefensible, and the Abucay‚ÄìMauban Line was abandoned on 22 January. Battle of Trail Two Japanese flamethrower in action against a bunker on the Orion-Bagac Line Within four days, the Orion-Bagac Line was formed. But the defenders had yet to complete their withdrawal to the reserve battle position when the Japanese struck again, through a gap held by I Corps. General Bluemel hastily organized a defense along Trail Two, consisting of 32nd Infantry, 41st Infantry and 51st Division reinforcements, in time to stop a major offensive and plug the gap. Battle of the Pockets The Orion‚ÄìBagac line showing the U.S. positions around 27 January 1942 The remaining Japanese troops managed to get through, however, and held out at some rear sectors of the Orion-Bagac Line at the Tuol River Valley behind the 11th Division, and in the Gogo-Cotar River behind the 1st Regular Division. From 23 January to 17 February, coordinated action by the defenders to eliminate these salients of resistance became known as the \\"Battle of the pockets\\". Fierce fighting marked the action. Captain Alfredo M. Santos, of the 1st Regular Division, outmaneuvered the enemy during their attempt to pocket the area. In both attempts, his unit successfully broke through the Gogo-Cotar and Tuol pockets, thus earning for himself the moniker \\"hero of the pockets\\". For his successes, he was promoted to major in the field. Major Santos was then given the hazardous mission of closing the gaps and annihilating the enemy troops who had infiltrated the lines, as the gap posed a serious threat to the positions and the security of the division. He led a counterattack against the strong and numerically superior Japanese forces positioned between the MLR and the Regimental Reserve Line (RRL). The fighting began at dawn on 29 January 1942, and the Americans restored the defensive sector assigned to the 1st Regular Division. On 3 February 1942, 1st Lieutenant Willibald C. Bianchi of the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts, led a reinforced platoon forward against two enemy machine-gun nests, silenced them with grenades, and despite two machine gun wounds to the chest, then manned an antiaircraft machine gun until being knocked off the tank by a third severe wound.https://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/keeble/medal/citations20.htm#B He was awarded a Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 2,000 Japanese soldiers engaged, 377 were reported to have escaped. Battle of the Pockets on the Orion-Bagac Line General Homma, on 8 February, ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate the pocketed 3rd Battalion, 20th Infantry. With further casualties, the remnants of the 3rd Battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north, with USAFFE forces re-occupying positions evacuated by the Japanese. Battle of the Points Japanese landings on Bataan 23 January ‚Äì 1 February 1942 In an attempt to outflank I Corps and isolate the service command area commanded by USAFFE deputy commander Brigadier General Allan C. McBride, Japanese troops of the 2nd Battalion, 20th Infantry, 16th Division, were landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. Intercepted by U.S. PT-34, two barges were sunk and the rest scattered in two groups, neither of which landed on the objective beach. The Japanese forces were contained on their beachheads by members of Philippine constabulary units, a hastily organized naval infantry battalion, and by personnel of several U.S. Army Air Corps pursuit squadrons fighting as infantry, including Ed Dyess and Ray C. Hunt.Dyess, W.E., 1944, The Dyess Story, New York: G.P. Putnam's SonsHunt, Ray C., and Norling, Bernard, 1986, Behind Japanese Lines: An American Guerrilla in the Philippines, The University Press of Kentucky, The naval infantry consisted of 150 ground crewmen from Patrol Wing Ten, 80 sailors from the Cavite Naval Ammunition Depot, and 130 sailors from , with 120 sailors from the base facilities at Cavite, Olongapo, and Mariveles, and 120 Marines from an antiaircraft battery. Sailors used the Canopus machine shop to fabricate makeshift mountings for machine guns salvaged from Patrol Wing Ten's damaged aircraft. The Marines were distributed through the ranks, and the sailors were told to \\"watch them and do as they do.\\" The sailors attempted to make their white uniforms more suitable for jungle combat by dying them with coffee grounds. The result was closer to yellow than khaki, and the diary of a dead Japanese officer described them as a suicide squad dressed in brightly colored uniforms and talking loudly in an attempt to draw fire and reveal the enemy positions.Gordon, John IV, Capt. USA \\"The Navy's Infantry at Bataan\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings Supplement March 1985 pp.64‚Äì69 Japanese commanders, in an attempt to hold onto their lodgements, reinforced the beachheads piecemeal, but could not break out. Battles were fought ferociously against a company-sized group at the Lapay- Longoskawayan points from 23 to 29 January, at the Quinawan-Aglaloma points from 22 January to 8 February, and at the Silalim-Anyasan points from 27 January to 13 February. Out of the 2,000 Japanese troops committed to these battles, only 43 wounded returned to their lines. These engagements were collectively termed the \\"Battle of the Points\\". =Fall of Bataan= On the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family, and several USAFFE staff officers left Corregidor for Mindanao aboard four PT boats commanded by Lieutenant Commander John D. Bulkeley. For this, and a number of other feats over the course of four months and eight days, Bulkeley was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross and other citations. MacArthur was eventually flown to Australia where he broadcast to the Filipino people his famous \\"I Shall Return\\" promise. MacArthur's departure marked the end of the USAFFE, and by 22 March, the defending army was renamed the United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP), and Lieutenant General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV was placed in command. After the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese general headquarters sent strong artillery forces to the Philippines in order to smash the American fortifications. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150 mm cannons and the rare Type 45 240 mm howitzer. The 1st Artillery headquarters, under Major General Kineo Kitajima, who was a known authority on IJA artillery, also moved to the Philippines along with the main forces to command and control these artillery units. Also, the Japanese high command reinforced General Homma's 14th Imperial Army, and toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final assault. On 3 April, the entire Orion-Bagac Line was subjected to incessant bombings by 100 aircraft and artillery bombardment by 300 artillery pieces from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 pm, which turned the Mount Samat stronghold into an inferno. Over the course of the next three days (Good Friday to Easter Sunday, 1942), the Japanese 65th Brigade and 4th Division spearheaded the main attack at the left flank of II Corps. Everywhere along the line, the American and Filipino defenders were driven back by Japanese tanks and infantry. Based on his two prior attempts, General Homma had estimated that the final offensive would require a week to breach the Orion- Bagac Line and a month to liquidate two final defense lines he believed had been prepared on Bataan. When the opening attack required just three days, he pushed his forces on 6 April to meet expected counterattacks head-on. The Japanese launched a drive into the center, penetrated into flanks held by the 22nd and 23rd Regiments of the 21st Division, captured Mount Samat and outflanked all of II Corps. Counterattacks by the U.S. Army and Philippine Scout regulars held in reserve were futile; only the 57th Infantry gained any ground, soon lost. All along the battle front, units of I Corps, together with the devastated remnants of II Corps, crumbled and straggled to the rear. The commanders on Bataan lost all contact with their units, except by runner in a few instances. In the last two days of the defense of Bataan, the entire Allied defense progressively disintegrated and collapsed, clogging all roads with refugees and fleeing troops (some were evacuated by YAG-4 from the Mariveles Naval Base). By 8 April, the senior U.S. commander on Bataan, Major General Edward P. King, saw the futility of further resistance, and put forth proposals for capitulation. The next morning, 9 April 1942, General King met with Major General Kameichiro Nagano and, after several hours of negotiations, the remaining weary, starving and emaciated American and Filipino defenders on the battle-swept Bataan Peninsula surrendered.

Aftermath Japanese soldiers guard American and Filipino prisoners of war. The continued resistance of the force on Bataan after Singapore and the Indies had fallen made heartening news among the Allied peoples. However, the extension of time gained by the defence was very largely a result of the transfer of the 48th Division from Homma's army at a critical time, and the exhaustion of the weakened force that remained. It cost a far stronger Japanese army as many days of actual combat to take Malaya and Singapore Island as it cost Homma to take Bataan and Corregidor.(Long G, \\"MacArthur as Military Commander\\" (1969), Angus and Robertson (Australia), p.83.) The surrender of Bataan hastened the fall of Corregidor a month later. There is a suggestion that without the stand, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific and could have quickly invaded Australia.William L. O'Neill, A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II, p 116 Willoughby, MacArthur's Intelligence Officer, asserted after the war that the epic operation in Bataan and Corregidor became a decisive factor in the ultimate winning of the war, that it disrupted the Japanese timetable \\"in a way that was to prove crucial\\" and that \\"because of Bataan the Japanese never managed to detach enough men, planes, ships, and material to nail down Guadalcanal.\\" That assertion is contradicted by simple facts of history, geography and arithmetic . Rather than allowing the operations on Luzon to upset their general timetable, the Japanese took steps that resulted in prolonging the resistance of Luzon in order to speed up their conquest of the Indies. Between the time of their advance into the Solomons and the American counter-landing on Guadalcanal in August, three months after the fall of Corregidor, they had ample troops available to build up their strength in the South Seas. However, historian Teodoro Agoncillo argues that the battle was \\"unnecessary in so far as the throwing away of precious lives was concerned, for it served no strategic purpose.\\" It was only Yamashita who thought of invading Australia, something that Tojo did not support. Finally, not only did the USAFFE possess numerical superiority, it could have recaptured Manila easily (according to Homma). Ultimately, more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March. However, about 10,000‚Äì12,000 of these eventually escaped from the march to form guerrilla units in the mountains, tying down the occupying Japanese. On 7 September 1944, the Japanese ship Shiny≈ç Maru was sunk by USS Paddle; on board the Shinyo Maru were U.S. POWs, of whom 668 died and 82 survived. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur initiated the Campaign for the Liberation of the Philippines, fulfilling his promise to return to the country he had left in 1942. As part of the campaign, the Battle for the recapture of Bataan (31 January to 21 February 1945) by Allied forces and Philippine guerrillas avenged the surrender of the defunct United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) to invading Japanese forces.

(1943) and Cry 'Havoc' (1943). Dozens of documentaries have also featured stories from the Battle of Bataan including A Legacy of Heroes: The Story of Bataan and Corregidor (2003), Ghosts of Bataan (2005) and an episode of The History Channel series Shootout, entitled \\"Raid on the Bataan Death Camp\\" (2006). Though largely focusing on the Cabanatuan Raid in 1945, this last program also featured stories from the 1942 battle; notably the stand of the 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) at Mabatang.

Life The son of Rev. William Williams and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Cotton (daughter of Rev. Seaborn Cotton), he was born at Hatfield, Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard, graduating, at the age of seventeen, in 1711. His first wife, and mother of his seven children (only two of whom survived him), was Eunice Chester. They were married in 1714; she died in 1750. After his marriage he studied law, and was a member of the Connecticut legislature from Wethersfield for five sessions, the first in 1717. He was also a tutor in Weathersfield, Connecticut for those Yale college students who for three years from 1716 to 1719 refused to move from Saybrook Point to New Haven, Connecticut; he was one of the leaders in the attempt to make the schismatic college part of Harvard, an offer which Harvard turned down.Warch, Richard, School of the Prophets: Yale College, 1701-1740, Yale University Press, 1973,\\"Chapter 3 ‚Äì Declining and Unhappy Circumstances\\", subheading \\"Elihu Yale\\" After Yale college was reunited in New Haven, he remained in Weathersfield, studied divinity with his father, and was ordained a clergyman in 1722. He served the church at Wethersfield until 1726, when he became fourth Rector of Yale College, serving in that capacity for thirteen years. He entered the position during a troubled period of Yale's history. Under the leadership of senior Tutor Samuel Johnson between 1716 and 1719, Tutor Daniel Brown from 1718 to 1722, and Rector Timothy Cutler from 1719 to 1722, Yale had begun to teach an Enlightenment curriculum. The \\"Great Apostasy\\" of 1722 had seen these three men and four other local clergymen abandon the Puritan Congregationalist church and declare for the Church of England at the close of Yale's commencement.Ahlstrom, Sydney, Yale University Press,1972, pp. 224-225 Yale's trustees fired Cutler and Brown, and searched for an orthodox Rector. After being turned down by six other candidates, the board offered Williams the position in 1726.Warch, \\"Chapter 5 ‚Äì A Repairer of the Breach\\" His mission there for the 13 years he was there was to restore the Puritan curriculum, much of which went back to the early sixteenth century. According to colonial college scholar J. David Hoeveler, ‚ÄúYale set its sights on an orthodox recovery‚Äù, and Rector Williams became ‚Äúa polemicist for orthodoxy.‚ÄùHoeveler, David J., Creating the American Mind: Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007, p. 62 After his resignation as Yale's Rector in 1739, he claimed for reasons of health, though more likely in order to run for Governor,Johnson, Samuel, Samuel Johnson, President of King's College; His Career and Writings, edited by Herbert and Carol Schneider, New York: Columbia University Press, 1929, Volume 1, p. 101 Williams immediately resumed his career in politics.

Shifting professions once again, he became a Colonel of Militia, and served as Chaplain in the expedition sent against Cape Breton in 1745.Dexter, p. 633 Abandoning entirely his clerical orders, he took military command of a regiment of one thousand men raised for the reduction of Canada; when they were not paid, he was sent to go to England to entreat for their pay. While he was there, his wife died, and he married Elizabeth Scott, daughter of Rev. Thomas Scott, of Norwich, England. Returning home, he narrowly escaped shipwreck, and spent some months in Antigua before reaching Connecticut. He was a delegate to the Albany Congress in 1754. He died at Wethersfield, Connecticut and is buried there. His widow, Elizabeth, became the second wife of William Smith (1697‚Äì1769) in 1761.

It is a simple game relatively easy to complete successfully more often than not. Rules The game starts with the aces separated from the deck to form the foundations. After the remaining 48 cards are shuffled, 20 cards are laid out on the tableau in a 5x4 grid fashion to form \\"the carpet\\". The remaining 28 cards make up the stock. All cards from \\"the carpet\\" must be moved to the foundations up by suit (i.e. 2‚ô† over A‚ô†). Any \\"holes on the carpet,\\" i. e. gaps left behind by the cards that are moved to the foundations, are filled by cards from the waste pile or, if the waste pile is empty, the stock. The stock cards are dealt one at the time on the waste pile and can be moved to the foundations or to the carpet if necessary. Once the stock is used up, all cards on the waste pile cannot be used as a new stock. Only the top card of the waste pile can be played. The game is won when all of the cards are moved into the foundations. Strategy Good strategy aims to fill empty spaces with cards that can soon be played, if possible building up in the carpet chains of cards that can be played consecutively, while leaving higher ranking cards in the discard pile until later in the game. Variations Under some rules (e.g. Basil Dalton's The Complete Patience Book), the Aces remain in the deck at the start of the game and only are played to the foundations when they are appear during regular game-play. Colorado and Twenty (sometimes called Sly Fox) are among several games that work similar to Carpet, but use two decks. Four Winds is a lesser known solitaire game in the style of Carpet, and has a set-up consisting of 16 tableau piles in the shape of the four directions of a compass.

It has been held annually since 2002 and is organized by the student-driven, non- profit entrepreneurship association at the Royal Institute of Technology, Excitera. The competition's audience is students at Swedish universities and high schools, particularly those studying game development and software engineering. Funding is handled through partnerships with various software and game development companies, e.g. Digital Illusions CE and Sun Microsystems.  History  Swedish Game Awards started in 2002 as a PC-only game competition under the name KTH Game Awards, and was targeted mainly at students in the Stockholm area. In 2004, KTH Game Awards was merged with another competition organized by Excitera, called the Excitera Mobile Award. This led to the creation of special class for mobile phone games. After its first iteration, the name was changed to Swedish Game Awards to reflect the increase in scope from local to national competition, as well as the fact that the competition had grown to be the largest of its kind in Sweden.Swedish Game Awards 2011 ‚Äì History In 2014 the competitions hosts changed from students of Royal Institute of Technology to students of S√∂dert√∂rn University (while still maintaining its cooperation with Excitera). In 2015 the competition added the category Best Diversity Effort as a result of their co-operation with Diversi to reflect the games industry's increasing interest in variation of its developers and consumers. The final day of the competition also had its first livestream on YouTube by cooperating with students of Medieinstitutet to make the announcement of the winners available directly to the public. It also broke the previous record of submitted games in 2014 (which was 98) with 104 games. The competition has gradually gained recognition from Swedish game development companies and universities as a way for students to show their game development capabilities and thus increase their chances of getting employment within the video game industry.

In its 13th year, the Swedish Game Awards continues annually to draw greater numbers of entries from student-development teams across Sweden. = Rules = The parameters to the competition have remained relatively stable over the years, aimed toward providing a launching pad for talented, independent, student game developers to develop new and marketable games. The official rules are available at http://gameawards.se/competition/rules. = Event Timeline = The process of the Swedish Game Awards spans the majority of each academic year. Beginning in October with the SGA Kickoff, previous winners, current jury members, and corporate sponsors are invited to present their perspectives of the game industry and the Swedish Game Awards in particular to the upcoming year's participants. Also at this time, the various award categories are announced. The competition submissions are developed by independent teams during the year, culminating in a Jury Weekend and Grand Finale party in late May. In the early months of the competition, the SGA Tour also occurs. During the tour, representatives from the Swedish Game Awards visit universities and technical schools across the country to engage with competition participants. = Partners = Main Partners  King (company), DICE, Arrowhead Game Studios, Sweden Game Arena Autodesk  Gold Partners  MAG Interactive  Silver Partners  Paradox Interactive, Epic Games  Bronze Partners  Rovio Entertainment, Avalanche Studios = Current Categories = : Game of the Year : Gamers' Choice : Best Diversity Effort : Best Execution in Art : Best Execution in Audio : Best Execution in Design : Best Execution in Narrative : Best Technical Execution  Previous Competition  Previous Partners = Here is a list of previous partners that have sponsored the Swedish Game Awards in some way in the past.

","title":"It's Like That"},{"id":"1613966","text":"Francis Alfred \\"Frank\\" Tarrant (11 December 1880 ‚Äì 29 January 1951) was an Australian cricketer whose first-class career spanned from 1899 to 1936, and included 329 matches. From Melbourne, Tarrant began his career with Victoria in Australia's Sheffield Shield, but found fame playing in England, with a long career as an all-rounder for Middlesex in the County Championship. After the First World War, he was mostly active in India, appearing for the Europeans in the Bombay Quadrangular tournament. Tarrant played his final first-class match at the age of 56, during the 1936‚Äì37 season. He had also umpired in two England‚ÄìIndia Test matches (and several first-class games) several seasons earlier. Considered one of the best players never to play at Test level, Tarrant scored almost 18,000 runs and over 1,500 wickets during his long career, and completed \\"the double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season on eight separate occasions. Biography A nephew of ex-Victoria player Ambrose Tarrant, Tarrant first played for Victoria in 1898/1899, and met with little success either as a batsman or a bowler then or in 1900/1901. However, he moved to England in 1903 to join the Lord's ground staff and played a number of matches for the MCC while qualifying for Middlesex. In these, he showed himself developing into a left-arm spinner of above average pace but with nothing beyond steadiness when pitches did not help him. In 1904, he showed development as a solid right-handed batsman, and in 1905, when fully qualified, he was a valuable aid to Middlesex. his superb batting on a difficult pitch to draw the game with Essex at Leyton showed he was a player of exceptional resolution during the most difficult crisis. In 1906, while his bowling was impotent on the rock-hard wickets prevailing in the Home Counties for most of the season, Tarrant was unplayable on rain-affected pitches at Old Trafford and in Yorkshire, and he scored 1000 runs for the first time. 1907 saw Tarrant take a leap into cricket's elite, with his batting, at least for three months, marking him as a player of remarkable patience even if he failed to use all the strokes he was capable of playing. Though he lacked sting when pitches were hard, on rain-affected pitches Tarrant could turn the ball extremely quickly from a perfect length. This was seen at its clearest when he took nine for 59 against Nottinghamshire at Lord's ‚Äì some of the batsmen said they \\"had never seen a finer piece of bowling\\". For the whole season Tarrant took 183 wickets for 15.70 each and scored 1552 runs with an average of 32. That winter, Tarrant returned to Australia and in six matches scored 762 runs for an average of 76, including 159 against the touring MCC team and 206 against New South Wales at the SCG. Between 1908 and 1914, he was always one of the best all-rounders in the game ‚Äì a safe catcher, a skilful opening batsman (who formed with Pelham Warner one of the best opening partnerships in the game), and a deadly bowler when the wicket was helpful and steady when it did not. His batting also grew beyond the purely defensive as he developed his on-side strokes ‚Äì so much that against Surrey at Lord's in 1911 he scored 89 in seventy minutes when Middlesex wanted quick runs for a declaration. That year he achieved the rare feat of scoring 2000 runs and taking 100 wickets, and carried his bat for 207 against Yorkshire. His performance of taking 16 for 176 followed by 101 not out against Lancashire in 1914 remains one of the greatest all-round feats in county cricket. That same year, he scored a brilliant 250 not out at Leyton after Johnny Douglas had put Middlesex in to bat on a rain-affected pitch. As he scored 200 against Worcestershire in the following match, he accomplished the remarkable feat of scoring two successive double-hundreds. With J.W. Hearne he forged a partnership that, almost single- handed, allowed Middlesex to come second to Surrey. During the war, Tarrant played in India, and his bowling was unplayable on the matting wickets against weak batting. In 1918/1919 he achieved the incredible feat of scoring a century and taking all ten wickets in an innings. Tarrant continued to organise touring teams to India after the war, and only played rarely outside India. However, he managed to make 78 in one match as late as 1936/1937, when he was fifty-seven, and he umpired England's first two Tests on Indian soil, as well as several other MCC matches on that tour. Tarrant and his son Louis stood together in the match between MCC and Southern Punjab, which provides one of the few instances when a father and son umpired in a match, and later also appeared together in a first-class match during the 1935‚Äì36 season. On 26 August 1909, playing for Middlesex against Gloucestershire, Tarrant did the double by taking a Hat-trick and carrying his bat in the same match; he is the only cricketer to do so.

A native of Austria-Hungary, he was attracted to the cause of Polish independence early in life. As a professor at Jagiellonian University (1920‚Äì1933), he held a chair in the History of Culture. His principal expertise was in the politics, ideologies, education, and literature of the 16th- and 17th-century Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. He is particularly known for his contributions to the study of the Reformation in Poland. As a Second Polish Republic politician, he was a member of the People's Party; and, during World War II, he held several high posts in the Polish Government in Exile, including those of Minister of Interior (1940‚Äì1941), Minister of State (1942‚Äì1943), and Minister of Information (1943‚Äì1944). He also served, during the war, as Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union (1941‚Äì1942); and shortly after the war, as Polish ambassador to Italy (1945‚Äì1947). In 1947, in the wake of the communist takeover of Poland, he became a political refugee, living in France and later in the United Kingdom, where he was the leader of the People's Party in exile.  Early life and education  Kot was born into a peasant family in Ruda, in the Austrian-partition Galicia region of Austro- Hungary. His father Marcin, a leading citizen of the village, could read and write, and was involved in the patriotic movement of Lesser Poland, the historic region to which Ruda belonged. Kot attended elementary school in Czarna and Sƒôdzisz√≥w and gymnasium in Rzesz√≥w, and became active in Polish- independence youth groups in Galicia, part of the Austrian partition of Poland. In 1904 he matriculated in law at Lw√≥w University, but in 1905 he transferred to Krak√≥w's Jagiellonian University, where in 1909 he obtained a Ph.D. in classics for a thesis on The Influence of the Political Theories of Classical Antiquity on the Political Ideas of Sixteenth-Century Poland, with Special Reference to Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski. At university he was active in the student socialist movement, and clashed with right-wing National Democrats over his insistence on respecting the rights of the region's ethnic Ukrainian citizens. Kot also rejected the National Democrats' antisemitism. CareerSchoolteaching and World War I= In 1908‚Äì1912 he taught at secondary schools in Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine) and Krak√≥w. In 1911 he married Ida Proksch. In 1912‚Äì1914, thanks to a scholarship from the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, he studied in France and made several study trips to Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium. During World War I he was active in politics, culture, and education, working with the Polish Legions. From 1915 he headed the Press Department of the Polish Supreme National Committee. From 1914 to 1917 or 1919 (sources vary) he published a newspaper, Wiadomo≈õci Polskie (Polish News); during that time, his political views shifted from left-leaning to centrist. However, he preferred scholarly over political work, and during the 1920s he took little part, if any, in politics. = Historian = Kot published his first scholarly work in 1910, about Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski‚Äôs views on education. His early research thus began with the history of education in Poland, but over time his interest gravitated toward the history of culture, in particular the Reformation in Poland. After Poland had in November 1918 regained independence, incarnated as the Second Polish Republic, Kot in 1919 began publishing the book series, ' (The National Library), which continues to the present; up to the outbreak of World War II, he oversaw the publication of 177 volumes. He also edited another book series, Biblioteka Pisarz√≥w Polskich (The Library of Polish Writers). In 1920 Kot habilitated his doctorate and was appointed a professor at Krak√≥w's Jagiellonian University, in 1924 earning a full professorship and holding a chair in the History of Culture newly created for him. Kot was popular with his students, particularly those from ethnic minorities, and has been described as \\"a strong opponent of nationalism and antisemitism\\".Anna Landau- Czajka, Syn bƒôdzie Lech... Asymilacja ≈ªyd√≥w w Polsce miƒôdzywojennej (The Son Will Be a Pole... The Assimilation of Jews in Interwar Poland) , Warsaw, Wydawnictwo Neriton, 2006, , p. 99: \\"[M]any outstanding Polish scholars of Jewish descent, when up for promotions, ran into difficulties for 'extra- scholastic' reasons... One of the most outstanding historians, J√≥zef Feldman, had trouble getting through his habilitation because one of the [examining] professors had maliciously prepared questions that were impossible to answer (Prof. Stanis≈Çaw Kot came to [Feldman's] rescue, declaring that if Feldman were not given his habilitation, he [Kot] would resign his own [professorial] chair, because he did not know the answers to the questions either)\\" His opposition to the antisemitism then common among Polish chauvinists has been attributed to the political activism that he had begun in his student days. In 1919 Kot published a biography of Modrzewski which, as of 1999, was still considered the most exhaustive and reliable work on the subject. In 1932 he published a book on Socinianism in Poland: The Social and Political Ideas of the Polish Antitrinitarians in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries ‚Äì a detailed monograph on the Polish Brethren ‚Äì which appeared in English in 1957 and is considered his most influential monograph. He also published a well- received textbook, Historia Wychowania (History of Education; first, single- volume edition, 1924; second, revised, two-volume edition, 1933-1934). From 1921 until 1939 he edited the quarterly, Reformacja w Polsce (The Reformation in Poland), which he had established; it was published by the Society for Research into the History of the Reformation. For a while he also edited another journal, Archiwum do dziej√≥w literatury i o≈õwiaty (Archive for the History of Literature and Education), published by the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1921 he became a corresponding member of the said Academy, in 1928 advancing to a full active member. In 1927 he became a member of the PEN Club. In 1929 he was inducted into the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences. In 1930 he organized a large academic conference dedicated to the study of the 16th-century Polish poet Jan Kochanowski. From 1929 to 1939 Kot was chairman of the Commission for the History of Education and Schools in Poland. In 1935 or 1937 (sources vary) he was a guest lecturer at Paris' Coll√®ge de France. In 1941 he received an honorary degree from Oxford University, where he also lectured that year; and in 1959, from the University of Basel. Kot's main scholarly expertise comprised the politics, ideologies, and literature of the 16th- and 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In particular, he specialized in the Reformation in Poland, the history of education in Poland, Poland's cultural contacts with the West, historical Polish political thought and doctrines, and observations of Polish national characteristics.Archiwum Stanis≈Çawa Kota (Stanis≈Çaw Kot collection). United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Archives His studies of Polish emigrations to Western Europe and to cities in France, Germany, and Italy were trailblazing. Wiktor Weintraub writes that Kot was a university professor for a period of only thirteen years, cut short by the consequences of his political activities; and that, in assessing Kot the scholar, \\"one cannot avoid a certain feeling of frustration\\" since, while he produced substantial research in the decade following his 1909 Ph.D. degree, despite the disruptions of World War I, his subsequent scholarship lost its initial drive and was not as productive. = Politician =1930s In the early 1930s Kot participated in protests directed against the government. One protest opposed a reform of the educational system. In 1933, when the Sanation government controlled by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski was mistreating political prisoners at the Brze≈õƒá fortress, Kot was a principal organizer of a protest by university professors. Soon after, in September 1933, due to the Sanation government's pressure Kot, then aged 48, was forced to take early retirement from Jagiellonian University; this was widely seen as retribution for his political activities, such as his connection with professors' resistance against the suppression of university autonomy and in connection with protests against the government's imprisonment of Centrolew politicians. From that point on, Kot would focus an increasing amount of his time on politics, and less and less on scholarly activities. In 1933 Kot joined the People's Party and from 1936 to 1939 was a member of its Executive Committee. He was aligned with the party's right wing, and was also involved in the Front Morges political alliance. He acted on Wincenty Witos' behalf in Poland (Witos then being in foreign exile) and helped organize a 1937 rural strike, leading to his two-day arrest by Polish authorities. World War II In 1939, after the German invasion of Poland and the start of the Second World War, Kot escaped to Romania, then through Hungary and Switzerland to France, where in October 1939 he took part in forming the Polish Government in Exile. That December he became its Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Secretary of State. He worked closely with Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and was a vocal opponent of Sanation, which was now in the political opposition. In February 1940, Kot met in Paris with the resistance envoy Jan Karski, who had just arrived from Poland. Karski's report stated that German policies were oppressive, and that the Polish Jewish community was being singled out for especially harsh treatment. In the spring of 1940, meeting with representatives of British Jewry in France, Kot criticized the bulk of Poland's Jews for failing to assimilate into Polish society and suggested that, after the war, most Jews would have to leave Poland. From October 1940 to August 1941 Kot was Minister of the Interior. He was also active in preserving Polish culture, supporting Polish artists, educators, and scholars through the Fund for National Culture. In New York City in 1942, he cofounded the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA). Stalin signs the Soviet-Polish declaration, 4 December 1941. Poles include Sikorski, Anders, Kot (behind Stalin, in dark suit). Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and the subsequent reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union (severed upon the Soviet invasion of Poland), from November 1941 until July 1942 Kot was Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union in Moscow. In that capacity he was very active in helping Polish refugees in the Soviet Union. One of his main responsibilities was to ensure the \\"rapid release of all Poles held in Soviet prisons and camps\\" and to establish Polish consulates on Soviet territory. Despite his attempts, he failed to secure the release of some, including Polish-Jewish Bund and Second International executive-committee members Viktor Alter and Henryk Ehrlich.Herman Kruk, Benjamin Harshav, The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps, 1939-1944, Yale University Press, 2002, p. 43, He objected to the creation of a separate Jewish Legion within the Anders Army ‚Äì a question that divided the Jewish community itself. Kot (front left), Sikorski's funeral, 1943 After Kot's tour of duty as Poland's ambassador to the Soviet Union, until 1943 he served as Polish Minister of State in the Near East, where substantial Polish armed forces were stationed. From March 1943 Kot was the Polish exile government's Minister of Information. One of his most memorable acts in this capacity was the public disclosure, on 17 April that year, of the Katyn Massacre.Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk w dokumentach aparatu bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, t. 1: Dzia≈Çalno≈õƒá w latach 1945‚Äì1947, ed. Witold Bagie≈Ñski, Piotr Byszewski, Agnieszka Chrzanowska, Franciszek DƒÖbrowski, Franciszek Gryciuk, Jolanta Mysiakowska-Muszy≈Ñska, Warszawa 2010. P. 106. Quote: \\"nieszczƒô≈õliwym zbiegiem okoliczno≈õci Sikorskiego nie by≈Ço w Londynie, a on sam by≈Ç chory w momencie, kiedy dowiedziano siƒô o Katyniu. Bez czekania na powr√≥t genera≈Ça, bez porozumienia siƒô Rettingerem, Kot, Kukiel i Raczy≈Ñski zredagowali komunikat, kt√≥ry oddali do PAT i rozes≈Çali Anglikom\\" In that communiqu√©, the Polish government asked for a Red Cross investigation. This was rejected by Stalin, who used the fact that the Germans had also requested such an investigation as \\"proof\\" of a Polish-German conspiracy, and turned it into a pretext for breaking off Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations. After Prime Minister Sikorski's death on 4 July 1943 at Gibraltar, President W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz asked Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, who had been acting Prime Minister in General Sikorski's absence, to form a government. Kot retained his post as Minister of Information in Mikolajczyk's cabinet until 1944. = Post-World War II = In July 1945 Kot returned to Poland with a number of politicians, including Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, who hoped to establish a dialogue with the new communist authorities. From 1945 to 1947 Kot worked with the Provisional Government of National Unity, which sought to bring together the Polish Government-in-Exile and the Soviet-sponsored Polish communist government. Throughout most of that period Kot served as Poland's ambassador to Italy. In 1947, in the wake of staged elections and of trials suppressing People's Party activists deemed insufficiently cooperative with the Soviet-backed communists ‚Äì events that marked the effective takeover of Poland by the communists ‚Äì Kot, fearing persecution, resigned his post and went back into exile. Kot was a political refugee in Paris, before moving to the United Kingdom. In France he became involved with the International Rescue Committee. He supported the London-based Polish Government in Exile, and from 1955 was the leader of the People's Party in exile. He was also active in the International Peasant Union. He published scholarly articles in international academic journals, and memoirs of his time as Polish ambassador to the USSR. Some of his final research concerned the Polish Reformation, interactions between Polish and Western cultures, medieval proverbs, and biographies of Yuri Nemyrych and Szymon Budny. He received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to publish a study on the Reformation in Poland, but was unable to finish it before his health deteriorated. In January 1964 he suffered a stroke that left him in a coma for two years and thereafter bedridden and unable to work for the rest of his life. 1965 saw the publication of his memoirs, Conversations with the Kremlin and Dispatches from Russia.Wagner, Wolfgang. \\"Kot, Stanislaw: Conversations with the Kremlin and Dispatches from Russia (Book Review).\\" Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas 13 (1965): 141-142. He died in London, England, on 26 December 1975, soon after turning 90. His funeral took place in London on 7 January 1976 at the North Sheen Cemetery.  Legacy  Peter Brock and write: \\"Like a long line of historians beginning in antiquity, Stanis≈Çaw Kot was both a writer of history and a politician who helped to shape events. Whereas in his scholarly writings he preserved a calm impartiality, with any polemical thrust usually concealed from the reader‚Äôs view, Kot from his [secondary]-school days emerged as 'a passionate politician, evoking strong emotions and partisan prejudices'.\\" Polish communist-era historiography described him as a reactionary leader of the extreme nationalist right, even calling him \\"the greatest enemy of communism and of the revolutionary currents of worker-peasant collaboration.\\" In the West, some Polish √©migr√©s criticized him for opposing J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's interbellum Sanation political movement and for attempting to find a modus vivendi with communist authorities during and after World War II. Brock and Pietrzyk write that, while Kot was respected among the international community, he was ostracized by many Polish exiles: \\"the Polish exiled community... never forgave him for his return to Poland in 1945; while he, for his part, waged a relentless ‚Äì and almost obsessive ‚Äì war against the National Democrats and Pilsudskiites, who predominated among the exiles\\". Kot the politician could be maladroit, with a tendency to suspect hostile conspiracies, especially on the part of the Sanation political movement. In 1928, Sanation founder J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski had relieved W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski of his army command; the latter would go on to become Kot's colleague in the wartime exile government. Also, in 1933, Sanation had pressured Kot into retiring prematurely from his Jagiellonian University professorial chair. Critics have seen Kot's last official appointment, as the Polish communist government's ambassador to Rome, as a disappointing end to his political career. Janusz Tazbir comments that \\"it is a tragedy\\" that, too often in Kot's life, especially after 1939, \\"the mediocre politician stole the limelight from the magisterial scholar\\". Tazbir writes that many of Kot's history writings remain valuable and continue to be reissued, as opposed to his writings on contemporary politics, which Tazbir considers properly forgotten. According to Agnieszka Wa≈Çƒôga, Kot was \\"among the founders of the history of education as a scholarly discipline in Poland\\". Lucyna Hur≈Ço writes that \\"his works in the... history of education, culture, literature, and [the R]eformation and Antitrinitarianism exemplify [scholarly] reliability.\\" Waclaw Soroka writes that \\"in Kot, the intellectual history of Poland and Eastern and Central Europe gained an outstanding researcher and exponent.\\" Lech Szczucki has called him \\"likely the most influential and industrious Polish historian of the interwar period\\", and writes that his contribution to the study of the Polish Reformation is of extreme value. Wiktor Weintraub has termed him \\"one of the leading 20th-century Polish historians\\" and writes that \\"in the Polish scholarly community... Kot secured [a] position as a first-rank historian.\\" Brock and Pietrzyk have assessed him to be a \\"historian of major stature\\". Wojciech Roszkowski and summarized his life: \\"He left a vast scholarly legacy in the history of education and history of culture, including particularly the history of the Reformation.\\" Kot won high praise for his organizational activities, including his work with committees, his founding and editing of scholarly journals and book series, his organizing of conferences, his mentoring of numerous graduate students. During his years at Jagiellonian University, Kot's disciples included , , , , Maria Czapska, J√≥zef Feldman, , , Bogdan Suchodolski, , , Wiktor Weintraub, Ignacy Zarƒôbski, and Jerzy Zathey. Kot also influenced foreign scholars, including his Italian student . Having inspired hosts of scholars, mostly through his students, many of whom became academics, he is regarded as the founder of his own historical school (\\"Kot's school\\" of the Polish Reformation). The periodical, Reformacja w Polsce (The Reformation in Poland), which he started before World War II, was revived after the war and continues to this day as the academic journal ' (The Renaissance and the Reformation in Poland). Kot wrote 95 major studies, books, and articles. His work, however, was published in Polish and thus had less influence on international, particularly English-language, scholarship. Only one of his books was translated into English (Socinianism in Poland, 1957). Particularly after World War II, a number of his scholarly articles were published in, or translated into, languages other than Polish. During Poland's communist era, with few exceptions, censorship did not allow his works to be reprinted, discussed, or even cited. In 1976 Jerzy Giedroyc, editor of Kultura, in Paris, called for a monograph on Kot's life. Such a work (in the form of a Festschrift) had in fact been in preparation before World War II, but the manuscript had been badly damaged during the war, and efforts to reconstruct it had been stopped by Poland's communist authorities. In December 1997 a conference on \\"Stanis≈Çaw Kot ‚Äì uczony i polityk\\" (\\"Stanis≈Çaw Kot ‚Äì scholar and politician\\") was held in Krak√≥w, organized by Jagiellonian University. The conference included an exhibit on Kot's life and work. Conference materials were published in a 2001 book of the same title, whose cover note described Kot as \\"undeniably a great scholar and politician\\". In 2000 published a biography of Kot, Stanis≈Çaw Kot 1885-1975. Biografia polityczna (Stanis≈Çaw Kot 1885-1975: A Political Biography). Janusz Tazbir wrote in a review of Rutkowski's book that he himself was working on a biography of Kot the scholar, but Tazbir had not finished it before his 2016 death.

Warren was built at the Boston Navy Yard between 1825 and 1827 and was commissioned at her builders on 14 January 1827, Master Commandant Lawrence Kearny in command. Service historyMediterranean Squadron= Warren sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 February 1827 to stop Greek-flag pirates from victimizing American merchantmen. Unsettled conditions in the Near East and the Greek fight for independence had resulted in some excesses against third parties, notably American flag merchantmen. The piracy caused the American Mediterranean Squadron to establish a regular convoy system from Malta to Smyrna. Warren sailed with a convoy of American vessels on 25 September 1827 and separated from them some 200 miles west of Kythira. On 4 October, Kearny's command bagged her first \\"piratical boat\\" and its crew of five. Later that same day, Warren captured a brig \\"peerced (sic) for 16 guns\\" flying the Greek flag. For the next three weeks, Warren cruised between Cape Matapan and Carabusa, touching occasionally to contact outward-bound American merchantmen. While off Milos on 25 October, Kearny learned of recent pirate attacks on the American ships Cherub and Rob Roy. That same day, Warren chased a 10-gun pirate brig ashore at the island of Kimolos; but the brigands escaped to the nearby hills. Warren's men cut away the masts of the erstwhile pirate ship and stripped them of their sails, leaving the rigging submerged in the waters offshore. Three days later, Warren came across Cherub and took possession of her. That evening, the brig arrived and assumed protective guard over Cherub while Warren returned to the pirate-hunt. The next day, between Tinos and Mykonos, Warren fell in with the Austrian brig Silence \\"robbed of everything.\\" The American sloop-of-war towed Silence to Syros, where she left her in care of Lexington. Cruising around the island of Mykonos, Warren captured a large tratta \\"capable of rowing 40 oars,\\" before she put into Mykonos harbor on 1 November. The following day, Kearny and his men recovered sails and some property taken from Cherub and two cases of opium taken from the brig Rob Roy, as well as the sails and rigging from Silence. The local inhabitants turned over four men accused of being pirates while a landing party of Warren men picked up a fifth man from the mountains. Kearny and his men also took possession of a boat belonging to pirates living at Mykonos and later burned it. Returning to Syros on the 7th, Kearny restored the goods to Cherub and the sails and rigging from the Austrian ship. Cherub, escorted by Lexington, set sail for Smyrna. That evening, Warren put to sea, bound for the reputed pirate lair of the island of Andros. A boat expedition, led by Lieutenant William L. Hudson, departed the ship to circle Andros Island. While Hudson's party was thus engaged, a brig with a convoy of some 20 to 30 boats opened fire on them in the darkness. Although shot went through the sails of Warrens boats and through the clothing of some of her sailors, no one was hurt. After this action ‚Äî which probably occurred because he and his expedition had been mistaken for pirates ‚Äî Hudson continued on, undaunted. Near the south end of the town of Andros, Warrens men brought out one \\"piratical craft\\" and burned another in a small bay nearby. At the head of that bay, the American sailors blew up a house believed to have been owned by a pirate and raised and took possession of a boat which had been sunk by pirates to avoid detection by the Americans. Rob Roys master later identified the boat as the craft in which pirates had attacked his vessel. Kearny, in Warren, remained in the vicinity of Andros and Gioura until 14 November. The people of Andros again cooperated and produced a pirate boat which contained a 12-pounder carronade and some tools from Cherub. Four days later, Warren made port at Milos and tarried there into late November. On the 27th of that month, the American brig Sarah and Esther and six other vessels arrived. Three days later, that convoy sailed for Smyrna under Warren's protection. They arrived at their destination, without incident, on 6 December. For the next two years, Warren remained in the western Mediterranean guarding American commerce. =Brazil Station= She returned to the United States in the summer of 1830, arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 August. Decommissioned for repairs, on 10 September, Warren was recommissioned on 2 September 1831, Master Commandant Benjamin Cooper in command, for service on the Brazil Station. After two years in the South Atlantic, the sloop-of-war headed northward and reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 31 October 1833. =Caribbean= Warren then made three successive tours in the West Indies, protecting American commerce in deployments that began in 1836 with the West Indies Squadron and with the Home Squadron in 1839, and 1841. On 19 October 1843, Warren sailed for service with the Pacific Squadron and remained on the western coast of the North American continent for the remainder of her naval career. =Pacific= During the war with Mexico, Warren acted as a guardship at Monterey, California and eventually moved to San Francisco, for duty as a stores and receiving ship. On 13 November 1846, the former sloop-of-war's launch, in charge of Acting Master William H. Montgomery, departed the ship with $900.00 to pay bills accrued by the Navy for supplies, bound for Sutter's Fort, up the Sacramento River. By the end of the month, when no word came from the launch's crew, Warren's commanding officer felt \\"great anxiety\\" and sent out a hired boat with some men from his ship to hunt for the missing craft and its crew. On 18 December, the search party ‚Äì having combed the river and inlets as far as Fort Sacramento‚Äîreturned and reported finding no sign of the launch or of the crew. Eventually, the fate of Warren's launch came to light. The officers had been murdered‚Äîtheir throats cut‚Äîand their bodies thrown overboard. The men divided the money and split up, some returning overland across the North American continent to the east; others remained in California to pan for \\"washing gold.\\" Records do not indicate whether or not the guilty men were ever found and brought to trial. However, they do show that orders were issued that valid discharges were to be shown by all naval personnel returning overland to prove that they were not deserters. The log of the whaleship Niantic records that the \\"US Sloop of War Warren\\" rendered immediate assistance 9 July 1849 in San Francisco harbor, when two of Niantics crew assaulted her captain with a knife. Thereafter, Warren was solely a stores ship. She was sold at Panama on 1 January 1863. Her eventual fate is unrecorded, although records indicate that the erstwhile sloop-of-war was used as a coal hulk by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company as late as 1874.

Hairspray was a dramatic departure from Waters's earlier works, with a much broader intended audience. Hairsprays PG is the mildest rating a Waters film has received; most of his previous films were rated X by the MPAA. Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, the film revolves around self-proclaimed \\"pleasantly plump\\" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against racial segregation. Hairspray was only a moderate success upon its initial theatrical release, earning a modest gross of $8 million. However, it managed to attract a larger audience on home video in the early 1990s and became a cult film. The film received critical acclaim and ranks #444 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. It is Divine's final film released during his lifetime, as he died three weeks after its release. In 2002, the film was adapted into a Broadway musical of the same name, which won eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical in 2003. A second film version of Hairspray, an adaptation of the stage musical, was also released by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2007, which included many changes of scripted items from the original. Plot In Baltimore, Maryland in the year 1962, Tracy Turnblad and her best friend, Penny Pingleton, audition for The Corny Collins Show, a popular Baltimore teenage dance show (based on the real- life Buddy Deane Show). Penny is nervous and stumbles over her answers, and another girl, Nadine Carver, is cut for being black (the show has a \\"Negro Day\\" on the last Thursday of every month, she is told). However, despite being overweight, Tracy is a strong enough dancer to become a regular on the show, infuriating the show's reigning queen, Amber Von Tussle, a mean, privileged, beautiful high school classmate whose racist parents, Velma and Franklin Von Tussle, own Tilted Acres Amusement Park and have banned African Americans from going there. Tracy steals Amber's boyfriend, Link Larkin, and competes against her for the title of Miss Auto Show 1963, fueling Amber's hatred of her. Tracy's growing confidence leads to her being hired as a plus-size model for the Hefty Hideaway clothing store owned by Mr. Pinky. She is also inspired to bleach, tease, and rat her big hair into styles popular in the 1960s. At school, a teacher brands her hairdo a \\"hair-don't\\" and sends her to the principal's office, from which Tracy is sent to special education classes, where she meets several black classmates who have been put there to hold them back academically. The students introduce Tracy to Motormouth Maybelle, an R&B; record shop owner and host of the monthly \\"Negro Day\\" on The Corny Collins Show. They teach Tracy, Penny, and Link dance moves and Penny begins an interracial romance with Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed. This horrifies Penny's parents, Prudence and Paddy, who imprison their daughter in her bedroom and try to brainwash her into dating white boys and oppose integration with the help of Dr. Frederickson, a quack psychiatrist. Seaweed later helps her break out of the house and run away. It is implied that she will never return, as she has finally broken free from her parents. Undeterred, Tracy uses her newfound fame to champion the cause of racial integration with the help of Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, his assistant Tammy, and her own agoraphobic, slightly overbearing, overweight mother, Edna. After a race riot at Tilted Acres results in Tracy's arrest, the Von Tussles grow more defiant in their opposition to racial integration. They plot to sabotage the Miss Auto Show 1963 pageant with a bomb hidden in Velma's towering bouffant wig. The plan literally blows up in Velma's face when the bomb detonates prematurely, and the Von Tussles are dragged off by the Baltimore police. Tracy, who had won the crown but was disqualified for being in reform school, dethrones Amber after the governor of Maryland pardons her. She then comes to the pageant, integrates the show, and encourages everyone to dance.

The Corny Collins Show is based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show, a local dance party program which pre-empted Dick Clark's American Bandstand in the Baltimore area during the 1950s and early 1960s. Waters had previously written about The Buddy Deane Show in his 1983 book Crackpot: The Obsessions of John Waters. Principal photography took place in and around the Baltimore area during the summer of 1987. The school scenes were filmed at Perry Hall High School with set locations including the library, a first-floor English class, and the principal's office. In the scene set in the principal's office, the Harry Dorsey Gough (see Perry Hall Mansion) coat-of-arms that once hung in the main lobby can be seen through the doorway. The scenes set at Tilted Acres amusement park were filmed at Dorney Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. According to Debbie Harry, Waters wanted her to perform music for the film as well as act in it, but the record label she was signed to objected. Hairspray was Divine's final film to be released in his lifetime; he died on March 7, 1988, three weeks after the film's premiere and nine days after the film's release. Hairspray was his only film with Waters in which he didn't play the lead. Originally, Divine was considered to play both Tracy Turnblad and her mother Edna. Executives from New Line Cinema, the film's distributor, discouraged this concept, and it was eventually dropped. Instead Divine played Edna Turnblad and Arvin Hodgepile, the racist TV station manager. According to BusinessInsider.com, Hairspray became the most popular movie set in Maryland. =Deleted scenes= A handful of scenes were cut while in post-production, some of which provided context for certain plot developments seen in the finished film. The first scene occurs before Tracy and Penny go the Parkville VFW record hop. Tracy is required to start her first shift working in the Hardy-Har Joke Shop. But after managing to scare away all her customers she is excused to go to the hop. The joke shop customers are still listed in the end credits of the final cut. An additional scene that was removed shows Tracy skipping school, stealing shoes from the Etta Gown Shop, breaking into the Von Tussles' home, and using a bottle of Amber's peroxide to bleach her hair in Amber's sink, thus explaining Tracy's subsequent change of hair color when she auditions for The Corny Collins Show. Another deleted scene involved cockroaches being placed in Tracy's hair. Although removed prior to the film's theatrical release, numerous references to the incident remain in the final edit, including the songs \\"The Roach\\" (1961) by Gene and Wendell and \\"The Bug\\" (1958) by Jerry Dallman and the Knightcaps, as well as Tracy arriving to be crowned \\"Miss Auto Show\\" wearing an evening gown appliqued with black satin cockroaches. When discussing his decision to ultimately cut the scene, Waters explained \\"Bob Shaye, the head of New Line, probably correctly, said, 'This doesn't work. What is this, a Bu√±uel movie?' [...] And he was probably right.\\" The final deleted scene was a musical number which depicted the teens performing an obscure 1960s dance called \\"The Stupidity\\" at the auto show just prior to Tracy being released from reform school, but again, Waters ultimately decided it wasn't appropriate, stating, \\"[B]asically, I thought, you know, you don't want your leading man to look stupid right in the big finale.\\" ReceptionCritical response= Hairspray received three stars from critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. The film holds a 98% \\"certified fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10. It is Waters' second-highest- rated film (behind Multiple Maniacs) on the website. The critical consensus states that \\"Hairspray is perhaps John Waters' most accessible film, and as such, it's a gently subversive slice of retro hilarity.\\" John Waters wrote that his all-time favorite review of Hairspray was David Edelstein's in Rolling Stone: \\"A family movie both the Bradys and the Mansons could adore\\". =Box office= Hairspray opened on February 26, 1988 in 79 North American theaters, where it grossed 577,287 in its opening weekend. On March 11, it expanded to 227 theaters, where it grossed $966,672 from March 11‚Äì13. It ended its theatrical run with $8,271,108. =Awards= The film was nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards, and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Other worksBroadway musical= In mid-2002, Margo Lion teamed with writers Marc Shaiman and Thomas Meehan to turn Hairspray into a Broadway musical production. The show opened on August 15, 2002 starring Marissa Jaret Winokur as Tracy and Harvey Fierstein as Edna. The show went on to win eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical, in 2003. The show closed on January 4, 2009. =2007 film adaptation= In 2006, New Line Cinema joined forces with Adam Shankman to adapt the Broadway show into a movie musical. The film was released July 20, 2007, starring John Travolta as Edna, Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma, Christopher Walken as Wilbur, Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton, Brittany Snow as Amber Von Tussle, Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle, James Marsden as Corny, Zac Efron as Link, and newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy. The film had a $75 million budget and earned over $200 million worldwide. =2016 live television adaptation= NBC aired a special television event of the acclaimed musical on December 7, 2016, starring Harvey Fierstein as Edna, Ariana Grande as Penny Pingleton, Kristin Chenoweth as Velma, Martin Short as Wilbur, Dove Cameron as Amber Von Tussle, Jennifer Hudson as Motormouth Maybelle, Derek Hough as Corny, Garrett Clayton as Link, and newcomer Maddie Baillio as Tracy. It was well received by critics and was seen by 9.05 million viewers, with a ratings share of 2.3 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and a 5.9 overnight household rating. Soundtrack The soundtrack was released in 1988 by MCA Records. The album featured one original song by Rachel Sweet and eleven other songs mostly from the early 1960s by Gene Pitney, Toussaint McCall and The Ikettes, among others. Two songs, \\"You Don't Own Me\\" and \\"Mama Didn't Lie\\", came out in 1963; \\"Nothing Takes the Place of You\\" was released in 1967.

However, the decision to create a settlement where Duaringa exists today was only determined after a devastating flood in 1875.The flood at the Dawson, Rockhampton Bulletin, 1 March 1875. Retrieved 9 December 2016. Prior to the flood, the government had surveyed land where the railway crosses the Dawson River for a major service centre for the railway to be established there. As such, the township of Boolburra was established with many families settling on either side of the river.Bird, J T S (John T S), The early history of Rockhampton, published 1 January 1904 by The Morning Bulletin The bridge across the Dawson River was almost finished in February 1875 when torrential rain began to fall which continued over several days.

When the rescuers arrived, they found thirty residents on the roof of Sheehy's Hotel, while others were stranded on the top of Beattie's Hotel or their own rooftops. Many were suffering from insect bites and severe sunburn. Almost 300 people were rescued from the floodwaters, including four Chinese men who had been without food for five days. While the loss of life was expected to be substantial, the death toll was much less than first anticipated. Several people did lose their lives, including a German man and his three children, though his wife and their baby were found alive on top of a pile of railway sleepers. The people of Rockhampton began donating items to the Boolburra flood victims including blankets, clothing, loaves of bread, meat and rations. After the flood, the government decided to abandon their plan to use Boolburra as the major railway centre it was proposed to be, and instead create a separate settlement seven miles further west along the railway line for that purpose. Boolburra then became an ordinary wayside station instead of its original purpose. The railway line from Boolburra to Duaringa opened on 28 March 1876.

As a result, the Duaringa Divisional Board was formed.Turner, Denise, Duaringa Shire: 100 years of local government (1881-1981), published in 1981 by Duaringa Shire Council, The first meeting of the Duaringa Divisional Board took place on 10 August 1881. Another two meetings took place in 1881 where road repairs, a request to the government for accounting books, a set of by-laws and permission to use the Duaringa Railway Station as a meeting place were among the issues discussed. A rate of sixpence in the pound was levied and sent to all ratepayers in the newly formed division. The Duaringa Divisional Board held its last meeting on 11 June 1903 just prior to the name change to Duaringa Shire Council. A council office and residence was built in 1919. The existing council chambers on the corner of William and Elizabeth Street was officially opened by Minister for Local Government Wallace Rae on 28 November 1970. The construction of a new council library in Elizabeth Street followed, which was opened in October 1977.

The Queensland Government proclaimed the town reserve on 30 October 1878, an area of which was resumed from the Nundubbermere pastoral run. It believed the name derives from an early pastoral run, believed to be an Aboriginal word, meaning she oak tree. The Queensland Railways Department claimed that the origin of the name for the Duaringa railway station meant oak. A book that was published by Duaringa Shire Council in 1981 to mark 100 years of local government explored three versions but concluded that no version could be verified with 100% certainty. The first version published in the book explores the possibility that the word Duaringa originated from the word \\"djuaringe\\" possibly used by Aborigines in the traditional Wakawaka or Barunggam languages in southern parts of Queensland. The word \\"djuaringe\\" is believed to mean \\"to turn oneself around\\" or \\"to turn into something\\". The second and most popular theory is that the town's name is derived from the aboriginal words 'D'warra D'nanjie', meaning a meeting place on the swamp oaks. This is the officially recognised origin of the name Duaringa.Queensland place names search: Duaringa, Department of Natural Resources & Mines, Queensland Government website. Retrieved 9 December 2016. A third version and arguably the most outlandish theory, explored the likelihood of whether the name is linked to a local pioneering family. The book explains that a local well-liked woman named Inga Anderson lived and worked in the Boolburra area. It has been said that the area where she lived was known as \\"Inga's Place\\" or \\"Dear Inga's\\". It's claimed that her descendants believe that the Railways Department invited Inga to see her name \\"Dear Inga\\" painted on the Duaringa Railway Station when it opened in 1876 and somehow was corrupted into the name Duaringa. Anderson went on to marry Moses Wafer of the pioneering Wafer family that settled in the Dingo area. As Duaringa was being established as a railway town in the 1870s, the settlement was known as either \\"The Dawson Seven Mile\\" or \\"Colo\\". In an article in the 27 November 1875 edition of The Capricornian, it was stated that the newspaper understood that the Postmaster-General deemed it undesirable to adopt the name of Colo, as there was already a Colo in New South Wales. The brief article also mentioned that the native name of the area was said to be \\"Duarininga\\" but it was considered too lengthy.Local & General News, The Capricornian, 27 November 1875. Retrieved 9 December 2016. On 4 December 1875, The Capricornian reported that \\"a suitable designation had been found for Colo, alias Seven-mile.\\" The article reported that the native name of Duarininga had been discarded as it was thought to have been too difficult to pronounce, and a \\"euphonious and expressive\\" name of Thorn Town had been selected to honour the Postmaster General, George Thorn, who became the 6th Premier of Queensland the following year.Local & General News, The Capricornian, 4 December 1875. Retrieved 9 December 2016. However, in the following week's edition of The Capricornian, the newspaper retracted their previous report which stated the Dawson Seven-mile township would be called Thorntown, instead of Colo. The newspaper explained their announcement was found to have been premature as those who decide such matters had gone on to reverse their original decision and finally decided to officially call the town by its native name, although \\"slightly contracted\\" from Duarininga to Duaringa.Local & General News, The Capricornian, 18 December 1875.

The first post office to serve the town was the Colo Post Office which opened in November 1875 during a debate on what to call the town. After it was finally decided to call the newly established settlement Duaringa, the Postmaster General's Department advised that from the start of 1876, the post office would be called the Duaringa Post Office. When postmaster Frank Murray took over the post office in 1934, he moved swiftly to gain approvals to build a new post office on the corner of Alice and William Street. The Postmaster General approved, on the condition Murray provided half the cost for the project. The new post office and residence were subsequently built and opened in 1936. The Duaringa LPO still operates from the same building today.Duaringa LPO, Australia Post website. Retrieved 10 December 2016. In the mid 1990s, the building underwent some minor refurbishments to allow the business to provide additional newsagency-like services and products rather than just postal needs. The business changed its name to Duaringa Post Office & News, as they began selling newspapers, magazines, stationery items, greeting cards and scratch-it tickets as well as a limited array of grocery items. =Duaringa Ambulance Centre= Duaringa Ambulance Station, 2012The local ambulance station, opened in 1970, is unique in the fact that it was built almost exclusively by voluntary labour performed by local Duaringa residents. After local postmistress Nancy Andrews donated a substantial parcel of land for the purpose of establishing an ambulance station next to the Duaringa Post Office, the Rockhampton Ambulance Committee engaged the services of architect Edward Hegvold to draw up plans for the proposed building. Once the plans were approved, the voluntary labour commenced construction. Six local residents donated timber, gravel and sand for concreting. Falling, loading, haulage and conversion of the timber was done free of charge. Working bees were held over a number of months which is involved a total of about 80 personnel. 43 people assisted with the foundations and concreting, 30 worked on the carpentry and plumbing, 14 people helped with the painting while two people installed the electrical work.

It was opened on 3 June 1879 with 17-year-old Mary Ann Simpson as head teacher whose sole education experience consisted of being a monitor at Port Curtis Road State School near Rockhampton for a short period. As her teaching skills grew, Simpson was later transferred to a bigger school and was replaced in 1883 by Kate D'Arcy who had received training in Ireland. At the end of her tenure, D'Arcy was teaching between 50 and 60 students in four classes.Murtagh-Scott, Anne, Duaringa State School Centenary (1879-1979), published 1979 by Duaringa State School By 1892, Duaringa had grown to such an extent that the residents began calling for a more suitable and permanent facility ‚Äì a state school. The District School inspector was reluctant and in late 1892, after a building committee for a new school had been formed, advised that he was unsure of whether Duaringa was likely to become a permanent settlement. In spite of this, the department warned that the existing Provincial School was inadequate and warned that if improvements weren't made, the school would be closed. The bark hut was repaired and extended to 7.9 √ó 5.5 m to provide more room for the students and teacher. By 1898, Duaringa had grown further due to the local timber industry flourishing. The building committee raised sufficient funds and a tender to build the new school building was finally accepted. The new school building was completed by October 1899 and was occupied the next month, meaning Duaringa State School was finally established. Throughout the 20th century, the school continued to grow. Two high set buildings were constructed on either side of the first building allowing more rooms to be added to incorporate additional classrooms, staff rooms, offices and a tuckshop. In 1979, Duaringa State School celebrated its centenary. By then, the school had grown to a four-teacher school with 110 students. In 1989, a 15-metre swimming pool was added.

Reception The film was rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America, but earned a B -- \\"objectionable in part\\" -- rating from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting; the latter body observed that \\"the film presents in uncritical fashion a suffocatingly materialistic and amoral environment, has offensive jokes at the expense of people with physical disabilities, and flaunts a gratuitous bit of nudity.\\" Soundtrack Most of the soundtrack was written by Mike Love of the Beach Boys and performed by a studio band assembled by Love known as Celebration. The title song, which became a mid- level hit single (U.S. #28, Canada #30),Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - opens with the lyrics \\"Susie wants to be a lady director, and Eddie wants to drive a hearse; Johnny wants to be a doctor or lawyer, and Linda wants to be a nurse\\" -- reflecting a total lack of world-changing idealism on the part of the teenage characters.

The British captured 4 ships of the line, 2 frigates and 7 merchantmen, in a five-hour battle in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Finisterre in northwest Spain. One French frigate, one French East India Company warship and the other merchantmen escaped. EventsPrelude= France needed to keep shipping lanes open in order to maintain her overseas empire. To this end she assembled merchantmen into convoys protected by warships. Anson on and Rear-Admiral Sir Peter Warren on had sailed from Plymouth on 9 April to intercept French shipping. When a large convoy was sighted Anson had made the signal to form line of battle. When Rear-Admiral Warren, suspecting the enemy to be merely manoeuvring to promote the escape of the convoy, bore down and communicated his opinion to the admiral, the latter threw out a signal for a general chase. =Battle= under a press of sail, was the first to come up with the rearmost French ship, which she attacked heavily and two other ships dropped astern to her support. The action became general when three more British ships, including Devonshire, came up. The French, though much inferior in numbers, fought till seven in the evening, when all but two of their ships were taken, as well as nine East India merchantmen. The French lost 700 men killed and wounded, and the British 520.

Fran√ßois de Grasse later the famous Comte was wounded in this First Battle and taken prisoner as he served on La Gloire, which was captured.

A British fleet of fourteen ships of the line commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Hawke intercepted a French convoy protected by eight French ships of the line commanded by Admiral Desherbiers de l'Etendu√®re. The battle took place in the eastern Atlantic, roughly halfway between Ireland and Cape Finisterre in northwest Spain. It was a decisive British victory that has been described as \\"the most brilliant naval action of the war\\". It put an end to French naval operations for the remainder of the war, thus eliminating any threat of an invasion of Britain and threatening the very existence of France's empire overseas. EventsPrelude= North America was a secondary theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession, principally fought between France and Britain, and was a source of raw materials for both sides. Britain's Royal Navy had disrupted France's transatlantic trade in the past, notably at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre on 14 May 1747. France made a second attempt to reopen the supply routes in October of that year, assembling 252 merchantmen in the Basque Roads off La Rochelle. They would be protected by eight men-of-war from Brest. The British got wind of this huge convoy, and dispatched a squadron of 14 smaller ships from Plymouth on 20 August (9 August Julian). Hawke was given the command at the last minute after Sir Peter Warren had fallen ill with scurvy. The French set off on 17th (6th) October, and were sighted by Hawke's fleet eight days later at 7am. =Battle= Initially Hawke thought he was up against a much larger fleet of warships, and formed a line of battle; when the French responded in kind Hawke realised that he was faced by inferior numbers that could be progressively enveloped by a \\"swarm\\" of ships. This allowed the British to make up for their inferior individual firepower by concentrating their fire on one ship at a time as Anson had done back in May, rather than rigidly sticking to a line of battle. At first the French mistook the British ships for members of the convoy; on realising their mistake the French hoped to use their warships to just divert the British for long enough that the merchants had a chance to escape into the vastness of the Atlantic. Hawke approached from leeward while the French sailed close-hauled in a line ahead, hoping he would engage in a long-range artillery duel. Instead, Hawke made the signal for a general chase, freeing his captains from the constraints of a formal battle. The British overhauled the French line and enveloped it from rear to van, capturing six ships. The Comte de Vaudreuil in Intr√©pide, first in the French line, turned back to help his admiral, allowing both ships to escape. The French also lost 4000 men, which would prove as devastating as the loss of the ships themselves. The merchants escaped under the protection of the Content 64 and Castor 26, and continued across the Atlantic. However most of them were intercepted and captured in the West Indies by Commodore George Pocock in the winter of 1747‚Äì48. =Aftermath= The Marquis of Etendu√®re with a representation of the battle. Three of the six French vessels captured at the Battle of Cape Finisterre; Terrible, Neptune and Severn This disaster convinced the French government of its helplessness at sea, and it made no further efforts to fight convoys through the British blockade. This soon brought most of France's colonies close to starvation particularly in the West Indies. For example, Martinique was successfully blockaded by the Royal Navy from their new base at English Harbour in Antigua thus bringing France to the negotiating table despite her victories in the Low Countries and elsewhere. King Louis decided to give back the Netherlands in return for normality in the colonies. The psychological impact of the battles of Cape Finisterre continued into the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), as King Louis would prove reluctant to send men and supplies to New France and her other colonies.

It was hand-produced by a group of boys living in the Home One barracks, among them editor-in-chief Petr Ginz and Hanu≈° Hachenburg. Altogether, some 800 pages of Vedem survived World War II.  History of the magazine  The magazine was written, edited, and illustrated entirely by young boys, aged twelve to fifteen, who lived in Barracks L417, or Home One, which the boys referred to as the Republic of Shkid. The content of Vedem included poems, essays, jokes, dialogues, literary reviews, stories, and drawings. The issues were then copied manually and read around the barracks on Friday night. For some time, it was also posted on the barracks bulletin board, however, it was decided to discontinue this practice because it was deemed dangerous in case of SS inspections. The inspiration for the authors of Vedem was their teacher, twenty-eight-year-old \\"Professor\\" Valtr Eisinger, who was appointed to supervise the boys in that barracks. He fostered their love of literature and encouraged them to express themselves creatively, describing both what they witnessed (often in a humorous tone) and their hopes for the future. It was probably under his influence that the boys adopted a rocket ship, inspired by Jules Verne, flying past a book to a star, as the symbol of their barracks and of their magazine. Eisinger himself never contributed directly to Vedem, but did add the occasional editorial or translation from Russian. The work itself was done by the boys, who wandered around Terezin looking for themes. Each boy took a nickname to sign their articles. This might have been obscure initials, a pseudonym, or some personal quirk like \\"Dummy\\" or \\"Bolshevik.\\" Sometimes, the nicknames would change. For instance, one prolific contributor, Ji≈ô√≠ Gr√ºnbaum, called himself \\"Medic ≈†najer,\\" \\"Socialist ≈†najer,\\" or just \\"≈†najer,\\" depending on his mood. Hanu≈° Hachenburg contributed several poems and was an avid collaborator. Today, many of the contributors can only be identified by their nicknames, and their true identities are unknown. At some point in 1943, ten of the most prolific contributors began to refer to themselves as the \\"Academy.\\" The boys smuggled in art supplies to work on the magazine. They found an abandoned typewriter and used it to create the first 30 issues. The next 53 issues were made by hand after the typewriter ran out of ink. A boy served as lookout as the rest worked on the wooden table in the middle of the bunkroom, or while sitting on their bunks. If a guard approached, he would give a secret signal and the others would hide their work. Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who carried a drawing by Petr Ginz into space One of the outstanding contributors to Vedem was \\"nz,\\" or Petr Ginz (1928‚Äì1944), who at 14 was editor-in-chief of the magazine. At 16, Ginz was deported to Auschwitz, where he was gassed. A drawing by him of the planet Earth as seen from the Moon was taken by Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon onto the Space Shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated upon its reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. The boys tried as much as possible to create a real magazine, even jokingly adding a price on the cover. The material included poetry, adventure stories, essays, and book reviews, as well as popular features such as the \\"Quote of the Week,\\" chosen from among silly things the boys said. For instance, \\"Medic ≈†najer\\" was once quoted as saying, \\"I am afraid to speak. I might say something stupid.\\" \\"Embryo\\" was quoted as saying, \\"Football is the best game, right after Monopoly.\\" In one edition, a review of Uncle Tom's Cabin compares the fate of African American slaves with that of the Jews in Terez√≠n, noting that until the deportations began, African-Americans had it worse because their families were torn apart; afterward, the suffering of the two groups became approximately equivalent. In the popular feature \\"Rambles through Terez√≠n\\", Petr Ginz visits various institutions throughout the Ghetto, and interviews people there. His rambles include visits to the bakery, the maternity hospital, the fire station, and a very chilling ramble to the crematorium.  Preservation and publication  By 1944, most of the inhabitants of Barracks L417 had been deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and no more issues were produced. Of the 92 boys who participated in the effort to produce Vedem, only fifteen survived. Only one of them, Zdenƒõk Taussig, remained in Terez√≠n until its liberation in May 1945. He had hidden it in a blacksmith shop where his father had worked, and brought it back with him to Prague after he was liberated. After the war, efforts to publish Vedem were thwarted under the communist regime of Czechoslovakia, but excerpts were smuggled to Paris, where they were printed in the Czech √©migr√© magazine Svƒïdectv√≠. A type-written samizdat version was published in Czechoslovakia that same year, and re-released in the 1980s. This version was exhibited in the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1990. Selections from Vedem, illustrated by art that appeared in the magazine and that was created by other children in Terez√≠n, were published with an introduction by V√°clav Havel in 1994 as We Are Children Just the Same: Vedem, the Secret Magazine of the Boys of Terez√≠n. The editors of this selection included Kurt Ji≈ôi Kotouƒç and Zdenƒïk Ornest, two of the original contributors from Terez√≠n. Further reading * Terez√≠n.

This black-and-white film was shot partly on location in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles. The film was written by Daniel Fuchs. Franz Planer's cinematography creates a black-and-white film noir world. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa scored the film's soundtrack.. It was remade as The Underneath in 1995. Plot Reuniting with director Siodmak after their success with Ernest Hemingway's The Killers, Burt Lancaster plays Steve Thompson, a man who seals his dark fate when he returns to Los Angeles to find his ex-wife Anna Dundee (Yvonne De Carlo) eager to rekindle their love against all better judgment. He resumes his old job as a driver at an armored-truck company. Although Anna marries mobster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea), she encourages an affair with Thompson. To deflect suspicion of the affair, Thompson leads Dundee into a daylight armored-truck robbery, only to double cross him when the crime is pulled off. Wounded during the botched robbery, Thompson is recovering in a hospital and considered the hero who wounded the robbers. Dundee has sent a man to the hospital to bring Thompson to him but Thompson bribes the man to drive him to Anna's hiding place where they are to meet and start a new life with the stolen money. But seeing Thompson's wounded condition Anna shocks Thompson with her \\"criss cross\\" by telling him that she will take the money and leave him behind. Thompson is trying to reason with Anna when Dundee arrives. He assumed Thompson would bribe the driver and followed them. He kills both Anna and Thompson, but as he turns to leave, sirens fill the air. Cast * Burt Lancaster as Steve Thompson * Yvonne De Carlo as Anna * Dan Duryea as Slim Dundee * Stephen McNally as Det.

The production nearly derailed when producer Mark Hellinger died suddenly before filming began. Reportedly, Lancaster was unhappy with the way Siodmak and Fuchs had reworked Hellinger's idea of a racetrack heist into a fatal romantic triangle. =Locations= Criss Cross was shot around downtown Los Angeles, beginning with an aerial panorama that ends at a nightclub just north of downtown. Lancaster's character lives with his mother at a house on Hill Street, just above the north entrance of the short Hill Street Tunnel at Temple Street in the Court Hill section of Bunker Hill. The tunnel and the hill above it (including the house) were razed in 1955 for expansion of the Civic Center and a new Los Angeles County Courthouse on Hill Street, which can often be seen in episodes of Perry Mason. For the planning of the heist, Siodmak used the exterior and interiors of the rambling, rundown Sunshine Apartments on the steep Third Street steps between Hill and Olive, just opposite the Angels Flight funicular, seen in the background through the windows of the hotel room. This area of Bunker Hill was a favorite of noir directors, and unfortunately it was all torn down in the 1960s. There is also an extended scene inside and outside Union Station on Alameda. ReceptionCritical response= When released, The New York Times gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"A tough, mildly exciting melodrama about gangsters and a dame named Anna who 'gets into the blood' of a guy named Steve and causes him no end of trouble...In many ways Criss Cross is a suspenseful action picture, due to the resourceful directing of Robert Siodmak. But it also is tedious and plodding at times, due partly to Mr. Siodmak's indulgence of a script that is verbose, redundant and imitative. However, the writers should be credited with having invested the old triangle- gangster formula with a couple of fresh if not exactly revolutionary twists.\\"The New York Times.

It's 1940s film noir at its most influential as far as style goes, that is further enhanced by the beautiful dark photography of Frank Planer, the tight script by Daniel Fuchs, and the taut pacing by Siodmak. It's based on a story by Don Tracy ... Siodmak keeps the suspense at a feverish pitch, and the characterizations are well drawn out.

At the end of the summer's midshipmen cruises, she sailed to New York City, where she was commissioned on 6 September 1851 with Lieutenant J. W. Livingston in command. On 9 September 1851, John Hancock departed New York for Havana, Cuba, to assist in suppressing the last filibustering expedition led by Narciso L√≥pez, which had been launched from the United States in violation of American neutrality laws. She arrived at Havana on 29 September 1851, but her duty there terminated on 3 October 1851, when extremely stormy weather damaged her and caused her to return to Boston via Charleston, South Carolina, and New York. She was placed in ordinary at the Boston Navy Yard and rebuilt almost entirely. She received a new bow and stern, increasing her length to 165 ft 6 in and her displacement to 382 tons but not affecting her beam or draft. John Hancock was relaunched on 24 February 1853 and recommissioned 19 March 1853 with Lieutenant John Rodgers in command. =Survey ship, 1853-1856= John Hancock stood out of New York Harbor on 3 May 1853 and joined Commander Cadwallader Ringgold's North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition at Hampton Roads three days later. United States Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin visited the ship at Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 June 1853, nine days before the squadron sailed for the Pacific. After stopping at Funchal in the Madeira Islands, Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Islands; and Simonstown, False Bay, in the Cape Colony, the expedition arrived Batavia on Java in the Netherlands East Indies on 12 December 1853. The expedition devoted the next five months to conducting hydrographic surveys of the waters surrounding the large islands off the coast of Southeast Asia. Early in May 1854, John Hancock departed for Hong Kong, where she arrived on 24 May 1854. The squadron operated from Hong Kong as its base throughout the summer of 1854, surveying nearby coast, islands, and rivers. At this time China was plagued by rebellion and pirates endangering foreigners and threatening their property. The American ships were a source of stability and order protecting American citizens and interests. While John Hancock steamed up the Canton River in China, rebel Chinese artillery batteries fired on two of her armed boats from John Hancock, which promptly returned fire and silenced the Chinese guns. Serious illness compelled Commander Ringgold to relinquish command of the expedition on 11 August 1854, leaving Lieutenant Rodgers in charge. Lieutenant Henry K. Stevens then took command of John Hancock. She departed Hong Kong on 9 September 1854 and sailed north along the coast of China, surveying as she went. She arrived at Shanghai, China, on 27 November 1854 and remained there under repair until 28 January 1855, when she resumed surveying operations which took her north along the eastern coast of Asia to the Bering Sea before she turned south along the western coast of North America. Besides greatly increasing knowledge of the western and northern Pacific Ocean, stimulating commerce, and easing navigation in previously unknown seas, the operations helped to establish friendly relations between the United States and several countries in East Asia. John Hancock arrived at San Francisco, California on 19 October 1855. After repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on 20 March 1856 bound for Puget Sound to help suppress Native American uprisings which threatened to wipe out U.S. civilian settlements and United States Army outposts established in the early 1850s. She arrived at Seattle, Washington Territory, on 28 March 1856 and operated from that port as a base until 4 August 1856, when she stood down Puget Sound bound for San Francisco. She arrived at San Francisco on 17 August 1856. John Hancock decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 23 August 1856 and remained there in ordinary until sold at auction on 17 August 1865. =Later career= John Hancock later operated under the control of the United States Department of Statealaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (J) and then served as a floating powder magazine in Mission Bay in San Francisco.cimorelli.com John Hancock (schooner) Subsequently, Middlemass & Boole purchased her, rigged her as a topsail schooner, and placed her in service as a cod-fishing vessel. Under her final owners, Lynde and Hough, John Hancock departed San Francisco on 8 February 1893 bound for Sand Point on the northwestern coast of Popof Island in the Shumagin Islands off the south coast of the Alaska Peninsula in the Territory of Alaska. While moored at the wharf at Sand Point on 7 March 1893 with a crew of eight and a cargo of 80 tons of salt and provisions aboard, she broke loose from her moorings during a storm and was stranded. Her crew survived, but she and her cargo both were a total loss.

It is measured from . It is served by both Southern and Thameslink, and it is in Travelcard Zone 3. History Tulse Hill station was opened in 1868 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on their line from London Bridge. In 1869, this was joined by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's \\"Metropolitan Extension\\" line to Holborn Viaduct. The LB&SCR;'s through line to Streatham and Wimbledon opened in 1871. The station originally had a bowstring-arched iron and glass roof covering all four platforms. and the brick retaining walls of this structure survive. However, it appears that the roof was demolished as a precautionary measure following the collapse of a similar one at Charing Cross in 1905, and individual platform canopies were then introduced. These had no proper foundations, and gradually subsided until the last of the Edwardian canopies were replaced in the 1990s by British Rail. Some modernisation of the station, including a new covered entrance on the east side, took place under the operator Southern, and ticket gates (funded by the Transport Department) were installed in 2009. The station can accommodate eight-car trains; the complex sections of track at each end of the station and a large bridge which cannot be moved mean it cannot be extended to accommodate longer ones.Thameslink Programme Services The typical off-peak service frequency is: * 4 trains per hour to London Bridge via Peckham Rye (Southern) * 2 trains per hour to West Croydon via Norbury (Southern) * 2 trains per hour to Beckenham Junction via Crystal Palace (Southern) * 4 trains per hour to St Albans City via London Blackfriars (On Sundays, some services are extended to Luton) (Thameslink) * 2 trains per hour to Sutton via Mitcham Junction (and then clockwise around the Sutton loop) (Thameslink) * 2 trains per hour to Sutton via Wimbledon (and then anticlockwise around the Sutton loop) (Thameslink) There are also some peak hour Southern services from London Bridge to Sutton via the Wimbledon loop.

Early life and career Bell was born in Southgate, North London on 18 October 1941, to Belfast-born Arthur Leigh Bell, a Crosse & Blackwell sales representative, and Greta Mary Finlay, an Australian.

On 19 November 1977 Bell was fined ¬£50 for indecency. He had exposed himself while masturbating at his Hampstead bathroom window on 21 October in full view of female passers-by.Mark Hollingsworth The Ultimate spin doctor: the life and fast times of Tim Bell, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1997, p.45Brian Basham \\"Thatcher exposed in Tim Bell revelations\\", Marketing Week, 14 March 1997 He left the Saatchis to join Frank Lowe and Geoff Howard-Spink in 1985 to have his name on the door at Lowe Howard-Spink and Bell where he served as deputy chairman. Later, in 1989 he bought out the PR division which became his own agency, Lowe Bell Communications, and he became chairman of Chime Communications in 1994 (which included the Bell Pottinger group). Thatcher years Bell was instrumental in the Conservative general election campaign victories of Margaret Thatcher and was seen as Thatcher's \\"favourite spin-doctor and confidante.\\" For her first 1979 victory, he developed the strategy for the 'Labour Isn't Working' campaign, created by Saatchi creative director Jeremy Sinclair and Bell advised the future Prime Minister on interview techniques, clothing, and even hairstyle choices. He also courted newspaper editors and worked on devastating attacks on the Labour Party. In 1984 Bell was seconded to the National Coal Board to advise on media strategy at the start of the miners' strike. He worked on media relations and helped set the terms of the negotiations and course of government policy. Bell was knighted in 1991 after nomination by Margaret Thatcher, and created a Life Peer after nomination as a Conservative working peer as Baron Bell of Belgravia in the City of Westminster on 31 July 1998. He was often later seen on panels and current affairs programmes discussing the issues of the day, and was chairman of the Conservative Party's Keep the ¬£ Campaign. He also served on various arts and public administration bodies. On 8 April 2013 it was Bell who officially announced the news of Lady Thatcher's death.

Lord Bell, a friend of Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, handled the media attention behind poisoned Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died in hospital 23 November 2006. The Bell Pottinger Communications agency distributed a photograph showing a hairless Litvinenko in his hospital bed. The PR Agency also offered advice to relatives of Litvinenko and his spokesman Alex Goldfarb. In December 2006, Lord Bell successfully lobbied on behalf of the Saudi government to discontinue the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribes in the Al Yamamah arms deal. Lord Bell also performed public relations work for the authoritarian government of Belarus,\\"No breakthrough in Belarus\\", The Economist, 2 October 2008 and for the Pinochet Foundation (Fundaci√≥n Pinochet). In addition, he worked as an advisor to former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In late 2011, Bell's lobbying interests were investigated by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism for The Independent newspaper which reported claims that the company attempts to interfere with Google results to \\"drown\\" out coverage of human rights abuses, that his employees had altered English Wikipedia entries to create a better impression of clients and had easy access (via former Conservative MP Tim Collins) to the Cameron government and others overseas.Melanie Newman and Oliver Wright \\"Caught on camera: top lobbyists boasting how they influence the PM\\", The Independent, 6 December 2011 Bell Pottinger, via a sting operation, were found to be willing to work for the authoritarian regime in Uzbekistan.

Bell Pottinger exit under cloud of PR malpractice Bell Pottinger announced Lord Bell's departure as chairman to set up an advisory firm, Sans Fronti√®res Associates, in August 2016. He retained a 7% stake in Bell Pottinger. Tony Walford, partner at Green Square stated, \\"Perhaps not coincidentally, Sans Fronti√®res was the original name of the public relations firm he set up before it was renamed Bell Pottinger; it was also the name of the unit that handled the firm's controversial lobbying and consultancy work for the governments of countries such as Belarus and Sri Lanka.\\" A \\"leading PR figure\\" told The Times that his resignation from his own agency didn't come as a surprise, saying: \\"Ultimately, he did not fit with the kind of corporate image Bell Pottinger wanted to project\\", in the end. Walford explains that, \\"there is big money to be made from representing governments and other entities, no matter how reviled they are. The problem is, this kind of activity sits increasingly uneasily with corporates keen on projecting a responsible image.\\" In January 2017 the Huffington Post reported that Johann Rupert, CEO of Remgro and Richemont, ended an 18-year-old contract with Bell Pottinger due to their 'concerted effort on social and other media to discredit him'. Rupert had spoken out against state capture and called on President Jacob Zuma to resign \\"for the sake of our children\\". As the Guptas back Zuma, Rupert asserted that Bell Pottinger painted him as the embodiment of white monopoly capital and as the counterweight to the Guptas and state capture, an example of how state capture allegedly worked under apartheid. Eleven months after leaving Bell Pottinger and six days after the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) acknowledged receipt of the Democratic Alliance's complaint, on 11 July 2017 Bell announces for the first recorded time to PRWeek that he had left Bell Pottinger after raising his concerns about its \\"smelly\\" relationship with the Gupta family's Oakbay conglomerate in South Africa but that they had \\"completely ignored me\\"; Bell Pottinger denied his claims. The PRCA expelled Bell Pottinger for at least five years from September 2017 for inflaming racial tensions in South Africa. The PRCA found Bell Pottinger guilty of four breaches of its code of conduct and dispensed its toughest possible punishment. PRCA director-general, Francis Ingham told the FT, \\"This is the most blatant instance of unethical PR practice I‚Äôve ever seen. Bell Pottinger's work has set back South Africa by possibly 10 years.\\" During a live Newsnight interview on 4 September 2017, Lord Bell mentioned that he was the most senior director at the several hour long initial meeting with the Guptas. Bell explained to Kirsty Wark that upon his return to London he told Bell Pottinger CEO James Henderson, \\"it's a very interesting piece of business but we can't handle it because there's a conflict of interest\\". Wark then read Bell his own email, dated 26 January 2016, stating, \\"The trip was a great success and we will put forward a deal whereby we will earn ¬£100,000 per month plus costs and I will oversee this and make further reports.\\" Wark asserted that the email was in \\"direct conflict with what you just said\\". Bell went on to deny this on the basis the email was sent before his return to London. Rather than oversee the deal, Bell claimed that upon his return \\"I did absolutely nothing\\", but Bell Pottinger \\"submitted a [fee] proposal\\". Bell went on to deny Wark's assertion that he is the senior figure working on the Gupta account, but rather he is a \\"father figure of the meeting\\". Wark asked that when Bell, as the founder of the company, stated that there was a conflict of interest, \\"nobody listens? Really?\\". Bell responded, \\"Nobody listens to me. That's why I left the company\\". Wark then produced a further Bell-authored email, dated 3 months later (April 2016), in which Bell offered further advice regarding the account. Bell retorted, \\"You can attack me all you like but I had nothing to do with getting this account.\\" Bell's Newsnight performance was pilloried by the UK press, with The Spectator labelling it, \\"Lord Bell's Newsnight PR disaster\\". The Daily Expresss take was, \\"Lord Bell was left red-faced after his phone rang twice while he was live on air during a Newsnight interview.\\". An alternative view of what happened was published in The Drum on 5 September 2019. It stated Bell had a genuine desire to help the Indian-descended Guptas from being discriminated against in South Africa. However, Bell suffered a stroke in 2016 and was put on three months medical leave. CEO James Henderson used Bell's absence to ensure the account was run exclusively by his financial PR Team, under Victoria Geoghegan. Fake Twitter accounts were set up accusing white businessmen, such as Johann Rupert, of \\"white monopoly capital\\". When Bell returned from medical leave, he had a row with Henderson telling him he had to resign the account and when he refused, Bell resigned from the company. After the story broke in 2017, Johann Rupert claimed Bell was \\"the only person to have acted with honour in the entire affair.\\"https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/09/05/with-the-passing-lord-bell- i-fear-we-will-not-see-his-again The story of Bell's rise and fall was documented in the 2020 documentary film 'Influence' directed by Richard Poplak and Diana Neille. Personal life Bell was married three times: first, in the 1960s, to Suzanne Cordran (marriage dissolved in 1985); in 1988 he married Virginia Hornbrook with whom he had a son and daughter (marriage dissolved in 2016); in 2017, he married Jacky Phillips.

It closed in May 2012 after more than 30 years of service. In 2017 Radio Caroline started broadcasting on 648 kHz. The station was designed to transmit powerful medium wave (AM) signals to much of Europe on two frequencies, 648 and 1296 kHz. Built by the British government, the facility passed through various owners after privatisation in 1997. From 2010, it was owned by a large engineering and defence services company, the Babcock International Group. The current owner of the site is a telecommunications company called Cobra Mist Limited, set up in 2015.Update on Orford Ness Article on the station by Alan Pennington and Dave Kenny in Communication, monthly journal of the British DX Club, September 2016. Over the years, the Orfordness station carried a variety of radio services. It was best known, particularly in the UK, for transmitting the BBC World Service in English around the clock on 648 kHz from September 1982 until March 2011. The station's name is written as one word while that of the shingle spit on which it sits is two words. History The former Cobra Mist building in October 2004 The site was originally built in the late 1960s for an experimental over-the-horizon radar station known as Cobra Mist. The radar never worked satisfactorily and the project was scrapped in 1973. The site and buildings were taken over in 1975 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Communications Engineering Department (still better known by its previous name, the Diplomatic Wireless Service), who installed a 50-kW medium- wave broadcast transmitter.Orfordness Transmitting Station, Orford, Suffolk History of the station, written in July 2011 by Andy Matheson and reproduced in Communication, monthly journal of the British DX Club, September 2011. Following successful tests and the installation of further transmitters, from 1978 the site gradually took over responsibility for the BBC's medium-wave services to Europe which had been provided since the Second World War by an FCO transmitting station at Crowborough in Sussex. From September 1982, Orfordness handled all such BBC transmissions. In 1986, the BBC itself took over the running of the site from the FCO, although the latter retained ownership of the station. In 1997, as part of the privatization of all transmitting stations in the UK used by the BBC, the station was bought by Merlin Communications International Ltd (usually known simply as Merlin), a company formed by former BBC engineers and frequency managers. In 2001, Merlin was acquired by VT Group plc (known as Vosper Thorneycroft until 2002) and renamed VT Merlin Communications, then just VT Communications. In 2010, VT Communications was bought by Babcock. BBC's use of the two frequencies From September 1982, the 648 kHz channel was used to carry BBC World Service programmes in English around the clock. From 1987 and into the 1990s, the channel carried a tailored service, branded BBC 648, in which some French and German programmes were interwoven with the main output in English. The French service closed in 1995, 75 years BBC World Service - A History. and the BBC's German service in 1999, and 648 reverted to being English-only. BBC's German Service goes off air, BBC News, 27 March 1999. () The 1296 kHz channel was used for BBC broadcasts in east European languages during the evening and early morning. This use of 1296 was phased out after it became possible to relay the BBC on FM within the target countries, following the end of the Cold War. Final years of operation 648 kHz: Following cuts in the BBC World Service budget, its transmissions in English on 648 from Orfordness ceased at 0000 GMT/UTC on 27 March 2011. The 648 channel came back on the air in August and September 2011 as a temporary measure for the Dutch domestic news/information network Radio 1.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide. 22 September 2011. 1296 kHz: In 2001, the Dutch station Radio Nationaal hired the use of 1296 to beam its signal to the target audience in the Netherlands and Belgium. In 2008, an EU-funded programme in English, Network Europe, was aired on 1296 for half-an-hour a day. Between 2003 and 2012, BBC World Service used Orfordness on 1296 kHz at limited times of the day for transmissions using the DRM digital radio system. Radio Netherlands hired 1296 at other times of the day for analogue broadcasts in Dutch. The final transmission from Orfordness (on either frequency) was a farewell 24-hour broadcast by Radio Netherlands on 10‚Äì11 May 2012, marking the end of its Dutch service. RNW Dutch service to end with 24-hour broadcast Radio Netherlands Worldwide. 7 May 2012. Status of the site since the end of broadcasts In October 2012, the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom withdrew Babcock‚Äôs authorisation to use 648 kHz. Future use of 648 kHz medium wave OfCom. 6 November 2012. Notionally, therefore, Babcock still retained the right to transmit from Orfordness on the other frequency (1296 kHz). However, no further broadcasts were made. Prior to selling the site to Cobra Mist Ltd, Babcock removed all transmitter equipment, although as of August 2016 all three aerial systems were still standing.Update on Orford Ness Article on the station by Alan Pennington and Dave Kenny in Communication, monthly journal of the British DX Club, September 2016. In 2017 Cobra Mist Ltd entered into an agreement with Radio Caroline to transmit their services on 648kHz using the omni-directional mast. Test transmissions began in November 2017 and full service commenced on 22 December 2017. The Ofcom licence for 648kHz was awarded to Radio Caroline in June 2017. Transmitters A number of transmitters were installed on the site over the years, the most powerful being an AEG-Telefunken S4006 which had a maximum output of 600 kW. However, registration listings for both 648 and 1296 kHz always gave 500 kW as the maximum power used on both frequencies. Transmissions on 648 kHz from the AEG- Telefunken S4006 used dynamic carrier control, an energy-saving technique in which the power of the transmitter's carrier signal is reduced when the audio level is low. Other transmitters included two Doherty 250 kW units, designated ORF 2A and 2B (both originally at Crowborough), whose outputs could be combined to give 500 kW on a single frequency.Tricks of the Trade Article by Dave Porter, Andy Matheson and Pete Edwards in Signal magazine, issue 14. A DRM-capable Nautel NA200 transmitter was commissioned in 2003 and radiated digital signals on 1296 kHz. It was designated ORF 4. Although rated at 200 kW, when operating in DRM mode it generally ran with an output power of 35 kW. The original 50 kW transmitter (a Continental Electronics type 317), installed at Orfordness in 1975 and used for the station's initial tests, was brought back into service following the major storm that hit southern England during the night of 15-16 October 1987. Aerial systems Aerials at Orfordness The station has two directional aerial (antenna) systems: one for 648 kHz and one for 1296 kHz. The directional aerial for 648 kHz (erected in 1981-82) consists of a row of five 106.7 metre (350 ft) freestanding steel lattice towers of triangular cross section, insulated at their base. All five towers were driven. It was beamed at 131 degrees (i.e. south-east) though for practical purposes the bearing was nominal as the beam was very broad towards the east and south. It provided daytime coverage of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, north-east France and north-west Germany by ground wave propagation; and night-time coverage of much of Europe by skywave propagation. The directional aerial for 1296 kHz (erected in 1978) consistes of six freestanding steel lattice towers. Unlike the directional aerial for 648 kHz, they are arranged in two parallel rows with three towers in each. Only the middle tower of each three was driven; the other towers acted as passive reflector and director elements. It was beamed at 96 degrees (i.e. east) and was originally mainly intended for night-time (skywave) coverage of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the western USSR, key target areas for the BBC during the Cold War. It could also be used for daytime coverage of the Netherlands and Belgium. Both the 648 and 1296 directional aerials have limited radiation to the west, meaning that, despite the high power of the transmitters, reception of Orfordness within the UK was poor or non-existent, with the notable exception of parts of south-east England (including London) and East Anglia. There is also a back-up omni-directional mast radiator for 648 kHz, erected in 1983, which can only handle transmitter powers of up to 250 kW and was used when maintenance work was being carried out on the directional antenna.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States defines heritage tourism as \\"traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past\\", and \\"heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources\\". Culture Culture has always been a major part of travel, as the development of the Grand Tour from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism; tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. Culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. According to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, archaeology and interaction with local people. Cultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism. As Benjamin Porter and Noel B. Salazar have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved. Cultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of sustainable development such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. (J. M. Fladmark, 1994) Heritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old canals, railways, battlegrounds, military sites, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a diaspora who have distant family roots there. Immigration Decolonization and immigration form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.Winter, T. (2007). Post- Conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism: Tourism, Politics and Development at Angkor. Routledge. Another possible form involves religious travel or pilgrimages. Many Catholics from around the world come to the Vatican and other sites such as Lourdes or F√°tima. Islam commands its followers to take the hajj to Mecca, thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.Basu, P. (2007). Highland homecomings: Genealogy and heritage tourism in the Scottish diaspora. Routledge. Heritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.Timothy, D., & Olsen, D. (Eds.). (2006). Tourism, religion and spiritual journeys. Routledge. Indigenous peoples Anthropology and Ethnology were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures.Harris, M. (2001).

Community tourism in Sierra Leone: The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner Another problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted end of the Maya Calendar. However, some activists claim the indigenous Maya are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks. = Cultural tourism = Promotion and facilitation  Heritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish Bydgoszcz or Warsaw. There are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance European Route of Brick Gothic and many others (Cultural Route of the Council of Europe).

Significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton (spaceflight osteopenia). Other significant effects include a slowing of cardiovascular system functions, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, eyesight disorders and changes in the immune system. Additional symptoms include fluid redistribution (causing the \\"moon-face\\" appearance typical in pictures of astronauts experiencing weightlessness), loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and excess flatulence. The engineering problems associated with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of hours of research have been spent on them. In recent years there has been an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body. In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to space exploration, including a human mission to Mars. On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results, from the Astronaut Twin Study, where one astronaut twin spent a year in space on the International Space Station, while the other twin spent the year on Earth, which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other. In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clot problems while on board the International Space Station, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the researchers. Physiological effects Many of the environmental conditions experienced by humans during spaceflight are very different from those in which humans evolved; however, technology such as that offered by a spaceship or spacesuit is able to shield people from the harshest conditions. The immediate needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by a life support system, a group of devices that allow human beings to survive in outer space. The life support system supplies air, water and food. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary. Some hazards are difficult to mitigate, such as weightlessness, also defined as a microgravity environment. Living in this type of environment impacts the body in three important ways: loss of proprioception, changes in fluid distribution, and deterioration of the musculoskeletal system. On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken trips in space, based on MRI studies. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes. In October 2018, NASA-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space, including travel to the planet Mars, may substantially damage the gastrointestinal tissues of astronauts. The studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts, and age them prematurely. In March 2019, NASA reported that latent viruses in humans may be activated during space missions, adding possibly more risk to astronauts in future deep-space missions. =Research= Space medicine is a developing medical practice that studies the health of astronauts living in outer space. The main purpose of this academic pursuit is to discover how well and for how long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can re-adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from space. Space medicine also seeks to develop preventive and palliative measures to ease the suffering caused by living in an environment to which humans are not well adapted. =Ascent and re-entry= During takeoff and re-entry space travelers can experience several times normal gravity. An untrained person can usually withstand about 3g, but can blackout at 4 to 6g. G-force in the vertical direction is more difficult to tolerate than a force perpendicular to the spine because blood flows away from the brain and eyes. First the person experiences a temporary loss of vision and then at higher g-forces loses consciousness. G-force training and a G-suit which constricts the body to keep more blood in the head can mitigate the effects. Most spacecraft are designed to keep g-forces within comfortable limits. =Space environments= The environment of space is lethal without appropriate protection: the greatest threat in the vacuum of space derives from the lack of oxygen and pressure, although temperature and radiation also pose risks. The effects of space exposure can result in ebullism, hypoxia, hypocapnia, and decompression sickness. In addition to these, there is also cellular mutation and destruction from high energy photons and sub-atomic particles that are present in the surroundings. Decompression is a serious concern during the extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) of astronauts. NASA TP-2001-210196. Retrieved 2012-09-23. Current EMU designs take this and other issues into consideration, and have evolved over time. A key challenge has been the competing interests of increasing astronaut mobility (which is reduced by high-pressure EMUs, analogous to the difficulty of deforming an inflated balloon relative to a deflated one) and minimising decompression risk.

Vacuum This 1768 painting, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, depicts an experiment performed by Robert Boyle in 1660 to test the effect of a vacuum on a living system. Human physiology is adapted to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and a certain amount of oxygen is required in the air we breathe. If the body does not get enough oxygen, then the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from hypoxia. In the vacuum of space, gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness. Exposure to vacuum for up to 30 seconds is unlikely to cause permanent physical damage. Animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds, while longer full-body exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful. There is only a limited amount of data available from human accidents, but it is consistent with animal data. Limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired. In December 1966, aerospace engineer and test subject Jim LeBlanc of NASA was participating in a test to see how well a pressurized space suit prototype would perform in vacuum conditions. To simulate the effects of space, NASA constructed a massive vacuum chamber from which all air could be pumped. At some point during the test, LeBlanc's pressurization hose became detached from the space suit. Even though this caused his suit pressure to drop from to in less than 10 seconds, LeBlanc remained conscious for about 14 seconds before losing consciousness due to hypoxia; the much lower pressure outside the body causes rapid de- oxygenation of the blood. \\"As I stumbled backwards, I could feel the saliva on my tongue starting to bubble just before I went unconscious and that's the last thing I remember,\\" recalls LeBlanc. The chamber was rapidly pressurized and LeBlanc was given emergency oxygen 25 seconds later. He recovered almost immediately with just an earache and no permanent damage. Another effect from a vacuum is a condition is called ebullism which results from the formation of bubbles in body fluids due to reduced ambient pressure, the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. 942 pages. Technically, ebullism is considered to begin at an elevation of around or pressures less than 6.3 kPa (47 mm Hg), known as the Armstrong limit. Experiments with other animals have revealed an array of symptoms that could also apply to humans. The least severe of these is the freezing of bodily secretions due to evaporative cooling. Severe symptoms, such as loss of oxygen in tissue, followed by circulatory failure and flaccid paralysis would occur in about 30 seconds. The lungs also collapse in this process, but will continue to release water vapour leading to cooling and ice formation in the respiratory tract. A rough estimate is that a human will have about 90 seconds to be recompressed, after which death may be unavoidable. Swelling from ebullism can be reduced by containment in a flight suit which are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km. During the Space Shuttle program astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called a Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS) which prevented ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa (15 mm Hg). The only humans known to have died of exposure to vacuum in space are the three crew-members of the Soyuz 11 spacecraft; Vladislav Volkov, Georgi Dobrovolski, and Viktor Patsayev. During preparations for re-entry from orbit on June 30, 1971, a pressure-equalisation valve in the spacecraft's descent module unexpectedly opened at an altitude of , causing rapid depressurisation and the subsequent death of the entire crew. Temperature In a vacuum, there is no medium for removing heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so there is no danger of immediately freezing. Rapid evaporative cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard. Exposure to the intense radiation of direct, unfiltered sunlight would lead to local heating, though that would likely be well distributed by the body's conductivity and blood circulation. Other solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet rays, however, may cause severe sunburn. Radiation RAD on the MSL (2011‚Äì2013). Without the protection of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed to high levels of radiation. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside the protection of low Earth orbit, galactic cosmic rays present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Solar flare events (though rare) can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes. It is thought that protective shielding and protective drugs may ultimately lower the risks to an acceptable level. Crew living on the International Space Station (ISS) are partially protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around the earth and the ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary human missions are much more vulnerable. Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful solar flare ever recorded. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a flare of this magnitude could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death. A video made by the crew of the International Space Station showing the Aurora Australis, which is caused by high-energy particles in the space environment. There is scientific concern that extended spaceflight might slow down the body's ability to protect itself against diseases. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and cause both short and long-term damage to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. In particular, it causes 'chromosomal aberrations' in lymphocytes. As these cells are central to the immune system, any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body‚Äîwhich would normally be suppressed‚Äîbecome active. In space, T-cells (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems. On 31 May 2013, The NASA scientists reported that a possible human mission to Mars may involve a great radiation risk based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the RAD on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011‚Äì2012. In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25-times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month. =Weightlessness= ISS in weightless conditions. Michael Foale can be seen exercising in the foreground. Following the advent of space stations that can be inhabited for long periods of time, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the earth, and so in response to weightlessness, various physiological systems begin to change, and in some cases, atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, some do have a long-term impact on human health. Short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, one of the most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system. As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts. Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, distorted vision, and a loss of taste and smell. A 2006 Space Shuttle experiment found that Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, became more virulent when cultivated in space. On April 29, 2013, scientists in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, funded by NASA, reported that, during spaceflight on the International Space Station, microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways \\"not observed on Earth\\" and in ways that \\"can lead to increases in growth and virulence\\". More recently, in 2017, bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the near- weightlessness of space. Microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space. Motion sickness Bruce McCandless II floating free in orbit with a space suit and Manned Maneuvering Unit. The most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. Bone and muscle deterioration Aboard the International Space Station, astronaut Frank De Winne is attached to the COLBERT with bungee cords A major effect of long-term weightlessness involves the loss of bone and muscle mass. Without the effects of gravity, skeletal muscle is no longer required to maintain posture and the muscle groups used in moving around in a weightless environment differ from those required in terrestrial locomotion. In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back muscles or leg muscles used for standing up. Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller. Consequently, some muscles atrophy rapidly, and without regular exercise astronauts can lose up to 20% of their muscle mass in just 5 to 11 days. The types of muscle fibre prominent in muscles also change. Slow-twitch endurance fibres used to maintain posture are replaced by fast-twitch rapidly contracting fibres that are insufficient for any heavy labour. Advances in research on exercise, hormone supplements, and medication may help maintain muscle and body mass. Bone metabolism also changes. Normally, bone is laid down in the direction of mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment, there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip, and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms that resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place‚Äîneither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region because this is the region that carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3‚Äì4 month trip into space, it takes about 2‚Äì3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise, and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone. To prevent some of these adverse physiological effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia. Currently, NASA is using advanced computational tools to understand how to best counteract the bone and muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts in microgravity environments for prolonged periods of time. The Human Research Program's Human Health Countermeasures Element chartered the Digital Astronaut Project to investigate targeted questions about exercise countermeasure regimes. NASA is focusing on integrating a model of the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) currently on board the International Space Station with OpenSim musculoskeletal models of humans exercising with the device. The goal of this work is to use inverse dynamics to estimate joint torques and muscle forces resulting from using the ARED, and thus more accurately prescribe exercise regimens for the astronauts. These joint torques and muscle forces could be used in conjunction with more fundamental computational simulations of bone remodeling and muscle adaptation in order to more completely model the end effects of such countermeasures, and determine whether a proposed exercise regime would be sufficient to sustain astronaut musculoskeletal health. Fluid redistribution The effects of microgravity on fluid distribution around the body (greatly exaggerated). The Beckman Physiological and Cardiovascular Monitoring System in the Gemini and Apollo suits would inflate and deflate cuffs to stimulate blood flow to lower limbs Astronaut Clayton Anderson observes as a water bubble floats in front of him on the Space Shuttle Discovery. Water cohesion plays a bigger role in microgravity than on Earth In space, astronauts lose fluid volume‚Äîincluding up to 22% of their blood volume. Because it has less blood to pump, the heart will atrophy. A weakened heart results in low blood pressure and can produce a problem with \\"orthostatic tolerance\\", or the body's ability to send enough oxygen to the brain without the astronaut's fainting or becoming dizzy. \\"Under the effects of the earth's gravity, blood and other body fluids are pulled towards the lower body. When gravity is taken away or reduced during space exploration, the blood tends to collect in the upper body instead, resulting in facial edema and other unwelcome side effects. Upon return to earth, the blood begins to pool in the lower extremities again, resulting in orthostatic hypotension.\\" Disruption of senses=Vision= In 2013 NASA published a study that found changes to the eyes and eyesight of monkeys with spaceflights longer than 6 months. Noted changes included a flattening of the eyeball and changes to the retina. Space traveler's eye-sight can become blurry after too much time in space. Another effect is known as cosmic ray visual phenomena. Since dust can not settle in zero gravity, small pieces of dead skin or metal can get in the eye, causing irritation and increasing the risk of infection. Long spaceflights can also alter a space traveler's eye movements (particularly the vestibulo-ocular reflex). Intracranial pressure Because weightlessness increases the amount of fluid in the upper part of the body, astronauts experience increased intracranial pressure. This appears to increase pressure on the backs of the eyeballs, affecting their shape and slightly crushing the optic nerve. This effect was noticed in 2012 in a study using MRI scans of astronauts who had returned to Earth following at least one month in space. Such eyesight problems could be a major concern for future deep space flight missions, including a crewed mission to the planet Mars. If indeed elevated intracranial pressure is the cause, artificial gravity might present one solution, as it would for many human health risks in space. However, such artificial gravitational systems have yet to be proven. More, even with sophisticated artificial gravity, a state of relative microgravity may remain, the risks of which remain unknown. =Taste= One effect of weightlessness on humans is that some astronauts report a change in their sense of taste when in space. Some astronauts find that their food is bland, others find that their favorite foods no longer taste as good (one who enjoyed coffee disliked the taste so much on a mission that he stopped drinking it after returning to Earth); some astronauts enjoy eating certain foods that they would not normally eat, and some experience no change whatsoever. Multiple tests have not identified the cause, and several theories have been suggested, including food degradation, and psychological changes such as boredom. Astronauts often choose strong-tasting food to combat the loss of taste. Additional physiological effects Within one month the human skeleton fully extends in weightlessness, causing height to increase by an inch. After two months, calluses on the bottoms of feet molt and fall off from lack of use, leaving soft new skin. Tops of feet become, by contrast, raw and painfully sensitive, as they rub against the handrails feet are hooked into for stability. Tears cannot be shed while crying, as they stick together into a ball. In microgravity odors quickly permeate the environment, and NASA found in a test that the smell of cream sherry triggered the gag reflex. Various other physical discomforts such as back and abdominal pain are common because of the readjustment to gravity, where in space there was no gravity and these muscles could freely stretch.The Body in Space These may be part of the asthenization syndrome reported by cosmonauts living in space over an extended period of time, but regarded as anecdotal by astronauts. Fatigue, listlessness, and psychosomatic worries are also part of the syndrome. The data is inconclusive; however, the syndrome does appear to exist as a manifestation of the internal and external stress crews in space must face. Psychological effects Studies of Russian cosmonauts, such as those on Mir, provide data on the long-term effects of space on the human body. =Research= The psychological effects of living in space have not been clearly analyzed but analogies on Earth do exist, such as Arctic research stations and submarines. The enormous stress on the crew, coupled with the body adapting to other environmental changes, can result in anxiety, insomnia and depression. =Stress= There has been considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance. Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, quotes this passage from The Handbook of Hymen by O. Henry in his autobiographical book about the Salyut 6 mission: \\"If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in an eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won't stand it.\\"Ryumin, Valery A Year off of Earth: A cosmonaut's journal. (In Russian). Moscow: Molodaya Gvardia Publishing, 1987. Retrieved 01.21.2013 NASA's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their crewed missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir. Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance while under public scrutiny, as well as isolation from peers and family. On the ISS, the latter is still often a cause of stress, such as when NASA Astronaut Daniel Tani's mother died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child. =Sleep= The amount and quality of sleep experienced in space is poor due to highly variable light and dark cycles on flight decks and poor illumination during daytime hours in the spacecraft. Even the habit of looking out of the window before retiring can send the wrong messages to the brain, resulting in poor sleep patterns. These disturbances in circadian rhythm have profound effects on the neurobehavioural responses of the crew and aggravate the psychological stresses they already experience (see Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight for more information). Sleep is disturbed on the ISS regularly due to mission demands, such as the scheduling of incoming or departing space vehicles. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon; fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere, which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment. Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts took sleeping pills and still got 2 hours less sleep each night in space than they did on the ground. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night's sleep, as improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity. A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion. =Duration of space travel= A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks represent a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment. While Skylab's three crews remained in space 1, 2, and 3 months respectively, long-term crews on Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and the ISS remain about 5‚Äì6 months, while MIR expeditions often lasted longer. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak different languages. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language, while 2nd and 3rd generation stations have crews from many cultures who speak many languages. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way. Future use Space colonization efforts must take into account the effects of space on the human body. The sum of human experience has resulted in the accumulation of 58 solar years in space and a much better understanding of how the human body adapts. In the future, industrialisation of space and exploration of inner and outer planets will require humans to endure longer and longer periods in space. The majority of current data comes from missions of short duration and so some of the long-term physiological effects of living in space are still unknown. A round trip to Mars with current technology is estimated to involve at least 18 months in transit alone. Knowing how the human body reacts to such time periods in space is a vital part of the preparation for such journeys. On-board medical facilities need to be adequate for coping with any type of trauma or emergency as well as contain a huge variety of diagnostic and medical instruments in order to keep a crew healthy over a long period of time, as these will be the only facilities available on board a spacecraft for coping not only with trauma but also with the adaptive responses of the human body in space. At the moment only rigorously tested humans have experienced the conditions of space. If off-world colonization someday begins, many types of people will be exposed to these dangers, and the effects on the very young are completely unknown. On October 29, 1998, John Glenn, one of the original Mercury 7, returned to space at the age of 77. His space flight, which lasted 9 days, provided NASA with important information about the effects of space flight on older people. Factors such as nutritional requirements and physical environments which have so far not been examined will become important. Overall, there is little data on the manifold effects of living in space, and this makes attempts toward mitigating the risks during a lengthy space habitation difficult. Testbeds such as the ISS are currently being utilized to research some of these risks. The environment of space is still largely unknown, and there will likely be as-yet-unknown hazards. Meanwhile, future technologies such as artificial gravity and more complex bioregenerative life support systems may someday be capable of mitigating some risks.

Biography Born in Florence in 1924, Sartori began his academic career as a lecturer in the History of Modern Philosophy. He founded the first modern Political Science academic post in Italy, and was Dean of the newly formed University of Florence's Department of Political Science. Sartori served as Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University from 1979 to 1994 and was appointed Professor Emeritus. He was a recipient of a Prince of Asturias Award (Social Sciences area) in 2005 and of the Karl Deutsch Award in 2009.Karl Deutsch Award of the International Political Science Association (IPSA), which honours a prominent scholar engaged in the cross-disciplinary research. Sartori's 1970 article \\"Concept Misformation in Comparative Politics\\" published in The American Political Science Review is prominent in the field, leading Gary Goertz to write, \\"There are few articles in political science that deserve the predicate \\"classic,\\" but Sartori's ... merits the label.\\"Gary Goertz.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. p. 69 Sartori's notions of \\"conceptual traveling\\" (the application of a concept from one case to a new case) and \\"conceptual stretching\\" (the mismatch that happens when a concept does not fit a new case) is influential in social science methodology. Conceptual stretching is frequently used as a criticism of studies that employ large-N quantitative analysis. Sartori was also a regular contributor, as an op-ed writer, of the leading Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. In 1971 he founded and edited the periodical Italian Political Science Review.

The name underwent something of a renewal when the 1985 edition of the Bears proved to be similarly dominant and has been used as a nickname for the Bears, in particular their intimidating defenses and linebackers, ever since. The name got another renaissance in 2006 when the Bears went back to the Super Bowl thanks to their dominant defense and again in the 2018 season, when the dominant Chicago defense led the team to an NFC North championship. Origins of the name The nickname Monsters of the Midway was originally applied to the University of Chicago \\"Maroons\\", a college football team under the leadership of Amos Alonzo Stagg. \\"Midway\\" is a reference to the Midway Plaisance, a long, green swath of boulevard space bordering the southern end of the campus between 59th and 60th Streets and running from Washington Park to Jackson Park on Chicago's South Side. The U of C ended its major college football program in 1939, around a time of several Bears NFL Championships. During this time, their home field was Wrigley Field, the legendary home of the Chicago Cubs, on the North Side of the city, roughly 12 miles (20 km) from the Midway. The \\"C\\" symbol on their helmets is borrowed from the U of C Maroons. The moniker is also used by the university's Velo Club bicycle racing team, for their annual criterium in May on the Midway. It is not, contrary to some mentions, a reference to Chicago's Midway Airport, which was known as \\"Chicago Municipal Airport\\" until 1949, at which time it was renamed to honor veterans of the Battle of Midway. =Mid-1980s revival= The popularity of \\"Monsters of the Midway\\" was renewed by the dominant Chicago Bears defense of 1985. That year the Bears went 15‚Äì1 in the regular season. In the playoffs the Bears posted two shutouts against the New York Giants (21‚Äì0) and the Los Angeles Rams (24‚Äì0). This culminated in the Super Bowl, wherein they defeated the New England Patriots 46‚Äì10. The 1985 Bears defense was ranked first in the NFL in points allowed and yards allowed. That year defensive end Richard Dent led the league in sacks and linebacker Mike Singletary won the Defensive Player of the Year Award. Both players were two of five Bears from that team enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the others being running back Walter Payton, defensive end Dan Hampton, and coach Mike Ditka. Defense Although the Monsters of the Midway nickname is sometimes applied to the Bears team as a whole it is primarily applied to the defensive side of the ball. This is due to the Bears having a long tradition of tough and intimidating defenses that date back to the beginning of the franchise. Both the initial association of the nickname to the Bears and its 1980s revival were due mainly to the Bears' strong defensive performances. Founder George Halas primarily played defensive end and the Bears have been credited with as defensive innovators with schemes such as the 46 Defense and the Tampa 2. Over the years ten of the Bears' defenses being ranked among the 100 stingiest defenses of all time by Cold Hard Football Facts, more than any other franchise. =Middle linebackers= Within their acclaimed defenses, the Bears have been described as having a particularly strong legacy at middle linebacker, with players often being referred to as \\"Monsters in the Middle\\", a play on the Monsters of the Midway nickname. This is mainly due to the play of Bill George, Dick Butkus, Mike Singletary, and Brian Urlacher, all of whom were members of the first-team NFL All-Decade teams for their respective tenures, and are ranked within the top fifteen Bears of all time by ESPN Chicago. Furthermore, George, Butkus, Singletary, and Urlacher are Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees and Butkus and George have their numbers retired by the Bears. Butkus was also selected to the NFL 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams. * Bill George (1952‚Äì1965) ‚Äì Considered the first true middle linebacker and inadvertently the creator of the 4‚Äì3 defense, George was an eight time All-Pro, NFL Champion (1963), and member of the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. * Dick Butkus (1965‚Äì1973) ‚Äì Widely considered one of the greatest and most intimidating linebackers of all time, Butkus was a six time All-Pro, two time NEA Defensive Player of the Year, and member of the NFL All Decade Team for both the 1960s and the 1970s. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979. * Mike Singletary (1981‚Äì1992) ‚Äì Middle linebacker for the Super Bowl winning 1985 Chicago Bears and the archetypical linebacker in Buddy Ryan's innovative 46 defense. Singletary was an eight time All-Pro, two time AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and member of the National Football League 1980s All-Decade Team. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998. * Brian Urlacher (2000‚Äì2012) ‚Äì The linebacker that led the Bears back to prominence after a decade of subpar play. Urlacher thrived in the Tampa 2 defense of coach Lovie Smith due to his agility and intelligence and was a four time All-Pro, NFC Champion in 2006, one time AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year, member of the National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team. Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018. Games TSR published a game entitled Monsters of the Midway https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5011/monsters-midway in a 1982 edition of their magazine Dragon. It was a football simulation with various fantasy characters taking the place of football players.

Fluids having this characteristic are called barotropic fluids.}} The barotropic fluid is a useful model of fluid behavior in a wide variety of scientific fields, from meteorology to astrophysics. The density of most liquids is nearly constant (isopycnic), so it can be stated that their densities vary only weakly with pressure and temperature. Water, which varies only a few percent with temperature and salinity, may be approximated as barotropic. In general, air is not barotropic, as it is a function of temperature and pressure; but, under certain circumstances, the barotropic assumption can be useful. In astrophysics, barotropic fluids are important in the study of stellar interiors or of the interstellar medium. One common class of barotropic model used in astrophysics is a polytropic fluid. Typically, the barotropic assumption is not very realistic. In meteorology, a barotropic atmosphere is one that for which the density of the air depends only on pressure, as a result isobaric surfaces (constant-pressure surfaces) are also constant-density surfaces. Such isobaric surfaces will also be isothermal surfaces, hence (from the thermal wind equation) the geostrophic wind will not vary with depth. Hence, the motions of a rotating barotropic air mass is strongly constrained. The tropics are more nearly barotropic than mid- latitudes because temperature is more nearly horizontally uniform in the tropics. A barotropic flow is a generalization of a barotropic atmosphere. It is a flow in which the pressure is a function of the density only and vice versa. In other words, it is a flow in which isobaric surfaces are isopycnic surfaces and vice versa. One may have a barotropic flow of a non-barotropic fluid, but a barotropic fluid will always follow a barotropic flow. Examples include barotropic layers of the oceans, an isothermal ideal gas or an isentropic ideal gas. A fluid which is not barotropic is baroclinic, i. e., pressure is not the only factor to determine density. For a barotropic fluid or a barotropic flow (such as a barotropic atmosphere), the baroclinic vector is zero.

In other words, it represents the survivorship of people from a certain population. They can also be explained as a long-term mathematical way to measure a population's longevity. Tables have been created by demographers including Graunt, Reed and Merrell, Keyfitz, and Greville. There are two types of life tables used in actuarial science. The period life table represents mortality rates during a specific time period of a certain population. A cohort life table, often referred to as a generation life table, is used to represent the overall mortality rates of a certain population's entire lifetime. They must have had to be born during the same specific time interval. A cohort life table is more frequently used because it is able to make a prediction of any expected changes in mortality rates of a population in the future. This type of table also analyzes patterns in mortality rates that can be observed over time. Both of these types of life tables are created based on an actual population from the present, as well as an educated prediction of the experience of a population in the near future. In order to find the true life expectancy average, 100 years would need to pass and by then finding that data would be of no use as healthcare is continually advancing. Other life tables in historical demography may be based on historical records, although these often undercount infants and understate infant mortality, on comparison with other regions with better records, and on mathematical adjustments for varying mortality levels and life expectancies at birth.Saskia Hin, The Demography of Roman Italy, Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 104‚Äì118.

The concept is also of importance in product life cycle management. Background There are two types of life tables: * Period or static life tables show the current probability of death (for people of different ages, in the current year) * Cohort life tables show the probability of death of people from a given cohort (especially birth year) over the course of their lifetime. Static life tables sample individuals assuming a stationary population with overlapping generations. \\"Static life tables\\" and \\"cohort life tables\\" will be identical if population is in equilibrium and environment does not change. If a population were to have a constant number of people each year, it would mean that the probabilities of death from the life table were completely accurate. Also, an exact number of 100,000 people were born each year with no immigration or emigration involved. \\"Life table\\" primarily refers to period life tables, as cohort life tables can only be constructed using data up to the current point, and distant projections for future mortality. Life tables can be constructed using projections of future mortality rates, but more often they are a snapshot of age-specific mortality rates in the recent past, and do not necessarily purport to be projections. For these reasons, the older ages represented in a life table may have a greater chance of not being representative of what lives at these ages may experience in future, as it is predicated on current advances in medicine, public health, and safety standards that did not exist in the early years of this cohort. A life table is created by mortality rates and census figures from a certain population, ideally under a closed demographic system. This means that immigration and emigration do not exist when analyzing a cohort. A closed demographic system assumes that migration flows are random and not significant, and that immigrants from other populations have the same risk of death as an individual from the new population. Another benefit from mortality tables is that they can be used to make predictions on demographics or different populations. However, there are also weaknesses of the information displayed on life tables. One being that they do not state the overall health of the population. There is more than one disease present in the world, and a person can have more than one disease at different stages simultaneously, introducing the term comorbidity. Therefore, life tables also do not show the direct correlation of mortality and morbidity. The life table observes the mortality experience of a single generation, consisting of 100,000 births, at every age number they can live through. Life tables are usually constructed separately for men and for women because of their substantially different mortality rates. Other characteristics can also be used to distinguish different risks, such as smoking status, occupation, and socioeconomic class. Life tables can be extended to include other information in addition to mortality, for instance health information to calculate health expectancy. Health expectancies such as disability-adjusted life year and Healthy Life Years are the remaining number of years a person can expect to live in a specific health state, such as free of disability. Two types of life tables are used to divide the life expectancy into life spent in various states: * Multi-state life tables (also known as increment-decrements life tables) are based on transition rates in and out of the different states and to death * Prevalence-based life tables (also known as the Sullivan method) are based on external information on the proportion in each state. Life tables can also be extended to show life expectancies in different labor force states or marital status states. Life tables that relate to maternal deaths and infant moralities are important, as they help form family planning programs that work with particular populations. They also help compare a country's average life expectancy with other countries. Comparing life expectancy globally helps countries understand why one country's life expectancy is rising substantially by looking at each other's healthcare, and adopting ideas to their own systems. Insurance applications In order to price insurance products, and ensure the solvency of insurance companies through adequate reserves, actuaries must develop projections of future insured events (such as death, sickness, and disability). To do this, actuaries develop mathematical models of the rates and timing of the events. They do this by studying the incidence of these events in the recent past, and sometimes developing expectations of how these past events will change over time (for example, whether the progressive reductions in mortality rates in the past will continue) and deriving expected rates of such events in the future, usually based on the age or other relevant characteristics of the population. An actuary's job is to form a comparison between people at risk of death and people who actually died to come up with a probability of death for a person at each age number, defined as qx in an equation. When analyzing a population, one of the main sources used to gather the required information is insurance by obtaining individual records that belong to a specific population. These are called mortality tables if they show death rates, and morbidity tables if they show various types of sickness or disability rates. The availability of computers and the proliferation of data gathering about individuals has made possible calculations that are more voluminous and intensive than those used in the past (i.e. they crunch more numbers) and it is more common to attempt to provide different tables for different uses, and to factor in a range of non- traditional behaviors (e.g. gambling, debt load) into specialized calculations utilized by some institutions for evaluating risk. This is particularly the case in non-life insurance (e.g. the pricing of motor insurance can allow for a large number of risk factors, which requires a correspondingly complex table of expected claim rates). However the expression \\"life table\\" normally refers to human survival rates and is not relevant to non-life insurance. The mathematics tpx chart from Table 1. Life table for the total population: United States, 2003, Page 8 The basic algebra used in life tables is as follows. * \\\\,q_x: the probability that someone aged exactly \\\\,x will die before reaching age \\\\,(x+1). * \\\\,p_x: the probability that someone aged exactly \\\\,x will survive to age \\\\,(x+1). :: \\\\,p_x = 1-q_x * \\\\,\\\\ell_x: the number of people who survive to age \\\\,x :: note that this is based on a radix or starting point, of \\\\,\\\\ell_0 lives, typically taken as 100,000 :: \\\\,\\\\ell_{x + 1} = \\\\ell_x \\\\cdot (1-q_x) = \\\\ell_x \\\\cdot p_x :: \\\\,{\\\\ell_{x + 1} \\\\over \\\\ell_x} = p_x * \\\\,d_x: the number of people who die aged \\\\,x last birthday :: \\\\,d_x = \\\\ell_x-\\\\ell_{x+1} = \\\\ell_x \\\\cdot (1-p_x) = \\\\ell_x \\\\cdot q_x * \\\\,{}_tp_x: the probability that someone aged exactly \\\\,x will survive for \\\\,t more years, i.e. live up to at least age \\\\,x+t years ::\\\\,{}_tp_x = {\\\\ell_{x+t} \\\\over \\\\ell_x} * \\\\,{}_{t\\\\mid k}q_x: the probability that someone aged exactly \\\\,x will survive for \\\\,t more years, then die within the following \\\\,k years ::\\\\,{}_{t\\\\mid k}q_x = {}_t p_x \\\\cdot {}_k q_{x+t} = {\\\\ell_{x+t} - \\\\ell_{x+t+k} \\\\over \\\\ell_x} * Œºx : the force of mortality, i.e. the instantaneous mortality rate at age x, i.e. the number of people dying in a short interval starting at age x, divided by ‚Ñìx and also divided by the length of the interval. Another common variable is * \\\\,m_x This symbol refers to central rate of mortality. It is approximately equal to the average force of mortality, averaged over the year of age. Further descriptions: The variable dx stands for the number of deaths that would occur within two consecutive age numbers. An example of this is the number of deaths in a cohort that were recorded between the age of seven and the age of eight. The variable ‚Ñìx, which stands for the opposite of dx, represents the number of people who lived between two consecutive age numbers. ‚Ñì of zero is equal to 100,000. The variable Tx stands for the years lived beyond each age number x by all members in the generation. ƒñx represents the life expectancy for members already at a specific age number. Ending a mortality table In practice, it is useful to have an ultimate age associated with a mortality table. Once the ultimate age is reached, the mortality rate is assumed to be 1.000. This age may be the point at which life insurance benefits are paid to a survivor or annuity payments cease. Four methods can be used to end mortality tables: *The Forced Method: Select an ultimate age and set the mortality rate at that age equal to 1.000 without any changes to other mortality rates. This creates a discontinuity at the ultimate age compared to the penultimate and prior ages. *The Blended Method: Select an ultimate age and blend the rates from some earlier age to dovetail smoothly into 1.000 at the ultimate age. *The Pattern Method: Let the pattern of mortality continue until the rate approaches or hits 1.000 and set that as the ultimate age. *The Less-Than-One Method: This is a variation on the Forced Method. The ultimate mortality rate is set equal to the expected mortality at a selected ultimate age, rather 1.000 as in the Forced Method. This rate will be less than 1.000. Epidemiology In epidemiology and public health, both standard life tables (used to calculate life expectancy), as well as the Sullivan and multi-state life tables (used to calculate health expectancy), are the most commonly mathematical used devices. The latter includes information on health in addition to mortality. By watching over the life expectancy of any year(s) being studied, epidemiologists can see if diseases are contributing to the overall increase in mortality rates. Epidemiologists are able to help demographers understand the sudden decline of life expectancy by linking it to the health problems that are arising in certain populations.

It was licensed to the Avalon Hill Game Company (now a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc.) in 1985. It was nominated for the Charles S. Roberts Award Best Professional Game of the Year at Origins '84. A computer version of the game was released by Matrix Games in late 2007.Empires in Arms at Matrix Games Gameplay Empires in Arms is a \\"grand strategy\\" wargame, focusing on warfare in the Napoleonic era of 1805-1815. Up to seven players can participate, each assuming control of a Great Power (France, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain and Turkey). Variants have been developed that cover other time periods and allow for additional players by elevating a neutral country to a playable power. Although classified as a war game, the object of the game is to achieve international prestige (measured by \\"victory points,\\" as described below). Although successful military campaigns contribute to a player's prestige, there are other ways of gaining prestige, such as creating diplomatic alliances and improving the country's internal economy. A shrewd player can win the game without ever declaring war. Victory is achieved by a given player when that player accrues a particular number of victory points. The number of victory points required is determined at the start of the game, when each player bids a certain number of victory points for each country. The player that bids the most for a given country plays that country. As a result, although not all seven countries are of equal strength, the weaker countries have a competitive advantage if the players bid a sufficiently low number of victory points for them. Leader chits from each Great Power: Napoleon, Wellington, Charles, Kutusov, Pechlivan Khan, Casta√±os, and Brunswick. The numbers represent their strategic rating (ability to outflank/withdraw), their (head-to-head) tactical rating, and the number of corps they can manage. The letter indicates their order of precedence among fellow leaders. Each power has a unique mix of economic and military power. Additionally the properties of the available forces and generals vary widely. Although Great Britain's regular infantry have high morale, France in general possesses the largest and highest-quality military. The full game lasts 132 turns, one turn for each month, playing time can be 200‚Äì250 hours or more. Each month is split into 4 (sometimes 5) phases: * The Diplomatic phase where players negotiate deals, forge alliances etc. * The Reinforcement phase where each player in sequence adds previously purchased reinforcements. * The Naval phase where each player conducts naval moves in sequence. * The Land phase where each player moves and fights with his armies in sequence. * An Economic phase every three months, where players collect resources, purchase reinforcements, and earn victory points. Winning the game is done through earning victory points. These are scored in the economic phase and are based on each nation's political status. The political status of a nation is influenced by a number of factors, but mainly by winning or losing wars and battles. Battles are won by a combination of generals available, the quality of the troops in the armies and a battlefield strategy selected prior to the battle. Troops are divided into elite guards, cavalry, infantry, artillery, militia and feudal troops. Northwest portion of map (about 10% of total map size) showing early-game moves The troops have different abilities but differ mainly in their morale. Most battles are won by reducing the opponents morale to zero rather than by destroying all factors in the army. With few exceptions, wars can only be won through a surrender and the appropriate time and conditions of a surrender is one of the key elements of the game. Reception Alessio Cavatore comments: \\"Anyone who knows the game Empires in Arms (EiA) would agree that it is a monster. It is one of the longest, most complicated, and most demanding board games that has ever been produced. It's certainly the longest I've ever played, and I've played quite a few. However, EiA has also been the most exciting, engrossing, and rewarding board-gaming experience of my life.\\" ReferencesExternal links Empires in Arms can be played via email, some websites supporting email play are : * http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/empires-in-arms/ This Yahoo!

Scdoris had her best result in the 2009 Iditarod, taking the Southern route for the first time. Visually guided by Tim Osmar, making his first re-entry into the race since a catastrophic ankle injury incurred while protecting his home from a wildfire in 2007, Scdoris came in 45th,Anchorage Daily News, 2009 Iditarod standings, retrieved December 19, 2009] beating her previous best of 57th.Men's Stuff, Rachael Scdoris, retrieved December 19, 2009 Biography Scdoris was born with congenital achromatopsia, an uncorrectable visual disorder. Her vision is 20/200, and she is totally color blind. In 1997, Scdoris competed her first dog sled race, and placed 4th in the Frog Lake Race, and later won several local short-distance races. In 2001, she competed in the 500 mile (805 km) International Pedigree Stage Stop Sled Dog Race, and became the first legally blind person and the youngest musher to complete an event of that distance. Rachael carried the Olympic Torch for the 2002 Winter Games. In 2003, the Iditarod Trail Committee approved her request under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for special accommodations to compete in the much longer and more rigorous Iditarod. Scdoris completed the qualifying races in 2004, placing 11th in the 350-mile (563 km) Race to the Sky in Montana, and 6th in the 400-mile (644 km) John Beargrease Mid-Distance Marathon in Minnesota. On March 5 she started the 2005 Iditarod in Anchorage, Alaska, with \\"visual interpreter\\" Paul Ellering, who warned her of trail conditions by radio or shouting. The two-way radios broke several times during the race during crashes, which are relatively common especially among rookies. \\"I had a nice little encounter with a tree... the tree won\\".\\"Person of the Week: Rachael Scdoris\\".

In the 2006 Iditarod, Rachael Scdoris fell asleep while mushing and became separated from Tim Osmar, her visual guide. She awoke in a place that had no tracks from other dog teams, which meant that her dogs had no scent to follow. Scdoris guided her team over jumble ice and open leads into the Koyuk checkpoint:MSNBC, Blind Musher Slams into Tree, then Finishes Iditarod , Retrieved December 19, 2009. \\"Scdoris said she had fallen asleep on the sled, as many mushers do, and veered off the trail. 'It was so flat and so early in the morning, it was hard not to doze,' Scdoris said. 'I woke up in jumbled ice and no other dog tracks.' As it turned out, Scdoris was close enough to Koyuk to make out the lights of the village and guide her dog team there.\\" \\\\- Jeannette J.

His interest began in 1933 with the publication of the Hugh Gray photograph in newspapers, becoming a lifelong passion. From 1939 to 1946 he served in the RAF. In August 1962 he made his first one-man expedition trying to get photographs, and in 1963 joined the newly formed Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau. After several hundred hours of watching the Loch, Holiday claims that he reported four unidentified sightings. In his 1968 book, The Great Orm of Loch Ness, Holiday postulated that the creature in the Loch was an invertebrate creature similar in form to the extinct Tullimonstrum gregarium, but vastly larger. Holiday also claimed that he noticed several unusual coincidences, including camera malfunction during certain Nessie sightings. For example, in August 1968, even though there were several witnesses along the shore, \\"Nessie\\" chose to appear in one of the very few places that were obscured from the various cameras. Holiday reported, \\"The observers were watchful and keen but they had seen nothing. The phenomenon had concealed itself so there was nothing for them to see.\\" By 1972, Holiday modified his initial hypothesis that the Loch Ness monster was a literal physical animal. In his second book, The Dragon and the Disc, Holiday postulates that there are certain commonalities between paranormal phenomena and certain reported sightings on the Loch. Holiday also believed that there is a relationship between ancient dragon legends and contemporary UFO phenomena. Though he maintained in the book that he still believed that the monster was an invertebrate animal, there was a paranormal aspect to it reminiscent of ancient Water Horse legends which he could not fully explain. His final work, The Goblin Universe, was published posthumously and includes an introduction by Colin Wilson.

Life Freyer began studying theology, national economics, history and philosophy at the University of Greifswald in 1907, with the aim of becoming a Lutheran theologian. A year later he moved to Leipzig, where he initially took the same courses, but then gave up the theological parts. He gained his doctorate in 1911. His early works on the philosophy of life had an influence on the German youth movement. In 1920 he qualified as a university lecturer, and in 1922 he became a professor at the university of Kiel. In 1925, moving on to the University of Leipzig, Freyer founded the university's sociology department. He led the department until 1948. In Leipzig, he developed a branch of sociology with a strongly historical basis, the Leipzig School. Sympathizing with the Hitlerite movement, he forced 1933 Ferdinand T√∂nnies, an outspoken enemy of it, and then president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Soziologie, out of office. In 1933 Freyer signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. Nevertheless, being T√∂nnies' successor he abstained from making the Gesellschaft a Nazi tool by stopping all activities from 1934 onwards. From 1938 to 1944 Freyer was the head of the German Institute for Culture in Budapest. Together with Walter Frank he established a racist and anti-semitic v√∂lkisch historiography.The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 4: 1800-1945 by Stuart Macintyre, D. Daniel R. Woolf, Andrew Feldherr, 2011, p. 178. Freyer was Protestant and married K√§the L√ºbeck; they had four children together. After the Second World War, Freyer's position in Leipzig, now in the Soviet occupation zone, became untenable, and in 1948 he took up a position in Wiesbaden at the Brockhaus publishing company. He took up lecturing again for only another three years, from 1953 to 1955, at the University of M√ºnster and for a short time in 1954 in Ankara where he helped set up an institute for sociology. Works In Der Staat (1926), Freyer identified three stages of history which repeated themselves in a cycle: Glaube, Stil and Staat (belief, style, the state). These were partly, although not openly, based on Ferdinand T√∂nnies' Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (community and society). The last stage, Staat, was the ideal state for society: \\"the essential quality of the state (...) was its ability to forge living humanity with all its forces into a unity\\". In 1929 Freyer wrote Soziologie als Wirklichkeitswissenschaft (Sociology as a \\"Science of Reality\\") (using Max Weber's term). This looked into the origins of sociology, saying that it came from the philosophy of history; that it had emerged from people's attempts to understand the connections between the past and the present. In Freyer's view, sociology was needed as a science to understand why changes in society had happened and, based on these findings, to help transform society. Freyer's 1931 article Die Revolution von Rechts studied freedom, saying that people should only be free if they were part of a common will; that individual freedom should be limited for the sake of the community.

Background Forster was born in Dublin, the son of Richard Forster and his wife Anne Webber. His father sat in the Irish House of Commons for Swords and came from a family long associated with the Dublin business community. Career Forster served as Recorder of Dublin from 1701 to 1714, and represented Dublin City in the Irish House of Commons from 1703 to 1715. He was Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1709 and Attorney-General for Ireland from Christmas Eve 1709 to 1711, before being raised to the Bench as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas on 20 September 1714.Haydn, Joseph Book of Dignities In 1713 he took part in the hotly contested Irish General Election and his constituency was the scene of the Dublin election riot. Elrington Ball described Forster as \\"a sound lawyer and impressive speaker\\" but lacking in political judgment.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray, London 1926 Like Alan Brodrick, 1st Viscount Midleton, his mentor, he was stubborn and hot-tempered. His tenure as Recorder of Dublin saw a major conflict between the aldermen of Dublin and the Privy Council; Forster was entirely on the side of the aldermen, and for this he was violently attacked by Jonathan Swift and other critics. These attacks undoubtedly took their toll, and it is believed he exchanged the Recordership for the position of Chief Justice on the understanding that the more senior position would in practice be less onerous than the Recordership. Family Forster married firstly Rebecca Monck, daughter of Henry Monck of St. Stephens Green, Dublin and his wife Sarah, daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Stanley of Grangegorman, by whom he had at least three children, Richard, Anne and Elizabeth. He married secondly Dorothy Evans, daughter of George Evans and Mary Eyre, and sister of George Evans, 1st Baron Carbery. They had a daughter, Dorothy. His son Richard married Elizabeth Geering in 1721, and died in 1738. His daughter Anne married the celebrated philosopher George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne; her sister Elizabeth married Rev. Robert Spence, and the youngest child Dorothy married Thomas Burton. He died following a stroke at his home, Clonshagh, Santry.

The book was initially published in December 1982 by Cambridge University Press. Overview In the book, John Maynard Smith summarises work on evolutionary game theory that had developed in the 1970s, to which he made several important contributions. The book is also noted for being well written and not overly mathematically challenging. The main contribution to be had from this book is the introduction of the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy, or ESS, concept, which states that for a set of behaviours to be conserved over evolutionary time, they must be the most profitable avenue of action when common, so that no alternative behaviour can invade. So, for instance, suppose that in a population of frogs, males fight to the death over breeding ponds. This would be an ESS if any one cowardly frog that does not fight to the death always fares worse (in fitness terms, of course). A more likely scenario is one where fighting to the death is not an ESS because a frog might arise that will stop fighting if it realises that it is going to lose. This frog would then reap the benefits of fighting, but not the ultimate cost. Hence, fighting to the death would easily be invaded by a mutation that causes this sort of \\"informed fighting.\\" Much complexity can be built from this, and Maynard Smith is outstanding at explaining in clear prose and with simple math.

Squadrons were commanded by a rear-admiral whose title was given as Flag Officer Cruiser Squadron n, or CSn for short (e.g. the officer commanding the 3rd Cruiser Squadron would be CS3). During peacetime the grouping was primarily for administrative purposes, but during war the whole squadron tended to be operated as a unified fighting unit and such units would train in this formation during peace. In the main fighting fleets (Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet) members of a given squadron were normally of the same or similar classes.

The work does not survive in a complete state, and large parts are missing. The surviving sections derive from excerpts preserved in later works and from an incomplete palimpsest uncovered in 1819. Cicero uses the work to explain Roman constitutional theory. Written in imitation of Plato‚Äôs Republic, it takes the form of a Socratic dialogue in which Scipio Aemilianus takes the role of a wise old man. The work examines the type of government that had been established in Rome since the kings, and that was challenged by, amongst others, Julius Caesar. The development of the constitution is explained, and Cicero explores the different types of constitutions and the roles played by citizens in government. The work is also known for the Dream of Scipio, a fictional dream vision from the sixth book. Setting and dramatis person√¶ De re publica is in the format of a Socratic dialogue in which Scipio Aemilianus (who had died over twenty years before Cicero was born, 270 years after Socrates' death) takes the role of a wise old man -- a typical feature of the genre. Cicero's treatise was politically controversial: by choosing the format of a philosophical dialogue he avoided naming his political adversaries directly. By employing various speakers to raise differing opinions, Cicero not only remained true to his favoured sceptical method of setting opposing arguments against one another (see, e.g., Carneades), but also made it more difficult for his adversaries to take him to task on what he had written. =Setting= The dialogue is portrayed as taking place in Scipio's estate, during three consecutive days. Each day is described in two books, with an introduction by Cicero preceding the dialogue of each book. A large part of the last book (the sixth) is taken by Scipio telling a dream he had: this passage is known as Somnium Scipionis, or \\"Scipio's dream\\". =Participants= In alphabetical order: *Fannius, Gaius: Consul in 122 BC.

As a letter to his brother Quintus (dated to November 54 BC) shows, Cicero very nearly redrafted the entire work so as to replace these characters with himself and his friends.Cicero, Ad Quintum Fratrem III.5 (= SB 25) Cicero showed an early draft of the treatise to a friend named Sallustius. However, Sallustius immediately recommended that Cicero redesign the work in order to set it in his own day, and substitute Cicero himself for Scipio Aemilianus: 'for he pointed out that these matters could be treated with much more authority if I spoke of the Republic in my own person'.Cicero, Ad Quintum Fratrem III.5.1 Cicero was convinced by Sallustius' arguments, and he makes clear in the letter to Quintus that he intended to carry out this redraft. However, he must have changed his mind soon after, as the treatise as it survives is still set in Scipio Aemilianus' time. The Title of the Dialogue While already the Latin version of the title of this work is given in two versions (De re publica and De Republica), depending on source, the translation of the title of this work show even more variants, often based on the choice of the translator: the expression \\"res publica\\" (which appears in the title of this work) is notoriously difficult to translate. Its modern English cognate, republic, (also similar terms in many other languages) has acquired quite different connotations from the original Latin meaning (res publica = most literally \\"the public thing\\"), rendering the term here problematic if not outright anachronistic in its implications. Because of the difficulties the title affords, there is no general consensus on how best to retain the sense of the Latin in translating the title. It is helpful to note that Cicero almost certainly had in mind the title of Plato's celebrated dialogue Republic (Greek: Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµŒØŒ±, Politeia) when naming his dialogue. While Plato's dialogue is often translated as Republic, politeia translates more literally as \\"constitution,\\" \\"regime,\\" or \\"set-up,\\" and the long tradition of calling the dialogue The Republic can be attributed to Cicero's own treatise and treatment in Latin. =English translations of the title of Cicero's De re publica= De re publica has been translated as... *Republic - a translation neglecting the first word of the Latin title (De), which is the equivalent of On or Of; other translations of the title include On the republic or Treatise on the republic. *Although \\"republic\\" can appear a neutral translation of \\"res publica\\", it is infected by the many interpretations given to the word republic afterwards, as mentioned above. So, the translation of \\"Res publica\\" (literally the \\"public thing\\" or the public cause) has many variants: ** Sometimes \\"Res publica\\" is translated into Commonwealth, hence Treatise on the Commonwealth is a possible translation of the title (the major translation by G.H. Sabine & S.B. Smith, 1929, is, thus, On the Commonwealth). ** On Government or On the State ‚Äì Cicero's intention was however probably more specific, the type of government that had been established in Rome since the kings, and that was challenged by amongst others Julius Caesar, by the time Cicero wrote his De re publica. (see: Roman Republic) Content Apart from the Greek philosophers mentioned above, Polybius was also an important source of inspiration for Cicero's political views. Since not all of the work survives, some of the content is surmised from references by other ancient authors. Book one: Contains a discussion between the protagonists of the political situation of their time. The theme of the work is given and some comments are made about the theory of constitutions. Book two: An outline of Roman history and the development of the constitution. Book three: The role of justice in government is examined, as are the different types of constitutions. Book four: A discourse about education. Book five: The characters converse about the qualities of the ideal citizen in government. Book Six: Little of this book survives except the Somnium Scipionis, which functions as the conclusion to the work. Style Cicero carefully edited De re publica in order to achieve exalted style.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 31. Cicero used several archaic expressions in the treatise, even though he hadn't supported an archaistic movement in the Latin literature. The causes were the setting of De re publica in the past and discussion of historical and legal matters. His later works contain less archaic words, but more neologisms.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 45. Archaistic words in De re publica are distributed irregularly. Among the survived volumes, frequency of the outmoded words in Book II devoted to historical matters is two times higher compared to book I where the theoretical issues are discussed.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 92. Cicero tried to emulate speech of the dialogue's participants by reconstructing several aspects of spoken language of the Scipionic age.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 86-87. The treatise has other stylistic features: large amount of antitheses compared to other philosophical works and elements of the archaic grammar, still in use in official language, but completely outmoded in public speeches.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 115.Albrecht, M. Cicero's Style: a synopsis, Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2003. P. 42. History of the text Vatican palimpsest containing De re publica Large parts of the text are missing: especially from the 4th and the 5th book only minor fragments survived. All other books have at least some passages missing. Scipio's dream, which is only a part from the 6th book, is nearly all that survives from that book. The Somnium Scipionis, as it is known, survives because it was the subject of a commentary by Macrobius, who excerpted large portions; both he and his readers in the Middle Ages and Renaissance were mainly interested in its discussion of astrology and astronomy, especially given the loss of the rest of the book. An enterprising copyist early in the textual tradition appended a copy of the Somnium to a copy of Macrobius's Commentary, but this copy appears to be inferior to the one Macrobius was reading. This text became so popular that its transmission was polluted by multiple copies; it has been impossible to establish a stemma for it. The largest part of the surviving text was uncovered as a palimpsest in 1819 in a Vatican Library manuscript (Vat Lat 5757) of a work by Augustine and published in 1822. Before that date Scipio's dream was the only larger excerpt of the text that was known to have survived the Middle Ages. The other fragments are mainly quotes found in the work of other authors (for example Augustine and Nonius Marcellus). Through these other authors' discussion of Cicero's treatise, the main topics of each book can be surmised. The discovery in 1819 by Cardinal Angelo Mai was one of the first major recoveries of an ancient text from a palimpsest, and although Mai's techniques were crude by comparison with later scholars', his discovery of De Republica heralded a new era of rediscovery and inspired him and other scholars of his time to seek more palimpsests. A copy was published in the 19th century by the Vatican library, and a transcript is available in the 1908 Supplementary Proceedings of the American School of Rome. Uncertainty continues over several corruptions in the text that affect key data, such as the structure and size of the Comitia Centuriata in early Rome as described by Scipio in Book II. Another key area of debate is the one corrective hand present in Vat Lat 5757; some scholars believe the corrective hand was a more skilled copyist, perhaps a supervisor, who had access to the same text as the copyist and was correcting the first work; others have concluded that the corrective hand had access to a different version of the text. It is worth noting that in one letter to his friend Atticus, Cicero asks him to make a correction to the copy of De Republica Cicero has sent him. This correction is not present in the Vat Lat 5757 version of the text. Quotes * This excessive liberty soon brings the people, collectively and individually, to an excessive servitude.

Ear piercings are the most commonly stretched piercings, with nasal septum piercings, tongue piercings and lip piercings/lip plates following close behind. While all piercings can be stretched to some degree, cartilage piercings are usually more difficult to stretch and more likely to form hypertrophic scars if stretched quickly. Dermal punching is generally the preferred method for accommodating larger jewelry in cartilage piercings. Stretching is usually done in small increments to minimize the potential for damaging the healed fistula or creating scar tissue. In North America, most stretching methods go up by a single even-sized gauge increment at a time. 0g (8 mm), is generally considered to be \\"the point of no return\\": a hole larger than this size will rarely close to a standard piercing size. Since each body is different, any stretched piercings, no matter the size, should be approached as a permanent body modification. In Europe and most of the rest of the world, jewelry is metric, but the increments between standard sizes are similar. The first recorded use of ear-stretching comes from Ancient Egypt, and can be seen in the sarcophagus of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. In addition, anthropologists believe that the use of ear gauges originated in sub-Saharan Africa. Health issues There are minimal health issues directly related to stretched piercings. Most stretching methods do not create a wound, unless done too quickly. If an individual's skin elasticity and vascularity allow, most piercings can be stretched far beyond their initial size. Any size larger than 8mm is normally given as the \\"point of no return\\" for earlobe piercings, as beyond this size there is a significant risk that the hole will not shrink back to the size of the original piercing and may require cosmetic surgery in order to close the hole completely. Many variables affect whether or not a stretched piercing will return to its original size, such as the length of time taken to stretch and the amount of time the piercing is fully healed at a particular size. However, everyone's ears are different and some ears will not heal back even from a size smaller than 8mm. Jewelry for stretched piercings Flesh tunnel (metal) There is a large variety of jewelry available for stretched piercings. Many jewelry materials can be used in the manufacturing of jewelry for stretched piercings; materials that would ordinarily be too delicate or brittle to be inserted in smaller-gauge piercings are freely used. Stone, fossilized materials, wood, bone, horn, amber, bamboo, silicone, and glass are not uncommon in stretched piercings. Some of these materials \\"breathe\\" better than metals or plastics, preventing the buildup of sebum in the enlarged ear lobe. Jewelry, however, is still often made of acrylic or metal. There are dangers associated with wearing porous materials such as acrylic, stone, wood, bamboo, horn, bone, or other materials with small or microscopic holes, in a freshly stretched piercing. These materials not only have microscopic holes that will trap bacteria and can cause infection, but also cannot be autoclaved or properly sanitized, and are therefore unfit for a fresh stretch or piercing. The best materials for a fresh stretch that is not vulnerable to bacteria are implant grade steel, titanium, and glass. This is because these materials are non-porous and can withstand the heat and pressure of an autoclave, so that they can be properly sanitized before insertion. The typical jewelry worn in a large stretched piercing is a plug, sometimes referred to as a \\"gauge\\" or \\"gauges\\", which refers to the sizing system used in the U.S. It is solid and usually cylindrical, and may be flared out at one or both ends (saddle-shaped), or kept in place by o-rings fastened around the ends. A variation on this is the flesh tunnel, which is shaped in the same way, but hollow in the middle. Claw-, talon-, and spiral-shaped pieces are also commonplace. Ear-weights in varying degrees of size are also worn, commonly made from silver or bronze, though other metals such as copper or brass are occasionally used. However, some people are easily irritated by some metals; therefore, care should be taken when metal jewelry is worn. Ear cuffs (such as the gold ones utilized in South India provinces) or wrapped bead work (common amongst the Maasai of East Africa) are other options, though are not usually seen in modern Western contexts. There are several common methods used to enlarge piercings, of various origins and appropriate for different circumstances. *Tapering: Tapering involves the use of a taper, a conical rod usually made specifically for this purpose. It is lubricated and pushed through the fistula until the widest part of the taper is level with the skin surrounding the piercing. Larger jewelry is then pushed through, parallel to the back of the taper. Tapers come in a variety of sizes and are usually identified by the gauge of the large end. They can vary in length, but most tapers are about long. Most tapers are made of stainless steel or acrylic and some have threads extending from the wide end to allow the attachment of barbell jewelry, to make insertion easier. Improvised objects like knitting needles and porcupine quills or cocktail sticks are sometimes used as tapers by people stretching at home; however, this is not recommended by professionals, as their gauge cannot be exactly determined and sterile practices are rarely followed at home. Tapering is discouraged at sizes above 2g (). The use of a taper makes it easier to stretch a piercing before it is ready, which can lead to tearing the fistula, pain, bleeding, swelling, blowouts, and scar tissue. *Dead stretching: Dead stretching is the process of inserting a larger piece of jewelry into an existing piercing without any other equipment. As with tapering, this can lead to injury if the fistula is unready: either a tear of the skin, or a \\"blowout\\", in which the fistula is pushed out through the back of the piercing. Some piercings will stretch slightly on their own and larger jewelry can be inserted without the potential for unpleasant side effects, especially piercings that see a lot of \\"play\\", such as tongue piercings. Self stretching can be induced in other piercings by massaging the tissue, playing with the jewelry, and tugging it in small circles. Dead stretching is very safe if the lubricated jewelry slides easily into the piercing. The jewelry should never be forced in place. 0 ga by a combination of dead stretching and tapering. *Teflon tape stretching: The existing jewelry is removed and a thin layer of non-adhesive Teflon tape (PFTE tape), which is inert and safe for piercing use, is wrapped around the jewelry. Non-adhesive bondage tape and heat-shrink tubing are also frequently used. The jewelry is then re-inserted, and as the piercing adapts to the new diameter of jewelry, the process is repeated with increasingly thicker layers of tape. *Weights: Large, heavy jewelry or weighted objects can be used to stretch piercings. This method is not widely used in modern-day, as it tends to cause piercings to migrate and can, especially in ears, lead to a thinning of tissue that is disfiguring or requires reconstructive surgery. However, it is a method that has been traditionally utilized by various tribes, such as the Dayaks in Borneo, that practice extreme earlobe elongation. *Scalpelling: Rather than expanding a healed fistula, this method involves extending the size of the piercing by using a scalpel to cut the edge of the fistula, expanding its diameter. It is often used in earlobe piercings. This technique is also often used to alter the placement of a large piercing, combine two existing piercings into one larger one, or achieve a higher-gauge piercing when scar tissue is preventing stretching, or when tissue has thinned too much making stretching too risky. *Scalpel and taper or pierce and taper: After piercing or scalpelling, a large taper can be inserted directly after, allowing skin to instantly be stretched to large diameters; several inches can be achieved. This method is much rarer and can be extremely painful, causing formation of large amounts of scar tissue. Because of this, it is generally discouraged. The use of a dermal punch followed by tapering is also used in this procedure. *Dermal Punch: A circular razor of the desired diameter is pressed against the skin of the area (typically earlobe or cartilage). The blade is then pushed down upon and twisted by the piercer to \\"punch\\" out a small disk of skin. The razor is then pulled out of the skin and the jewelry (usually a non-flared or single-flared Pyrex Glass plug) of the same size is inserted into the hole created by the razor. This is useful for achieving large-gauge cartilage piercings, and often discouraged for soft tissue that can easily be stretched. It is also described as being less painful and less damaging to tissue than using a hypodermic needle of the same gauge. *Silicone Plugs: These plugs are soft and malleable, allowing a relatively large plug to be inserted into the fistula. Once folded and inserted into the ear, they expand, stretching the earlobe. However, stretching with silicone is often a dangerous decision. It's not recommended to use silicone plugs to stretch, due to the tacky, porous surface. The stretched fistula can adhere to the silicone if the lubricant used is pushed out by the pressure of the stretch, and an airtight seal can be created, trapping infection and causing it to spread internally. Also because silicone expands and contracts in temperature change, they can swell and potentially blow out a newly stretched fistula.  History and culture  Karen woman with stretched earlobes Many young, western people have adopted the practice of stretching ear lobes for aesthetic reasons. This seems to give the impression that this is a modern practice, however it is not. Ear stretching is a ritual that has been practiced by people all over the world from ancient times. Bone, horn, wood, and stone are generally carved for ear stretching, but other organic materials that have the right shape naturally, such as shells, teeth, and claws, have also been used. Historically, the practice has been used for the purpose of achieving social status, to scare enemies in war, and for aesthetic purposes. It has been and still is a common practice for people in many parts of the world, including Africa, Eurasia, America, and beyond. =King Tutankhamen= The Ancient Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun is one of the earliest known rulers to have stretched ear lobes. This can clearly be seen in one of his more famous images on his sarcophagus. The instrument used to stretch the pharaoh's ears is unknown, but there are many possibilities including bamboo or wooden plugs. =The Iceman= Mummified bodies with stretched earlobes have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date: √ñtzi the Iceman (3300BC). The Iceman was found in the Alps between Austria and Italy. This European mummy had a stretch of somewhere between in diameter. =Gautama Buddha= Gautama Buddha, an aristocratic and wealthy prince, had long stretched ears. He wore heavy gold earrings or precious stones as a status symbol, and the weight stretched his ear lobes dramatically. When he finally renounced his wealth and discarded his jewelry, his ear lobes were permanently stretched. As a way of remembering Buddha's act of personal self-sacrifice in walking away from his wealth, all succeeding images of Gautama Buddha show his stretched ear lobes without jewellery. =Easter Island heads= Stretched earlobes can be found on the heads of the giant statues on Easter Island, giving them the title ‚ÄòLong Ears.‚Äô It is said that the original inhabitants of Easter Island carved the heads to depict themselves. When another tribe arrived to the Island, they were given the title ‚ÄòShort Ears.‚Äô The ‚ÄòLong Ears‚Äô would enslave the ‚ÄòShort Ears‚Äô until there were more ‚ÄòShort Ears‚Äô to overthrow them. =Mursi women in Ethiopia= The Mursi are a Nilotic people inhabiting the Nile Valley, known for their women decorating themselves with wooden plates in both their ears and bottom lip. Around the age of fifteen and a year before her marriage, a young woman has her lip and ears pierced by her mother. She then pushes a wooden peg through each piercing. After the healing process, the pegs are changed and go up in diameter (usually 8‚Äì22 cm). Once the desired size is reached, the young woman receives a higher degree of respect than those without piercings. =The Maasai people of Kenya= Both Maasai men and women stretch their ears, although today more women than men follow the practice. Originally, the piercing was done with a sharpened object such as the point of a knife or a thorn. Heavy jewelry was then placed in the hole to increase the size. The Maasai are known for using materials such as animal bones, wood, stone, and tusks for jewelry. =The Fulani of western Africa= The Fulani people are from Nigeria and elsewhere in western Africa. At the age of three years, girls will have their ears pierced but not stretched until they are older. These women will stretch their ears to a smaller diameter, unlike the Mursi and Maasai tribes, so that they can wear hoops and large gold domes. =Asian hill tribes= The Lahu tribe from Thailand and the Karen-Padaung from Myanmar are two known Asian tribes that practice ear stretching. They both believe that they should wear as much jewelry as possible because ears are revered as sacred. =Mexican and Central American civilizations= Aztec and Mayan men are traditionally known to have had stretched ears. The Aztecs crafted plugs from gold and silver for the higher-class men whereas the lower class wore materials such as shells, wood, and copper. The same idea can be seen with the Mayas. High-class men wore jade plugs, and the rest of society used bone, stone, and wood.

The film consists of two segments‚Äîthe first of which is based on the 1908 children's novel The Wind in the Willows by British author Kenneth Grahame, and the second is based on the 1820 short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", called Ichabod Crane in the film, by American author Washington Irving. The film is the 11th Disney animated feature film, and the last of the studio's package film era of the 1940s, following Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music, Fun and Fancy Free, and Melody Time. Disney would not produce another package film until The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh in March 1977. Beginning in 1955, the two portions of the film were separated, and televised as part of the Disneyland television series. They were later marketed and sold separately on home video.  Segments  As the film's animated segments are based on literary works, they are both introduced in live-action scenes set in a library as a framing device. The first segment is introduced and narrated by Basil Rathbone, and the second segment is introduced and narrated by Bing Crosby. Decca Records issued an album called Ichabod ‚Äì The Legend of Sleepy Hollow featuring Bing Crosby in 1949 to tie in with the release of the film. = The Wind in the Willows = This segment is based on The Wind in the Willows (1908) by Kenneth Grahame. The story is set in and around London, England, United Kingdom between June 10, 1908 and January 1, 1909. The protagonist J. Thaddeus Toad, Esq. is introduced as an \\"incurable adventurer\\" who \\"never counted the cost\\". As the story's \\"one disturbing element\\", although he is the wealthy proprietor of the Toad Hall estate, Toad's adventures and \\"positive mania for fads\\" have brought him to the brink of bankruptcy. As a last resort, Toad's friend Angus MacBadger volunteers as Toad's bookkeeper to help Toad keep his estate which is a source of pride in the community. One summer day, MacBadger asks Toad's friends Ratty (a water rat) and Moley (a mole) to persuade Toad to give up his latest mania of recklessly driving about the countryside in a horse and canary-yellow gypsy cart, which could accumulate a great deal of financial liability in damaged property. Ratty and Moley confront Toad, but are unable to change his mind. Toad tries to escape from them, but then sees a motor car for the first time and becomes entranced by the new machine, having been taken over by \\"motor- mania\\". In an attempt to cure Toad's new mania, Ratty and Moley put Toad under house arrest. However, Toad escapes and is later arrested and charged with car theft. At his trial, Toad represents himself and calls his horse Cyril Proudbottom as his first witness. Cyril testifies that the car which Toad was accused of stealing had already been stolen by a gang of weasels. Toad had entered a tavern where the car was parked and offered to buy the car from the weasels. However, since Toad had no money, he instead offered to trade Toad Hall for the car. The prosecutor and judge show disbelief toward the statement, so Toad then calls the bartender Mr. Winkie as a witness to the agreement; however, when told by Toad to explain what actually happened (during which he believes he will be pronounced innocent, proceeding to dress fashionably and attempting to walk out the door of the court house) Winkie falsely testifies that Toad had tried to sell him the stolen car. Toad is found guilty on the spot and sentenced to 20 years in the Tower of London. As the months passed by, Toad's friends make every effort to appeal his case, but to no avail. On Christmas Eve, Toad appears to have an epiphany about his careless ways, but once Cyril visits Toad in disguise as his grandmother and helps him escape by giving him a disguise of his own, all that flies out the window. Toad quickly runs to a railway station and hijacks a 2-4-0 steam locomotive and drives out of the station heading toward the river bank without getting caught by the police on another train. Though seeming to drown due to his ball and chain dragging him down to the bottom of the river, he then arrives at Ratty's house. However, while Moley is happy to see him again, Ratty is insistent that Toad return to prison and pay his debt to society, still believing he'd stolen the motorcar. Meanwhile, MacBadger discovers that Mr. Winkie himself is the leader of the weasel gang, and that they have indeed taken over Toad Hall; Winkie himself is in possession of the deed. Ratty then apologizes to Toad for thinking ill of him. Knowing that the deed bearing both Toad and Winkie's signatures would prove Toad's innocence, the four friends sneak into Toad Hall using a secret passage near the river by boat. Though Toad nearly louses up the plan by almost shooting the guard outside on the bridge, the four manage to sneak in. Finding the weasels and Winkie (who they see has the deed on his person) drunk and passed out, they attempt to lower Moley on a makeshift rope to swipe it. Unfortunately, Toad's actions from before had caused more damage than originally thought as the guard investigates, finds the passageway and wakes up the Weasels and Winkie. A grueling chase around the estate ensues to take the document, during which a number of antics happen, including Toad folding the deed into a paper airplane and then producing numerous ones to confuse Winkie and the weasels and the quick switch-around with the hidden wall panel. Though the four manage to escape with their lives, they appear to not get the deed. However, Toad proudly produces said deed from his pocket. The film then ends on New Year's Day with Toad exonerated and regaining his house while it is implied that Winkie and the weasels have been arrested and imprisoned. As MacBadger, Ratty, and Moley celebrate the New Year with a toast to Toad, who they believe has completely reformed, Toad and Cyril recklessly fly past on a 1903 Wright Flyer; Toad has not truly reformed and has developed a mania for airplanes instead. = The Legend of Sleepy Hollow = The second segment is based on \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" by Washington Irving. Although the film introduces the story as Ichabod Crane, later individual releases retained the story's original title. (As a short story, \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" was originally published in The Sketch Book with other stories, not as a single volume as pictured in the film.) In October 1790 (fourteen years after the American Revolution and founding the United States), Ichabod Crane, a lanky and superstitious, yet charming dandy arrives in Sleepy Hollow, New York, a small village outside Tarrytown that is renowned for its ghostly hauntings, to be the town's new schoolmaster. Despite his odd behavior, appearance, and rather effeminate mannerisms, Ichabod soon wins the hearts of the village's women and forms good friendships with his students, though the latter is mainly in order to get invitations to suppers at said student's homes which he would not be able to afford on his meager salary. Brom Bones, the roguish town hero, does his best to bully and play pranks Ichabod, such as interrupting his singing lessons with the town ladies choir by having a dog howl in the middle of Ichabod singing a series of notes, making it seem like Ichabod himself produced it. However, the schoolmaster is very good at ignoring these taunts and continues to interact with the townspeople. One day at a town picnic, Ichabod meets and falls in love with Katrina van Tassel, the beautiful daughter of the wealthy farmer Baltus van Tassel and Brom's unofficial fianc√©e. Despite being obsessed with Katrina's beauty, Ichabod mainly desires to take her family's money for himself. Brom, who has never been challenged like this, proceeds to compete with the schoolmaster, but Ichabod wins Katrina over at every opportunity and proceeds to (albeit mostly unintentionally) make a fool of Brom. Unbeknownst to both men, Katrina is only using Ichabod to make Brom jealous and force him to try harder for her affections. The two love rivals are invited to the van Tassel Halloween party. Brom attempts to get Ichabod to dance with a plump woman who is a wild and impetuous dancer instead of Katrina, and later attempts to have him fall through a cellar door, but both attempts backfire. While both men dine, Brom catches Ichabod accidentally knocking the salt shaker over and nervously tossing salt over his left shoulder. Discovering Ichabod's weakness is superstition, he decides to sing the tale of the legendary Headless Horseman. The horseman supposedly travels the woods on Halloween each year, searching for a living head to replace the one he had lost, and the only way to escape the ghost is to cross a covered bridge. Everyone else, including Katrina, finds the song amusing, while Ichabod starts to fear for his life. Riding home from the party through the very woods from the song, Ichabod becomes paranoid of every sound he hears in the dark woods. While traveling through the old cemetery, Ichabod believes he hears the sound of a horse galloping toward him, but discovers the sound is being made by nearby cattails bumping on a log. He and his horse begin to laugh hysterically in amusement at being scared by something so small... when their laughter is cut short by the appearance of the Headless Horseman, wielding a sword and riding what appears to be Brom's black horse. After being chased through the dark forest, Ichabod, remembering Brom's advice, rides across the covered bridge to stop the ghost's pursuit. The horseman stops and throws his flaming head, revealed to be a jack-o'-lantern, right at Ichabod's face, presumably knocking him out. The next morning, Ichabod's hat is found at the bridge next to the shattered jack-o-lantern, but Ichabod himself is nowhere to be found. Sometime later, Brom takes Katrina as his wife. Rumors begin to spread that Ichabod is still alive, married to a wealthy widow in a distant county with children who all look like him. However, the superstitious people of Sleepy Hollow insist that he has been \\"spirited away\\" by the Headless Horseman.  Cast The Legend of Sleepy Hollow= * Bing Crosby as the Narrator, Ichabod Crane and Brom Bones * Pinto Colvig as Gunpowder and Ichabod Crane screaming * Clarence Nash as Ichabod's horse =The Wind in the Willows= Production  In 1938, shortly after the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, James Bodrero and Campbell Grant pitched to Walt Disney the idea of making a feature film of Kenneth Grahame's 1908 children's book The Wind in the Willows. Bodrero and Grant felt that The Wind in the Willows, with its anthropomorphized animals, could only be produced using animation. To persuade Disney to approve the film, Bodrero and Grant prepared a Leica reel, which combined storyboard stills with rough dialogue performed by members of the animation staff. Disney was skeptical, however, and felt it would be \\"awful corny\\", but acquired the rights in April that year. The film was intended to be a single narrative feature film with the title of the same name. After some delays due to story rewrites, James Algar was appointed to direct the film. By April 1941, work on The Wind in the Willows had begun as animators and writers had come off from Bambi, which was nearly complete. When the Disney animators' strike was finished in October 1941, Joe Rosenberg of the Bank of America issued an ultimatum in which he would permit an absolute loan limit of $3.5 million, and in return, he ordered the studio to restrict itself to producing animation shorts and to finish features already in production‚ÄîDumbo, Bambi, and The Wind in the Willows‚Äîbut no other feature film would begin work until they had been released and earned back their costs. In response, the studio's feature film production, including early versions of Alice in Wonderland and Lady and the Tramp, were heavily scaled back while The Wind in the Willows was kept in production as animation work had already begun. However, after reviewing the animation footage, Disney decided to shelve the project deciding that \\"the quality was too far below the standard necessary to be successful on the market.\\" The Wind in the Willows resumed production in 1946. Following his military service in World War II, animator Frank Thomas was assigned to direct additional footage for Wind in the Willows alongside James Algar in hopes of salvaging the project. Under Walt's strict orders, the film was shortened down to a length of 25 minutes. However, the project was shelved again following layoffs in August 1946. Meanwhile, in December 1946, Disney started production on a new animated feature film, an adaptation of Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", which was to be co-directed by Jack Kinney and Clyde Geronimi. Around this same time, there were plans developed to combine The Wind in the Willows with The Legend of Happy Valley and The Gremlins, an original story developed by author Roald Dahl, into a package film titled Three Fabulous Characters. When The Gremlins failed to materialize, the title was changed to Two Fabulous Characters. Then, The Legend of Happy Valley was cut from the project in favor of pairing it with Bongo in which the two shorts were incorporated under the title Fun and Fancy Free, which was eventually released in 1947. In late 1947, Disney decided to pair The Legend of Sleepy Hollow with The Wind in the Willows into a singular package film as neither part was long enough to be a feature film. The new film was later given its final title The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. Well-known celebrities Basil Rathbone and Bing Crosby were cast as narrators in order to provide mass audience appeal.  Reception  Critical reception = The New York Times praised the film, saying that \\"Mr. Disney, abetted by his staff, such perfect narrators as Bing Crosby and Basil Rathbone, and a pair of durable literary works, has fashioned a conclave of cartoon creatures, which, by and large, have the winsome qualities and charm of such noted creations as Mickey Mouse, Dumbo, et al.\\" Life wrote that Disney's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows \\"leaves out the poetry and most of the subtlety, but it still has enough action for the children and wit enough for everybody. It is deft and pleasant, and throughout, ironic and goodhearted. Although the Ichabod part of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is silly and bumbling, Mr. Toad's half is good enough to convince Disney admirers that the old master can still display the bounce and vitality he had before the war.\\" Time particularly praised the first half, writing, \\"This lighthearted, fast- moving romp has inspired some of Disney's most inventive draftsmanship and satire.\\" Disney film historian and film critic Leonard Maltin, writing in his book The Disney Films, wrote that the film was \\"one of Disney's most beguiling animated features: The Wind in the Willows in particular has some of the finest work the studio ever did.\\" Altogether, he claimed \\"these sequences form a most engaging feature, with as the saying goes, something for everyone. The half-hour length seems ideal for each of the stories, with neither a feeling of abruptness, nor a hint of padding to reach that length. And somehow the two tales seem to complement each other quite well, providing an interesting contrast, notable in style and execution, and more obviously in the change of narrator.\\" M. Faust of Common Sense Media gave the film five out of five stars, writing, \\"Two classic stories told in the best Disney style\\". On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad has an approval rating of 93%, based on 14 reviews, with an average score of 7.25/10. Its consensus states \\"This Disney two-fer may not be the most reverent literary adaptation, but it's remarkably crafted and emotionally resonant.\\" = Box office = The film grossed $1,200,000 in domestic rentals in the United States and Canada. Cumulatively, it earned $1,625,000 in worldwide rentals. = Accolades = * Golden Globe AwardsGolden Globe Awards ** Best Cinematography Color ‚Äì Won  Release  Television airings = The Mr. Toad segment of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad was first screened on television, in edited form, as part of the inaugural season of the Disneyland anthology series, on February 2, 1955, under the title The Wind in the Willows.Television.

The Legend of Sleepy Hollow had a subsequent television airing, in truncated form, as part of the TV specials Halloween Hall o' Fame (1977) and Disney's Halloween Treat (1982). Once it was split into two segments for airing on the Disneyland television series, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad was not available for viewing in its original form for many years thereafter, but was instead screened as two individual items. When first released on home video, the segments retained their names from the Disneyland series (The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and The Wind in the Willows, respectively), having taken their names from the original stories. Some of the scenes were cut when the segments were split up for home video release. For example: * The Wind in the Willows ** Part of the introduction was cut because of the new music added. ** The scene where Angus MacBadger confronts the angry townspeople who are suing Toad. ** The newspaper scene regarding Toad's disgrace was shortened by removing the newspaper articles of his friends' attempts to reopen his case. ** When Toad realizes he is underwater after unknowingly jumping into a river to elude the police pursuing him, there is a brief full-body scene of Toad frantically trying to pull out the ball-and- chain he is shackled to out of the floor of the river. * The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ** The only thing that was cut was the introduction in the bookcases. = Home media = The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad received its first complete home video release in the UK in 1991 and in the US in 1992, when it was released by Walt Disney Home Video on LaserDisc. A subsequent complete release on VHS followed in 1999 as the last title in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line. In 2000, it appeared on DVD for the first time as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line. The 1963 theatrical version of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was released on VHS in 1982, 1990, and 1994. The 1978 theatrical version of The Wind in the Willows was released on VHS in 1982, 1988, and 1996. This same version of The Wind in the Willows was issued on DVD for the first time in 2009, as part of the fifth volume of the Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films series. Both had been released to video separately in the US in the early 1980s as white clamshell releases even though Fun and Fancy Free had been released in its entirety around the same time. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad was released on Blu-ray, DVD, Digital HD and in a two-film collection with Fun and Fancy Free on August 12, 2014. It was also released as solely on Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy combo and a stand-alone DVD exclusively to Walmart stores. The film was available to stream on Disney+ when the service launched on November 12, 2019.https://attractionsmagazine.com/disney-plus-day-one-list/  See also  * 1949 in film * List of American films of 1949 * List of Walt Disney Pictures films * List of Disney theatrical animated features * List of animated feature films of the 1940s * List of highest-grossing animated films * List of package films * Mr. Toad's Wild Ride  References  Bibliography  * *  External links  The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad on Metacritc Category:1949 films Category:1949 animated films Category:1940s fantasy adventure films Category:1940s American animated films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:Fiction set in 1790 Category:American films Category:Animated films about rats Category:Animated films about reptiles and amphibians Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:Christmas films Category:English-language films Category:Films about Halloween Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films based on The Wind in the Willows Category:Films based on works by Washington Irving Category:Films directed by Clyde Geronimi Category:Films directed by Jack Kinney Category:Films directed by James Algar Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:Films set in the 1790s Category:Films set in 1908 Category:Films set in 1909 Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Westchester County, New York Category:New Year films Category:Package films Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:Works based on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ","title":"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"},{"id":"1614268","text":"Quality management ensures that an organization, product or service is consistent. It has four main components: quality planning, quality assurance, quality control and quality improvement. Quality management is focused not only on product and service quality, but also on the means to achieve it. Quality management, therefore, uses quality assurance and control of processes as well as products to achieve more consistent quality. What a customer wants and is willing to pay for it determines quality. It is a written or unwritten commitment to a known or unknown consumer in the market. Thus, quality can be defined as fitness for intended use or, in other words, how well the product performs its intended function. Evolution Quality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization. Civilizations that supported the arts and crafts allowed clients to choose goods meeting higher quality standards rather than normal goods. In societies where arts and crafts are the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists, these masters would lead their studios and train and supervise others. The importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work practices were instituted. The aim was to produce large numbers of the same goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was Eli Whitney who proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward was promoted by several people including Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called \\"the father of scientific management.\\" He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices. Henry Ford was also important in bringing process and quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. In Germany, Karl Benz, often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar assembly and production practices, although real mass production was properly initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. From this period onwards, North American companies focused predominantly upon production against lower cost with increased efficiency. Walter A. Shewhart made a major step in the evolution towards quality management by creating a method for quality control for production, using statistical methods, first proposed in 1924. This became the foundation for his ongoing work on statistical quality control. W. Edwards Deming later applied statistical process control methods in the United States during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products. Quality leadership from a national perspective has changed over the past decades. After the second world war, Japan decided to make quality improvement a national imperative as part of rebuilding their economy, and sought the help of Shewhart, Deming and Juran, amongst others. W. Edwards Deming championed Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. He is probably best known for his management philosophy establishing quality, productivity, and competitive position. He has formulated 14 points of attention for managers, which are a high level abstraction of many of his deep insights. They should be interpreted by learning and understanding the deeper insights. These 14 points include key concepts such as: * Break down barriers between departments * Management should learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership * Supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job * Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service * Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement In the 1950s and 1960s, Japanese goods were synonymous with cheapness and low quality, but over time their quality initiatives began to be successful, with Japan achieving high levels of quality in products from the 1970s onward. For example, Japanese cars regularly top the J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings. In the 1980s Deming was asked by Ford Motor Company to start a quality initiative after they realized that they were falling behind Japanese manufacturers. A number of highly successful quality initiatives have been invented by the Japanese (see for example on this pages: Genichi Taguchi, QFD, Toyota Production System). Many of the methods not only provide techniques but also have associated quality culture (i.e. people factors). These methods are now adopted by the same western countries that decades earlier derided Japanese methods. Customers recognize that quality is an important attribute in products and services. Suppliers recognize that quality can be an important differentiator between their own offerings and those of competitors (quality differentiation is also called the quality gap). In the past two decades this quality gap has been greatly reduced between competitive products and services. This is partly due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacture to countries like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition. These countries, among many others, have raised their own standards of quality in order to meet international standards and customer demands. The ISO 9000 series of standards are probably the best known International standards for quality management. Customer satisfaction is the backbone of Quality Management. Setting up a million dollar company without taking care of needs of customer will ultimately decrease its revenue. There are many books available on quality management. Some themes have become more significant including quality culture, the importance of knowledge management, and the role of leadership in promoting and achieving high quality. Disciplines like systems thinking are bringing more holistic approaches to quality so that people, process and products are considered together rather than independent factors in quality management. The influence of quality thinking has spread to non-traditional applications outside of walls of manufacturing, extending into service sectors and into areas such as sales, marketing and customer service. Principles The International Standard for Quality management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts a number of management principles, that can be used by top management to guide their organizations towards improved performance. =Customer focus= The primary focus of quality management is to meet customer requirements and to strive to exceed customer expectations. Rationale Sustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the confidence of customers and other interested parties on whom it depends. Every aspect of customer interaction provides an opportunity to create more value for the customer. Understanding current and future needs of customers and other interested parties contributes to sustained success of an organization =Leadership= Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction and create conditions in which people are engaged in achieving the organization‚Äôs quality objectives. Leadership has to take up the necessary changes required for quality improvement and encourage a sense of quality throughout organisation. Rationale Creation of unity of purpose and direction and engagement of people enable an organization to align its strategies, policies, processes and resources to achieve its objectives =Engagement of people= Competent, empowered and engaged people at all levels throughout the organization are essential to enhance its capability to create and deliver value. Rationale To manage an organization effectively and efficiently, it is important to involve all people at all levels and to respect them as individuals. Recognition, empowerment and enhancement of competence facilitate the engagement of people in achieving the organization‚Äôs quality objectives. =Process approach= Consistent and predictable results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that function as a coherent system. Rationale The quality management system consists of interrelated processes. Understanding how results are produced by this system enables an organization to optimize the system and its performance. =Improvement= Successful organizations have an ongoing focus on improvement. Rationale Improvement is essential for an organization to maintain current levels of performance, to react to changes in its internal and external conditions and to create new opportunities. =Evidence based decision making= Decisions based on the analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired results. Rationale Decision making can be a complex process, and it always involves some uncertainty. It often involves multiple types and sources of inputs, as well as their interpretation, which can be subjective. It is important to understand cause- and-effect relationships and potential unintended consequences. Facts, evidence and data analysis lead to greater objectivity and confidence in decision making. =Relationship management = For sustained success, an organization manages its relationships with interested parties, such as suppliers, retailers. Rationale Interested parties influence the performance of an organizations and industry. Sustained success is more likely to be achieved when the organization manages relationships with all of its interested parties to optimize their impact on its performance. Relationship management with its supplier and partner networks is of particular importance.  Criticism  The social scientist Bettina Warzecha (2017) describes the central concepts of Quality Management (QM), such as e.g. process orientation, controllability, and zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero- error processes and the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological problem of self-referentiality. The emphasis on the processes in QM also ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference between structure and process. Above all, the complexity of management cannot be reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures. According to her, the risks and negative side effects of QM are usually greater than the benefits (see also brand eins, 2010). Quality improvement and more The PDCA cycle There are many methods for quality improvement. These cover product improvement, process improvement and people based improvement. In the following list are methods of quality management and techniques that incorporate and drive quality improvement: # ISO 9004:2008 ‚Äî guidelines for performance improvement. # ISO 9001:2015 - a certified quality management system (QMS) for organisations who want to prove their ability to consistently provide products and services that meet the needs of their customers and other relevant stakeholders. # ISO 15504-4: 2005 ‚Äî information technology ‚Äî process assessment ‚Äî Part 4: Guidance on use for process improvement and process capability determination. # QFD ‚Äî quality function deployment, also known as the house of quality approach. # Kaizen ‚Äî ÊîπÂñÑ, Japanese for change for the better; the common English term is continuous improvement. # Zero Defect Program ‚Äî created by NEC Corporation of Japan, based upon statistical process control and one of the inputs for the inventors of Six Sigma. # Six Sigma ‚Äî 6œÉ, Six Sigma combines established methods such as statistical process control, design of experiments and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in an overall framework. # PDCA ‚Äî plan, do, check, act cycle for quality control purposes. (Six Sigma's DMAIC method (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) may be viewed as a particular implementation of this.) # Quality circle ‚Äî a group (people oriented) approach to improvement. # Taguchi methods ‚Äî statistical oriented methods including quality robustness, quality loss function, and target specifications. # The Toyota Production System ‚Äî reworked in the west into lean manufacturing. # Kansei Engineering ‚Äî an approach that focuses on capturing customer emotional feedback about products to drive improvement. # TQM ‚Äî total quality management is a management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. First promoted in Japan with the Deming prize which was adopted and adapted in USA as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and in Europe as the European Foundation for Quality Management award (each with their own variations). # TRIZ ‚Äî meaning \\"theory of inventive problem solving\\" # BPR ‚Äî business process reengineering, a management approach aiming at optimizing the workflows and processes within an organisation. # OQRM ‚Äî Object-oriented Quality and Risk Management, a model for quality and risk management. # Top Down & Bottom Up Approaches‚ÄîLeadership approaches to change Proponents of each approach have sought to improve them as well as apply them for small, medium and large gains. Simple one is Process Approach, which forms the basis of ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System standard, duly driven from the 'Eight principles of Quality management', process approach being one of them. Tharejahttp://ssrn.com/abstract=1488690 \\"Thareja\\" writes about the mechanism and benefits: \\"The process (proficiency) may be limited in words, but not in its applicability. While it fulfills the criteria of all-round gains: in terms of the competencies augmented by the participants; the organisation seeks newer directions to the business success, the individual brand image of both the people and the organisation, in turn, goes up. The competencies which were hitherto rated as being smaller, are better recognized and now acclaimed to be more potent and fruitful\\".Thareja P(2008), \\"Total Quality Organization Thru‚Äô People, Each one is Capable\\", FOUNDRY, Vol. XX, No. 4, July/Aug 2008 The more complex Quality improvement tools are tailored for enterprise types not originally targeted. For example, Six Sigma was designed for manufacturing but has spread to service enterprises. Each of these approaches and methods has met with success but also with failures. Some of the common differentiators between success and failure include commitment, knowledge and expertise to guide improvement, scope of change/improvement desired (Big Bang type changes tend to fail more often compared to smaller changes) and adaption to enterprise cultures. For example, quality circles do not work well in every enterprise (and are even discouraged by some managers), and relatively few TQM-participating enterprises have won the national quality awards. There have been well publicized failures of BPR, as well as Six Sigma. Enterprises therefore need to consider carefully which quality improvement methods to adopt, and certainly should not adopt all those listed here. It is important not to underestimate the people factors, such as culture, in selecting a quality improvement approach. Any improvement (change) takes time to implement, gain acceptance and stabilize as accepted practice. Improvement must allow pauses between implementing new changes so that the change is stabilized and assessed as a real improvement, before the next improvement is made (hence continual improvement, not continuous improvement). Improvements that change the culture take longer as they have to overcome greater resistance to change. It is easier and often more effective to work within the existing cultural boundaries and make small improvements (that is 'Kaizen') than to make major transformational changes. Use of Kaizen in Japan was a major reason for the creation of Japanese industrial and economic strength. On the other hand, transformational change works best when an enterprise faces a crisis and needs to make major changes in order to survive. In Japan, the land of Kaizen, Carlos Ghosn led a transformational change at Nissan Motor Company which was in a financial and operational crisis. Well organized quality improvement programs take all these factors into account when selecting the quality improvement methods. Quality standards ISO standards = The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created the Quality Management System (QMS) standards in 1987. They were the ISO 9000:1987 series of standards comprising ISO 9001:1987, ISO 9002:1987 and ISO 9003:1987; which were applicable in different types of industries, based on the type of activity or process: designing, production or service delivery. The standards are reviewed every few years by the International Organization for Standardization. The version in 1994 was called the ISO 9000:1994 series; consisting of the ISO 9001:1994, 9002:1994 and 9003:1994 versions. The last major revision was in the year 2000 and the series was called ISO 9000:2000 series. The ISO 9002 and 9003 standards were integrated into one single certifiable standard: ISO 9001:2000. After December 2003, organizations holding ISO 9002 or 9003 standards had to complete a transition to the new standard. ISO released a minor revision, ISO 9001:2008 on 14 October 2008. It contains no new requirements. Many of the changes were to improve consistency in grammar, facilitating translation of the standard into other languages for use by over 950,000 certified organization in the 175 countries (as at Dec 2007) that use the standard. The ISO 9004:2009 document gives guidelines for performance improvement over and above the basic standard (ISO 9001:2000). This standard provides a measurement framework for improved quality management, similar to and based upon the measurement framework for process assessment. The Quality Management System standards created by ISO are meant to certify the processes and the system of an organization, not the product or service itself. ISO 9000 standards do not certify the quality of the product or service. In 2005 the International Organization for Standardization released a standard, ISO 22000, meant for the food industry. This standard covers the values and principles of ISO 9000 and the HACCP standards. It gives one single integrated standard for the food industry and is expected to become more popular in the coming years in such industry. ISO has also released standards for other industries. For example, Technical Standard TS 16949 defines requirements in addition to those in ISO 9001:2008 specifically for the automotive industry. ISO has a number of standards that support quality management. One group describes processes (including ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288) and another describes process assessment and improvement ISO 15504. = CMMI and IDEAL methods = The Software Engineering Institute has its own process assessment and improvement methods, called CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) and IDEAL respectively. Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement training and appraisal program and service administered and marketed by Carnegie Mellon University and required by many DOD and U.S. Government contracts, especially in software development. Carnegie Mellon University claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization. Under the CMMI methodology, processes are rated according to their maturity levels, which are defined as: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing. Currently supported is CMMI Version 1.3. CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by Carnegie Mellon University. Three constellations of CMMI are: * Product and service development (CMMI for Development) * Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services) * Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition). CMMI Version 1.3 was released on November 1, 2010. This release is noteworthy because it updates all three CMMI models (CMMI for Development, CMMI for Services, and CMMI for Acquisition) to make them consistent and to improve their high maturity practices. The CMMI Product Team has reviewed more than 1,150 change requests for the models and 850 for the appraisal method. As part of its mission to transition mature technology to the software community, the SEI has transferred CMMI-related products and activities to the CMMI Institute, a 100%-controlled subsidiary of Carnegie Innovations, Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs technology commercialization enterprise.

Solutions range in functionality, however, with the use of automation capabilities they typically have components for managing internal and external risk, compliance, and the quality of processes and products. Pre- configured and industry-specific solutions are available and generally require integration with existing IT architecture applications such as ERP, SCM, CRM, and PLM. Quality Management Software Functionalities * Non- Conformances/Corrective and Preventive Action * Compliance/Audit Management * Supplier Quality Management * Risk Management * Statistical Process Control * Failure Mode and Effects Analysis * Complaint Handling * Advanced Product Quality Planning * Environment, Health, and Safety * Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points * Production Part Approval Process Enterprise Quality Management Software The intersection of technology and quality management software prompted the emergence of a new software category: Enterprise Quality Management Software (EQMS). EQMS is a platform for cross-functional communication and collaboration that centralizes, standardizes, and streamlines quality management data from across the value chain. The software breaks down functional silos created by traditionally implemented standalone and targeted solutions. Supporting the proliferation and accessibility of information across supply chain activities, design, production, distribution, and service, it provides a holistic viewpoint for managing the quality of products and processes. Quality terms * Quality Improvement can be distinguished from Quality Control in that Quality Improvement is the purposeful change of a process to improve the reliability of achieving an outcome. * Quality Control is the ongoing effort to maintain the integrity of a process to maintain the reliability of achieving an outcome. * Quality Assurance is the planned or systematic actions necessary to provide enough confidence that a product or service will satisfy the given requirements.

She was known for her recordings of \\"The Big Hurt\\", \\"West of the Wall\\", \\"Maybe (He'll Think Of Me)\\", and \\"Why Can't The Dark Leave Me Alone\\". She was later known as Toni F. Monzello, following her marriage to Henry Monzello. Biography Fisher is best remembered for her 1959 song \\"The Big Hurt\\", written by her manager Wayne Shanklin. The song went to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. The track also peaked at #30 in the UK Singles Chart. \\"The Big Hurt\\" is notable because it featured a flanging effect when mixing engineer Larry Levine‚Äîwho went on to help Phil Spector create his wall of sound‚Äîinadvertently mixed the mono and stereo versions of the song together but out of sync; a happy accident. It is claimed to be the first record to have such phasing.interview in Behind the Glass Vol2Liner notes of 2003 reissue of Nirvana's album All of Us DJ Dick Biondi on WKBW in Buffalo, New York, would introduce the record as \\"Toni Fisher's weird one\\". The song was recorded in the Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles and engineered by Stan Ross and Dave Gold. Disc jockey Wink Martindale commented that the record label billed the singer as \\"Miss Toni Fisher\\" because of her powerful voice, which is consistently audible over the phasing, the instruments, and the background noise, to confirm to the listener that the singer is indeed a woman. \\"The Big Hurt\\" was later covered by Wes Montgomery, Del Shannon, Scott Walker, Vikki Carr, Nick Cave, and others. In 1962 she had another Top 40 hit single with \\"West of the Wall\\" (#37), a song about the sadness of lovers separated by the 1961 erection of the Berlin Wall. She had recorded the melody before; an earlier version, \\"Toot Toot Amore\\" on Signet Records had different lyrics.

Originally opened on March 5, 1983, its original and current version feature the small purple dragon named Figment as well as the song \\"One Little Spark,\\" composed by the Sherman Brothers.  History 1983‚Äì1998: Journey into Imagination= The original attraction opened on March 5, 1983 and was the creation of Tony Baxter and Steve Kirk.. It began with the omnimover vehicles ‚Äúfloating‚Äù in the clouds and seeing the silhouette of a strange blimp mixed with a vacuum cleaner and hearing the humming and singing of its pilot. In the next scene the riders come right next to this vessel and the pilot, an old man with a red beard dressed in a blue suit and top hat, introduces himself as the Dreamfinder (voiced by Chuck McCann and Ron Schneider) and saying that he uses his vehicle (called the Dream Mobile or Dream Catcher by some fans) to collect dreams and ideas to create all sorts of new things. Soon he creates a figment of his imagination: \\"two tiny wings, eyes big and yellow, horns of a steer, but a lovable fellow! From head to tail, he's royal purple pigment, and there, voil√†! You've got a Figment!\\" Both Dreamfinder and the dragon Figment (voiced by Billy Barty) imagine things to fill the \\"idea bag.\\" When the idea bag is full, Dreamfinder declares that the ideas need to be emptied in the \\"Dreamport\\" which, as he says, is \\"never far away when you use your imagination.\\" Regarding the scene where Figment is introduced, Baxter said, > If you're telling the story of Little Mermaid or Snow White, everyone > already knows who they are, what they talk like, how they sing, etc. But in > a ride like Imagination, you're not familiar with the characters going into > it. This opening scene allows you to meet Dreamfinder, understand how he > created Figment, and get to know Figment's personality, so at the end of > those four minutes you know the characters. The omnimovers leave the side of the Dream Mobile and enter the Dreamport‚Äôs storage room, which includes a massive contraption for sorting ideas. Also in the room there are numerous objects including boxed applause, a plasma ball, and a birdcage of musical notes. After leaving the storage room, the ride continued through several rooms representing Art, Literature, the Performing Arts and Science. The Art room was mostly white colored, and had a large painting Dreamfinder was making using a large fiber optic paint brush, a carousel with giant carousel animals and a pot of rainbows held by Figment. The Literature room was mostly focused on suspenseful tales and had Dreamfinder playing a massive organ with words coming out of it, words that turned into their meanings, a massive book featuring the raven from Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs poem cawing menacingly and books of horrible monsters Figment tried to keep closed. The Performing Arts had Figment trying on costumes backstage while Dreamfinder conducted a laser light show in the manner of an orchestra conductor. The last of the rooms, Science, featured a large machine that Dreamfinder was operating that took a closer look at the workings of nature such as the growth of plants, the formation of crystals from minerals and looking into space. At the end, Dreamfinder told Figment and the audience that Imagination is the key to unlocking the hidden wonders of the world. The ride then entered the final show scene. As the riders' pictures were taken, they saw Figment surrounded by several movie screens of him being a scientist, a mountain climber, a pirate, a superhero, a tap dancer, a ship captain, a cowboy and an athlete. Dreamfinder, who is behind a movie camera, gave the riders one last inspiring message and told them to use their newly found sparks of imagination in the ImageWorks and the on-ride photo was shown on a screen next to the camera. The ride then exited into Imageworks, which was meant to be a creative playground of the future. Imageworks was an interactive playground located above the ride where guests could play with their imaginations. Those activities included interactive exhibits such as giant kaleidoscopes, pin-screens, a rainbow corridor, and a drama stage which gave guests the opportunity to put themselves in their own movie. The Imageworks section of the Imagination pavillion opened five months before Journey Into Imagination, and it was a hit among guests. The ride closed on October 10, 1998 in order to begin a major renovation of the attraction. =1999‚Äì2001: Journey into YOUR Imagination= The attraction reopened on October 1, 1999 as Journey Into YOUR Imagination and featured an updated theme based on the 3-D movie Honey, I Shrunk the Audience (1994). Now guests would take a tour of the Imagination Institute and be test subjects for the new invention, the Imagination Scanner. Dr. Nigel Channing, played by Eric Idle, hosted this version. The ride began with guests going through the scanner and saying that the riders have no imagination. Then Channing decides to send us through the numerous labs throughout the Institute including Sound, Illusion, Color, Gravity and Connections. In the first room, Sound, the room starts out in total silence and complete darkness. Slowly, one can hear the sounds of cricket chirping, distant city noises, and an approaching train that comes closer and closer until it seems to pass over the audience‚Äôs heads. In the second room, Illusion, there is a fish swimming in and out of its tank and an empty cage with a butterfly that seems to materialize as riders go by. In the third room, the Color lab, there are sounds of jungle animals and cities that cause two large light screens to change colors matching the sounds. In the next room, Connections lab, the room is covered with numerous stars that soon form into constellations. Finally, in the Gravity lab, the riders enter an upside down house. For the finale, riders go through the Scanner again and find that their minds have been supercharged with ideas. The machine then \\"explodes\\" and you see a light show. Public opinion of Journey into YOUR Imagination was generally negative. Figment‚Äôs appearances in the experience were reduced to cameos in the queue movies, a constellation in the connection lab and at the end of the ride, where he is only heard, but is shooed off by Channing. Fans were mainly upset that the Dreamfinder, a popular character from the original ride, was not present in this version. Additionally, the ride path was drastically shortened due to budgetary issues. Because of this, the attraction closed on October 8, 2001 and again, went through another renovation. =2002‚Äìpresent: Journey into Imagination with Figment= The Journey into Imagination with Figment ride at Epcot. The negative response to Journey into YOUR Imagination led to the ride being shut down and renovated once again after only 2 years. The attraction opened for its third and current iteration on June 2, 2002, as Journey into Imagination with Figment. Figment returned with a larger role, appearing in every show scene and the classic song \\"One Little Spark\\" also returned with new verses, but the Dreamfinder was still absent. This time, the Institute has five labs based on the five human senses: Sound, Sight, Smell, Touch, and Taste. Dr. Nigel Channing of the Imagination Institute (Eric Idle, from the previous incarnation) invites guests to the Institute‚Äôs open house. Figment (voiced by Dave Goelz) tags along, much to Channing‚Äôs dismay, and causes mischief along the way. *In Sound, Figment interrupts the experiment and comes up with a telephone and the train sound from the previous version is now a \\"Train of Thought.\\" *In Sight, Figment knocks the letters off the room‚Äôs eye chart and begins a sing-along to \\"One Little Spark.\\" The materializing butterfly from the old version was carried over from the previous version, but rather than appearing in the cage, the effect is now reversed so that the butterfly is hiding. *In Smell, Figment becomes a skunk, which blasts the riders with a foul odor (which is actually a burnt coffee smell). After seeing the chaos Figment has been causing, Channing stops the tour outside the Touch and Taste labs, abandoning the tour. Figment takes the riders to his own open house, which he literally turns upside down with his carefree mind. Channing soon learns from Figment that Imagination should be set free (\\"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!\\") and the riders go into the finale with numerous Figments in various situations while Figment and Channing (Channing is seen as the moon) sing \\"One Little Spark\\" together while riders disembark for the ImageWorks. A homage to the initial incarnation of this attraction can be found on an office door in the initial showroom under the name \\"Dean Finder,\\" alluding to \\"Dreamfinder.\\" Both the 1999 and 2002 versions were created by Tom Fitzgerald. The Kodak company ended its sponsorship of the pavilion in August 2010, after nearly 28 years. ImageWorks: The What-If Labs ImageWorks: The What-If Labs is an interactive exhibit area located at the Imagination! pavilion on the western side of Future World at Epcot, a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The original Journey Into Imagination described ImageWorks as \\"the creative playground of the future\\". Before its 1998 closure, the attraction was originally named ImageWorks and was located in the upstairs area of the Imagination! pavilion. The What-If Labs saw the addition of new interactive musical and digital exhibits. In 1999, the attraction reopened at the exit of Journey into Imagination with Figment. Kodak originally sponsored The What-If Labs, before ending its sponsorship in 2010. As of early 2012, sponsorship of the area was assumed by ColorVision, a company that operates green-screen photo kiosks in many major theme parks. In June 2016 the ImageWorks staircase area of the Imagination Pavilion reopened as a lounge for Disney Vacation Club members. The original ImageWorks is still believed to be intact as it has been walled off. =Exhibits=ImageWorks (1982‚Äì1998) The original Imageworks was located on the second floor of the pavilion. It was closed and partially dismantled during the 1998 renovation of the pavilion. Some of the original equipment remains in place, but guests are no longer able to enter the second floor. * Dreamfinder's School of Drama ‚Äî Using a bluescreen, guests put themselves into a movie under the direction of Dreamfinder. Choices were a Western (Daring Deputies and the Return of Sagebrush Sam), a fantasy film (Enchanted Travelers -- The Wily Wizard and the Cranky King), or a science fiction film (Acrobatic Astronauts in Galactic Getaway).Smith, Dave, Disney A to Z: The Official encyclopedia (New York, 1996: Hyperion), p. 151 * Pin Screens ‚Äî A massive pin table. * Stepping Tones ‚Äî Guests create music from stepping on color panels * Figment's Coloring Book ‚Äî Guests colored images featuring Figment and Dreamfinder using electric \\"paintbrush guns\\" * Rainbow Corridor ‚Äî A large tunnel that featured colored lights that followed the guests as they went through, with each guest getting a different color. This has gained high notoriety among Disney fans as Michael Jackson had several photos taken here in the 80s. * Electronic Philharmonic ‚Äî By the usage of sensors, guests could conduct an orchestra. * Kaleidoscopes ‚Äî Very large kaleidoscopes that could be controlled by the guest. * Vibrating Mirrors ‚Äî An effect that made the guests reflection warp like a funhouse mirror. * Voice Activated Lumia ‚Äî A sphere that would respond with light effects to the guests voice or sounds. * Bubble Projectors ‚Äî In the small pyramid, bubbles were projected on circular screens under the guests control. When they overlapped they would create new colors ImageWorks ‚Äì The \\"What If\\" Labs (1999‚Äìpresent) This Imageworks incarnation is located on the first floor of the pavilion, outside of the ride exit. The area is directly adjacent to the pavilion's gift shop. It was known as the Kodak \\"What If?\\" Labs from 1999 to 2010 while Kodak was a sponsor for the exhibit. The Kodak name has since been dropped. *Stepping Tones ‚Äî much like the original, though now featuring picture panels making sounds *Figment's Melody Maker ‚Äî Added in the 2002 refurbishment, guests can cause Figment to play an instrument to the tune of One Little Spark, changing pitch by what height Figment is at on the screen *Create A Figment ‚Äî Also added in 2002, there are small touchscreens where guests can make their own Figment and email it to a friend or family member *Simon ‚Äî Replaced photograph area due to Kodak's lack of sponsorship. One Little Spark \\"One Little Spark\\" is a song written by the Sherman Brothers for the original Journey Into Imagination attraction. The original version of the song (1983‚Äì1998) was performed by audio-animatronic characters, Dreamfinder (voiced by Chuck McCann (speaking) and Ron Schneider (singing)) and his creation Figment (voiced by Billy Barty). The 2002 version is performed by Dr. Nigel Channing (Eric Idle) with Figment (voiced by Dave Goelz). References to Disney films The 2002 revamp of the Journey into Imagination attraction includes several visual elements suggesting that the \\"Imagination Institute\\" is connected to Medfield College, the setting of several live-action Disney films. The queue for the attraction passes the \\"offices\\" of Professor Brainard (Fred MacMurray's role in The Absent-Minded Professor (1961), although the queue addressed the 1997 live-action remake when the role was played by Robin Williams), Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis in the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids trilogy) and Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn's role in the Dexter Riley films). The ride includes further references to The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, with a glass-fronted computer room, including a sign on the door indicating \\"no tennis shoes allowed,\\" as well as a Medfield College letter-man's jacket can also be seen inside the room.

He is a researcher at the Meudon campus of the Laboratoire Univers et Th√©ories, part of the CNRS. Biography Carter studied at the University of Cambridge under Dennis Sciama. He found the exact solution of the geodesic equations for the Kerr/Newman electrovacuum solution, and the maximal analytic extension of this solution. In the process, he discovered the extraordinary fourth constant of motion and the Killing‚ÄìYano tensor. Together with Werner Israel and Stephen Hawking, he proved partially the no-hair theorem in general relativity, stating that all stationary black holes are completely characterized by mass, charge, and angular momentum. In 1982 with astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet, he invented the concept of tidal disruption event (TDE), namely the destruction of a star passing in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole. They showed that this phenomenon could result in the violent destruction of the star in the form of a \\"stellar pancake\\", causing a reactivation of nuclear reactions in the core of the star in the stage of its maximum compression. More recently, Carter, Chachoua, and Chamel (2005) have formulated a relativistic theory of elastic deformations in neutron stars. References  * * Carter, B. & Luminet, J.- P.

The award is unusual in two ways: first, it is not an award for a specific class of thing, but can be awarded to a person, product, publication, company, organization, event or trend ‚Äì anything related to gaming; second, it does not count popularity or commercial success as a sign of \\"excellence\\". The award was first presented in 2001. Nominees are circulated during the year to the committee, which is mostly anonymous but which is known to include Peter Adkison, Matt Forbeck, John Kovalic and James Wallis. The committee is anonymous to protect the voting process from interference, but individual judges are free to reveal themselves. The committee releases a shortlist of three to seven nominees in spring, and the award is presented to the winner at Gen Con in Indianapolis in August. The Diana Jones trophy was created in the UK offices of TSR in the mid 1980s to commemorate the ending of their license to publish The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game.\\"JAMES WALLIS: ...Eventually the Lucasfilm license expires and is not renewed. The word comes down from TSR head office to TSR UK that all unsold copies are to be destroyed, as per the terms of the license. They guys at TSR UK...got the final unsold copy and they destroyed it.... this did this it in strategic ways, by singeing bits of it. They took the singed remains, which included the logo, from which they'd burned the first two letters, to turn it from 'Indiana Jones' to 'Diana Jones,' and they encased these remains in a Perspex pyramid.\\" (Laws 2007, p 139) The trophy itself is a perspex pyramid containing the burnt remains of the last unsold copy of the game; all that is legible of the title is \\"diana Jones\\". (There is no relation of the award with fantasy author Diana Wynne Jones.)

Life He was president of the parliament of his hometown Dijon from 1741, a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres from 1746, and a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon from 1761. He was a close friend of Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, the naturalist who wrote the Histoire Naturelle, and a personal enemy of Voltaire, the famous philosopher, who barred his entry in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1770. Because he opposed the absolute power of the king, he was exiled twice, in 1744 and 1771. He wrote numerous academic papers on topics concerning ancient history, philology and linguistics, some of which were used by Denis Diderot and D'Alembert in the Encyclop√©die (1751-1765). Frank A.

This provides a materialistic theory of the origin and the evolution of language, where the meaning of words is considered as an image of the physiological articulation of sounds (see Sound Symbolism). It had an influence on Condillac's Grammaire (1775) and a very important role in the birth of a scientific conception of language. *Histoire de la R√©publique romaine, dans le cours du VIIe si√®cle, par Salluste, en partie traduite du latin sur l'original, en partie r√©tablie et compos√©e sur les fragmens qui sont rest√©s de ses livres perdus (1777).

Biography Petty was born in the small town of Clovis, New Mexico, United States. He began playing piano at an early young age. While in high school, he regularly performed on a 15-minute show on a local radio station. After his graduation in 1945, he was drafted into the United States Air Force, returned, and married his high-school sweetheart Violet Ann Brady on June 20, 1948. The couple lived briefly in Dallas, Texas, where Petty worked as a part-time engineer at a recording studio. Eventually, they moved back to their hometown of Clovis. Petty and his wife, Vi, founded the Norman Petty Trio with guitarist Jack Vaughn. Due to the local success of their independent debut release of \\"Mood Indigo\\", they landed a recording contract with RCA Records and sold half a million copies of the recording, and were voted Most Promising Instrumental Group of 1954 by Cashbox magazine. In 1957, their song \\"Almost Paradise\\" hit number 18, and Petty won his first BMI writers' award. The song had various cover versions released, with Roger Williams' version selling the best. Despite the success of his own records, Petty began construction of his Clovis studio in late 1954. The new studio was state of the art, his estimated spending at about $100,000 (US$ in dollars). With the success of \\"Almost Paradise\\", it was completed to its current state in mid-1957. In his original 7th Street studio, aside from songs for his own musical group, he also produced early singles (several which were hits) for Texas musicians Roy Orbison, Buddy Knox, Waylon Jennings, Charlie \\"Sugartime\\" Phillips, Sonny West, Carolyn Hester, and Terry Noland. He also produced all of Buddy Holly's recordings that can be classified as rockabilly. Also, the hits \\"Sugar Shack\\" and \\"Bottle of Wine\\" by Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs and \\"Wheels\\" by the String-A-Longs were recorded at Petty's studio in the 1960s. Due to the success with instrumental groups, Petty was a reputable producer for bands of that genre to record with and his Clovis Studio was one of the top \\"go-to\\" studios for the guitar instrumental (surf) sound in the early 1960s. Petty produced a number of Canadian recording artists, including Wes Dakus and the Rebels, Barry Allen, Gainsborough Gallery, and the Happy Feeling, all whom had chart success in their homeland. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, recordings produced by Petty, in various musical styles, were issued by virtually every major record label in the United States and Canada, with numerous regional successes. Petty served as Buddy Holly's producer and also as his first manager until late 1958. Many of Holly's best and most polished efforts were produced at the Clovis studio. After Holly's death, Petty was put in charge of overdubbing unfinished Holly recordings by request of the Holley family (Buddy's parents) and demos, which had charting success overseas. However, Petty has been accused of pocketing Holly‚Äôs earnings. Petty had taken control of Holly and the band‚Äôs finances, and the singer never seemed to earn enough. He became suspicious of Petty ‚Äî who also regularly gave himself songwriting credits on Holly‚Äôs hits ‚Äî and planned to sack him. When Holly died, his Lubbock bank account had a balance of only $73.34 (US$ in dollars). Petty purchased the Mesa Theater on Main Street in Clovis in 1960. In 1963, he launched the FM radio station KTQM starting as an easy-listening station, later switching to country-and-western music, and then in 1968 to top-40 rock. The country genre had local appeal, so he applied for a new station license and started KWKA 680 AM in 1971, airing country-and-western music. Petty ran both stations until 1979. The stations were sold by Curry County Broadcasting to Zia Broadcasting in 2010. Petty died in Lubbock, Texas, in August 1984, of leukemia. Later in 1984, he was posthumously named Clovis Citizen of the Year. His wife, Vi, died in March 1992. She helped start the \\"Norman and Vi Petty Music Festival\\" in Clovis in 1987, which ran until 1997. It featured many artists who had recorded at the Clovis studio and also popular hit makers. Robert Linville requested the name from the Chamber of Commerce and started the festivals again from 1998 until his death in 2001. Norman and Vi were given awards for \\"Outstanding Graduate Accomplishment\\" (in the classes of 1945 and 1946, respectively) by the Clovis Municipal Schools Foundation and Alumni Association in April 2011. The awards are presented to Clovis High School graduates for achievement in their sphere of business; the recipients are chosen because their strength of character and citizenship, to serve as models for today's CHS students. The plaques were given to Vi's relative Nick Brady, who turned them over to Kenneth Broad of the Petty estate to display during studio tours. The original 7th Street Studio is available for tours by appointment only. The King of Clovis, a book about Petty by Frank Blanas, was published in 2014. Petty's Nor-Va-Jak record label was revived in 2016 as \\"Nor-Va-Jak Music\\", with authorization from Norman Petty Studios, for the purpose of reissuing Petty productions that were not previously available on CD.

History After the construction of Eton College in the 15th century, a small group of houses were built immediately west to the college grounds. Making up the homes of shoemakers, tailors, and other workers who worked in the college, the hamlet was physically separated from the rest of Eton by land owned by the college, and was known as the wick.\\"Eton Wick & Boveney\\", Welcome to Maidenhead The wick was on the very edge of the parish, on the opposite side of the border adjacent to the village; cottages were built to house farmhands working at nearby Bell Farm. Throughout the 19th century, scholars at Eton College took a personal interest in the village. Building a village hall and a small school in the village, the college was traditionally responsible for the social well-being of the settlement. The village grew rapidly between the 1880s and the 2000s. \\\\- \\\\- In 1880, the owner of Bell Farm, Charles Dorney, sold some of his land for residential building. The new village was called Boveney New Town. After the 1894 Civil Parish act, the Wick was transferred from Eton parish to Boveney parish and became known as Eton Wick. Eton Wick and Boveney New Town were almost immediately next to each other yet both retained their own councils until 1934. The population of the villages during this time was around 500. After the Second World War, both villages were expanded and built into each other as part of the wider national push for more housing, bringing the population up to around 3,000. In 1965, the land surrounding the village was registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act, meaning the land cannot be developed without permission from the Secretary of State for the Environment. Transport Eton Wick shares its major transport facilities with Slough, as the route to Windsor by road is circuitous. The M4 and A4 roads are nearby. At Slough, there is access to trains into London Paddington station and west to places such as Maidenhead, Reading and Bristol. Local rivers As it flows from Boveney to Windsor, the River Thames meets the Boveney Ditch stream just south east of Eton Wick. Boveney Ditch is formed by the merging of Roundmoor (drainage) Ditch and the habitually dried up Cress Brook just west of Eton Wick. After Romney Weir and lock, the Thames is fed by Colenorton Brook (called Common Ditch upstream of Eton College) and then the Willow Brook (called Chalvey Ditch upstream of the College) to the east of Eton Wick. More recently the Jubilee River, an artificial secondary channel to the Thames, was built between Maidenhead and Datchet for flood relief. It was completed in 2002 and runs to the north of Eton Wick, cutting through the Roundmoor, Chalvey and Common Ditches, which are all carried in siphons beneath it to continue on their original courses.http://streetmap.co.uk/grid/494535_178495_120 \\\\- http://streetmap.co.uk/grid/494535_178495_106 Politics The village is part of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead and administered by an elected Unitary Authority. The current MP (2020) for the Windsor constituency (of which Eton Wick is a part) is Adam Afriyie (Conservative). The village was administered by Buckinghamshire County Council until 1974, when administration was transferred to Berkshire County Council under the Local Government Act 1972.

The nodes in a value network represent people (or abstractly, roles). The nodes are connected by interactions that represent deliverables. These deliverables can be objects, knowledge or money. Value networks record interdependence. They account for the worth of products and services. Companies have both internal and external value networks.Value Network Basics, openvaluenetworks.com  Types  External networks include customers/recipients, intermediaries, stakeholders, complementary, open innovation networks and suppliers. Internal networks focus on key activities, processes and relationships that cut across internal boundaries, such as order fulfillment, innovation, lead processing and customer support. Value is created through exchange and the relationships between roles.  Definition  Christensen defines value network as: > \\"The collection of upstream suppliers, downstream channels to market, and > ancillary providers that support a common business model within an industry. > When would-be disruptors enter into existing value networks, they must adapt > their business models to conform to the value network and therefore fail at > disruption because they become co-opted.\\"Christensen, C.; The Innovator's > Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business, > Collins Business Essentials, page 296  Value configuration  Fjeldstad and Stabellabstract Stabell, Charles B., and Fjeldstad, √ò. \\"Configuring value for competitive advantage: On chains, shops, and networks\\" Strategic Management Journal 19, 1998 declare a value network as one of three ways by which an organisation generates value. The others are the value shop and value chain. Their value networks consist of these components: * customers * a service that enables interaction among them * an organization to provide the service. * contracts that enable access to the service One example of a value network is that formed by social media users. The company provides a service, users contract with the company and immediately have access to the value network of other customers. A less obvious example is a car insurance company: The company provides insurance. Customers can travel and interact in various ways while limiting risk exposure. The insurance policies represent the company's contracts and the internal processes. F/S and Christensen's concepts address how a company understands itself and its value creation process, but they are not identical. Christensen's value networks address the relation between a company and its suppliers and the requirements posed by the customers, and how these interact when defining what represents value in the product that is produced. Fjeldstad and Stabell's value networks emphasize that the created value is between interacting customers, as facilitated by value networks.  Value constellations  Normann and Ramirez arguedOnline HBS Version Normann, R. and Ram√≠rez, R. From Value Chain to Value Constellation: Designing Interactive Strategy, Harvard Business Review, 71, July/August 1993, pp. 65‚Äì77 in 1993 that strategy is not a fixed set of activities along a value chain. Instead the focus should be on the value creating system. All stakeholders are obligated to produce value. Successful companies conceive of strategy as systematic social innovation.  Verna Allee  Verna Allee defines value networksAllee, V. The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks, Butterworth-Heinemann 2003 as any web of relationships that generates both tangible and intangible value through complex dynamic exchanges between two or more individuals, groups or organizations. Any organization or group of organizations engaged in both tangible and intangible exchanges can be viewed as a value network, whether private industry, government or public sector. Allee developed Value network analysis, a whole systems mapping and analysis approach to understanding tangible and intangible value creation among participants in an enterprise system. Revealing the hidden network patterns behind business processes can provide predictive intelligence for when workflow performance is at risk. She believes value network analysis provides a standard way to define, map and analyse the participants, transactions and tangible and intangible deliverables that together form a value network. Allee says, value network analysis can lead to profound shifts in perception of problem situations and mobilise collective action to implement changeValue Networks LLP, Value Network Adoption at Boeing and in Large Organizations (III/III), Publisher: Colabria, November 2007.  Important terms and concepts  Tangible value = All exchanges of goods, services or revenue, including all transactions involving contracts, invoices, return receipt of orders, request for proposals, confirmations and payment are considered to be tangible value. Products or services that generate revenue or are expected as part of a service are also included in the tangible value flow of goods, services, and revenue (2). In government agencies these would be mandated activities. In civil society organizations these would be formal commitments to provide resources or services. = Intangible value = Two primary subcategories are included in intangible value: knowledge and benefits. Intangible knowledge exchanges include strategic information, planning knowledge, process knowledge, technical know-how, collaborative design and policy development; which support the product and service tangible value network. Intangible benefits are also considered favors that can be offered from one person to another. Examples include offering political or emotional support to someone. Another example of intangible value is when a research organization asks someone to volunteer their time and expertise to a project in exchange for the intangible benefit of prestige by affiliation (3). All biological organisms, including humans, function in a self-organizing mode internally and externally. That is, the elements in our bodies‚Äîdown to individual cells and DNA molecules‚Äîwork together in order to sustain us. However, there is no central \\"boss\\" to control this dynamic activity. Our relationships with other individuals also progress through the same circular free flowing process as we search for outcomes that are best for our well- being. Under the right conditions these social exchanges can be extraordinarily altruistic. Conversely, they can also be quite self-centered and even violent. It all depends on the context of the immediate environment and the people involved.Ehin, Charles. Hidden Assets: Harnessing the Power of Informal Networks. New York: Springer, 2005. = A non-linear approach = :Often value networks are considered to consist of groups of companies working together to produce and transport a product to the customer. Relationships among customers of a single company are examples of how value networks can be found in any organization. Companies can link their customers together by direct methods like the telephone or indirect methods like combining customer's resources together. The purpose of value networks is to create the most benefit for the people involved in the network (5). The intangible value of knowledge within these networks is just as important as a monetary value. In order to succeed knowledge must be shared to create the best situations or opportunities. Value networks are how ideas flow into the market and to the people that need to hear them. Because value networks are instrumental in advancing business and institutional practices a value network analysis can be useful in a wide variety of business situations. Some typical ones are listed below.  Relationship management  Relationship management typically just focuses on managing information about customers, suppliers, and business partners. A value network approach considers relationships as two-way value- creating interactions, which focus on realizing value as well as providing value.  Business web and ecosystem development  Resource deployment, delivery, market innovation, knowledge sharing, and time-to-market advantage are dependent on the quality, coherence, and vitality of the relevant value networks, business webs and business ecosystems.Tapscott, D., Ticol, D., Lowy, A. Digital Capital, Harnessing the Power of Business Webs. Harvard Business School Press. May 2000  Fast-track complex process redesign  Product and service offerings are constantly changing ‚Äì and so are the processes to innovate, design, manufacture, and deliver them.

A value network analysis helps communities of practice negotiate for resources and demonstrate their value to different groups within the organization.  Develop scorecards, conduct ROI and cost/benefit analyses, and drive decision making  Because the value network approach addresses both financial and non-financial assets and exchanges, it expands metrics and indexes beyond the lagging indicators of financial return and operational performance ‚Äì to also include leading indicators for strategic capability and system optimization.

History  Bad T√∂lz Archaeology has shown continuous occupation of the site of Bad T√∂lz since the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the Ice Age. For example, there are finds from the Hallstatt culture as well as from Roman Raetia, or at least occupation by romanized Celts. The name \\"T√∂lz\\" (as \\"Tolnze\\") appears relatively late in documentation at the end of the 12th century. The name \\"Reginried\\" appears as that of a settlement belonging to the monastery at Tegernsee in earlier texts, which is probably the same as Reid in the western part of M√ºhlfeld. Hainricus de Tolnze built a castle on the site, which controlled the river and road traffic in the region but which no longer exists. In 1331, Louis IV made T√∂lz a market town. The 14th century saw T√∂lz become a crossroads for the salt and lumber traffic on the Isar. In 1453, the market street, church, and castle were destroyed by fire. Duke Albrecht III enabled the city to rebuild, but this time in stone. He also built a palace which stood until 1770, when it fell into disrepair and was eventually undermined by the Ellbach. The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) brought plague and destruction to the region. During the War of the Spanish Succession things began to turn around again, with trade in lime and wood products, among other items. During this war, in 1705, the vintner Johann J√§ger of T√∂lz led a band of farmers to battle at Sendling (south of Munich). The town also became known as a pilgrimage site; every November 6, there is a festival to Saint Leonard of Noblac. In 1718, a chapel was built in his honor on the Calvary hill. In the middle of the 19th century, T√∂lz changed direction with the discovery of natural springs. The town began to focus on the healing properties of these springs and became a cure and spa town. In 1899, it became known as Bad T√∂lz. In 1937, SS-Junkerschule Bad T√∂lz was established near the town. The SS-Junkerschulen SS-Junker School (SS Officer Candidate School) operated until the end of World War II in 1945. A subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was located in the town. It provided labour for the school and the Zentralbauleitung (Central Administration Building). Bad T√∂lz would also be the last town to be \\"passed through\\" by the Holocaust death marchArchived Todesm√§rsche Dachau memorial website's map page of KZ-Dachau death march from Dachau to the Austrian border, that would be halted by Nisei U.S. Army artillery soldiers on 2 May 1945, just two kilometers short of the next village to the east of it, Waakirchen. The former SS-Junkerschule was the base of the U.S. Army's 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group until 1991.Edward Victor. \\"Bad Toelz\\".

It was in Bad T√∂lz that Amon Goeth, commandant of the Nazi concentration camp in P≈Çasz√≥w, in German-occupied Poland during World War II, was arrested and sent for trial in Poland. Today, Bad T√∂lz is known for its spas, historic medieval town, and its views of the Alps. On the western bank of the Isar River lies the Kurverwaltung, or modern spa, whose iodine-rich waters are known for their soothing and healing powers. A major attraction was the Alpamare, Europe's first indoor water park with long water slides, wave pool, a surf wave, and a range of thermal outdoor pools with iodine water, until it closed in 2015. Another major attraction is Stadtpfarrkirche, a church built in 1466, which is an example of German late‚ÄìGothic architecture.

It occupies 30.8 square kilometres. = Climate = In Bad T√∂lz, the average annual high temperature is , and the annual low temperature is . Winters are cool to cold, and summers are moderately warm, thanks to its location that close to the Alps. It classifies as humid continental (Dfb).

Therefore, in early 1933, an unofficial message was forwarded from top levels to Brasov, essentially indicating that a small number of fighter-trainers would be purchased by the air force. The I.A.R. team immediately began to work on a new type, designated I.A.R. 14, still based on the experience gained with previous designs The airplane was designed by IAR design bureau in 1933 and was an evolution from the IAR 12 prototype. It was a cantilever low-winged monoplane with a spatted main undercarriage with V-form legs and a single, open cockpit over the wing. The rectangular section fuselage was of mixed metal-wood configuration, with the front half covered by duralumin sheets and the rear part with pine plywood. The tail had been modified once more and the control surfaces were balanced. The pilot's head rest was not fitted with the anti-crash pylon, typical to the precedent prototypes. The engine was mounted on welded steel bearers attached to a duralumin fireproof bulkhead. The wings were built around twin duralumin spars and pine and plywood ribs and had plywood leading edges. The centre section, let into the fuselage underside was duralumin covered, outer sections and ailerons fabric-covered. The fixed tail was built of pine and plywood-covered, the moving surfaces duralumin with fabric cover. The aircraft was equipped with the IAR LD 450 powerplant, produced under license by IAR, that also equipped the IAR 12. The first flight took place in June 1933.

The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2012. Background Following the death of Viscount Dundee in the Jacobite victory at the Battle of Killiecrankie, command of the Jacobites was passed to Colonel Alexander Cannon, leader of the recruits from Ireland, in preference to the 60-year-old veteran Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, one of the most formidable Highland chiefs. Cameron was so insulted at this perceived slight that he left, taking some of his clan with him. With the Scottish Privy Council preparing to leave Scotland in the wake of an expected Jacobite onslaught, the Council ordered the newly formed Cameronian regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Cleland to move north from Perth and to hold Dunkeld at all costs.Inglis, John Alexander. (1911). The Monros of Auchinbowie and Cognate Families. pp. 40‚Äì44. Edinburgh, Privately printed by T and A Constable. Printers to His Majesty. The Cameronian regiment takes its name from Richard Cameron (1648‚Äì1680), a Scottish religious reformer and covenanting leader from the Scottish Lowlands, and was raised largely from the tenantry of the Marquess of Douglas, chief of Clan Douglas. The Cameronian regiment subsequently became the 26th (The Cameronian) Regiment of Foot, and then the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). Battle Dunkeld was not protected by town walls, so Cleland ordered his troops to take up defensive positions in the cathedral, because it was surrounded by an enclosing wall, and the nearby mansion of the Marquess of Atholl. The fighting began when the Jacobites, who outnumbered the Cameronians by more than four to one, stormed the town from all sides. They were initially successful, forcing the Cameronians back from all their outlying positions.Hopkins, P. (1986). Glencoe and the End of the Highland War although in the town's narrow, winding streets there was no room for the type of Highland charge that succeeded at Killiecrankie. The Cameronian regiment's 27-year-old Colonel William Cleland, a veteran of the Covenanter cause, died in the first hour of battle by taking one bullet in the liver and another in the head, before dragging himself out of sight so that his men would not see him fall. As the regiment's major was also wounded, command fell to Captain George Munro of Auchinbowie who would lead them to victory. For sixteen hours the battle raged, as the Cameronians were gradually forced back. Some of the Highlander dunkeldcathedral.org.uk who had barricaded themselves into houses were trapped inside and burned alive. At 11pm, depleted of energy and ammunition, the Highlanders decided to call it a day and withdrew, leaving 300 of their men dead or dying in the town. The Cameronians are reported to have stripped lead from the roof of Atholl House to keep firing because they had also exhausted their munitions. Holes caused by musket balls are still visible in the east gable of Dunkeld Cathedral. With the battle over, the Cameronian Covenanters claimed a war-winning victory. Losses on the Williamite side are unclear, but ranged from 20 to 50. Colonel Cleland was buried in the cathedral.

History In 1993, Garza was convicted of murdering three people while running a marijuana smuggling and distribution ring based in Brownsville, Texas. He was sentenced to death and appealed on the basis that the jury were allegedly not told that they had the power to recommend life imprisonment instead of the death sentence. Garza's lawyers also claimed that it was unfair that the jury were told that Garza was suspected of four murders in Mexico given that, although a prime suspect in these crimes, he had never been charged with, or convicted of them. On July 13, 1999, federal authorities moved Garza, who had committed the crime in Texas but was under a federal death sentence, out of the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and into Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody.\\"Offenders No Longer on Death Row .\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

On December 4, 2000, the Commission adopted the merits report 109/00, which was transmitted to the State Department on December 5, 2000. The merits report stated that: \\"the Commission considers that the State‚Äôs conduct in introducing evidence of unadjudicated foreign crimes during Mr. Garza‚Äôs capital sentencing hearing was antithetical to the most basic and fundamental judicial guarantees applicable in attributing responsibility and punishment to individuals for crimes. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the State is responsible for imposing the death penalty upon Mr. Garza in a manner contrary to his right to a fair trial under Article XVIII of the American Declaration, as well as his right to due process of law under Article XXVI of the Declaration. (...) The Commission also concludes that, by sentencing Mr. Garza to death in this manner, and by scheduling his execution for December 12, 2000 and thereby exhibiting its clear intention to implement Mr. Garza's sentence, the State had placed Mr. Garza's life in jeopardy in an arbitrary and capricious manner, contrary to Article I of the Declaration. In addition, to execute Mr. Garza pursuant to this sentence would constitute a further deliberate and egregious violation of Article I of the American Declaration.\\". Based on these conclusions, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) recommended to: \\"Provide Mr. Garza with an effective remedy, which includes commutation of sentence\\" and \\"Review its laws, procedures and practices to ensure that persons who are accused of capital crimes are tried and, if convicted, sentenced in accordance with the rights established in the American Declaration, including Articles I, XVIII and XXVI of the Declaration, and in particular by prohibiting the introduction of evidence of unadjudicated crimes during the sentencing phase of capital trials\\". By communication dated March 6, 2001 and received by the Commission on the same date, the United States answered that: \\"Finally, with respect to the Commission's conclusions in Part IV(C)(4) that Mr. Garza's rights to due process and a fair trial under Articles XVIII and XXVI of the American Declaration were violated, we note that these conclusions are in conflict with jurisprudence based on the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This jurisprudence requires the provision of all relevant information to a capital jury before it makes a sentencing determination. Indeed, the rationale on which the Commission recommends invalidating Garza's death sentence was presented to the appropriate federal courts in collateral review and rejected by them as not affording a basis for relief\\". The IACHR analyzed this answer in its Report 52/01, published April 4, 2001, where it said: \\"The Commission, based upon the foregoing considerations of fact and law, and in light of the response of the State to Report 109/00, hereby ratifies its conclusion that the State is responsible for violations of Articles I, XVIII and XXVI of the American Declaration in condemning Juan Raul Garza to the death penalty. The Commission also hereby ratifies its conclusion that the United States will perpetrate a grave and irreparable violation of the fundamental right to life under Article I of the American Declaration, should it proceed with Mr. Garza's execution based upon the criminal proceedings under consideration\\". On these basis, the IACHR reiterated the recommendations to the US Government. =Cultural references= An episode of American TV series The West Wing's first season, \\"Take This Sabbath Day\\", deals with the imminent execution of drug lord and murderer Simon Cruz, likewise sentenced under the \\"Drug Kingpin\\" Act and to be executed by injection at Terre Haute (for killing two individuals in Michigan), who is described as the first individual to be executed by federal authorities since 1963 (probably alluding to the case of Victor Feguer, who would have been the last before Garza, had not Timothy McVeigh been executed eight days earlier).

The world's largest land-based rocket range, it is on a site about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Fairbanks and 1.5 degrees south of the Arctic Circle. More than 1,700 launches have been conducted at the range to study the Earth's atmosphere and the interaction between the atmosphere and the space environment. Areas studied at PFRR include the aurora, plasma physics, the ozone layer, solar proton events, Earth's magnetic field, and ultraviolet radiation.

PFRR is owned by the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Geophysical Institute, which operates it under contract to the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. Other users include the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the Air Force Geophysics Lab (AFGL), and various universities and research laboratories. Since its founding in 1948, PFRR has been closely aligned with and funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and its predecessor, the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). History The University of Alaska had performed auroral research since the 1920s, and when sounding rockets were developed for this purpose, the university decided to build a range for them. The UAF Geophysical Institute leased the land that became the PFRR from the state of Alaska, and the range's facilities were initially completed in 1948 with leadership and vision from T. Neil Davis. PFRR's first supervisor, Neal Brown, directed the facility from 1948 to 1965. In the 1990s, new facilities were built with a $30 million grant provided by Congress. Refurbishment of older facilities is an ongoing project. Facilities Poker Flat Research Range has five launch pads, including two optimized for severe weather, that can handle rockets weighing up to . Range facilities include an administrative facility, a concrete blockhouse used as a mission control center, several rocket assembly buildings, a 2-story science observatory, and a payload assembly building. Three S-band antennas are used to collect telemetry, and a C-band radar is used for tracking rocket payloads in flight.

He served in senior positions in the Army of the Potomac, including division command, chief of staff, and corps command, and was Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army. Early life Andrew Atkinson Humphreys was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a family with Quaker ancestry. His grandfather, Joshua, was the \\"Father of the American Navy\\", who had served as chief naval constructor from 1794-1801 and designed the first U.S. warship, including the USS Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\") and her sister ships. Andrew's father, Samuel designed and built the USS Pennsylvania, the largest and most heavily armed ship at the time. Samuel, like his father, was a chief naval constructor from 1826-1846.Pearcy, 197. Andrew graduated from Nazareth Hall (predecessor to the present day Moravian College & Theological Seminary).Thereafter, he entered the United States Military Academy, more commonly known as West Point, at the age of seventeen. He graduated from the Academy on July 1, 1831. Upon graduation Humphreys joined the second artillery regiment at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina. Near the beginning of the Seminole Wars he followed his regiment in the summer of 1836 to Florida where he received his first combat experience, while also falling ill, having to leave by September. de Peyster, who rose to brevet major general for the New York Volunteer Army during the Civil War and later Civil War historian says: After being reinstated in the engineer corps in 1844 Humphreys was put in charge of the Central Office of the Coast Survey at Washington and appointed to Captain in 1848. During 1850 he was directed to commence surveys and investigate the Mississippi River Delta. Investigating the Mississippi River in order to figure out what could prevent inundation and increase the depth of water on the bars. This work would take up ten years of Humphreys' life, during which he visited Europe.Harper's Weekly, 26. From 1853-1857 he also worked on the Pacific Railroad Surveys with Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. Humphreys, along with 100 plus men (soldiers, scientist and technicians) went west to find the most practical route for the First Transcontinental Railroad. Just before the Civil War, Humphreys was ranked among the upper echelon of American Scientist and gained membership to the American Philosophical Society.Pearcy, 198.

Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac.Harper's Weekly, 36-37. Humphreys was put in this position because of his achievements in life but also because \\"those in power at Washington distrusted him because of his intimacy with Jefferson Davis before the war.\\"Stockpole, 217. Initially involved in planning the defenses of Washington, D.C., by March 1862, he shipped out with McClellan for the Peninsula Campaign. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on April 28de Peyster, 12. and on September 12 assumed command of the new 3rd Division in the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He led the division in a reserve role in the Battle of Antietam. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, his division achieved the farthest advance against fierce Confederate fire from Marye's Heights, with Humphreys personally commanding from the very front of the line on horseback, while five of his seven staff were shot down. During the battle Humphreys himself had two of horses shot from under him and finding a third he continued to ride with having his clothes pierced but himself unharmed.de Peyster, 12-13.

Daniel Butterfield, wrote: \\"I hardly know how to express my appreciation of the soldierly qualities, the gallantry, and energy displayed by my division commanders, Generals George Sykes, Humphreys, and Charles Griffin.\\"Official Records, Series I, Vol. XXI, p. 402. General Butterfield goes on to talk personally about Humphreys' actions: \\"General Humphreys personally led his division in the most gallant manner. His attack was spirited, and worthy of veterans. Made as it was by raw troops, the value of the example set by the division commander can hardly be estimated.\\" For an officer with little combat experience, he inspired his troops with his personal bravery. Historian Larry Tagg wrote: Although respected by his men for his bravery under fire, Humphreys was not well liked by them. In his mid-fifties, they considered him an old man, despite his relatively youthful appearance. His nickname was \\"Old Goggle Eyes\\" for his eyeglasses. He was a taskmaster and strict disciplinarian. Charles A. Dana, the Assistant Secretary of War, called him a man of \\"distinguished and brilliant profanity.\\" Generals Andrew A.

On May 23, 1863, Humphreys was transferred to the command of the 2nd Division in the III Corps, under Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles.ed. Bill Hyde, 183. When Meade assumed command of the Army of the Potomac just before the Battle of Gettysburg, he asked Humphreys to be his chief of staff, replacing Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, who was considered to be too close politically to the previous commander, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Humphreys declined the opportunity to give up his division command. His new division immediately saw action at Gettysburg where, on July 2, 1863, Sickles insubordinately moved his corps from its assigned defensive position on Cemetery Ridge. Humphreys' new position was on the Emmitsburg Road, part of a salient directly in the path of the Confederate assault, and it was too long a front for a single division to defend. Assaulted by the division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, Humphreys' three brigades were demolished; Sickles had pulled back Humphrey's reserve brigade to shore up the neighboring division (Maj. Gen. David B. Birney), which was the first to be attacked. Humphreys put up the best fight that could have been expected and was eventually able to reform his survivors on Cemetery Ridge, but his division and the entire corps were finished as a fighting force. Humphreys was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 8, 1863,Official Records, Series I, Vol. XXI, p. 3. and finally acceded to Meade's request to serve as his chief of staff;Official Records, Series I, Vol. XXI, p. 2. he did not have much of a division left to command. He served in that position through the Bristoe and Mine Run campaigns that fall, and the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg in 1864. In November 1864, he assumed command of the II Corps, which he led for the rest of the siege and during the pursuit of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Appomattox Court House and surrender. On March 13, 1865, he was breveted brigadier general in the regular army and then on May 26, 1865, he was awarded brevet major general in the regular army for \\"gallant and meritorious service at the battle of Gettysburg\\"\\"The Army.\\", 470 for the Battle of Sayler's Creek during Lee's retreat.

He became a permanent brigadier general and Chief of Engineers in 1866. \\"He oversaw a corps whose personnel--consisting of only about 100 officers and an equal number of civilian assistants--were greatly taxed by the numerous responsibilities heaped upon them. River and harbor work increased from 49 projects and 26 surveys in 1866 to 371 projects and 135 surveys in 1882\\".Reuss, Humphreys, Andrew Atkinson He held this position until June 30, 1879, when he retired, serving during this period on lighthouse and other engineering boards. Humphreys was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. by Harvard University in 1868. In retirement, he studied philosophy and was one of the incorporators of the National Academy of Sciences. Humphreys's published works were highlighted by the 1861 Report on the Physics and Hydraulics of the Mississippi River,Eicher, p. 309. co-authored with Lt. Henry Abbott, which gave him considerable prominence in the scientific community. He also wrote personal accounts of the war, published in 1883: From Gettysburg to the Rapidan and The Virginia Campaign of '64 and '65. He died in Washington, D.C. and is buried there in the Congressional Cemetery. A military base in Virginia was founded during World War I as Camp A. A. Humphreys, named for Andrew A. Humphreys. The post was renamed Fort Belvoir in the 1930s in recognition of the Belvoir plantation that once occupied the site, but the adjacent United States Army Corps of Engineers Humphreys Engineer Center retains part of the original namesake. In 1935, after the base in Virginia was renamed, the Washington Arsenal in Washington, DC was named in his honor. But in 1948, the Washington, D.C. base was renamed Fort McNair in honor of Lesley J. McNair who'd died in World War II. Humphreys Peak, 12,633', Arizona's highest peak, is named in honor of General A.A. Humphreys.

OW2 federates IT vendors and users, universities, and research centers from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, representing thousands of IT professionals.  History  150px OW2 was founded in 2007 as an independent organization to foster the ObjectWeb code base of open source middleware. ObjectWeb was a joint project launched in 2002 by INRIA, Bull, and France Telecom; in 2005 INRIA signed an agreement with OrientWare, a joint project between Peking University, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (now Beihang University), National University of Defense Technology, CVIC Software Engineering Co., Ltd, and the Institute of Software at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All became founding members of OW2 along with Engineering, Red Hat, and Thales.  Services  250px OW2 offers three kinds of services: 1) Technical infrastructure: OW2 provides developers with technical infrastructure, offering project hosting and providing a number of services to facilitate the collaborative work (versioning, bug tracking, licenses, etc.). 2) Community Services: OW2 runs an open source governance system helping members connect with each other and with the international open source ecosystem at large. OW2 Governance provides the collaboration framework for its activities, namely, its Projects, Initiatives, and Local Chapters. As part of its governance efforts, OW2 develops its own project quality and assessment system made available as the Open Source Capability Assessment Radar (OSCAR) and the Market Readiness Index (MRI). 3) Marketing Services: OW2 engages in marketing activities to promote its brand, its code base and its members. OW2 regularly takes part in industry conferences and trade shows around the world including Cloud Expo Europe, Cloud Computing World Expo, FISL, FOSDEM, OpenStack Summit, OSCON, Paris Open Source Summit, etc. It also hosts its own yearly conference, known as OW2con. In addition, OW2 provides information dissemination and community building services for R&D; collaborative projects funded by European or French research programs. ActivitiesProjects= OW2 hosts circa 100 open source projects spanning enterprise solutions and components, application frameworks, engineering tools, and libraries. Projects make up the OW2 code base and are foundation of all OW2 activities. Projects can be submitted into the OW2 code base after meeting some minimum requirements and applying. At this point, a Project is considered to be in \\"Incubation,\\" the first of OW2's defined lifecycle stages. Upon gaining code contributors, growing, and meeting rigorous requirements, a Project can apply for \\"Mature\\" status. The application is then reviewed by the OW2 Technology Council and granted Mature status or kept in Incubation. If a Project stops evolving and updating, it can then be moved to the third lifecycle stage, \\"Archive,\\" where it is no longer active but still benefits from OW2's infrastructure services. =Initiatives= Initiatives are joint efforts by multiple members targeted at meeting a common market need. Initiatives arise from examining market trends and identifying areas of need. Initiatives are constituted by several projects and facilitate their implementations into business solutions by systems integrators, OEMs, and end-users.List of current Initiatives =Local Chapters= A Local Chapter is a group of OW2 members who combine their efforts to promote the goals of the consortium within a community characterized by its geography or language. Current OW2 Local Chapters can be found throughout Europe, China, Brazil, and North America.  OW2con  OW2con is OW2's global annual conference for the OW2 community and IT professionals, organized since 2009. Topics of the two-day conference are open source software for enterprise information systems, cloud computing, big data, privacy and security, and accessibility. Traditionally held in Paris, each annual conference is focussed on a new central theme.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. Green, William: Observers Aircraft, pages 40-41. Frederick Warne Publishing, 1981. Design and development The Skipper was conceived with the design goals of creating a low cost primary trainer with an emphasis on ease of maintenance and low operating costs. Design work on the Skipper began in 1974 as the PD 285,Phillips, Edward H., Beechcraft - Staggerwing to Starship. Flying Books, 1987. . which made its maiden flight on February 6, 1975.Air Enthusiast December 1975, p. 312. The Skipper was Beechcraft's attempt to enter the two-place trainer market with an aircraft capable of competing with the popular Cessna 150 line of trainer aircraft. Though the aircraft first flew with a standard tail configuration, by the time it entered production, a T-tail configuration had been adopted, giving it an appearance very similar to its close competitor, the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk introduced in 1978. Like the Cessna and Piper trainers which were its primary competition, the Skipper utilizes the Lycoming O-235 engine and features side-by-side configuration seating. Production was handled at the Liberal (Kansas) Division, where the Beechcraft Duchess and Musketeer were produced. The Skipper wing utilizes a GA(W)-1 airfoil, specifically developed for low-speed aviation applications, based on 1970s NASA research. The aircraft was certified for intentional spins. While it is an all-metal design, the Skipper incorporated a number of innovative construction techniques, including tubular spars and aluminum honeycomb construction with metal-to-metal bonding, a technique inherited from the Musketeer family. The flaps and ailerons are actuated by torque tubes, rather than cables. The landing gear is mounted to the fuselage/wing junction, but has a wide wheelbase, giving it a \\"spraddle- legged\\" appearance on the ground. Operational history Beechcraft Skipper The Skipper had the misfortune of being introduced at the beginning of a severe downturn in general aviation aircraft production in the United States. During its first year 1979, 47 were built, 140 in 1980, and 125 in 1981. Production stopped in 1983. A total of 312 aircraft were built. Most of the production run was initially delivered to Beechcraft's flight school network, the Beech Aero Centers, where they were used as primary trainers. A handful of Skippers are still in use as trainers. Others are in the hands of private owners who use them as touring aircraft.

It followed the tale of two teenagers who came from feuding families on opposite sides of the moral and legal spectrum. Adam (D.J. Cotrona) is the son of the Los Angeles District Attorney, and Jewel (Olivia Wilde) is the daughter of a pornographer. The show is a modern-day take on the Romeo and Juliet story. Even after an incredible amount of advertising, the show was cancelled after only three episodes due to poor ratings and less than favorable reviews. It was reprieved in 2005, when SOAPnet acquired broadcasting rights to all eight episodes and aired the last five episodes for the first time. Production Jim Leonard had the idea for the show, and put it forward to Jerry Bruckheimer. It was to be a Romeo and Juliet romance between the daughter of a porn king and the son of a crusading district attorney. Fox was interested as \\"it was a really character-based drama, and a new world\\" where pornography would be the background, not the focus. Leonard said \\"Our goal was to take the soap out of soap opera and to tell a kind of operatic big story where worlds come together,\\" and that he had long wanted to do a show that was about \\"sex, race and love.\\" Skin was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Television and Hoosier Karma Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television The executive producers were creator Jim Leonard, Jonathan Littman, Jerry Bruckheimer. During production Bruckheimer had expressed intent to have the DVD release more contain explicit edits of the episodes than what was broadcast. This is the first series produced by Bruckheimer to be canceled. Cast and characters Larry Goldman is Jewish, a pornography magnate and loving father, who controls the Los Angeles pornography industry. Barbara is his bubbly platinum-blonde wife and Jewel is their 16-year-old daughter. Thomas Roam is a Catholic Los Angeles district attorney running for re-election, at a time when missing children, linked to child pornography, dominate the news. Laura Roam, his wife, is a judge, and Adam is their half-Mexican/half-Irish 16-year-old son. =Casting= Ron Silver was cast as main character Larry Goldman. Goldman was to be a likable personality whose professional conduct is questionable. \\"What I wanted to set up was a situation where nobody's good and nobody's bad, and you ultimately don't know who to root for,\\" said Leonard. Silver said \\"I was fascinated by the potential complexity of the character\\". In researching his role Silver met with Larry Flynt and Jenna Jameson as well as reading magazines and watching videos. Olivia Wilde played his daughter Jewel and Pamela Gidley played his wife Barbara. Kevin Anderson played the Los Angeles district attorney, Thomas Roam, who was out to get Goldman. Anderson elaborated on his character stating, \\"He's not an out-and-out good guy, there's a dark side. He's different than the run-of-the-mill do-gooder crusader lawyer.\\" His son, Adam, and wife, Laura, were played by D.J. Cotrona and Rachel Ticotin respectively. Other recurring characters included D. W. Moffett as Skip Ziti, Laura Leighton as Cynthia Peterson, and Ginger Lynn Allen as Amber Synn. Marketing In the lead-up to its premiere, promos for Skin were frequently shown during Fox's coverage of the Major League Baseball postseason. A repeatedly-aired ad featuring Larry Goldman's line \\"His father is the district attorney!\\" was noted as being annoying by critics; after its cancellation, ESPN writer Bill Simmons joked that Skin \\"[broke] Falcones record for 'most promos shown during a prolonged sporting event versus number of actual episodes that made the air'.\\" Chicago Tribune media writer Phil Rosenthal similarly addressed the program when discussing TBS's similar tendencies to air excessive promotions for series (such as Frank TV) during its own postseason coverage, noting that Goldman's \\"loud, urgent line-reading\\" had \\"[become] a punch line through repetition\\". Reception On May 30, 2003 Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly picked Skin as one of the most promising new series for the 2003‚Äì2004 U.S. television season. Fretts said that redoing Romeo and Juliet in a modern setting was nothing new, but having Romeo's father be a district attorney going after Juliet's porn-king father was original enough that \\"methinks Shakespeare would approve.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today said, \\"Skin traps a 21st-century Romeo and Juliet between two dirty worlds: politics and porn. Throw in race, religion, and economic disparity, and you have enough problems to keep a soap busy for decades. ...Yet there's nothing salacious or pornographic about the show itself, which by current standards is relatively chaste.\\" Bianco described the plot as \\"amusingly complicated\\" and Cotrona and Wilde as an \\"almost impossibly attractive couple\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said, \\"Fox has pulled off a slick, clever melodrama that holds one's attention even when pole-dancing, thong-snapping adult entertainers are off the screen\\" because \\"the adults do not fit neatly into hero and villain categories.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe begins his review by saying, \\"If you were to write a book about MTV's influence on series television, you'd have to devote a long chapter to Skin.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle points out that by the time Skin premiered it was already about a month into the new television season and there were many good shows already struggling to find an audience and it was too late for another show that wasn't truly great to premiere. In exploring the plot development Goodman says, \\"You begin to think this might be the shortest story arc ever -- a three-episode season.\\" In addressing the conceptual similarities to Romeo and Juliet Goodman wrote, \\"This kind of forced drama may have worked in Shakespeare's time, but the modern audience doesn't want a tease it can predict.\\" In addressing the show's cancellation Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described Skin as one of Fox's good shows and said he expected Arrested Development to be cancelled. Tucker goes on to say of the critical praise the show had received, \\"critics didn't want to look prudish, so their effusive ejaculations... were premature\\". Originally aired on Fox, the first episode attracted 6.3 million viewers. It was down to fewer than 5.1 million viewers in its second airing and fewer than 4.1 million by its third airing.\\"FOX Strips 'Skin' from Schedule \\" (November 4, 2003) Zap2It.com. Retrieved on July 18, 2008. Episodes The first three episodes were shown on Fox in 2003 and SOAPnet aired the eight episodes in 2005. There were reports at the time the show was canceled that nine episodes had been produced. CNN reported on November 5, 2003 that production on the series had shut down the day before, after completion of the eighth episode. ReferencesExternal links  .

The name arose from Ichbiah's promise to give a bottle of Beaujolais nouveau red wine to anyone who could find such a situation in the draft language standard. At least one bottle was actually awarded for such a discovery.  Definition  The Beaujolais effect is a situation where adding or removing a single use clause in an Ada program changes the behavior of the compiled program, a very undesirable effect in a language designed for semantic precision. Ichbiah took steps to prevent the effect when he updated his draft standard to produce the final Ada 83 language standard. The remaining possible situations for producing the effect were later identified by mathematical analysis and addressed by the Ada 95 language standard, making any situation that still resulted in a Beaujolais effect in Ada 83 an illegal construct in the more recent Ada 95 language standard. In principle, the Beaujolais Effect can occur in other languages that use namespaces or packages, if the language specification does not ensure to make it illegal.  Background  The Ada programming language allows source code to be broken up into library packages containing definitions of data and algorithms that can be used by programs or other library packages. The definitions in a package are made visible by a with clause. For example, if the line - with Ada.Text_IO; appears at the top of the source code for a program or package then the data, procedures, and functions declared in the library package Ada.Text_IO can be invoked within that source code. This is the implementation of the namespace concept for Ada. Thus a program that has the \`with Ada.Text_IO;\` directive can \\"see\\" the definitions there, and in order to invoke the \`New_Line\` procedure in Ada.Text_IO it can be referred to by name, Ada.Text_IO.New_Line; and similarly with procedures or functions that require arguments, or with reads/writes to any variables declared in the Ada.Text_IO package. However, such fully specified names can become quite verbose, so the language standard also supports a use clause that tells the compiler to search the contents of the package when trying to identify names that occur in the source code. Thus if both the lines - with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO; appear at the top of a program, the \`New_Line\` procedure in the package Ada.Text_IO is not only visible to the program, but can be invoked by the abbreviated form - New_Line; because the use clause tells the compiler what package contains the definition. However, ambiguity arises if more than one package defines a \`New_Line\` procedure with the same or similar parameter profiles. If the program does not resolve the ambiguity, the compiler should reject the program with an error message. Here is an example: package A is procedure New_Line (Number_Of_Lines : in Positive := 1); end A; with A; use A; with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO; procedure Ambiguous is begin New_Line; -- error end Ambiguous; In the example above, the call is ambiguous because it could correspond to either \`Ada.Text_IO.New_Line\` or \`A.New_Line\` with the default parameter value. There are two ways to resolve the ambiguity. One is to specify the package name, and the other is to specify the parameter name explicitly, if the subprogram to call has parameters. The three examples below all resolve the ambiguity.

Highly diversified, they were particularly well known for their industrial electrical equipment such as generators, steam turbines, switchgear, transformers, electronics and railway traction equipment. Metrovick holds a place in history as the builders of the first commercial transistor computer, the Metrovick 950, and the first British axial-flow jet engine, the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2. Their factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was for most of the 20th century one of the biggest and most important heavy engineering facilities in Britain and the world. History Metropolitan-Vickers 375 KW steam turbo-alternator MV Logo from brass Waveguide Advertisement for marine turbines in Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual 1923. Metrovick electric multiple unit made for Central Argentine Railway in 1931. They worked until 2002. Metrovick started as a way to separate the existing British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company factories from United States control, which had proven to be a hindrance to gaining government contracts during the First World War. In 1917 a holding company was formed to try to find financing to buy the company's properties.Scott (1963). P.140-142. In May 1917, control of the holding company was obtained jointly by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company, of Birmingham, chaired by Dudley Docker, and Vickers Limited, of Barrow-in-Furness.Gillham (1988), Chapter 2: The Manufacturers. On 15 March 1919, Docker agreed terms with Vickers, for Vickers to purchase all the shares of the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company for almost ¬£13 million.Scott (1963). Appendix A. On 8 September 1919, Vickers changed the name of the British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company to Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company. The immediate post-war era was marked by low investment and continued labour unrest. Fortunes changed in 1926 with the formation of the Central Electricity Board which standardized electrical supply and led to a massive expansion of electrical distribution, installations, and appliance purchases. Sales shot up, and 1927 marked the company's best year to date. On 15 November 1922 the BBC was registered and the BBC's Manchester station, 2ZY, was officially opened on 375 metres transmitting from the Metropolitan Vickers Electricity works in Old Trafford. =BTH merger and transition to AEI= In 1928 Metrovick merged with the rival British Thomson-Houston (BTH), a company of similar size and basically the same product lineup. Combined, they would be one of the few companies able to compete with Marconi or English Electric on an equal footing. In fact the merger was marked by poor communication and intense rivalry, and the two companies generally worked at cross purposes. The next year the combined company was purchased by the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) holding group, who also owned Edison Swan (Ediswan); and Ferguson, Pailin & Co, manufacturers of electrical switchgear in Openshaw, Manchester. The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH continued, and AEI was never able to exert effective control over the two competing subsidiary companies. Problems worsened in 1929 with the start of the great depression, but Metrovick's overseas sales were able to pick up some of the slack, notably a major railway electrification project in Brazil. By 1933 world trade was growing again, but growth was nearly upset when six Metrovick engineers were arrested and found guilty of espionage and \\"wrecking\\" in Moscow after a number of turbines built by the company in and for the Soviet Union proved to be faulty. The British government intervened; the engineers were released and trade with Russia was resumed after a brief embargo. During the 1930s Metropolitan Vickers produced two dozen very large diameter (3m/10 ft) three-phase AC traction motors for the Hungarian railway's V40 and V60 electric locomotives. The 1640 kW rated power machinery, designed by K√°lm√°n Kand√≥, was paid for by British government economic aid. In 1935 the company built a 105 MW steam turbogenerator, the largest in Europe at that time, for the Battersea Power Station.\\"Turbine, Battersea Power Station, 31 January 1935\\" In 1936 Metrovick started work with the Air Ministry on automatic pilot systems, eventually branching out to gunlaying systems and building radars the next year. In 1938 they reached an agreement with the Ministry to build a turboprop design developed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) under the direction of Hayne Constant. It is somewhat ironic that BTH, their erstwhile partners, were at the same time working with Frank Whittle on his pioneering jet designs. =Wartime aircraft production= Metropolitan-Vickers 10-14 cwt postal van in Manchester, 1943 In mid-1938, MV's were given a contract to build Avro Manchester twin-engined heavy bombers under licence from A.V. Roe. As this type of work was very different from their traditional heavy engineering activities, a new factory was built on the western side of Mosley Road and this was completed in stages through 1940. There were significant problems producing this aircraft, not least being the unreliability of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and that the first 13 Manchesters were destroyed in a Luftwaffe bombing raid on Trafford Park on 23 December. Despite this the firm went on to complete 43 examples. With the design of the much improved four-engined derivative, the Avro Lancaster, MV switched production to that famous type, supplied with Rolls- Royce Merlin engines from the Ford Trafford Park shadow factory. Three hangars were erected on the southside of Manchester's Ringway Airport for assembly and testing of their Lancasters, before a policy switch was made to assembling them in a hangar at Avro's Woodford airfield. By the end of the war, MV's had built 1,080 Lancasters. These were followed by 79 Avro Lincoln derivatives before remaining orders were cancelled and MV's aircraft production ceased in December 1945. In 1940 the turboprop effort was re-engineered as a pure jet engine after the successful run of Whittle's designs. The new design became the Metrovick F.2 and eventually flew in 1943 on a Gloster Meteor. Considered to be too complex to bother with, Metrovick then re-engineered the design once again to produce roughly double the power, while at the same time starting work on a much larger design, the Metrovick F.9 Sapphire. Although the F.9 proved to be a winner, the Ministry of Supply nevertheless forced the company to sell the jet division to Armstrong Siddeley in 1947 to reduce the number of companies in the business. In addition to building aircraft, other wartime work included the manufacture of both Dowty and Messier undercarriages, automatic pilot units, searchlights and radar equipment. They also produced electric vans and lorries. =Metrovicks postwar= The Metrovick G.1 Gatric gas turbine from MGB 2009. Metropolitan-Vickers electron microscope The post- war era led to massive demand for electrical systems, leading to additional rivalries between Metrovick and BTH as each attempted to one-up the other in delivering ever-larger turbogenerator contracts. Metrovick also expanded their appliance division during this time, becoming a well known supplier of refrigerators and stoves. The design and manufacture of sophisticated scientific instruments, such as electron microscopes, and mass spectrometers, became an important area of scientific research for the company. In 1947, a Metrovick G.1 Gatric gas turbine was fitted to the Motor Gun Boat MGB 2009, making it the world's first gas turbine powered naval vessel. The Bluebird K7 jet-propelled 3-point hydroplane in which Donald Campbell broke the 200 mph water speed barrier was powered with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl jet engine producing 3,500 lbf (16 kN) of thrust. The K7 was unveiled in late 1954. Campbell succeeded on Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he set a record of 202.15 mph (325.33 km/h), beating the previous record by some 24 mph (39 km/h) held by Stanley Sayres. Another major area of expansion was in the diesel locomotive market, where they combined their own generators and traction motors, with third-party diesel engines to develop in 1950 the WAGR X class 2-Do-2 locomotive and in 1958 the type 2 Co-Bo, later re-classified under the TOPS system as the British Rail Class 28. This diesel-electric locomotive was unusual on two counts; its Co-Bo wheel arrangement and its Crossley 2-Stroke diesel engine (evolved from a World War II marine engine). Intended as part the British Railways Modernisation Plan, the twenty-strong fleet saw service between Scotland and England before being deemed unsuccessful and withdrawn towards the end of the 1960s. Metrovick also produced the CIE 001 Class (originally 'A' Class) from 1955, the first production mainline diesels in Ireland. Metropolitan Vickers also produced electrical equipment for the British Rail Class 76 (EM1), and British Rail Class 77 (EM2), 1.5 kV DC locomotives, built at Gorton Works for the electrification of the Woodhead Line in the early 1950s. Larger but broadly similar locomotives were also supplied to the NSWGR as their 46 class. The company also designed the British Rail Class 82, 25 kV AC locomotives built by Beyer Peacock in Manchester using Metrovick electrical equipment. The company also supplied electrical equipment for the British Rail Class 303 \\"Blue Train\\" electric multiple units. In the 1950s, the company built a large power transformer works at Wythenshawe, Manchester. The factory opened in 1957, and was closed by GEC in 1971, after which it was sold to the American compressor manufacturer Ingersoll Rand. In 1961, the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was invited to the company's factory at Trafford Park as part of his tour of Manchester.\\"Yuri Gagarin in the UK\\" The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH was eventually ended in an unconvincing fashion when the AEI management eventually decided to rid themselves of both brands and be known as AEI universally, a change they made on 1 January 1960. This move was almost universally resented within both companies. Worse, the new brand name was utterly unknown to their customers, leading to a noticeable fall-off in sales and AEI's stock price. =General Electric Company (GEC) takeover= When AEI attempted to remove the doubled-up management structures, they found this task to be even more difficult. By the mid-1960s the company was struggling under the weight of two complete management hierarchies, and they appeared to be unable to control the company any more. This allowed AEI to be purchased by General Electric Company in 1967, which was later restructured into many other companies, including Marconi plc in 1999, later Marconi Corporation plc, and others.

De los R√≠os was born in Buenos Aires into a musical family; his father was a musician and his mother a well known folk singer; he studied composition and arranging at the National Conservatory of Music under Alberto Ginastera and Teodoro Fuchs. He was inspired by an eclectic range of music and formed a musical group called \\"The Waldos\\" which crossed folk music with electronic sounds. De los R√≠os turned to work in cinema and film sound tracks where his compositions were heard in the 1967 film Savage Pampas, for which he received a prestigious award from the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences. He relocated to the US in 1958 and then to Spain in 1962. He is best remembered for his ability to transform European classical music into pop music. His 1971 arrangement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40, recorded with the Manuel de Falla orchestra, reached the top spot in the Dutch charts and scored a top 10 hit in several other European countries. (In the U.S. it peaked at #67 on the Billboard charts, released through United Artists Records.) In 1970, prior to this success, Waldo de los R√≠os had already climbed the charts around Europe and America with Ludwig van Beethoven's Ode To Joy, which he arranged and conducted for Miguel R√≠os \\"Song of Joy\\". His record Mozart in the Seventies rearranged famous Mozart pieces in a contemporary style, with a large percussion section. Several tracks from it were used as theme tunes to BBC programmes of that era, including the theme to the BBC's coverage of the Horse of the Year Show (his reworking of Mozart's A Musical Joke). His re- working of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, used for many years as the theme to the Radio 4 quiz show Brain of Britain, was the subject of frequent complaints from classical music fans (with whom the show was popular) and presenter Robert Robinson described it on air as \\"Mozart plus sacrilege\\". He also issued an album Symphonies for the Seventies which included Mozart's Symphony no. 40 and other major composers including Dvo≈ô√°k's New World. He arranged and conducted the Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1971, \\"En un mundo nuevo\\" for Karina. The song landed a respectable second position and hit the charts in several European countries. He was married to actress turned journalist/author Isabel Pisano (born in Montevideo, Uruguay, 1944). Pisano later documented part of his life in her autobiography El Amado Fantasma (Plaza y Jan√©s, 2002). A victim of an acute depression while working on \\"Don Juan Tenorio\\", De los R√≠os committed suicide in Madrid in 1977. Los Waldos Los Waldos were a folk group from Argentina based in Spain, formed by Waldo de los Rios. They played folk songs from Argentina with modern instruments, such as electric guitars, electric bass, drums, piano and synthesizers, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. They started in the mid sixties and released various albums in Spain. The band was made up of five members: * Waldo de los Rios (arranger, piano) * Cecar Gentili (keyboards) * Willy Rubio (guitars) * Roberto Stella (drums) * Alberto Carbia (bass guitar) They disbanded in the late sixties when Waldo started his solo career. Discography All his records were released under the Hispa-Vox Label. His first recordings were made with his folk group \\"Los Waldos\\". During late 60s and mid 70s he made several arrangements for many Spanish and international famous artists such as: Raphael, Mari Trini, Alberto Cortez, Facundo Cabral, Tony Landa, Jeanette Dimech, Miguel R√≠os, Los Pekenikes, Maria Ostiz, Karina, Paloma San Basilio, Los Payos, etc. On his discography as soloist: * \\"Los Waldos\\", 1965 (With \\"Los Waldos\\") * \\"Waldo de los Rios en Europa\\", 1965 (With \\"Los Waldos\\") * \\"Espa√±a Electrodin√°mica Vol. 1\\", 1966 * \\"Folklore Din√°mico\\", 1966 (With \\"Los Waldos\\") * \\"Espa√±a en 3era Dimensi√≥n\\" 1967 * \\"Suite SudAmericana - Argentina‚Ä¢Paraguay‚Ä¢Peru‚Ä¢Uruguay\\" 1968 * \\"Waldo en la TVE\\", 1968 * \\"El Sonido M√°gico Vol. 1\\", 1969 * \\"El Sonido M√°gico Vol. 2\\", 1970 * \\"Sinfon√≠as\\", 1970 * \\"Mozartmania\\", 1971 * \\"Symphonies for the Seventies\\", 1971 * \\"Operas\\", 1973 * \\"Navidad Con Waldo de Los Rios\\" 1973 * \\"Sinfon√≠as 2\\", 1974 * \\"Oberturas\\", 1974 * \\"Concierto Para La Guitarra Criolla\\", with Ernesto Bitetti, 1974 * \\"Conciertos\\", 1976 * \\"Corales\\", 1977 (Postum Release) =Film work= *Alias Gardelito (Alias Big Shot) (1961) *The Blonde from Buenos Aires (1961), with Mamie Van Doren * Savage Pampas (1966), with Robert Taylor *La residencia (The House That Screamed) (1969), with Lilli Palmer *A Town Called Bastard (1971), with Telly Savalas *Bad Man's River (1971), with James Mason, Gina Lollobrigida *Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971), with Jason Robards, Herbert Lom *The Corruption of Chris Miller (1973), with Jean Seberg, Barry Stokes *Boquitas pintadas (1974) *Who Can Kill a Child?

He is credited with raising origami from a craft to a living art. According to his own estimation made in 1989, he created more than 50,000 models, of which only a few hundred designs were presented as diagrams in his 18 books. Yoshizawa acted as an international cultural ambassador for Japan throughout his career. In 1983, Emperor Hirohito awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun, 5th class, one of the highest honors bestowed in Japan.  Life  Yoshizawa was born on 14 March 1911, in Kaminokawa, Japan, to the family of a dairy farmer. When he was a child, he took pleasure in teaching himself origami. He moved into a factory job in Tokyo when he was 13 years old. His passion for origami was rekindled in his early 20s, when he was promoted from factory worker to technical draftsman. His new job was to teach junior employees geometry. Yoshizawa used the traditional art of origami to understand and communicate geometrical problems. In 1937 he left factory work to pursue origami full- time. During the next 20 years, he lived in total poverty, earning his living by door-to-door selling of tsukudani (a Japanese preserved condiment that is usually made of seaweed). During World War II, Akira Yoshizawa served in the army medical corps in Hong Kong. He made origami models to cheer up the sick patients, but eventually fell ill himself and was sent back to Japan.. His origami work was creative enough to be included in the 1944 book Origami Shuko, by Isao Honda (Êú¨Â§ö Âäü). However, it was his work for a 1952 issue of the magazine Asahi Graph that launched his career, which included the 12 zodiac signs commissioned by a magazine. In 1954 his first monograph, Atarashii Origami Geijutsu (New Origami Art) was published. In this work he established the Yoshizawa‚ÄìRandlett system of notation for origami folds (a system of symbols, arrows and diagrams), which has become the standard for most paperfolders. The publishing of this book helped Yoshizawa out of his poverty. It was followed closely by his founding of the International Origami Centre in Tokyo in 1954, when he was 43. His first overseas exhibition was organized in 1955 by Gershon Legman, a leading player in the early years of the origami movement. The exhibition was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Felix Tikotin, a Dutch dealer, acted as a liaison. Yoshizawa lent many of his own origami models to other exhibitions around the world. He would never sell his origami figures, but rather gave them away as gifts to people, and let other groups and organizations borrow them for exhibiting. His second wife, Kiyo Yoshizawa, served as his manager and taught origami to the other patients until his death from pneumonia on his 94th birthday.  Technique  A wet- folded origami bull Although Akira Yoshizawa pioneered many different origami techniques, wet-folding is one of his most significant contributions. This technique involves slightly dampening the paper before making a fold. Wet- folding allows the paper to be manipulated more easily, resulting in finished origami models that have a rounder and more sculpted look. The ability to create origami with a more realistic appearance was an important advancement in paper folding, since it took models away from the realm of simple crafts and towards true artistic expression. Wet-folding is most often used with thicker paper; normal origami paper is very thin and thus prone to tearing when using the wet-folding technique. Yoshizawa believed the process was the most important part. He was known to say that, \\"When you fold, the ritual and the act of creation is more important than the final result. When your hands are busy your heart is serene\\".  Later years  In March 1998, Yoshizawa was invited to exhibit his origami in the Carrousel du Louvre. Although he had previously disliked his contemporaries, he was not opposed to having his photo taken with them. Many of his patterns had been diagrammed by his professional rivals, which angered Yoshizawa when he was younger. However, as he had aged, he found that he now enjoyed the company of his peers. Akira Yoshizawa died on 14 March 2005 in a hospital in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo due to complications of pneumonia on his 94th birthday.

It was found in Ireland in 1850, but, despite its name, not at Tara but likely near Bettystown on the coast of County Meath. The name by which it became known was attached to the brooch by the jeweller who purchased it, as a marketing ploy for the copies they made. The brooch was exhibited internationally and was one of the artifacts that fuelled the Celtic Revival in the mid-19th century. It is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. The National Museum of Ireland describes it as follows: \\"...[T]he Tara Brooch can be considered to represent the pinnacle of early medieval Irish metalworkers‚Äô achievement. Each individual element of decoration is executed perfectly and the range of technique represented on such a small object is astounding.\\" Description The brooch has a diameter of 8.7 cm and the pin has a length of 32 cm. It is made of cast and gilt silver, decorated on both front and rear. On the front are fine gold filigree panels depicting animal and abstract motifs, separated by studs of glass, enamel and amber. The back is flatter than the front, and the decoration is cast. The motifs consist of scrolls and triple spirals. Attached to the brooch by a swivel attachment is a silver chain made from plaited wire. The swivel consists of animal heads framing two small cast glass human heads. Discovery Although the brooch is named after the Hill of Tara, traditionally seen as the seat of the High Kings of Ireland, the Tara Brooch has no connection to either the Hill of Tara or the High Kings of Ireland. The brooch was supposedly found in August 1850 on the beach at Bettystown, near Laytown, in County Meath, not far from Drogheda and some 50 km (30 mi) north of Dublin and about 25 kilometers from Tara. The finder, a peasant woman (or her two sons), claimed to have found it in a box buried in the sand, though it is likely that it was found inland, and she claimed it was found at the beach to avoid a legal claim by the landowner. It was sold to a dealer and then to the Dublin jeweller, G. & S. Waterhouse, who were already producing Celtic Revival jewellery and who renamed it the \\"Tara Brooch\\" to increase its public appeal.Accounts of the brooch's origins and discovery vary ‚Äì see Exhibition image and description, also Lynch, Michelle, \\"Delicate Irish Treasure\\" in NOW magazine, 25‚Äì31 January 2007, V. 26 N. 21 The brooch was made in many pieces, with much of the decoration on small \\"trays\\" or panels which were then fixed into place. When it was found only one panel of decoration was missing, but several more have since disappeared, apparently before it entered the collection of the Royal Irish Academy,British Museum replica brooch. who later transferred their collection of antiquities to the new National Museum. Reception in the 19th century Celtic Revival jewellery had become very fashionable in the 1840s. Waterhouse used the Tara Brooch as the centre of displays of his replicas and imitations of Celtic brooches in his Dublin shop, also exhibiting it at The Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and the Paris Exposition Universelle, as well as the Dublin exhibition visited by Queen Victoria in 1853. Victoria liked these Celtic brooches and purchased a facsimile of the Tara Brooch at the Great Exhibition. Prince Albert had already bought two similar pieces for her when the two of them visited Dublin in 1849. Waterhouse had invented the brooch's name, choosing to link it to the site associated with the High Kings of Ireland, \\"fully aware that this would feed the Irish middle-class fantasy of being descended from them\\".Gere and Rudoe, 444; British Museum: Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, see note above. In 1868, the brooch was sold to the Royal Irish Academy. By the 1870s, \\"Tara brooch\\" had become a generic term for Celtic Revival brooches, some of which were by then being made by Indian workshops for export to Europe.Gere and Rudoe, 455 See also * Broighter Gold * Derrynaflan Chalice * Ardagh Chalice * Cross of Cong *Londesborough Brooch References *Gere, C. and Rudoe J., Jewellery in the Age of Queen Victoria: a Mirror to the World, 2010, British Museum Publications, *\\"NMI\\":Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds.

Origins  MartinLogan was founded by Gayle Martin Sanders and Ron Logan Sutherland who met in the late 1970s at a high-end audio store Sanders managed in Lawrence, Kansas. Despite different backgrounds (Sanders had trained in architecture and advertising, Sutherland in electrical engineering) they shared a passion for music and electrostatic loudspeakers. Discussion of electrostatic speakers and the available technology led Sanders and Sutherland to design and build an electrostatic speaker. Sanders organized a research and development team to transform a design he had tinkered with for more than a decade into a marketable electrostatic transducer.  The first prototype  The first prototype was ready in 1980. The sound quality was adequate, but at high volume levels there was arcing within the electrostatic panels. The team began experiments with aerospace materials that led to improved performance. The drivers were made with conductive coatings, insulation, and adhesives, and an ultra-light Mylar diaphragm between two perforated-steel stators. Satisfied with the aesthetics, Sanders still struggled with achieving satisfactory high-frequency dispersion without compromising sound quality (physically wide transducers radiate high frequencies in a narrow beam rather than fanning them over a wide area.) The solution came in a midnight session when Sutherland sketched a theoretical sound wave to illustrate how sound disperses. Sanders envisioned a horizontally curved panel, the curvilinear line-source (or CLS), transducer central to the design of every MartinLogan electrostat since. With only a mock-up and some photographs, Sanders and Sutherland exhibited their speaker concept at the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago. The design was honored with a CES Design and Engineering Award. Excited by the response, they headed home to Kansas to translate their ideas into a working‚Äîand saleable‚Äîmodel. Through a network of high-technology manufacturers, Sanders and Sutherland enlisted the help of other engineers with expertise and interest in the project. The company that fabricated the space shuttle's filtered windows and the people who had created Teflon-coated cookware joined the design team. The final driver panel was patented and used a vapor deposition process, an optically transparent diaphragm that could support a 5,000-volt charge, and a conformal coating that uniformly insulated each perforated stator to a charge of up to 10,000 volts.  Products  A MartinLogan tower speaker (left) with signature large, curved electrostatic driver. = Monolith = By the time of the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), they had developed a full-range hybrid electrostatic loudspeaker they called the Monolith. A high-end audio company used a prototype pair in its room at the show to demonstrate its electronics. Dealers who heard them were impressed by the sound of the Monoliths and were eager to sell them. It was at this point that Sanders and Sutherland put their middle names to the venture and set about satisfying the demand they had created. MartinLogan was created. Working with one full-time and one part-time employee, they built and shipped the first 10 pairs of Monoliths. Sales started to surge in 1985, and the company was finally on a firm footing. Sutherland departed to return to his first love, electronics. The next year MartinLogan moved to its current location. At the same time international distribution for the Monolith took off. Steady growth followed. By 1988 sales had increased tenfold and the plant had expanded to include a large production space. In 1989, and again in 1990, Inc. magazine recognized MartinLogan as one of the 500 fastest-growing privately held companies in the United States. In the early 1990s MartinLogan released the world's first electrostatic home cinema center-channel speaker and on-wall surround channel speakers, establishing the brand in the emerging home theater market. It was during this time in the early 1990s that some of MartinLogan's most popular electrostatic speakers were introduced, including the Aerius, SL3, Quest, and Cinema. = The Statement e2 generation = MartinLogan's next product began to take form in 1997 in the form of the 2000-pound Statement e2 loudspeaker. The design and engineering behind the Statement e2 fueled the next generation of MartinLogan electrostatic speakers (not to mention ML's first non-electrostatic product). Released in 1999, the Prodigy electrostatic loudspeaker incorporated much of the design and engineering knowledge gained during the Statement e2 project. Prodigy in turn inspired a new generation of electrostatic products including the Odyssey, Ascent, Aeon and Theater. = Subwoofers = The next product was MartinLogan's first non-electrostatic product. In 2001 the original Descent subwoofer (featuring servo-control and BalancedForce technologies) established MartinLogan as a major player in the growing subwoofer market. Other subwoofer models by MartinLogan include the Descent i, Depth i, Grotto, Abyss and Dynamo. = The Design Series = In 2003 the MartinLogan Design Series was launched aimed at producing a smaller, more affordable line of speakers. Speakers in the Design Series include the Clarity, Mosaic, Montage, Fresco, Vignette, as well as the Abyss and Dynamo subwoofers. = In-wall speakers = Now established as a loudspeaker 'technology' company (not just an 'electrostatic' company) MartinLogan designed a first for high-performance speakers ‚Äî inside a wall - the Voyage and Passage in-wall loudspeakers (released 2004). = The ESL Series = In January 2005 MartinLogan released the Summit electrostat. A major departure from previous electrostatics, Summit combined dual independently powered woofers with MartinLogan's most advanced electrostatic transducer to date‚Äîthe XStat. Later additions to the ESL Series include the Vista, Vantage, and Stage loudspeakers as well as the Descent i and Depth i subwoofers.  Current  In October 2005 ML was acquired by a subsidiary of ShoreView Industries. ShoreView is a financial firm that makes investments in companies. ShoreView is a passive investor that is not from the loudspeaker or audio business and is not involved in day-to-day operations. Production of Martin Logan Electrostatic loudspeakers was moved to the Paradigm manufacturing facility in Mississauga Ontario, Canada post this acquisition. Conventional loudspeakers by Martin Logan, the Motion line, are manufactured in China. On May 13, 2019, Paradigm Electronics in Mississauga Ontario, issued a press release that stated \\"Scott Bagby and John Bagby announced the purchase of Paradigm Electronics, Anthem Electronics, and MartinLogan Loudspeakers, effective May 10, 2019.\\" Scott Bagby, one of the original founders of Paradigm Electronics, will continue as Chairman and will assume the role of CEO.

A British force under General Edward Braddock, moving to take Fort Duquesne, was defeated by a force of French and Canadian troops under Captain Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu with its American Indian allies. The defeat marked the end of the Braddock Expedition, by which the British had hoped to capture Fort Duquesne and gain control of the strategic Ohio Country. Both Braddock and Beaujeu were killed in action during the battle, with Braddock being mortally wounded in the fight and dying during the retreat near present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He specifically asked for George Washington, who accompanied him on the march, to oversee his burial. The remainder of the column retreated south-eastwards and the fort, and region, remained in French hands until its capture in 1758. Background Braddock had been dispatched to North America in the new position of Commander-in-Chief, bringing with him two regiments (the 44th and 48th) of troops from Ireland.Anderson p.67-71 He added to this by recruiting local troops in British America, swelling his forces to roughly 2,200 by the time he set out from Fort Cumberland, Maryland on 29 May.Anderson p.96 He was accompanied by Virginia Colonel George Washington, who had led the previous year's expedition to the area. Major General Edward Braddock launched a military expedition aimed at capturing the French Fort Duquesne. Braddock's expedition was part of a four-pronged attack on the French in North America. Braddock's orders were to launch an attack into the Ohio Country, disputed by Britain and France. Control of the area was dominated by Fort Duquesne on the forks of the Ohio River. Once it was in his possession, he was to proceed on to Fort Niagara, establishing British control over the Ohio territory. He soon encountered a number of difficulties. He was scornful of the need to recruit local Native Americans as scouts, and left with only eight Mingo guides. He found that the road he was trying to use was slow, and needed constant widening to move artillery and supply wagons along it. Frustrated, he split his force in two, leading a flying column ahead, with a slower force following with the cannon and wagons. The flying column of 1,300 crossed the Monongahela River on 9 July, within of their target, Fort Duquesne. Despite being very tired after weeks of crossing extremely hard terrain, many of the British and Americans anticipated a relatively easy victory‚Äîor even for the French to abandon the fort upon their approach.Anderson p.97 Fort Duquesne had been very lightly defended, but had recently received significant reinforcements.Dull p.31 Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec≈ìur, the Canadian commander of the fort, had around 1,600 French troupes de la Marine, Canadian militiamen and Native American allies. Concerned by the approach of the British, he dispatched Captain Daniel Li√©nard de Beaujeu with around 800 troops, (108 Troupes de la Marine, 146 Canadian militia, and 600 Indians),W. J. Eccles, France in America, p184 to check their advance.Anderson p.98-99 Battle The French and Indians arrived too late to set an ambush, as they had been delayed, and the British had made surprisingly speedy progress. They ran into the British advance guard, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage. Seeing the enemy in the trees, Gage ordered his men to open fire. Despite firing at very long range for a smooth-bored musket, their opening volleys succeeded in killing Captain Beaujeu. Native American, French, and Canadian forces positioned along the tree line. Unconcerned by the death of Beaujeu, the Indian warriors took up positions to attack. They were fighting on an Indian hunting ground which favored their tactics, with numerous trees and shrubbery separated by wide open spaces. Although roughly a hundred of the Canadians fled back to the fort, Captain Dumas rallied the rest of the French troops. The Indian tribes allied with the French, the Ottawas, Ojibwa and Potawatomis, used psychological warfare against the British forces. After the Indians killed British soldiers, they would nail their scalps to surrounding trees. During the battle, Indians made a terrifying \\"whoop\\" sound that caused fear and panic to spread in the British infantry. As they came under heavy fire, Gage's advance guard began taking casualties and withdrew. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with the main body of Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. Despite comfortably outnumbering their attackers, the British were immediately on the defensive. Most of the regulars were not accustomed to fighting in forest terrain, and were terrified by the deadly musket fire. Confusion reigned, and several British platoons fired at each other.Anderson p.102 The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militiamen and Indians enveloped them and continued to snipe at the British flanks from the woods on the sides of the road. At this time, the French regulars began advancing along the road and began to push the British back. General Braddock rode forward to try to rally his men, who had lost all sense of unit cohesion. Following Braddock's lead, the officers tried to reform units into regular order within the confines of the road. This effort was mostly in vain, and simply provided targets for their concealed enemy. Cannon were used, but due to the confines of the forest road, they were ineffective. Braddock had several horses shot under him, yet retained his composure, providing the only sign of order to the frightened British soldiers. Many of the Americans, lacking the training of British regulars to stand their ground, fled and sheltered behind trees, where they were mistaken for enemy fighters by the redcoats, who fired upon them. The rearguard, made up of Virginians, managed to fight effectively from the trees‚Äîsomething they had learned in previous years of fighting Indians.Anderson p.102-3 Despite the unfavorable conditions, the British began to stand firm and blast volleys at the enemy. Braddock believed that the enemy would eventually give way in the face of the discipline displayed by the English-led troops. Despite lacking officers to command them, the often makeshift platoons continued to hold their crude ranks. After three hours of intense combat, General Braddock was mortally wounded, resulting in the withdrawal of British forces. Finally, after three hours of intense combat, Braddock was shot in the lung, possibly by one of his own men,Hadden, 117According to Crocker, Tom Fausett (1713?-1822) shot Braddock to avenge his brother whom Braddock caught cowering on the battlefield and ran through with his sword. He was something of a character and there are doubts about this story. He later settled in western Pennsylvania and died, it is said, at the age of 109. and effective resistance collapsed. He fell from his horse, badly wounded, and was carried back to safety by his men. As a result of Braddock's wounding, and without an order being given, the British began to withdraw. They did so largely with order, until they reached the Monongahela River, when they were set upon by the Indian warriors. The Indians attacked with hatchets and scalping knives, after which panic spread among the British troops, and they began to break ranks and run, believing they were about to be massacred. Colonel Washington, although he had no official position in the chain of command, was able to impose and maintain some order, and formed a rear guard, which allowed the remnants of the force to disengage. By sunset, the surviving British forces were fleeing back down the road they had built, carrying their wounded. Behind them on the road, bodies were piled high. The Indians did not pursue the fleeing redcoats, but instead set about scalping and looting the corpses of the wounded and dead, and drinking two hundred gallons of captured rum.Anderson p.103-4 A number of British soldiers and women were captured in the battle. Some of the soldiers were spared, as were most of the women, but around a dozen soldiers were tortured and burned to death by the Indians that night, witnessed by British prisoner James Smith.Preston 2015 pg 265 Daniel Boone, a famous American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman ‚Äî and one of the first folk heroes of the United States ‚Äî was among the soldiers involved in the battle. Boone served under Captain Hugh Waddell of North Carolina, whose militia unit was assigned in 1755 to serve under Braddock. Boone acted as a wagoner, along with his cousin Daniel Morgan, who would later be a key general in the American Revolution. In the Battle of the Monongahela, Boone narrowly escaped death when the baggage wagons were assaulted by Indian troops - Boone escaped, it is said, by cutting his wagons and fleeing. Boone remained critical of Braddock's blunders for the rest of his life.Wallace, Paul A. W. (1 August 2007). \\"Daniel Boone in Pennsylvania\\". DIANE Publishing Inc. ‚Äì via Google Books. While on the campaign, Boone met John Finley, a packer who worked for George Croghan in the trans-Appalachian fur trade. Finley first interested Boone in the abundance of game and other natural wonders of the Ohio Valley. Finley took Boone on his first hunting trip to Kentucky 12 years later. Order of battleAftermath The mortally wounded General Braddock during the retreat. The British saw significant casualties in the battle. Of the approximately 1,300 men Braddock led into battle, 456 were killed outright and 422 were wounded. Commissioned officers were prime targets and suffered greatly: out of 86 officers, 26 were killed and 37 wounded. Of the 50 or so women that accompanied the British column as maids and cooks, only 4 returned with the British; about half were taken as captives. The French and Canadians reported very few casualties. Braddock died of his wounds on July 13, four days after the battle, and was buried on the road near Fort Necessity. Colonel Thomas Dumas, with the reserves and rear supply units, took command when the survivors reached his position. Realizing there was no further likelihood of his force proceeding to capture Fort Duquesne, he decided to retreat. He ordered the destruction of supplies and cannon before withdrawing, burning about 150 wagons on the spot. His forces retreated back toward Philadelphia. The French did not pursue, realizing that they did not have sufficient resources for an organized pursuit. Legacy Braddock's Field 175th anniversary commemorative issue of 1930 The battle was a devastating defeat, and has been characterized as one of the most disastrous in British colonial history.McLynn p.35 It marked the end of the Braddock expedition, which many had believed contained overwhelming force, to seize the Ohio Country. It awakened many in London to the sheer scale of forces that would be needed to defeat the French and their Indian allies in North America.McLynn p.35-36 The inability of the redcoats to use skirmishers, and the vulnerability this caused for the main force, had a profound effect on British military thinking. Although Braddock had posted a company of flankers on each side, these troops were untrained to do anything but stand in line and fire platoon volleys, which were unsuited to such conditions. Learning from their mistakes the British made much better use of skirmishers, often equipped with rifles, who could protect the main body of troops from such devastating fire, both later in the French and Indian War and in the American War of Independence. Because of the speed with which the French and Indians launched their attack and enveloped the British column, the battle is often erroneously reported as an ambush by many who took part. In fact, the French had been unprepared for their contact with the British, whom they had blundered into. The speed of their response allowed them to quickly gain the upper hand, and brought about their victory. The French remained dominant in the Ohio Country for the next three years, and persuaded many previously neutral Indian tribes to enter the war on their side. The French were eventually forced to abandon Fort Duquesne in 1758 by the approach of the Forbes Expedition. =Commemorations= In 1930, on the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Braddock's Field, a statue of Colonel Washington was unveiled, and a commemorative postage stamp, modeled after that statue, was released for usage the same day.

Broader risks of trading such as political risk or systemic risk may interrupt markets and prevent settlement, but these are not settlement risk per se. One form of settlement risk is foreign exchange settlement risk or cross-currency settlement risk, sometimes called Herstatt risk after the German bank that made a famous example of the risk. On 26 June 1974, the bank's license was withdrawn by German regulators at the end of the banking day (4:30pm local time) because of a lack of income and capital to cover liabilities that were due. But some banks had undertaken foreign exchange transactions with Herstatt and had already paid Deutsche Mark to the bank during the day, believing they would receive US dollars later the same day in the US from Herstatt's US nostro. But after 3:30 pm in Germany and 10:30 am in New York, Herstatt stopped all dollar payments to counterparties, leaving the counterparties unable to collect their payment. The closing of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 did not cause similar problems because the Bank of England had set up a special scheme which ensured that payments were completed. Barings in 1995 resulted in minor losses for counterparties in the foreign exchange market because of a specific complexity in the ECU clearing system.

It was the last major engagement between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee and the Army of the Potomac, under the overall direction of Union General-in-Chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. After abandoning Petersburg, the exhausted and starving Confederates headed west, hoping to re-supply at Danville or Lynchburg, before joining General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina. But the stronger Union army kept pace with them, exploiting the rough terrain full of creeks and high bluffs, where the Confederates‚Äô long wagon trains were highly vulnerable. The two small bridges over Sailor's Creek and Little Sailor's Creek caused a bottleneck that further delayed the Confederates‚Äô attempt to escape. After some desperate hand-to-hand fighting, about a quarter of the remaining effective soldiers of the Confederate force were lost, including several generals. Witnessing the surrender from a nearby bluff, Lee made his famous despairing remark to Major General William Mahone, \\"My God, has the army dissolved?\\", to which Mahone replied, \\"No, General, here are troops ready to do their duty.\\" The battle is sometimes referenced under its old spelling as Sayler's Creek. BackgroundMilitary situation= A review of the Appomattox Campaign before the Battle of Sailor's Creek shows the increasingly desperate circumstances of the Confederate forces leading into the battle. Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's Union Army (Army of the Potomac, Army of the James, Army of the Shenandoah) broke the Confederate States Army defenses of Petersburg, Virginia at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1 and the Third Battle of Petersburg on April 2. A Union division under the command of Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles also broke up the last defense of the South Side Railroad on the afternoon of April 2, cutting off that railroad as a supply line or route of retreat for the Confederates. General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia evacuated Petersburg, Virginia and the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia on the night of April 2-3 and began a retreat in hopes of linking up with General Joseph E. Johnston's army confronting the Union army group commanded by Major General William T. Sherman in North Carolina.Bearss, Edwin C., with Bryce A. Suderow. The Petersburg Campaign.

On April 3, south of the Appomattox River, Union Army cavalry under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) William Wells's brigade of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer's division pursued and engaged units of the fleeing Confederate cavalry rear guard under Brigadier General William Paul Roberts at Namozine Creek and Brigadier General Rufus Barringer of W.H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee's division and the overall command of Major General Fitzhugh Lee at the Battle of Namozine Church.Humphreys, Andrew A. The Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865: The Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1883. . Retrieved March 5, 2015. p. 374. Barringer's Confederate cavalry had bought enough time for Major General Bushrod Johnson's infantry division to pass nearby Namozine Church. When General Johnson approached Namozine Church with his infantry division, Custer's men were forced to retire, allowing the Confederate forces to proceed across Deep Creek, an Appomattox River tributary.Longacre, 2002, p. 330. After dark, however, Wells's brigade continued to attack Fitzhugh Lee's force along Deep Creek but were finally held off by Bushrod Johnson's infantry at Sweathouse Creek. Brigadier General Barringer and many of his men were captured when Major General Philip H. Sheridan's scouts who were wearing gray uniforms led Barringer and his remaining men into a trap.Eicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. . p. 813 The number of Confederate killed and wounded are unknown except that Bushrod Johnson reported 15 wounded. 350 Confederates were captured. The Union force sustained casualties of 95 killed and wounded at the engagements at Namozine Creek, Namozine Church and Sweathouse Creek on April 3. =March toward Amelia Court House= Most of the Confederate Army had marched about west on April 3.Calkins, 1997, p. 69. In order to meet at the rendezvous point of Amelia Court House that had been designated by General Lee, all of the Confederate commands except those of Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson and Major General Fitzhugh Lee would have to cross the Appomattox River, which turns sharply to the north not far west of the Confederate camps on the night of April 3.Calkins, 1997, p. 67. On April 4, most of the Confederate army moving over to the south side of the Appomattox River had to use a single muddy road or take widely circuitous routes due to flooding and bridges being out on other roads, slowing progress toward the rendezvous point of Amelia Court House.Marvel, p. 44. By the evening of April 3, most of Lieutenant General James Longstreet's troops had crossed to the west side of the Appomattox River over Goode's Bridge while Major General John B. Gordon's corps was east of the bridge. Amelia Court House was to the west.Calkins, 1997, p. 75. Ewell's force could not cross the river at the Genito Bridge as planned because a necessary pontoon bridge expected to be there had not arrived.Calkins, 1997, p. 77. After marching south, Ewell's men crossed the river on a Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge over which they had placed planks. They camped on April 4 about west of the bridge. Gordon's corps was at Scott's Shop east of Amelia Court House, waiting for Ewell's column to catch up. Mahone's men marched to Goode's Bridge but did not go into Amelia Court House until he was told that the force from Richmond had arrived.Calkins, 1997, p. 78. =Beaver Pond Creek= On the line of march west toward the Confederate Army's rendezvous point of Amelia Court House on Bevill's Bridge Road, Lieutenant General Anderson had the remaining men of Major Generals George Pickett and Bushrod Johnson's divisions build earthworks and form a line of battle at Tabernacle Church Road to protect the forces in retreat from attack from the pursuing Union forces to their south.Marvel, 2002, p. 45. On April 4, Custer's cavalry division rode west toward Jetersville, Virginia on the Richmond and Danville Railroad, southwest of Amelia Court House and of Burkeville Junction, Virginia.Marvel, 2002, p. 47. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt with Brigadier General Thomas Devin's cavalry division crossed Deep Creek at Brown's Bridge and headed straight past Tabernacle Church to Beaver Pond Creek where late in the day, a Michigan regiment from the division sent Anderson's skirmishers back to their field works. Coming up toward the works, Devin's entire division, mostly dismounted, skirmished with portions of Major Generals Henry Heth's, Bushrod Johnson's and George Pickett's infantry.Long, E. B. The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac, 1861‚Äì1865. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1971. . p. 666.Calkins, 1997, pp. 76-77. About 10:00 p.m., Devin was ordered to pull back to Jetersville and he led his men to that point after burning a nearby mill. =Amelia Court House= On the morning of April 4, Union Brigadier General Ranald Mackenzie's command crossed Deep Creek and reached the Five Forks of Amelia County, only about south of Amelia Court House, where the 1st Maryland Cavalry (U.S.) skirmished with the 14th Virginia Cavalry. An advance party of Union Major General George Crook's cavalry division reached the important railroad intersection of Burkeville Junction, Virginia by 3:00 p.m., blocking the Richmond and Danville Railroad route to the southwest. The main body of Crook's cavalry division and Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's infantry brigade from the V Corps also headed toward Jetersville, arriving before dark. A few hours later, the rest of the V Corps arrived at Jetersville and started to entrench, even extending the trenches across the railroad tracks.Marvel, 2002, p. 48. The arrival of the entire V Corps at Jetersville ended Lee's last chance to move south along the railroad, although if he had chosen to send Longstreet's corps which had arrived first at Amelia Court House south against the gathering Union force, his trailing divisions probably could not have caught up.Starr, Steven. The Union Cavalry in the Civil War: The War in the East from Gettysburg to Appomattox, 1863-1865\\\\. Volume 2. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007. Originally published 1981. . p. 462. Lieutenant General Richard Ewell's corp was still trying to cross the Appomattox River at 10:00 p.m.; Anderson was still skirmishing with Devin at Beaver Pond Creek; Gordon was several miles behind at Scott's Shop; and, Mahone was not far from Goode's Bridge, waiting to protect the bridge in case Ewell could find no other river crossing.Humphreys, 1883, p. 375.Marvel, 2002, p. 49. When Devin's cavalry broke off the engagement at Beaver Pond Creek, no Union force threatened the rear of Lee's army and Anderson's and Mahone's forces did not need to lag behind as rear guards. They did not arrive at Amelia Court House until well into the next day.Marvel, 2002, p. 51. Lee had expected to find rations for the army at Amelia Court House but found only an inadequate stockpile of rations and a trainload of ordnance. Lee waited for the rest of the army to catch up and sent foraging parties into the county which yielded few provisions despite Lee's personal appeal in a proclamation that day.Calkins, 1997, p. 76. Yet Union Army foragers were able to find abundant provisions on the march as their wagons began to fall far behind on the muddy roads.Marvel, 2002, p. 52. Lee also ordered 200,000 rations to be sent from Danville via the railroad.Calkins, 1997, p. 76. Sheridan intercepted this message at Jetersville later that day.Calkins, 1997, p. 78. Lee also ordered that the number of wagons and artillery pieces with the army be reduced and precede the infantry on the march with the best horses. The extra equipment was to be sent by a circuitous route to the north with the weaker animals, sent by rail or destroyed.Trudeau, Noah Andre. \\"Out of the Storm: The End of the Civil War, April-June 1865. Boston, New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1994. . p. 92. The 200 guns and 1,000 wagons that Lee's army had taken on their flight would be reduced by almost one-third.Foote, 1974, p. 911.Humphreys, Andrew A. The Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865: The Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1883. . Retrieved March 5, 2015. p. 384. A week later, Lee said the delay at Amelia Court House assured the Confederate defeat and surrender.Marvel, 2002, p. 50. Some modern historians have emphasized the failure to have an expected pontoon bridge at the Genito Road crossing was the key factor in keeping Lee's trailing divisions from reaching Amelia Court House on April 4.Kinzer, Charles E. \\"Amelia Court House/Jetersville (3-5 April 1865).\\" In Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, edited by David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2000. . pp. 36-37.Davis, Burke. To Appomattox: Nine April Days, 1865. New York: Eastern Acorn Press reprint, 1981. . First published New York: Rinehart, 1959. p. 190. A pontoon bridge had been placed at Goode's Bridge but traffic there became heavily congested because the approaches to Bevill's Bridge also were blocked by high water.Marvel, 2002, pp. 50-51. Lee did not mention the missing pontoon bridge in his remarks a week later but instead blamed the delay entirely on the lack of supplies at Amelia Court House, but as some historians have pointed out, many of his men and wagons had not arrived at Amelia Court House on April 4 and were not in a position to advance until some time on April 5 even if he had not stopped the others to rest and forage. Historian William Marvel wrote that \\"as badly as Lee needed to keep moving that night, he needed even more to concentrate his forces.\\"Marvel, 2002, p. 51. =Paineville, Amelia Springs= On the morning of April 5, Sheridan sent Brigadier General Henry E. Davies's brigade of Major General George Crook's division to scout for Confederate movements beyond Amelia Court House near Paineville, or Paine's Cross Roads, about north of Amelia Springs.Humphreys, 1883, p. 376. At Paineville, Davies found a headquarters wagon train guarded by Brigadier General Martin Gary's cavalry brigade. This was the wagon train that had left Richmond with provisions for Lee's army, including food and ammunition for Ewell's corps.Marvel, 2002, p. 55. Since it had followed a more circuitous route north of Genito Bridge on Paineville Road, it had only some cavalry escort. The train crossed to the south side of the Appomattox River by the Clemmentown Bridge. As Davies's brigade slowly passed the resort at Amelia Springs, the wagon train with excess artillery and equipment started up the Paineville Road from Amelia Court House toward Paineville at the same time as the wagon train from Richmond headed south on that road toward Paineville. Local citizens began to spread out on horseback to warn the Confederates of the Union cavalry incursion.Marvel, 2002, p. 56. Davies attacked the lead section of the wagon train, two companies of artillery, east of Paineville, and quickly rounded up 300 soldiers and as many African-American teamsters. The Union cavalrymen cut many horses and mules out of their traces, captured five new Armstrong guns and burned more that 100 wagons of provisions. Davies's troopers destroyed Major General Custis Lee's supplies including all the spare ammunition.Marvel, 2002, pp. 56-57. Leading wagons from the train which left Amelia Court House, including Fitzhugh Lee's headquarters baggage, Robert E. Lee's headquarters wagons with many reports and some ambulances and medical supplies, also were caught by the Union raiders.Marvel, 2002, p. 57. Stragglers and sick soldiers finally gathered to stop the destruction. Before Davies could return to Jetersville, his brigade was attacked near Amelia Springs by Brigadier General Martin Gary's cavalry brigade and a much larger force of Thomas L. Rosser's and Colonel Thomas T. Munford's divisions under Major General Fitzhugh Lee.Humphreys, 1883, p. 377. Davies's force was driven back across Flat Creek. Acting as a rear guard, the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry Regiment held off the Confederate pursuers, allowing Davies's main column with prisoners and captured horses, mules and artillery to move past Amelia Springs.Marvel, 2002, p. 58. At Amelia Springs, the other brigades of Crook's division under Brigadier General J. Irvin Gregg and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. Smith provided reinforcements, allowing Davies's force to reach Jetersville with their prisoners, guns and teams. Davies returned with his men to Amelia Springs to help defend against the Confederate cavalry attack. Crook's cavalry division had casualties of 13 killed, 81 wounded and 72 missing and probably taken prisoner in three encounters during the day. Fitzhugh Lee said he counted 30 dead Union soldiers along the way.Calkins, p. 88 gives the Union casualties as 30 killed and 150 wounded but gives the lower number in the text in his appendix on page 202. Davies captured 320 Confederate soldiers and 310 African-Americans whom he described as teamsters.Calkins, 1997, p. 87. He also captured 400 animals and 11 flags while destroying about 200 wagons. Confederate casualties were unreported but two Confederate captains are known to have been mortally wounded.Calkins, 1997, pp. 88-89. =Jetersville= Having not been able to find much food in the Amelia Court House area and with the Union Army closing in, Lee started his army marching down the route of the Richmond and Danville Railroad toward Jetersville, Virginia at 1:00 p.m. on April 5.Longacre, 2003, pp. 126-127. Nearing Jetersville and hearing skirmish fire in front, Lee discovered that his route to Danville along the railroad was blocked at Jetersville by the fast-moving Union cavalry under Major General Philip Sheridan.Calkins, 1997, p. 91. Union infantry was reported by cavalry scouts to be nearby but in fact the V Corps had already reached Jetersville. Lee decided his men were too spread out and it was too late in the day to attack the Union force at Jetersville. So the Confederates would have to march back up the Richmond and Danville Railroad to a road upon which to make another night march to Farmville. At Farmville, west on the South Side Railroad, Confederate Commissary General Isaac St. John told General Lee that he would have 80,000 rations waiting. From Farmville, Lee might be able to reach the Richmond and Danville at Keysville, Virginia if the Confederates could outpace the Union forces. The Confederate march was held up before the troops could reach Amelia Springs because a bridge was out at Flat Creek which needed to be repaired to allow the passage of wagons and artillery. During the night, Union spies dressed in Confederate uniforms were captured with a message that showed the disposition of the Union forces.Calkins, 1997, p. 92. =Union plan= Lieutenant General Grant reached Major General Sheridan's headquarters at Jetersville about 10:30 p.m.Calkins, 1997, p. 93. Near midnight, Grant and Sheridan met with the ill Major General George Meade, commander of the Army of the Potomac. Grant said he had no doubt Lee was moving right then, but he did not order Meade to change his plan. Sheridan also was convinced that Lee would not remain static at Amelia Court House. Despite their skepticism about Lee staying at Amelia Court House, Grant directed him to advance early in the morning on Amelia Court House if Meade persisted in his view that that was the appropriate move. By this time, the II Corps, V Corps and VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac were available at Jetersville to move against the Confederate army. The soldiers of Meade's three corps were given coffee at 4:00 a.m. and were told to be ready to move at daybreak. In the morning, Humphreys discovered everyone asleep at William Hays's Second Division headquarters at 6:00 a.m., when their march was scheduled to begin, he replaced Hays as division commander with Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Francis Barlow, who had just reported for duty. Barlow's division did not become engaged at Sailor's Creek because, based on erroneous information about a Confederate column, that division was ordered to move too far to the right.Humphreys, 1883, p. 381. Lee's retreat and Grant's pursuit in the Appomattox Campaign, April 2‚Äì9, 1865 Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Initial movementsMarch and pursuit= The Confederate movements west from Amelia Springs put the Confederate army into precarious positions as their long columns became both spread out and eventually delayed as they reached choke points at bridges over Sailor's Creek and Little Sailor's Creek and high bluffs which needed to be traversed west of the creeks. Lee had his army in motion on the night of April 5-6\\\\. Longstreet's combined First and Third Corps led the Confederate night march west, followed by two divisions commanded by Richard Anderson, Richard Ewell's Reserve corps (Richmond garrison troops), the main wagon train, and John Gordon's Second Corps.Calkins, 1997, p. 99. Longstreet's route of march took his men to Amelia Springs, then on the road to Deatonville on their way to Rice's Station on the South Side Railroad.Marvel, 2002, p. 64. Lee's corps moved on parallel roads from Amelia Court House but after they reached Deatonville, all the men and wagons would have to use a single road to move directly to Rice's Station, increasing their vulnerability while on the march.Trudeau, 1994, p. 102. The only other route was the Jamestown Road which left Deatonville to the north and only reached Rice's Station over a roundabout loop.Trudeau, 1994, p. 107. Longstreet's corps left Amelia Court House first and arrived at Rice's Station starting about sunrise. Later in the morning, General Lee joined him. They planned to wait at Rice's Station for the rest of the army to catch up and to guard the town's South Side Railroad station from attack by the Union XXIV which already had occupied Burkeville Junction. At daybreak, Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry left Amelia Springs and marched to Rice's Station where they joined with Longstreet's command.Marvel, 2002, p. 65. Major General William Mahone's division, of the former Third Corps, now combined with Longstreet's First Corps, reached Deatonville before dawn on April 6.Marvel, 2002, p. 69. Mahone's men marched toward Rice's Station over the right-hand fork at Deatonville. They would move unhindered to Rice's Station but the following infantry corps would not. Anderson's, Ewell's and Gordon's corps followed in line after Mahone's division. Rooney Lee's cavalry division stayed behind when Fitzhugh Lee left with the other cavalry so that Rooney Lee's division could help Gordon's corps as a rear guard. The last of Gordon's soldiers had not reached Amelia Springs when the leading men of Longstreet's corps reached Rice's Station.Marvel, 2002, p. 71. The wagon trains were on the right flank of the soldiers of Lee's army, heading for a crossing of Sailor's Creek at Perkinson's mill, near the Creek's confluence with the Appomattox River. The troops planned to cross the river about higher up on the road to Rice's Station. Ewell's corps did not leave Amelia Springs until 2:00 p.m. in order to guard the wagons but moved ahead of them and close up with Anderson's corps when they did move out. On the route of march about past Deatonville, the road to Rice's Station declined into a marsh in the area of Sandy Creek.Marvel, 2002, p. 67. Holt's Corner, where some fighting took place, was two miles down the road.This was some times referred to as Hott's Corner but it was named after a local resident named John Holt. Trudeau, 1994, p. 107. Another farther, past the Hillsman House, was Sailor's Creek. On the opposite side of Sailor's Creek was a steep bluff. About past the bluff was another junction near James N. Marshall's farm.Marvel, 2002, p. 68. Deep ravines were cut into the terrain by both branches of Sailor's Creek. General Humphreys described the country as \\"broken, consisting of woods with dense undergrowth and swamps, alternating with open fields.\\"Humphreys, 1883, p. 379. Sheridan did not send the cavalry with Meade's infantry because of his conviction that Lee must have been moving west to try to outrun the Union Army.Longacre, 2003, p. 145. Sheridan directed his cavalry to follow a road parallel and to the south of Lee's line of march to try to intercept the Confederates. Sheridan sent the cavalry west on the Deatonville-Rice's Station Road with Crook's division leading the advance and Merritt's two divisions under Devin and Custer following behind instead of sending them toward Amelia Court House with the infantry. Battle As it developed, the Battle of Sailor's Creek was actually three principal engagements fought in close proximity mostly at about the same time. Major General Horatio Wright's VI Corps battled Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell's corps at the Hillsman House. Union cavalry led by Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt fought Lieutenant General Richard Anderson's corps at Marshall's Crossroads. After a running battle over several miles, Major General Andrew A. Humphreys's II Corps engaged Major General John B. Gordon's corps at Lockett's Farm.General Humphreys titled a subsection in his book: The Battles of Sailor's Creek. Humphreys, 1883, p. 381.Calkins, 1997, p. 114. =Humphreys v. Gordon: Battle of Lockett's Farm= On the rainy morning of April 6, Humphreys's corp initially moved toward the Confederate wagon train near Amelia Springs on the road to Amelia Court House. At Amelia Springs, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Gershom Mott was wounded while reconnoitering with the skirmish line and was replaced as division commander by Brigadier General Philippe R√©gis de Trobriand. Units of the II Corps moving toward Amelia Court House in accordance with Meade's order, which was in the opposite direction of the Confederate march, observed Lee's army moving west just before the rear guard passed out of sight.Salmon, John S., The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide, Stackpole Books, 2001, . p. 476.Calkins, 1997, p. 97. At about the same time, Union signal officers discovered wagon trains and infantry moving toward Deatonville while Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin's V Corps, at Hill's Shop, also learned that Lee's force had left Amelia Court House.Meade had been wrong in expecting Lee to still be at Amelia Court House. Sheridan had been correct that Lee would be on the move. As the westward movement of the Confederate Army became apparent, the II Corps changed direction and gave pursuit. Griffin's V Corps was sent on a wide swing to the north of the Confederate column through Paineville and was beyond the action on April 6.Calkins, 1997, p. 100. Reenactors engage in a recreation of the battle, 2013 Miles's division of Humphrey's corps brought some guns to the bank of Flat Creek, which ran from northeast to southwest across the line of march, and opened fire on the Confederate infantry, which was the rear of Gordon's corps, marching away toward the west.Humphreys, 1883, p. 378. A running battle began at about 9:00 a.m. a.m. between Miles's and De Trobriand's divisions of the II Corps and the much smaller divisions of Brigadier General James A. Walker's and Major General Bryan Grimes from Gordon's Second Corps, with Rooney Lee's cavalry occasionally holding the line for the infantry.Marvel, 2002, pp. 72-73. Gordon's running battle with Humphreys was stopped by the slow-moving wagon train at Deatonville, making it necessary for his corps to make a stand.Marvel, 2002, p. 73. Crook had sent a cavalry brigade to help the II Corps fight Gordon at Deatonville, but Gordon's infantry and Rooney Lee's cavalry drove them off.Marvel, 2002, p. 78. Regis DeTrobriand's division met Confederate Brigadier General James A. Walker's division and after a brief artillery duel, watched the survivors run up hill and defend themselves from the crest. Seven Union regiments charged Walker's position in an effort to silence his artillery, taking many casualties.Marvel, 2002, pp. 73-74. The 17th Maine Infantry Regiment under Major Charlie Mattocks led a charge against the 21st North Carolina Infantry Regiment, taking their flag and about 300 prisoners.Marvel, 2002, p. 74. DeTrobriand's other regiments picked up another 100 prisoners, flags and wagons as they also took the hill and, when they did, they sent some shells in the direction of the retreating Confederates. DeTrobriand's division occupied Deatonville, finding many arms and artillery pieces and much ammunition left behind by the Confederates. After Lieutenant General Ewell diverted the wagon trains to the Jamestown Road to the north, Major General Gordon's corps followed them, covering the wagons as the Union II Corps continued to pursue close behind.Trudeau, 1994, p. 108. After some fighting at the Holt's Corner junction of the two roads, Humphreys's and Gordon's corps continue to fight over another . The double bridges over Little Sailor's Creek and Big Sailor's Creek just before they merged were broken down, stranding hundreds of wagons and blocking Gordon's line of march.Trudeau, 1994, p. 110. The II Corps came on quickly and after some resistance, Gordon's corps fell back. Fighting stopped at dark and many of Gordon's men escaped, some reaching High Bridge with Gordon that night. Gordon reported that his disorganized men marched the entire night and that \\"many through their guns away.\\"Trudeau, 1994, p. 113. Overall the II Corps captured 13 flags, 4 guns and 1,700 prisoners. Humphreys wrote that his corps suffered 311 killed and wounded and that the Confederate losses probably exceeded his corps' loss. =Crook, Merritt v. Anderson: Battle of Marshall's Crossroads= Major General George Crook's cavalry division initially moving on the Pride's Church Road, starting near Deatonville, began hit and run tactics against the Confederate wagon train and supporting infantry.Humphreys, 1883, p. 380. After Crook's detached brigade was driven away from the fight with Gordon's corps at Deatonville, it jumped ahead to Holt's Corner where Crook's lead brigade attacked Lieutenant General Richard Anderson's men, who were scattered by the surprise attack. The troopers attacked the wagon train and burned a couple dozen wagons. Anderson reorganized and threw back the Union attackers. William Wallace's brigade of Bushrod Johnson's division, Anderson's corps, also dispersed the attack of another Union cavalry brigade. Johnson's four remaining small brigades set up a line perpendicular to Pride's Church Road. Crook ordered the brigades of both J. Irvin Gregg and Charles H. Smith back to the column since Sheridan had ordered Crook to continue west towards Marshall's Crossroads with the rest of the cavalry.Longacre, 2003, p. 148. A gap had opened in the line of march because Crook's cavalry had attacked and delayed Anderson's corps as it was protecting the wagons at Holt's Corner.Calkins, 1997, p. 105. After Crook's cavalry were driven off, Anderson crossed Little Sailor's Creek and reached Marshall's Crossroad, where he found that Union cavalry had found the gap in the line and blocked his way to Rice's Depot. From his position on the right flank, Custer's division crossed Little Sailor's Creek at Gill Mill and noticed the gap between Mahone and Anderson about away at Marshall's Crossroad and blocked the road there while Crook's troopers were attacking the rear of Anderson's column. In this space were slowly-moving artillery pieces. Custer's men charged the artillery, capturing ten pieces before being driven off by Anderson's infantry. Other Union cavalry came up to harass Anderson's line. Anderson's men counterattacked but then held up.Longacre, 2003, p. 149. A Virginia soldier late said that a large number of Union troopers then moved ahead of them while they were digging in instead of moving on. Anderson then turned to cross Little Sailor's Creek when Gordon's corps came up to Holt's Corner. Johnson's and Pickett's divisions set up breastworks across the road as Ewell's corps also crossed to set up a defensive line. Anderson's position was almost south of Ewell's position on a ridge across Sailor's Creek. The Union cavalry charged Anderson's infantry several times. Finally, Colonel Henry Capehart's brigade of Custer's division delivered a fierce blow to the Confederate line, followed by the attack of other brigades, including a charge by Brigadier General Henry E. Davies, Jr., which was praised by General Crook and which caused the entire line to collapse and the survivors to flee.Trudeau, 1994, p. 111. =Wright v. Ewell: Battle of Hillsman's House= The Hillsman House and grounds, as they existed in 2012 Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry had discovered the Union cavalry force blocking Anderson's corps and advised Lieutenant General Richard Ewell of the obstruction on the road ahead. Ewell directed that the trailing wagon train head north on the Jamestown Road at Holt's Corner avoid the Union force on the Deatonville-Rice's Station Road. Ewell's corps then closed about a gap with Anderson's corps and helped Anderson with the repulse of Crook's second attack on Anderson. After Anderson crossed Little Sailor's Creek and passed over the crest of the hill, Ewell moved his force to higher ground on the other side of the creek, leaving men from Colonel William H. Fitzgerald's brigade and the 24th Virginia Cavalry Regiment as a rear guard at the Hillsman farm.Calkins, 1997, p. 107. Ewell and Anderson met to confer about whether to attack the cavalry force in their front or head through the woods toward Farmville. Before they could finish their discussion, Major General Horatio G. Wright's VI Corps appeared in Ewell's rear, forcing Anderson's corps to face the Union cavalry moving up from the south at Marshall's Crossroads, while Ewell's corps had to confront the Union infantry at Hillsman's House. The two corps fought almost back-to- back against the encircling Union forces. As the VI Corps closed up on Ewell's corps, Ewell deployed Major General Joseph B. Kershaw's Division on the right, Custis Lee's division on the left and the naval battalion under Commander John R. Tucker in the middle. Wright's corps came up at about 4:30 p.m. and saw Ewell's force forming a line of battle on the north side of Sailor's Creek. Brigades from the VI Corps divisions of Brigadier General Truman Seymour and Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Frank Wheaton formed up against them.Trudeau, 1994, p. 109. Major General Sheridan was on the scene and a soldier nearby said it was evident that Sheridan's object was to surround Ewell's Confederates. The VI Corps attacked Ewell's line at about 6:00 p.m. after an artillery bombardment during which Ewell's men hastily built modest fortifications. Many Union soldiers were shot down crossing Sailor's Creek which was more like a swamp as much as wide in some places.Trudeau, 1994, p. 111. Wheaton's men reorganized under the crest of a hill and resumed their movement up the hill. The rapidly moving middle of the line was driven back under intense fire and a Confederate counterattack. Since the Confederate line was shorter than the Union line, however, this led the Confederate attackers into a double envelopment.Trudeau, 1994, p. 112. The twenty guns of Union artillery under Brevet Major Andrew Cowan deployed at the Hillsman Farm played a key role in their repulse. Fierce hand-to-hand combat took place before the Confederates finally saw that they were surrounded and gave up. The naval battalion under Commander Tucker was among the last of the surrounded Confederates to surrender. Prematurely, Lieutenant Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) J. Warren Keifer rode forward to accepte the naval battalion's surrender only to have several sailors aim their muskets at him. Only through the intervention of Commander Tucker was Colonel Keifer spared and able to accept the actual surrender a short time later. General Humphreys wrote that Ewell's entire command was killed, wounded or captured except about 250 men of Kershaw's division who escaped.Humphreys, 1883, p. 383. =Casualties= General Humphreys reported 311 casualties in his corps and 442 in Wright's corps but he had no way to state the number of casualties suffered by the Union cavalry. Historian Noah Andre Trudeau states that the total Union loss was 1,180 killed and wounded.Trudeau, 1994, p. 116. Humphreys stated that the total Confederate loss in killed, wounded and captured was \\"not less than 8,000.\\" Trudeau agreed with this number.Trudeau, 1994, p. 115. He noted that despite the efforts of Anderson, Ewell and Gordon, the greater part of the wagon trains was destroyed.Humphreys, 1883, p. 385. Humphreys wrote: \\"Ewell's whole force was lost, together with nearly half of Anderson's and a large part of Gordon's, all in a useless effort to save the trains.\\" Ewell's corps is captured At Sailor's Creek, about one fifth of the remaining retreating Confederate army was taken prisoner or became casualties. Many Confederate officers were captured, including generals Ewell, Kershaw, Custis Lee, Seth M. Barton, James P. Simms, Meriwether Lewis Clark, Sr., Dudley M. Du Bose, Eppa Hunton, and Montgomery D. Corse.Confederate Colonel (Brigadier General) Theodore W. Brevard, Jr. also was captured. He was the last general appointed by Jefferson Davis. His March 28 commission may not have reached him at the time of the battle so even Brevard himself may not have known he was a general. Marvel, 2002, p. 92. Colonel Stapleton Crutchfield was killed leading a detachment of artillery personnel who had participated in the defenses of Richmond. General Humphreys also stated that disorder of the Confederates after their defeats at Five Forks, Sutherland's Station and the Breakthrough \\"doubtless scattered them to such an extent that many being without rations did not rejoin their commands.\\" He went on to say that: \\"In the movement to Amelia Court House, and from that point to sailor's Creek, Farmville and Appomattox Court House, having but scanty supplies and being exhausted by want of sleep and food and overcome with fatigue, many men fell out or wandered in search of food.\\" Aftermath A monument at the site of the battle, dedicated in 2010 When a large part of the Confederate Army did not report to Rice's Station and Lee began to get reports of the defeat unfolding at Sailor's Creek, he returned to a bluff above the battlefield with Mahone's division.Trudeau, 1994, p. 114. Upon seeing the survivors streaming along the road, Lee exclaimed in front of Major General William Mahone, \\"My God, has the army dissolved?\\" to which General Mahone replied, \\"No, General, here are troops ready to do their duty.\\" Touched by the faithful duty of his men, Lee told Mahone, \\"Yes, there are still some true men left ... Will you please keep those people back?\\"Freeman, vol. 3., p. 711. Mahone's division remained on the opposite bank covering the escape of the fugitives but was not engaged in more combat. Captain Tom Custer, brother of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer, received a second Medal of Honor in four days for his actions in this battle. This followed his first medal for actions at the Battle of Namozine Church on April 3, 1865. General Philip Sheridan declared that the battle had been so overshadowed by Lee‚Äôs surrender three days later that it was never accorded the prominence it deserved.Personal memoires of P. Sheridan, Chap. VII. Naming the battle The current official name for the tributary of the Appomattox River is Sayler's Creek, as established in 1959 by the United States Board on Geographic Names; this spelling is used on topographic maps issued by the U.S. Geological Survey.Calkins, The Appomattox Campaign, p. 118. Many prominent Civil War historians (James M. McPherson, Shelby Foote, Bruce Catton, Douglas Southall Freeman, etc.) have used this spelling. Chris M. Calkins of the National Park Service used this spelling in his 1980 work, Thirty-Six Hours before Appomattox, and also in the nomination he wrote to preserve the battlefield in the National Register of Historic Places inventory. However, Calkins noted in his 1997 work, The Appomattox Campaign, that at the time of the Civil War and previously, maps used the spelling Sailors. These include the 1752 Joshua Fry- Peter Jefferson map of Virginia and the 1867 Michler survey maps of 1867 (included in the Official Records Atlas). He therefore judges that the correct name for the Civil War battle should be Sailor's Creek. The American Battlefield Protection Program (National Park Service Civil War Sites Advisory Commission),CWSAC Report Update the Civil War Trust,Battle of Sailor's Creek and the Virginia Department of Conservation and RecreationSailor's Creek State Park use the spelling \\"Sailor's Creek\\". The Battle is also known variously as Little Sailor's Creek, Harper's Farm, Marshall's Cross Roads, Hillsman Farm, Double Bridges, or Lockett's Farm. Battlefield preservation The Sayler's Creek Battlefield was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985.National Historic Landmarks Program website, accessed September 10, 2013.

This property implies that if investment A is considered riskier than B at some future time, then A will also be considered riskier than B at every prior time. Time consistency and financial risk Time consistency is a property in financial risk related to dynamic risk measures. The purpose of the time the consistent property is to categorize the risk measures which satisfy the condition that if portfolio (A) is riskier than portfolio (B) at some time in the future, then it is guaranteed to be riskier at any time prior to that point. This is an important property since if it were not to hold then there is an event (with probability of occurring greater than 0) such that B is riskier than A at time t although it is certain that A is riskier than B at time t+1. As the name suggests a time inconsistent risk measure can lead to inconsistent behavior in financial risk management. =Mathematical definition= A dynamic risk measure \\\\left(\\\\rho_t\\\\right)_{t=0}^{T} on L^0(\\\\mathcal{F}_T) is time consistent if \\\\forall X, Y \\\\in L^0(\\\\mathcal{F}_T) and t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,T-1\\\\\\\\}: \\\\rho_{t+1}(X) \\\\geq \\\\rho_{t+1}(Y) implies \\\\rho_t(X) \\\\geq \\\\rho_t(Y). Equivalent definitions ; Equality : For all t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,T-1\\\\\\\\}: \\\\rho_{t+1}(X) = \\\\rho_{t+1}(Y) \\\\Rightarrow \\\\rho_{t}(X) = \\\\rho_{t}(Y) ; Recursive : For all t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,T-1\\\\\\\\}: \\\\rho_t(X) = \\\\rho_t(-\\\\rho_{t+1}(X)) ; Acceptance Set : For all t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,T-1\\\\\\\\}: A_t = A_{t,t+1} + A_{t+1} where A_t is the time t acceptance set and A_{t,t+1} = A_t \\\\cap L^p(\\\\mathcal{F}_{t+1}) ; Cocycle condition (for convex risk measures) : For all t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,T-1\\\\\\\\}: \\\\alpha_t(Q) = \\\\alpha_{t,t+1}(Q) + \\\\mathbb{E}^{Q}[\\\\alpha_{t+1}(Q) \\\\mid \\\\mathcal{F}_t] where \\\\alpha_t(Q) = \\\\operatorname*{ess sup}_{X \\\\in A_t} \\\\mathbb{E}^{Q}[-X \\\\mid \\\\mathcal{F}_t] is the minimal penalty function (where A_t is an acceptance set and \\\\operatorname*{ess sup} denotes the essential supremum) at time t and \\\\alpha_{t,t+1}(Q) = \\\\operatorname*{ess sup}_{X \\\\in A_{t,t+1}} \\\\mathbb{E}^{Q}[-X \\\\mid \\\\mathcal{F}_t]. =Construction= Due to the recursive property it is simple to construct a time consistent risk measure. This is done by composing one-period measures over time.

Dynamic superhedging price The dynamic superhedging price is a time consistent risk measure. Dynamic entropic risk The dynamic entropic risk measure is a time consistent risk measure if the risk aversion parameter is constant.  Continuous time  In continuous time, a time consistent coherent risk measure can be given by: : \\\\rho_g(X) := \\\\mathbb{E}^g[-X] for a sublinear choice of function g where \\\\mathbb{E}^g denotes a g-expectation.

While the most elementary chunking algorithms simply link constituent parts on the basis of elementary search patterns (e.g., as specified by regular expressions), approaches that use machine learning techniques (classifiers, topic modeling, etc.) can take contextual information into account and thus compose chunks in such a way that they better reflect the semantic relations between the basic constituents.

It is a technique widely used in natural language processing. It is similar to the concept of lexical analysis for computer languages.

With no services running into the adjoining platform to create the piston effect pushing air into the station, ventilation was poor and temperatures in the tunnel rose to over . It took a further four days to extract the last body, that of Newson; his cab, normally deep, had been crushed to . The post-mortem on Newson showed no medical reason to explain the crash. A cause has never been established, and theories include suicide, that he may have been distracted, or that he was affected by conditions such as transient global amnesia or akinesis with mutism. Tests showed that Newson had a blood alcohol level of 80 mg/100 ml‚Äîthe level at which one can be prosecuted for drink-driving, though the alcohol may have been produced by the natural decomposition process over four days at a high temperature. In the aftermath of the crash, London Underground introduced a safety system that automatically stops a train when travelling too fast. This became known informally as Moorgate protection. Northern City Line services into Moorgate ended in October 1975 and British Rail services started in August 1976. After a long campaign by relatives of the dead, two memorials were unveiled in the vicinity of the station, one in July 2013 and one in February 2014. Background London Underground‚Äîalso known as the Underground or the Tube‚Äîis a public rapid transit system serving London and some parts of the adjacent counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire. The network opened in 1863 and contained of route track by 1975; that year three million people used the service each day. The Underground was one of the safest methods of transport in Britain in 1975. Apart from suicides, there were only fourteen deaths on the Underground between 1938 and 1975, twelve of which occurred in the 1953 Stratford crash. Moorgate station, in the City of London, was the terminus at the southern end of the Northern City Line, five stops and from the northern end at Drayton Park. Moorgate is an interchange between the Underground network and suburban overground services. The station contains ten platforms; numbers 7 to 10 are deep level, and numbers 9 and 10 are used for the Northern City Line service. Interior of a type of train carriage involved in the crash At the end of platform 9 in 1975 was a red warning light atop a post, situated in front of a sand drag placed to stop overrunning trains. The drag was long, of which was on the tracks in front of the platform, and was inside an overrun tunnel that was long, high and wide. The tunnel had been designed to accommodate larger main line rolling stock and so was wider than the standard tube tunnel width of . A buffer, which had once been hydraulic, but had not been functioning as such for some time prior to the crash, was at the end of the tunnel, in front of a solid wall. The approach to Moorgate from Old Street station, the stop prior to the terminus, was on a falling gradient of 1 in 150 for before levelling out for to platform 9; a scissors crossover was located just prior to platforms 9 and 10. There was a speed limit of on the line, and a limit of on entry into Moorgate station. From November 1966 the Northern City Line ran 1938 rolling stock. Weekly checks were made on the stock's brakes, doors and compressors; all equipment on the train was examined on a six-week basis and the cars were lifted from their bogies for a thorough examination once a year. Crash On 28 February 1975 the first shift of the Northern City Line service was driven by Leslie Newson, 56, who had worked for London Transport since 1969, and been driving on the Northern City Line for the previous three months. Newson was known by his colleagues as a careful and conscientious motorman (driver). On 28 February he carried a bottle of milk, sugar, his rule book, and a notebook in his work satchel; he also had ¬£270 in his jacket to buy a second-hand car for his daughter after work. According to staff on duty his behaviour appeared normal. Before his shift began Newson had a cup of tea and shared his sugar with a colleague; he jokingly said to the colleague, \\"Go easy on it, I shall want another cup when I come off duty\\". The first return trips of the day between Drayton Park and Moorgate, which started at 6:40 am, passed without incident. Robert Harris, the 18-year-old guard who had started working for London Underground in August 1974, was late and joined the train when it returned to Moorgate at 6:53 am; a driver waiting to go on duty took his place until his arrival. Newson and Harris made three further return trips before the train undertook its final journey from Drayton Park at 8:38 am, thirty seconds late. The train carried approximately 300 passengers; it was a Friday and, as it was the peak of rush hour, most of the travellers were commuters. As the exit from platform 9 was next to the overrun tunnel, the first two carriages were more popular with commuters and more full than the remaining four. Although pupils from the nearby City of London School for Girls would normally be on the service at that time, the pupils had a day's holiday as the school was in use for external examinations. The journalist Sally Holloway, in her history of the crash, observes that the number of casualties could have been higher if the girls had been attending school. After the train departed Old Street on its 56-second journey to Moorgate, Harris was bored and left his position at the guard's control panel‚Äîwhich contained the controls for the emergency brake‚Äîat the front of the rear carriage and walked to the back of the train to look for a newspaper. He did not find one and spent his time reading the advertisements on the walls at the rear of the carriage. On arrival at Moorgate at 8:46 am, the train, which comprised two units of three connected cars, did not slow. It was still under power and no brakes were applied; it passed through the station at . The signalman on duty later reported that the train appeared to be accelerating as it passed along the platform. A passenger waiting to take the return journey stated that Newson appeared \\"to be staring straight ahead and to be somewhat larger than life\\". Tests were later done on trains entering platform 9 at slow speed. These showed that because of the station lighting, it was impossible to clearly see the driver's eyes. Witnesses standing on the platform saw Newson sitting upright and facing forward, his uniform neat and still wearing his hat; his hands appeared to be on the train's controls as far as they could tell. Scale drawing of the crash, showing the size and position of the front three carriages before and after the impact The brakes were not applied and the dead man's handle was still depressed when the train entered the overrun tunnel, throwing up sand from the drag; when the driver's cab made impact with the hydraulic buffer, the carriage was separated from its bogie and the coachwork was forced into the end wall and the roof. The first fifteen seats of the carriage were crushed into . The second coach was forced under the rear of the first, which buckled at three points into the shape of a V with a tail, and had its rear forced into the tunnel roof. With the weight of the train piling up behind it, the front coach was crushed to . The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it rode over the second. Javier Gonzalez, a passenger who was travelling in the front carriage described the moment the train crashed: > Just above my newspaper I saw a lady sitting opposite me and then the lights > went out. I have the image of her face to this day. She died. > > As darkness came, there was a very loud noise of the crash, metal and glass > breaking, no screams, all in the fraction of the second, one takes to > breathe in. It was all over in no time. Forty-two passengers and the driver died; seventy-four people were treated in hospital for their injuries. It was, and remains, the worst peacetime accident on the Underground. Rescue The first call to the emergency services was received at 8:48 am; the London Ambulance Service arrived at 8:54 am and the London Fire Brigade (LFB) at 8:57 am. At around the same time the City of London Police alerted nearby St Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts) that \\"a tube train had hit the buffers\\", but there was no indication at that stage of the seriousness of the crash. A small assessment team comprising a casualty officer and a medical student was sent from the hospital; fifteen minutes later a resuscitation unit was sent, although the hospital staff were still unaware of the scale of the problem. The police also contacted the medical unit of British Petroleum (BP) at Britannic House, Finsbury Circus. Dr Donald Dean and a team of two doctors and two nurses walked around to the station to assist, and were the first medical assistance at the scene. After assessing the situation, Dean realised that he did not have enough painkillers with him, or in BP stores, so he went to the Moorgate branch of Boots where the pharmacist gave him the shop's entire supply of morphine and pethidine. The LFB undertook a brief inspection of the site and, once they saw what they were dealing with, the status was updated to a Major Accident event; additional ambulances and fire tenders were soon sent. One of the doctors from Barts later described the scene: The rear of the first carriage, forced into the roof of the tunnel, after the second carriage had been removed > The front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it > the living and the dead were heaped together, intertwined among themselves > and the wreckage. > > It was impossible to estimate the number [of casualties] involved with any > degree of accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all > tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black > dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for > individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main > problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared > to be in imminent danger of suffocation. By around 9:00 am the last casualty had been removed from the third carriage. By 9:30 am Moorgate and many of the surrounding roads had been cordoned off to allow space for the co-ordination teams above ground to manage the flow of vehicles‚Äîparticularly for ambulances taking casualties to hospitals. A message was sent from LFB headquarters to all fire stations in London; it estimated that there were still 50 people trapped and warned that \\"this incident will be protracted\\". To make a clear passage through the wreckage for equipment, the emergency services and injured commuters, a circular route was organised through the carriages. Firemen cut holes in parts of the structure, including in the floors and ceilings of the carriages through which it was possible to move, even if it meant crawling through some areas. At 10:00 am a medical team arrived from the London Hospital and set up a makeshift operating theatre on a platform near the triage team. Platform 9 was underground, and fire and ambulance crews had to carry all the equipment they needed through the station and down to the scene of the accident. The depth at which they were operating, and the shielding effect of the soil and concrete, meant their radios could not get through to the surface. Messages and requests for further supplies were passed by runners, which led to mistakes: one doctor requested further supplies of the pain-killing gas Entonox, but by the time the request reached the surface, it had been garbled to \\"the doctor wants an empty box\\". The LFB deployed a small team with \\"Figaro\\", an experimental radio system that worked in deep locations. Working conditions for the emergency services became increasingly difficult throughout the day. The crash had thrown soot and dirt into the air from the sand drag, and from between the two metal layers of the tube carriages. Everything was covered with a thick layer of the residue which was easily disturbed. The lamps and cutting gear used by the LFB raised the temperature to over and oxygen levels began to drop. In the deep lines at Moorgate, ventilation is created by the piston effect created by trains forcing air through the tube lines. With services stopped since the crash, no fresh air was reaching platforms 9 and 10. A large electric fan was placed at the top of the escalators in an attempt to remedy the situation, but soot and dirt was disturbed and little draught was created; the machine was soon turned off. By 12:00 noon only five live casualties were left to be extracted; by 3:15 pm only two were left: Margaret Liles, a 19-year-old Woman Police Constable (WPC), and Jeff Benton, who worked at the London Stock Exchange. They were in the front part of the first carriage at the time of the crash and ended up trapped together, pinned down under the girders of the carriage's structure. The LFB worked for several hours to release Benton, but it became apparent that Liles needed to be removed first, which could only be done by amputating her left foot. She was finally removed from the wreckage after the procedure at 8.55 pm; Benton was removed at 10:00 pm. As soon as Benton had been removed, all equipment was turned off and silence was ordered among the emergency services. Shouts were made to listen for any people trapped to respond; there were none and the site medical officer declared that all the remaining bodies in the wreckage were dead. During the day mouth-to-mouth resuscitation had been needed to save two people, and two victims died of crush syndrome soon after being released from the wreckage. Benton also died of crush syndrome, in hospital on 27 March 1975, despite initially good progress. AftermathClearing up= Work on removing the bodies and clearing the wreckage from the tunnel began after the last casualty had been removed. With no casualties remaining, the LFB were able to use flame cutting equipment. After the third carriage was cut free from the second, at 1:00 am on 1 March the third carriage began to be winched back down the track; as it began moving a body that no-one had seen fell from the wreckage and onto the track. According to Joseph Milner, the Chief fire officer of the LFB, the body gave \\"the first indication of how protracted would be the work ahead\\". Once the carriage had been removed, a doctor again checked for further signs of living casualties; none were found. Motorman's cab of 1938 rolling stock; the dead man's handle is incorporated in the main controller on the right The use of the flame cutting equipment had a detrimental effect on the atmosphere on the platform. Oxygen levels dropped from the norm of 21 per cent to 16 per cent and the smell of decomposition from the bodies trapped in the wreckage was noticed by workers. Those working on the platform or tunnel were restricted to 20-minute spells working, followed by 40 minutes' recovery time on the surface. All workers had to wear gloves and masks; any cuts had to be reported, and no-one with a cut was allowed to be involved in the extrication of a body. Temperatures improved after a company donated an air conditioning unit, which was installed at ground level, and the air piped down into the tunnel. During 1 and 2 March the wreckage of the second carriage was cut away in sections and winched free; clearance of the carriages continued round the clock until a break was forced by a telephoned bomb scare at 10:00 pm on 2 March, which forced the crews to evacuate the station. The last passenger was removed from the front carriage at 3:20 pm on 4 March, which left only the driver's body. Gordon Hafter, London Underground's chief engineer, and Lieutenant Colonel Ian McNaughton, the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, examined the driver's cab; normally deep, it had been crushed to . They ascertained that Newson was at his controls, although his head had been forced through the front window. Hafter reported his examination about Newson to the subsequent inquiry: > His left hand was close to, but not actually on the driver's brake handle > and his right arm was hanging down to the right of the main controller. His > head was to the left of the dead man's handle which had been forced upwards, > beyond its normal travel, and was resting on his right shoulder. Newson's body was removed at 8:05 pm on 4 March; the LFB cleared the remainder of the wreckage by 5:00 am on 5 March and handed control of the platform back to London Underground. The rescue and clean-up operation involved the efforts of 1,324 firemen, 240 policemen, 80 ambulance men, 16 doctors and several nurses. Services on the line had been suspended on the day of the crash. A shuttle service between Drayton Park and Old Street was used from 1 March 1975 until normal traffic returned on 10 March. =Investigation and inquiry= Keith Simpson, who performed the post-mortem on Motorman Newson The post- mortem was undertaken on Newson by the Home Office pathologist Keith Simpson on 4 March 1975. He found no physical conditions, such as a stroke or heart attack, that would have explained the crash. Initial findings showed no drugs or alcohol in Newson's bloodstream, and there was no evidence of liver damage from heavy drinking. On 7 March 1975 Anthony Crosland, the Secretary of State for the Environment, instructed McNaughton to undertake an investigation of the crash. McNaughton's inquiry began on 13 March and was paused after a day and a half; during that time it was established that the mechanics of the train were in working order and that there were no known problems with Newson's health, although the results of pathological tests were still awaited. McNaughton said he was perplexed as to the causes of the crash, but that he would proceed with the next part of his inquiry, which was to undertake further enquiries and to consider measures so the accident could not be repeated. The coroner's inquest was held between 14 and 18 April 1975. David Paul, the coroner, was unhappy that a government inquiry had already begun, as evidence was in the public domain, and could affect the inquest's jury. 61 witnesses gave evidence. An analysis of Newson's kidneys by the toxicologist Dr Anne Robinson showed his blood alcohol level at the time of the post-mortem was 80 mg/100 ml. Robinson stated that there were several biological processes that produced alcohol in the body after death, and it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of decomposition. She added \\"there are so many unknown factors here that it is difficult to be precise and definite. One has to make a number of assumptions\\", although she stated that it was likely that he had been drinking. 80 mg/100 ml was‚Äîand, as at 2018, still is‚Äîthe legal limit in England for driving. It was the highest reading of four samples taken from Newson's body; the lowest was 20 mg/100 ml. Newson's widow stated that her husband drank spirits only rarely; Paul agreed that it was out of character with all he had heard, and agreed that further tests could be run on Newson's samples. On the final day of the inquiry, Dr Roy Goulding, a specialist in the forensic examination of poisons, stated that while he reached the same results of 80 mg/100 ml, his conclusions differed from Robinson's; Goulding stated that as alcohol was naturally produced in the blood after death, it was not possible to confirm that Newson had been drinking prior to the crash. Several of Newson's colleagues reported that they had no suspicions that Newson had been drinking, and that his behaviour on the morning of the crash was normal. Paul asked Simpson to comment on the findings relating to alcohol levels. He informed the coroner that \\"it is generally accepted that as much as 80 mg/100ml may make its appearance in a decomposing body after four days in a [relatively] high temperature\\". The jury returned verdicts of accidental death. On 19 March a memorial service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, London, attended by 2,000 mourners, including representatives of the emergency services and Newson's widow and family. McNaughton published his report almost a year later, on 4 March 1976. He wrote that tests showed no equipment fault on the train, and that the dead man's handle had no defect. From X-rays it was clear that at the moment of the crash Newson's hand was on the dead man's handle. There were no electrical burns on his skin or clothing to indicate an electrical fault. McNaughton observed that because of the guard Harris's lack of experience, he could not have taken any action to stop the accident from happening, although he thought the young man \\"displayed himself as idle and undisciplined\\". He concluded that \\"the accident was solely due to a lapse on the part of the driver, Motorman Newson\\". Given the inquest findings relating to alcohol in Newson's bloodstream, McNaughton examined the possibility that Newson was drunk. He received expert advice that even if Newson had drunk sufficient alcohol to achieve a blood alcohol level of 80 mg/100 ml, it would not account for the crash. McNaughton also examined the possibility of suicide by Newson, but considered it unlikely, given other indications, including Newson's plans for purchasing a car later in the day and that he had driven the route without error for the preceding 2 hours. McNaughton investigated the possibility that Newson may have been daydreaming or distracted to the point that he did not realise the train was entering Moorgate. McNaughton concluded that as the train went over the scissor crossing before the platform, it would have brought the driver to his senses. It was also likely that Newson would have realised his circumstances before the train hit the wall, and would have thrown his hands up in front of his face in a reflex action. Medical evidence presented to the inquiry raised the possibility that the driver had been affected by conditions such as transient global amnesia or akinesis with mutism, where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically. There was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible because of decomposition, and transient global amnesia leaves no traces. McNaughton's report found that there was insufficient evidence to say if the accident was due to a deliberate act or a medical condition. > I must conclude, therefore, that the cause of this accident lay entirely in > the behaviour of Motorman Newson during the final minute before the accident > occurred. Whether his behaviour was deliberate or whether it was the result > of a suddenly arising physical condition not revealed as a result of post- > mortem examination, there is not sufficient evidence to examine, but I am > satisfied that no part of the responsibility for the accident rests with any > other person and that there was no fault or condition of the train, track or > signalling that in any way contributed to it. Legacy London Underground services into Moorgate on the Northern City Line had previously been scheduled to be replaced by British Rail services from Welwyn Garden City and Hertford; the accident did not change the plan. The last London Underground services on the Northern City Line ran into Moorgate on 4 October 1975 and British Rail services started in August 1976, having previously terminated at Broad Street station. When platform 9 reopened there had been changes introduced to aid drivers. The back wall of the tunnel was painted white and a large, heavy-duty buffer preceded the sand drag. Shortly after the crash, London Underground imposed a speed limit of for all trains entering terminal platforms. Operating instructions were changed so that the protecting signal at terminal platforms was held at danger until trains approaching were travelling slowly, or had been brought to a stop, although this caused delays and operating problems. =Moorgate protection= Train stop equipment Since the death of a driver in 1971, when an empty stock train crashed into buffers in a tunnel siding near Tooting Broadway, London Underground had been introducing speed controls at such locations. By the time of the Moorgate crash, twelve of the nineteen locations had the equipment installed. In July 1978, approval was given for Moorgate protection, Moorgate Control or Trains Entering Terminal Stations (TETS) to be introduced at all dead-end termini on manually driven lines on the Underground system. At Moorgate's platform 9, three timed train stops were installed; the first at the scissors crossing, the second at the start of the platform and the third halfway down the platform. If the train passes any of these at more than the emergency brake is applied. Resistors were placed in the traction supply of trains, to prevent a train accelerating when entering the platform, although the value of these resistors had to be changed after installation. Relays switch the resistors out when the train is permitted to leave. The system was operational in all locations by 1984. =Memorials= In the south-west corner of Finsbury Square, north of Moorgate station, a memorial lists those who died. Measuring , it was unveiled in July 2013 after a long campaign by relatives of the victims and supporters. On 28 February 2014 a memorial plaque was unveiled by Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, on the side of the station building, in Moor Place. =In the media= In 1977 the BBC One programme Red Alert examined whether an accident like Moorgate could happen again. The writer Laurence Marks, whose father died in the disaster, presented Me, My Dad and Moorgate, a Channel 4 documentary broadcast on 4 June 2006; he stated that he believed the crash was due to suicide by Newson. In 2009 the BBC Radio 4 programme In Living Memory examined the causes of the crash, and in 2015 Real Lives Reunited, aired on BBC One, recorded survivors meeting the firemen who cut them from the wreckage.

Stars The polarization of starlight was first observed by the astronomers William Hiltner and John S. Hall in 1949. Subsequently, Jesse Greenstein and Leverett Davis, Jr. developed theories allowing the use of polarization data to trace interstellar magnetic fields. Though the integrated thermal radiation of stars is not usually appreciably polarized at source, scattering by interstellar dust can impose polarization on starlight over long distances. Net polarization at the source can occur if the photosphere itself is asymmetric, due to limb polarization. Plane polarization of starlight generated at the star itself is observed for Ap stars (peculiar A type stars). Sun Both circular and linear polarization of sunlight has been measured. Circular polarization is mainly due to transmission and absorption effects in strongly magnetic regions of the Sun's surface. Another mechanism that gives rise to circular polarization is the so-called \\"alignment-to-orientation mechanism\\". Continuum light is linearly polarized at different locations across the face of the Sun (limb polarization) though taken as a whole, this polarization cancels. Linear polarization in spectral lines is usually created by anisotropic scattering of photons on atoms and ions which can themselves be polarized by this interaction. The linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun is often called the second solar spectrum. Atomic polarization can be modified in weak magnetic fields by the Hanle effect. As a result, polarization of the scattered photons is also modified providing a diagnostics tool for understanding stellar magnetic fields. Other sources The polarization in the quasar 3C 286 measured with ALMA Polarization is also present in radiation from coherent astronomical sources due to the Zeeman effect (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol masers). The large radio lobes in active galaxies and pulsar radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent) also show polarization. Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar magnetic field in our galaxy as well as in radio galaxies via Faraday rotation. In some cases it can be difficult to determine how much of the Faraday rotation is in the external source and how much is local to our own galaxy, but in many cases it is possible to find another distant source nearby in the sky; thus by comparing the candidate source and the reference source, the results can be untangled. Cosmic microwave background The polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is also being used to study the physics of the very early universe. CMB exhibits 2 components of polarization: B-mode (divergence-free like magnetic field) and E-mode (curl-free gradient-only like electric field) polarization. The BICEP2 telescope located at the South Pole helped in the detection of B-mode polarization in the CMB. The polarization modes of the CMB may provide more information about the influence of gravitational waves on the development of the early universe. It has been suggested that astronomical sources of polarised light caused the chirality found in biological molecules on Earth.

Rocklin was a fan of the group before joining them and has previously played as part of Jim James' band. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/the_core_sts9s_alana_rocklin_explores_the_universe_inside/ Relix Social work STS9 has partnered with a variety of non-profit organizations throughout their career. Over the last decade, they have partnered with Conscious Alliance to bring food drives to various concerts and festivals on their tour. In exchange for fan participation in these events, STS9 and Conscious Alliance thank patrons with limited edition artwork posters, often created by the same artists who accompany the band on stage. In 2005, STS9 put on a benefit concert where they raised over $20,000 for Hurricane Katrina victims. Beginning in the fall of 2006, as part of their Live as Time Changes tour, STS9 traveled across the country in a carbon neutral tour bus and powered their live concerts using renewable energy. The band hoped to offset 100%, or about 138,000 pounds, of their carbon dioxide emissions from their tour by donations of Renewable Energy Credits from their partnership with environment-friendly companies. STS9's remix album, Peaceblaster : The New Orleans Make It Right Remixes, features 30 remixes of material from their 2008 album, Peaceblaster. All proceeds from this album went to the Make it Right Foundation, in an effort to build a home in New Orleans, which has since been completed and taken up by a family displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The home has many eco-friendly features, including solar panels, high efficiency HVAC system, wire-free lighting panels, tankless water heater, dual flush toilets, low emissivity windows and doors, a rainwater collection system, and water-absorbing native landscaping. For protection against future storms, the home has walls that can withstand 130 mph winds, Kevlar hurricane shields for the windows, and a roof hatch in case an escape is necessary. Notable concert performances STS9 has gained acclaim, as well as a distinctly loyal fan base over the past decade.

It coordinates all U.S. Government efforts to improve counter-terrorism cooperation with foreign governments and participates in the development, coordination, and implementation of American counterterrorism policy. In June 2007, Ambassador- at-Large Dell Dailey was appointed to be the Coordinator for Counterterrorism. Under Secretary Clinton, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism from 2009 to 2012 was Ambassador-at-Large Daniel Benjamin. He was followed by Tina S. Kaidanow, from 2014 to 2016. The current Coordinator for Counterterrorism is Nathan Sales. Originally the Office for Combating Terrorism and later the Bureau of Counterterrorism, the bureau's name was expanded in 2016 to include countering violent extremism in its mandate. Aims The United States Counterterrorism Policy has four main aims: * to make no concessions to terrorists and strike no deals; * to bring terrorists to justice for their crimes; * to isolate and apply pressure on states that sponsor terrorism to force them to change their behavior; and * to bolster the counter-terrorism capabilities of those countries that work with the U.S. and require assistance. Regarding international terrorism, the U.S. Government will make no concessions to individuals or groups holding official or private U.S. citizens hostage. The United States will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of American citizens held hostage. At the same time, it is U.S. Government policy to deny hostage takers the benefits of ransom, prisoner releases, policy changes, or other acts of concession. History An Office for Combatting Terrorism was created in the State Department in 1972 after the Munich Olympics terrorist attack. Its name and legal authorization has changed a few times, and it was renamed the Bureau of Counterterrorism in 2012.About Us. U.S. State Department Bureau of Counterterrorism. In reaction to the State Department's 2004 proposal to omit terrorism figures from its Report to Congress, Larry C. Johnson stated that the State department was put in charge of coordinating counter-terrorism functions across government agencies by a presidential directive in 1986.Johnson, Larry C. 2005. Terrorism: Why the Numbers Matter.

Founded in 1698 by Thomas Bray, it has worked for over 300 years to increase awareness of the Christian faith in the UK and across the world. The SPCK is the oldest Anglican mission organisation in the world, though it is now more ecumenical in outlook and publishes books for a wide range of Christian denominations. It is currently the leading publisher of Christian books in the United Kingdom and also the third oldest independent publisher in the UK. The SPCK has a vision of a world in which everyone is transformed by Christian knowledge. Its mission is to lead the way in creating books and resources that help everyone to make sense of faith. History Foundation = On 8 March 1698, Revd Thomas Bray met a small group of friends, including Sir Humphrey Mackworth, Colonel Maynard Colchester, Lord Guilford and John Hooke, at Lincoln's Inn. These men were concerned by what they saw as the \\"growth in vice and immorality\\" in Britain at the time which was owing to the \\"gross ignorance of the principles of the Christian religion\\". They were also committed to promoting \\"religion and learning in the plantations abroad\\". They resolved to meet on a regular basis to devise strategies on how they could increase knowledge of Anglican Christianity. They decided that these aims could best be achieved by publishing and distributing Christian literature and encouraging Christian education at all levels. These foundational aims and methods continue to direct the activities of the SPCK today. = Priorities = Education  Unsurprisingly, education has always been a core part of SPCK's mission. One of the key priorities for Thomas Bray and his friends was to build libraries in market towns. In its first two hundred years, the Society founded many charity schools for poor children in the seven to 11 age group. It is from these schools that the modern concept of primary and secondary education has grown. Evidence of the SPCK's impact on British education can still be seen in the many Church of England primary schools you see today. The Society also provided teacher training.  Evangelism overseas  SPCK has worked overseas since its foundation. The initial focus was the British colonies in the Americas. Libraries were established for the use of clergy and their parishioners, and books were frequently shipped across the Atlantic by sail throughout the 18th century. By 1709 SPCK was spreading further afield: a printing press and trained printer were sent to Tranquebar in East India to assist in the production of the first translation of the Bible into Tamil. This was accomplished by the German Lutheran missionaries Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg and from the Danish-Halle Mission. For its time this was a remarkably far-sighted example of ecumenical co-operation. The SPCK has continued to work closely with churches of many different denominations, whilst retaining a special relationship with churches within the Anglican Communion. As the British Empire grew in the 19th century, so SPCK developed an important role in supporting the planting of new churches around the world. Funds were provided for church buildings, for schools, for theological training colleges, and to provide chaplains for the ships taking emigrants to their new homes. Whilst the SPCK supported the logistics of church planting and provided resources for theological learning, by the 19th century the SPCK did not often send missionaries overseas. Instead this sort of work had passed to other organisations, such as its sister society the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (USPG), which was also founded by Thomas Bray. In Ireland the APCK was founded in 1792 to work alongside the Church of Ireland; in south India the Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was established to support the Anglican missions in that region and is affiliated with SPCK.Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; about; accessed 2020-08-26 During the twentieth century SPCK's overseas mission concentrated on providing free study literature for those in a number of ministerial training colleges around the world, especially in Africa. The International Study Guide series were provided, free of charge, to theological training colleges across the world. They can still be purchased from the SPCK website, although the focus of SPCK's Worldwide mission is now on developing the African Theological Network Press.  Supporting the Church of England  From the late 1800s to the early 20th century, SPCK ran a Training College for Lay Workers on Commercial Road in Stepney Green, London. This college was set up to provide a theological education for working-class men, with the aim of better helping clergy to conduct services. It was also anticipated that with a firmer understanding of the Bible, theology and the values of the Anglican church, that these men might be able to instruct their own communities. This college was still handing out medals to graduates in 1908. Throughout the 20th century, the SPCK offered support to ordinands in the Anglican church. These were men in training to become a priest in the Church of England, who had fallen upon hard times and may have otherwise been unable to continue their studies. Today, this support continues through the Richards Trust and the Ordinands Library app.  Supporting the vulnerable  SPCK was involved in tackling a number of social and political issues of the time. It actively campaigned for penal reform, provided for the widows and children of clergy who died whilst overseas and provided basic education for slaves in the Caribbean.  Distribution and bookshops  SPCK's early publications were distributed through a network of supporters who received books and tracts to sell or give away in their own localities. Large quantities of Christian literature were provided for the Navy, and the Society actively encouraged the formation of parish libraries, to help both clergy and laity. By the 19th century, members had organized local district committees, many of which established small book depots‚Äîwhich at one time numbered over four hundred. These were overseen by central committees such as the Committee of General Literature and Education. In 1899 the addresses of their 'depositories' in London were given as Northumberland Avenue, W.C.; Charing Cross, W.C. and 43 Queen Victoria Street, E.C.\\"The Dawn of Day\\", 256th edition Six years later in edition 331 the depository was closed at Charing Cross, but a new one added Brighton: 129, North Street. In the 1930s a centrally co-ordinated network of SPCK Bookshops was established, offering a wide range of books from many different publishers. At its peak, the SPCK bookshop chain consisted of 40 shops in the UK and 20 overseas. The latter were gradually passed into local ownership during the 1960s and 1970s. Holy Trinity Church, Marylebone, Westminster, London is a former Anglican church, built in 1828 by Sir John Soane. By the 1930s, it had fallen into disuse and in 1936 was used by the newly founded Penguin Books company to store books. A children's slide was used to deliver books from the street into the large crypt. In 1937 Penguin moved out to Harmondsworth, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) moved in. It was their headquarters until 2004, when they relocated to London Diocesan House in Causton Street, Pimlico. The bookshop relocated to Tufton Street, Westminster in 2003. On 1 November 2006, St Stephen the Great Charitable Trust [SSG] took over the bookshops but continued to trade under the SPCK name, under licence from SPCK. That licence was withdrawn in October 2007. However, some shops continued trading as SPCK Bookshops without licence until the SSG operation was closed down in 2009.  Publishing  Thomas Bray believed passionately in the power of the printed word. From its earliest days, the SPCK commissioned tracts and pamphlets, making it the third-oldest publishing house in England. (Only the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses have existed longer.) Early member George Sale's translated AlKoran was published in the 1730s and was praised by Voltaire. Throughout the 18th century SPCK was by far the largest producer of Christian literature in Britain. The range of its output was considerable‚Äîfrom pamphlets aimed at specific groups such as farmers, prisoners, soldiers, seamen, servants and slave-owners, to more general works on subjects such as baptism, confirmation, Holy Communion, the Prayer Book, and private devotion. Increasingly, more substantial books were also published, both on Christian subjects and, from the 1830s onwards, on general educational topics as well. Now, the SPCK's publishing team produces around 80 titles per year, for audiences from a wide range of Christian traditions and none. The SPCK publishes under three main imprints: = SPCK = SPCK Publishing is a market leader in the areas of Theology and Christian Spirituality. At present, key authors for SPCK include Anglican New Testament Scholar N. T. Wright, former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, Paula Gooder, and Alister McGrath. Recent exciting additions to SPCK's list include Guvna B, and Ben Cooley, founder of Hope for Justice. SPCK is also increasingly gaining recognition in the secular space in genres such as History and Leadership. SPCK represent authors such as Terry Waite, Melvyn Bragg and Janina Ramirez. = IVP = SPCK merged with Inter-Varsity Press (IVP) in 2015. IVP maintains its own board of trustees and editorial board. Key authors for IVP include John Stott, Don Carson, Amy Orr-Ewing and Emma Scrivener. = Marylebone House = In 2014, SPCK launched its fiction imprint, Marylebone House. Marylebone House publishes a range of contemporary and historical fiction, short stories and clerical crime mysteries, which feature Christian characters and Christian themes.  Assemblies website  As the state increasingly took control of providing primary education throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the SPCK looked for new ways in which it could promote Christian knowledge amongst the youth of Britain. In 1999, the SPCK created the assemblies website. Schools in England and Wales are legally obliged to provide daily collective worship for all of their pupils and this should be of a broadly Christian nature. The aim of the assemblies website is to provide teachers with easy access to free resources, empowering them to deliver high-quality assemblies that give all their pupils to explore faith and their own beliefs. Over the 20 years since it was created, the assemblies website has become a web community, on which experienced teachers and youth leaders can share their ideas, assembly scripts and tips and tricks for delivering engaging assemblies. There are now over 1500 assembly scripts on the website and these are added to every month. Each month, SPCK commissions 16 new assemblies; 8 for primary schools and 8 for secondary schools. In addition to these, 'rapid response' assemblies may be added within 24 hours of momentous world events. Many assemblies focus on Christian themes, but many simply address pastoral issues that come up time and time again within schools. The Festivals of World Religions section also encourages awareness of other religions and enables teachers to celebrate children of other faiths. Every month, the assemblies website attracts over 50,000 unique visitors and the most popular assemblies are viewed over 10,000 times. In 2018, the SPCK also redeveloped its Welsh language offering. There is now a bank of 600 Welsh language assembly scripts that can be easily accessed, viewed and used within Welsh language schools.  Diffusion Prison Fiction  SPCK also owns the imprint Diffusion, which has published 12 titles which were especially commissioned for adults who struggle to read. These titles are divided into two series, Star and Diamond. Star books are written for adults who are new to reading and need to improve their very basic skills, whilst the Diamond series is more appropriate for learners who want to develop their reading confidence further. All of the books are written with engaging plots, suitable for adults, but in a style and typeface that is accessible to people with very basic literacy skills. SPCK provides these books for free to prisons including to individual prisoners, prison libraries and prison reading groups. This is done with the aim of addressing two major causes of re-offending: lack of employment on release and lack of support from family and friends. At the end of each chapter, the Diffusion books contain questions which can be discussed in a reading group, thereby developing verbal communication and social skills. These questions focus on developing empathy by asking questions like \\"what would it feel like to be in that character's position?\\" and encourage self- reflection by asking \\"how does this example apply to my own life?\\". Each book fosters a sense of personal responsibility, and demonstrates that every action has consequences. In these ways, the Diffusion prison fiction programme not only develops hard skills, such as literacy, but also soft skills such as the ability to develop positive personal relationships with others. By the end of 2018, the SPCK had sent Diffusion books to 70% of prisons in the UK. In 2018 alone, it sent out over 6500 books. It is now looking at ways of expanding the programme to reach more vulnerable adults, including refugees and members of the homeless community.  The African Theological Network Press  Together with the Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture, the Jesuit Historical Institute in Africa and Missio Africanus, the SPCK has founded the African Theological Network Press (the ATNP). The aim of the ATNP is to be \\"an ecumenical press serving the church in Africa and the Diaspora through affordable, high-quality, scholarly publications accessible on the continent and globally\\" The ATNP is a centralised commissioning and editorial unit, based in Nairobi. The material will then be distributed across Africa to be printed locally. In this way, the ATNP will overcome the problems of localised publishing, which has the unfortunate consequence that books rarely make it outside of the country in which they are published. The ATNP will also address the dependence of African theological study and teaching on publications from the Global North. Too often, African theology is published in the global North and never returned to Africa, or if it is, it's returned at prices that few African Christians can afford. The ATNP will publish theology, written by Africans on topics that matter to African Christians. The SPCK has always been actively engaged in worldwide mission, but this innovative approach reflects the extraordinary growth of Christianity in Africa. No longer is mission an asymmetrical process of giving and receiving, but a mutually beneficial experience. There is much that Christians in the UK can learn from joyful expression of African Christianity. The SPCK hopes that, by supporting the sustainable development of the ATNP, they will \\"unlock the treasure trove of African Christian thought for Africa and the whole world\\"  Prominent members  * James Catford, Chair of Trustees * Sam Richardson, CEO *Bishop John Pritchard, former Chair of Trustees  SSPCK in Scotland  The Scottish sister society, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), was formed by royal charter in 1709 as a separate organisation with the purpose of founding schools \\"where religion and virtue might be taught to young and old\\" in the Scottish Highlands and other \\"uncivilised\\" areas of the country. It was intended to counter the threat of Catholic missionaries achieving \\"a serious landslide to Rome\\" and of growing Highland Jacobitism. Their schools were a valuable addition to the Church of Scotland programme of education in Scotland, which was based on a tax on landowners to provide a school in every parish. Some‚Äîbut by no means all‚ÄîSociety schoolmasters were inferior in comparison to burgh and parish schools, however, \\"particularly in [their] acquaintance with the Evangelical System\\" rather than more pragmatic literacy, numeracy and teaching ability. The SSPCK had five schools by 1711, 25 by 1715, 176 by 1758 and 189 by 1808, by then with 13,000 pupils attending. At first the SSPCK avoided using the Gaelic language, with the result that pupils ended up learning by rote without understanding what they were reading. SSPCK rules from 1720 required the teaching of literacy and numeracy \\"but not any Latin or Irish\\" (then a common term for Gaelic on both sides of the Irish Sea), and the Society boasted \\"that barbarity and the Irish language ... are almost rooted out\\" by their teaching. Cited in Tanner (2004). In 1753 an act of the Society forbade students \\"either in the schoolhouse or when playing about the doors thereof to speak Erse, under pain of being chastised\\". In 1741 the SSPCK introduced a Gaelic‚ÄìEnglish vocabulary, then in 1767 introduced a New Testament designed with facing pages of Gaelic and English texts for both languages to be read alongside one another, with more success. In 1766 they allowed their Highland schools to use Gaelic alongside English as languages of instruction. In 1790, a Society preacher still insisted that English monolingualism was a Society goal Cited in Tanner (2004). and a decade later Society schools continued to use corporal punishment against students speaking Gaelic. In the early 19th century the Society's activity declined. Its educational work was taken over by the Gaelic Societies of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness.

These abbreviations are not the source of letters in Canadian postal codes, which are assigned by Canada Post on a different basis than these abbreviations. While postal codes are also used for sorting, they allow extensive regional sorting. In addition, several provinces have postal codes that begin with different letters. The codes replaced the inconsistent traditional system used by Canadians until the 1990s. Apart from the postal abbreviations, there are no officially designated traditional (or standard) abbreviations for the provinces. Natural Resources Canada, however, maintains a list of such abbreviations which are recommended for \\"general purpose use\\" and are also used in other official contexts, such as the census conducted by Statistics Canada. Some of the French versions included a hyphen. Nunavut (created in 1999) does not have a designated abbreviation because it did not exist when these codes were phased out, though some can be found in other official works.

Some are from the initials of two of the words in the name of a province or territory, while others are from the first and final letter or from the first and some other letter in the name. All of these names are based on the English form of the name, though they also correspond to their French equivalents in various ways (for example, NT could be read for the first and last letters of Nord-Ouest, instead of Northwest Territories). For Quebec and New Brunswick, the two provinces with large numbers of French speakers, the initials in both languages are identical. French equivalents of each abbreviation once existed: see Traditional abbreviations. =Avoidance of naming overlaps with US= These abbreviations are fully compatible with the equivalent two-letter codes used for states and territorial areas of the United States, because no abbreviations overlap. The policy of not overlapping adjacent-country abbreviations, which helps the postal processing system avoid dealing with naming collisions, precludes use of NV for Nunavut (compare NV for Nevada) and TN for Terre-Neuve/Terra Nova/Newfoundland (compare TN for Tennessee). Manitoba's abbreviation, MB, is due to U.S. states already having abbreviations in all of the letters of the province's name besides \\"B\\". This policy later became a formal agreement between Canada Post and the USPS.S18, ID-tagging of letter mail items. Universal Postal Union. Page vi. Accessed June 2, 2011. The USPS changed the abbreviation for the U.S. state of Nebraska from NB to NE in November 1969 to avoid a conflict with New Brunswick. The Canadian policy of adopting provincial abbreviations that did not overlap with the state abbreviations of adjacent countries differed from the situation in Mexico, where two-letter combinations for Mexican states were chosen by various competing commercial organizations (in the absence of any official Correos de M√©xico list) regardless of whether that combination was already in use in the United States or Canada, e.g., CO (Coahuila/Colorado), MI (Michoac√°n/Michigan), MO (Morelos/Missouri), NL (Nuevo Le√≥n/Newfoundland and Labrador), BC (Baja California/British Columbia). ISO 3166-2, an international standard, offers an alternative with globally unique administrative division identifiers, whose division elements are all between one and three letters long. This is very useful for software and web development, although it may be moot for established postal systems. Its codes for Canada, the U.S., and Mexico are listed at ISO 3166-2:CA, ISO 3166-2:US, and ISO 3166-2:MX, respectively. =Changes over time= Newfoundland and Labrador's postal abbreviation was changed from NF to NL on 21 October 2002, to reflect the provincial name change from \\"Newfoundland\\" to \\"Newfoundland and Labrador\\" on 6 December 2001. In 1991, the code for Quebec was changed from PQ to QC. Nunavut's code became effective 13 December 2000; before this date, but after Nunavut's creation on 1 April 1999, the abbreviation \\"NT\\" was used for Nunavut as well as the Northwest Territories. Canadian postal codes begin with \\"X\\" for both NT and NU, the only two territorial or provincial jurisdictions to share the same initial postal code letter. However, the new code NU was chosen to stem possible confusion and to reflect the new territory's creation.

It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom. Located in the heart of Nottingham City Centre, the square is bounded by Beastmarket Hill to the West, Long Row to the North, and South Parade to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the Council House, which served as Nottingham's town hall until 2010, when the administration moved to the newly acquired Loxley House on Station Street. The nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions. The square is often the scene of local fights and stabbings amongst the young people of the city. History The early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: Long Row West, Long Row, Long Row East, High Street, Poultry, South Parade, Beastmarket Hill, and Angel Row. Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.Thoroton This public square has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the City of Nottingham was formed, the area was the centre-point between the Norman town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old Anglo-Saxon town which was based around the current Lace Market at St. Mary's Church, also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910) The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs. The square was the original setting of Nottingham Goose Fair, an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square. The square was the location of Smith's Bank which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the National Westminster Bank, is still located in the same premises. When the Nottingham Exchange was demolished and the new Nottingham Council House built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as Square One. The Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number of granite slabs in place after the 2007 redesign.Pre 2007Post 2007 There was a mosaic of the city coat of arms in front of the Council House on the square. This fell into a state of dis-repair before the redesign, but was subsequently removed, renovated and installed near the Royal Concert Hall entrance. Construction of the new design cost ¬£17 million. Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007. Historically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civil protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square. One of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by Luddites (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the 4th Duke of Newcastle's mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.Gill Notts History The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are colloquially known as, ‚ÄòNottingham Castle‚Äô or simply, 'the Castle'.A Victorian idea of the design of the Castle. Trophies won by Nottingham Forest Football Club including the European Cup and the FA Cup have all been held aloft in front of crowds here. Nottingham ice dance legends Torvill and Dean also stood on the Council House balcony following their famous Olympic Triumph. In 2004, a memorial service to remember the life of Nottingham Forest's former manager Brian Clough was held there in front of national television cameras and thousands of local football supporters.Civic Tribute A statue of Brian Clough is located just off the square at the junction of King Street and Queen Street.Statue As well as many shops, bars and department stores, the Square is also home to the Nottingham City Transport Travel Centre. The city tourist information centre and the former Angel Row Central Library are also both just near the Square. The Bell Inn, thought to be one of the UK's oldest pubs dating back to around 1276, also sits at the back of the Square. Wheel of Nottingham Ferris wheel in Old Market Square, 2008 Folklore has it that it was in the Market Square where outlaw Robin Hood took advantage of an amnesty and won the coveted silver arrow in a contest devised by the Sheriff of Nottingham. This contest forms the central plot to the Disney version of Robin Hood. The Square has been the focal point of Nottingham's entry to the Britain in Bloom competition in recent years, taking the title four times (1997, 2001, 2003 and 2007). In December every year, the Square hosts a Weihnachtsmarkt (German Christmas Market), and is the centre of local New Year's Eve celebrations. The Nottingham Christmas Lights switch-on event also takes place here. In February 2008, a Ferris wheel was installed in Market Square. The wheel was nicknamed the Nottingham Eye and this name was adopted by the owners, however it was changed to the Wheel of NottinghamWheel of Nottingham after legal pressure from the owners of the London Eye. At 60 metres tall, the wheel provided panoramic views of the city and was the centre piece of Nottingham City Council's \\"Light Night\\".BBC Nottingham ‚Äì Birds Eye view of Nottingham Features One of the stone lions, a popular meeting place Fountains in the redesigned Old Market Square =The Lions= Two large stone lions guard the Council House steps, and they have historically been a popular symbol of the city, with the City Council recently adopting the lion on some of its recent 'Nottingham Proud' campaign posters. The 'Left Lion' has long since been adopted by locals as a meeting place. When Joseph Else FRBS, the Principal of the Nottingham School of Art from 1923 to 1939, sculpted the two lions, they were named \\"Agamemnon and Menelaus\\", after the two brothers from Greek mythology.Names tvNames Post Alternative colloquial names are, \\"Leo and Oscar\\", and sometimes, \\"Lennie and Ronnie\\". =Fountains= At the time of completion in 1929, there was a square area of grass, either side of the processional way at the east end of the square. At the west end was a similar arrangement, but at the centre of each of these two areas of grass, was a circular pool with a single central fountain. During the 1930s, the water was drained from these pools, and instead, plants and flowers were arranged in its place. A similar circular arrangement of plants and flowers was created in each of the two squares of grass at the east end. Around 1940, the grass, flowerbeds and earth at the west end were removed, and the two areas utilized as reservoirs to provide a ready supply of water for use by fire-fighters during the war years. These two reservoirs continued to exist until work started on the provision of the toilets beneath each of them.1946: Nottingham‚Äôs Old Market Square Opening in 1947, to the north, the 'Ladies' on Monday the 25 August, and to the south, the 'Gents' on Thursday the 2 October. As the grass and flowerbeds were re-instated at this time, there were once again four grassed areas each with a circular flowerbed, and additional borders, but no fountains. Subsequently, in the 1960s, the two squares flanking the central processional way at the east end, were rebuilt as two pools with a multiple fountain display in each. These remained until the redesign by Kathryn Gustafson which was completed in 2007, when new fountains and water feature, were added at the west end of the new square.Gustafson Porter + Bowman =Tram stop= On the southern side of the Market Square, along South Parade, is Nottingham Express Transit's Old Market Square tram stop. The two tram lines run in both directions, skirting around the edge of the main square from Market Street in the north west and along South Parade towards Hockley. The Market Square was once at the heart of the city's road network; today it is closed to all traffic except buses along Beast Market Hill and the tram. =Speaker's Corner= On 22 February 2009 Nottingham‚Äôs Speaker's Corner was officially opened by Jack Straw (at the time, UK Justice Secretary). It was the first official Speakers' Corner outside London. It is located on a new extension to the Market Square, which was added at the junction of King Street and Queen Street; with landscaping, planting, and a new memorial to Brian Clough. Due in part to the success of the Nottingham 'Corner', there are new plans for similar projects in Lichfield and Prague.Speakers‚Äô Corner Trust: Nottingham Redesign Old Market Square during redesign Redesigned by Gustafson Porter in 2004 and completed in March 2007, the Old Market Square renovations cost taxpayers around 17 million pounds. Not a single building was erected or demolished; the majority of the money was spent on granite paving stones and is built with three shades of granite. The central open space is a light coloured granite, with white, beige and dark grey granite used for the fountains, terraces and flowerbeds. The final slab prior to the reopening was laid by the Lord Mayor. The new square is a single tier area, including the re-creation of an ancient border which once divided Nottingham. A new water feature dominates the west side of the Square, with jet fountains and waterfalls. The square was designed to host public events and since the opening in 2007 a variety of successful events have been held including concerts and parades, May Day and St George's Day celebrations, cycling events, and a regular local farmers' market.

Examples include non-durable household goods such as packaged foods, beverages, toiletries, candies, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, dry goods, and other consumables. FMCG is the most common acronym in use across most of Europe, Asia, and Oceania, while CPG is used more frequently in the Americas.  Characteristics  The following are the main characteristics of FMCGs: * From the consumer perspective ** Frequent purchases ** Low engagement (little or no effort to choose the item) ** Low prices ** Short shelf life ** Rapid consumption ** Price comparison over online purchase by customer * From the marketer perspective ** High volumes ** Low contribution margins ** Extensive distribution ** High inventory turnover  Rural consumers  Consumers in rural areas typically purchase goods from nearby towns and villages. Recently, there has been a shift in consumer purchase behavior toward purchasing locally that has prompted the need for better local promotional efforts to generate brand awareness in small towns. FMCGs play a large part in the economy, as they are inelastic products that touch every part of consumer life. Businesses that supply FMCGs to a rural community can help provide employment opportunities and drive down the cost of such products in those rural areas. For instance, FMCGs represent the fourth-largest sector in the Indian economy and generate employment for more than three million people in downstream activities.  ISIC definition  The retail market for FMCGs includes businesses in the following International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) (Revision 3) categories:, p.2-4 Supplier industries for FMCGs include:  Fast-moving consumer electronics  Fast-moving consumer electronics are typically low-priced generic items with many comparable alternatives offering similar functionality. Examples of consumer electronics include mobile phones, MP3 players, game players, earphones, headphones, OTG cables and digital disposable cameras.

Skurge, an Asgardian, is originally depicted as a supervillain who wields a magic double-bladed battle axe. Skurge falls in love with the Enchantress and is frequently used in schemes by her and the trickster god Loki. He is a long-time antagonist of Thor and other heroes of the Marvel universe and is a member of the original Masters of Evil. Eventually, he joins the heroes of Asgard in a mission to Hel, where he sacrifices his axe to destroy Naglfar, the ship of the dead, and delays Ragnarok, sacrificing his life to hold the bridge at Gjallarbr√∫ so the heroes can escape the forces of Hel. After a time trapped in Hel, he joins the honored dead in Valhalla. The name was later used by two other characters: an axe-wielding android member of the Crazy Gang and a vigilante named Daniel DuBois, the son of Princess Python. Karl Urban portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Publication history The Executioner first appeared in Journey into Mystery #103 (April 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biographySkurge= Skurge was born in Jotunheim; he is the son of an unnamed Storm Giant and an unnamed Skornheim goddess, making him a half-giant. He later becomes a warrior, gaining the name Executioner after fighting in a war against the Storm Giants. Skurge has always had feelings for Amora, the Enchantress, and regularly aids her in various evil schemes to gain control of Asgard. However, the Enchantress only manipulates him, using her charms to keep Skurge under her thrall. Loki, the trickster god, also has used Skurge many times. In his first appearance, the Executioner teams with the Enchantress to battle Thor at the behest of Loki. He exiles Jane Foster to another dimension and tries to get Thor to surrender his hammer to him in exchange for Jane. Thor agrees to this, but when the Enchantress turns Skurge to a tree for bringing Foster back he releases Thor from the bargain, whereupon Thor returns the two to Asgard.Journey into Mystery #103. Marvel Comics. The Executioner and the Enchantress are exiled to Earth by Odin, where they learn of Zemo from a newspaper. They become members of Baron Heinrich Zemo's original Masters of Evil and fight the Avengers. The Executioner disguises himself as a former aide of Zemo, and lures Captain America to Zemo's kingdom, while the Enchantress uses her powers to turn Thor against the Avengers. Later the Executioner helps Zemo escape from Captain America by knocking out Cap.Avengers #7. Marvel Comics. Skurge remained with Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil for some time. The Masters of Evil created Wonder Man, who was meant to trick and destroy the Avengers. When the Executioner was defeated by Wonder Man testing his power, he worried about controlling him, though Zemo revealed Wonder Man would die within a week unless given an antidote. The gloating Skurge was derided by Wonder Man, who did not like the need for trickery and deceit. The group's plan to kill the Avengers was thwarted by Wonder Man, and Skurge and his allies were defeated.Avengers #9. Marvel Comics. The Executioner menaced Jane Foster, and fought Balder as any ally of Loki.Journey Into Mystery #116-117. Marvel Comics. He was later among the legion of villains assembled by Doctor Doom to destroy the Fantastic Four using a mind-control machine, but due to Mister Fantastic the villains all had their memory of this event erased.Fantastic Four Annual #3. Marvel Comics. Apart from the Enchantress, Skurge attempted to establish an empire by the conquest of an alternate future 25th Century Earth. He battled the Hulk after he was accidentally transported there.Tales to Astonish #76‚Äì77. Marvel Comics. He was reunited with the Enchantress, and joined the Mandarin's attempted world conquest with four other villains after being taken to his base by teleportation technology. He attacked the Asian sub-continent with an army of trolls due to the valuable diamonds that were there, and fought Hercules in another dimension he had transported them to with his axe, but was beaten and thrown at a giant the Enchantress had created to defeat the Scarlet Witch, destroying it.Avengers Annual #1.

Marvel Comics. With the Enchantress, he joined with the forces of Asgard against the legions of the most powerful fire demon Surtur.Thor #350. Marvel Comics. Once Amora the Enchantress set her sights on Heimdall as a potential lover, Skurge sought to ease the wounds of his heart in battle, joining Thor, Balder, and the Einherjar on a rescue mission into Hel. A group of souls belonging to living humans had been trapped there by Malekith the Accursed, and Hela had refused to permit them to return to Midgard (Earth).Thor #360. Marvel Comics. Despite initial misgivings, Thor permitted Skurge to accompany the group. Skurge is tempted by the appearance of Amora, who claims Heimdall had slain her. This was not Amora, but Mordonna, a shape-shifting sorceress in the employ of Hela. The disguise is revealed when Skurge decides to trust Balder more than the desires of his own heart. Hela whisks Mordonna away before Skurge can gain revenge. Naglfar, the ship of the dead, is nearing ready to sail, and Hela promises Skurge a place of honor beside her on it at the battle of Ragnarok. Enraged at being manipulated, Skurge destroys the ship with his axe, forestalling the end of days. The group is pursued out of Hel, and at the bridge Gjallerbru Thor swears to hold the bridge as long as he can so that the souls of the mortals can reach freedom. Seeking redemption for a wasted life, Skurge knocks Thor unconscious, and tells Balder he will take the thunder god's place. Skurge's last request is to ask Balder to promise that Thor and he would drink to the memory of Skurge. Balder consents, and he, the Einherjar and the mortal souls depart Hel with the unconscious Thor. Skurge defends Gjallerbru with the M16 rifles the Einherjar had brought from Earth for the expedition, and does not let a single demon pass. An impressed Hela pays him tribute, saying, \\"He stood alone at Gjallerbru. And that answer is enough.\\" He was eventually overrun and killed by Hela's forces.Thor #362. Marvel Comics. Following his death, he remains in Hel until Thor - currently cursed by Hela so that his bones would become brittle and never heal while simultaneously being immortal - assumes control of the Destroyer and attacks Hela's domain. Skurge attempts to use diplomacy to reach Thor's spirit inside the armor, but is knocked out by Thor. Unknown to all, this is all part of Thor's plan to force her to remove the curse, which she does before the thunder god can destroy Hel. Afterwards, Skurge tells Thor he guessed that Thor was truly in control when the Destroyer spared his life rather than killing him. Thor asks Skurge if there is anything he could do, and Skurge reminds Thor of his promise have a drink in his name as they had promised. Recognizing that Skurge's honor and courage belonged somewhere better, Hela allows him to depart her realm and releases him to Valhalla. Thor and Balder are said to have many drinks to Skurge's name.Thor #382. Marvel Comics. While there, his spirit was summoned from Valhalla by the Grandmaster as a member of his Legion of the Unliving, and he battled Thor.Avengers Annual #16. Marvel Comics. His spirit was freed from Hela's prison when he led the other escaped Einherjar to join an assault on Hela's forces by the Asgardians and New Mutants.New Mutants #85. Marvel Comics. He earned for himself a place in Valhalla, Asgard's place for honored dead. After his death, the Enchantress realized that she truly possessed feelings for Skurge and mourned his demise.Thor #367 and #375. Marvel Comics. The time-travelling villain Zarkko the Tomorrow Man once pulled him and eight other villains out of the Timestream to battle the Thor Corps, but he was defeated.Thor #440. Marvel Comics. Once, Amora gave the Executioner's axe to a mortal man called Brute Benhurst. Thor, believing him Skurge (this second Executioner wore a mask), tried not to fight him until the Executioner hit Kevin Masterson (son of Eric Masterson). Thor recognized hitting a boy as an ignoble thing which Skurge would never do, and defeated the new Executioner. Odin later recruits Skurge to aid Eric Masterson in fighting off the influence of the Bloodaxe, the former weapon that Skurge wielded. Enchantress attempts to attack Yggdrasil in order to free Executioner from Valhalla, although doing so threatens all reality. She is stopped by Thor, Loki, and Balder, who convince her that her actions are dishonoring Skurge's memory.Thor: God-Sized Special #1 (2008). Marvel Comics. Kid Loki disguised himself as Enchantress in order to get Executioner out of Hel so that he can assist the Asgardians of the Galaxy in securing the Nagalfar Beacon.Asgardians of the Galaxy #1-5. Marvel Comics. During the \\"War of the Realms\\" storyline, Executioner and the Asgardians of the Galaxy fought against Malekith the Accursed's forces. Executioner was hit many times by the arrows fired by the Asgardian Angels. Before he died from his injuries, he opened a portal from Heven so that Angela can kill the Queen of Angels.

However, it may be that he was simply in denial about this matter, as Norman Osborn comments that if his mother was Princess Python, then he would like to think he would know and Kate Bishop immediately realizes who she is upon meeting her.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #3. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Skurge possessed the superhuman abilities of a typical male Asgardian. Due to his unique hybrid physiology, with a half Storm-Giant and half Skornheimian pedigree, Skurge's physical strength, stamina and durability were considerably greater than those of the average Asgardian male. He also possessed superhuman visual acuity. Skurge was extremely long-lived, aging at a much slower pace than human beings, though not truly immortal. His body was highly resistant to physical damage, and he was immune to terrestrial diseases, toxins, and some magic. In the event of injury, Skurge's godly lifeforce would allow him to recover with a superhuman rate. Skurge had proficiency at hand-to-hand combat, and mastery of most Asgardian weapons. He would often fight wielding his large, enchanted, double- bladed battle axe that allowed him a number of abilities including cutting rifts into other dimensions and control over fire and ice that he could project at his enemies. Skurge also sometimes wore an enchanted impregnable horned helmet that completely covered his head. In his first appearance, Skurge demonstrated a 'super-human falcon hunting vision', that enabled him to find Jane Foster in a crowd.Journey into Mystery #103. Marvel Comics.

Serving Jaspers were the Crazy Gang which included Executioner. This group of superhumans were based on characters from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. Captain Britain and Saturnyne individually managed to escape this Earth and Jaspers and the Crazy Gang, including Executioner, were killed when Earth-238 was destroyed by Saturnyne's successor, Mandragon. =JLA/Avengers= Executioner is among the villains enthralled by Krona to defend his stronghold.

Biography  She was born in Cheadle, Staffordshire, and lived her entire life there. Mary was the daughter of a solicitor, John Charles Blagg, and France Caroline Foottit. She trained herself in mathematics by reading her brother's textbooks. In 1875 she was sent to a finishing school in Kensington where she studied algebra and German. She later worked as a Sunday school teacher and was the branch secretary of the Girls' Friendly Society. By middle age she became interested in astronomy after attending a university extension course, taught by Mr. J. A. Hardcastle, John Herschel's grandson. Her tutor suggested working in the area of selenography, particularly on the problem of developing a uniform system of lunar nomenclature. (Several major lunar maps of the period had discrepancies in terms of naming the various features.) In 1905 she was appointed by the newly formed International Association of Academies to build a collated list of all of the lunar features. She worked with Mr. S. A. Saunder on this very tedious and lengthy task, and the result was published in 1913. Her work produced a long list of discrepancies that the association would need to resolve. She also performed considerable work on the subject of variable stars, in collaboration with Professor H. H. Turner. These were published in a series of ten articles in the Monthly Notices, in which the professor acknowledged that a large majority of the work had been performed by Mary Blagg. After the publication of several research papers for the Royal Astronomical Society, she was elected as a fellow in 1916, after being nominated by Professor Turner. She was one of five women to be elected simultaneously, the first women to become Fellows of that society. She worked out a Fourier analysis of Bode's Law, which was detailed in Michael Martin Nieto's book \\"The Titius-Bode Law of Planetary Distances.\\" In 1920, she joined the Lunar Commission of the newly formed International Astronomical Union. They tasked her with continuing her work on standardizing the nomenclature. For this task she collaborated with Karl M√ºller (1866‚Äì1942), a retired government official and amateur astronomer. (The crater M√ºller on the Moon was subsequently named after him.) Together they produced a two volume set in 1935, titled Named Lunar Formations, that became the standard reference on the subject. During her life she performed volunteer work, including caring for Belgian refugee children during World War I. One of her favorite hobbies was chess. She was described in her obituary as being of \\"modest and retiring disposition, in fact very much of a recluse\\", and rarely attended meetings.  Honors  The crater Blagg on the Moon is named after her.

The operation was put in place 16 January 2015 and is still ongoing. The operation, originally codenamed Homeland, was significantly strengthened during the year 2015, after the attacks of 13 November, notably through the implementation of absolute emergency in the Brussels area from 21 to 26 November 2015 and after the attacks of 22 March 2016 in Brussels. The deployment of soldiers in the streets in Belgium is an unprecedented event since World War II and a number of violent events in the 1980s. Objectives This military operation, in collaboration with the police, decided by the Belgian government, aims to secure \\"sensitive\\" locations to deal with the terrorist threat in crowded public places (stations, shopping centers, squares), places of worship, transportation (subways, trains, stations, airports), government institutions (European institutions, embassies, parliaments), schools, universities, hospitals, ports, nuclear power plants, and international borders. Forces engaged At the beginning of the operation only 150 military members were mobilized, the number of personnel has steadily increased to reach the figure of 1,828 soldiers mobilized by October 2016.; Transaction costs For the year 2015 (beginning of the operation Saturday, January 17, 2015), the cost of deployment of the military in street amounted to 17.15 million euros. In 2016, only for the first trismestre, the cost was 12.01 million. For the second quarter, specifically from 1 st April to 2 July, the amount is expected to reach 22.05 million euros, according to government estimates. The rising costs of Operation Vigilant Guardian is explained, according to the Interior Ministry, the fact that the number of personnel has increased steadily since 2015. Incidents June 20, 2017, a man enters the enclosure of the Brussels Central Station and tries to perpetrate a terrorist attack. The perpetrator, called Osama Z, will be killed by soldiers mobilized as part of Operation Vigilant Guardian, thwarting an attack. This neutralization, in addition to saving aspect, reports of an exceptional nature, this is the first time since the Second World War that a soldier kills someone on the Belgian territory. On 26 August 2017, a man was shot in the center of Brussels on the Boulevard √âmile Jacqmain, after attacking with a knife military patrol, wounding one of them 9 . The federal prosecutor calls the terrorist attack aggression. It is claimed the next day by Daesh . A few days after the attack on 28 August 2017, the General Staff of the army Marc Thys, announced that the military should continue their patrols on the street, at least until 2020. Foreign equivalent The Vigilant Guardian transaction is directly inspired by the French military operation called Operation Sentinel implementation in the hexagon after the wave of attacks that hit France in January 2015. *Operation Temperer is the British Army equivalent operation. *Operation Banner was the British Armed Forces' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007, as part of the Troubles.

Felice Bryant (born Matilda Genevieve Scaduto; August 7, 1925 ‚Äì April 22, 2003) and Diadorius Boudleaux Bryant (; February 13, 1920 ‚Äì June 25, 1987) were an American husband and wife country music and pop songwriting team. They were best known for songs such as \\"Rocky Top,\\" \\"We Could\\" (credited solely to Felice), \\"Love Hurts\\" (credited solely to Boudleaux), and numerous hits by the Everly Brothers, including \\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\\" (credited solely to Boudleaux), \\"Bye Bye Love\\", and \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\". Beginnings Boudleaux Bryant was born in Shellman, Georgia in 1920 and attended local schools as a child. He trained as a classical violinist. Although he performed with the Atlanta Philharmonic Orchestra during its 1937‚Äì38 season, he had more interest in country fiddling. Bryant joined Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys, an Atlanta-based western music band. In 1945, Bryant met Matilda Genevieve Scaduto (whom he called Felice) when he performed at a hotel in her hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was born in the city in 1925 to an ethnic Italian family, and had written lyrics set to traditional Italian tunes. During World War II, she sang and directed shows at the local USO.\\"Felice Bryant\\", Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed 24 June 2016 Bryant and Scaduto eloped two days after meeting. Boudleaux's song \\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\\" is \\"autobiographical\\" for Felice. She was working as an elevator operator at the Schroeder Hotel when she saw Bryant. She has said that she \\"recognized\\" him immediately; she had seen his face in a dream when she was eight years old, and had \\"looked for him forever.\\" She was 19 when they met. Songwriting career During the first years of their marriage, the Bryants struggled financially, living in a mobile home, where they wrote more than 80 songs. They tried to sell their compositions to a number of country music artists but were either ignored or rejected until Little Jimmy Dickens recorded their song \\"Country Boy.\\" It went to #7 on the country charts in 1948 and opened the door to a working relationship with Fred Rose at Acuff-Rose Music in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1950, the Bryants moved to Nashville to work full-time at songwriting. Some of their compositions from the early 1950s included the swinging \\"Sugar Beet\\" (recorded by Moon Mullican) and the bluesy \\"Midnight\\" (recorded by Red Foley). The Bryants wrote more songs for Dickens as well as for country artist Carl Smith. At the same time, they released four 45-rpm singles of their own to modest success. Beginning in 1957, the Bryants came to national prominence in both country and pop music when they wrote a string of very successful songs for the Everly Brothers and hits for other singers such as Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly. Their compositions were recorded by many artists from a variety of musical genres, including Lynn Anderson, Tony Bennett, Frankie Laine, Sonny James, Eddy Arnold, Bob Moore, Charley Pride, Nazareth, Jim Reeves, Leo Sayer, Jerry Lee Lewis, Simon & Garfunkel, Sarah Vaughan, The Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello, Count Basie, Dean Martin, Ray Charles, Gram Parsons, Joan Jett, and Bob Dylan. (Dylan's Self Portrait album has a song by Boudleaux and another he co-wrote with Felice.) The Bryants wrote hits for many artists. In 1962, The Bryants wrote \\"Too Many Chicks,\\" a song that became a hit for Leona Douglas, the first African-American woman to record as a country music singer. The Bryants eventually moved to a house not far from Nashville on Old Hickory Lake in Hendersonville, Tennessee, near friends Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash. In 1978, they moved to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. They had often stayed at The Gatlinburg Inn, where they wrote numerous songs, including \\"Rocky Top.\\" They purchased the Rocky Top Village Inn in the town next to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. In 1979, they released their own album called A Touch of Bryant. \\"Rocky Top\\", written in 1967, was adopted as a state song by Tennessee in 1982, and as the unofficial fight song for the University of Tennessee sports teams. The Bryants wrote more than 6,000 songs, some 1,500 of which were recorded. During their career, the Bryants earned 59 BMI country, pop, and R&B; music awards. In 1972, they were inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, in 1986 into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1991 into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Boudleaux Bryant is the third most successful songwriter of the 1950s on the UK Singles Chart, and Felice Bryant is the 21st. Their works, the House of Bryant, is located in Gatlinburg. From September 2019 to August 2020, their artifacts are on exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. Deaths Boudleaux Bryant died in 1987.

Services on routes from Bissau to external destinations like Dakar, Ilha do Sal and Praia were inaugurated not long after foundation. A de Havilland Heron and two de Havilland Dragon Rapides were operating on the routes by 1961. By 1968 the airline was operating two de Havilland Herons, three Dornier Do 27s, one Cessna 206, one Cessna 172 and one Auster. The Portuguese national airline, TAP took over some TAGP flights, operating them with Boeing aircraft instead of with TAGP's Cessnas. TAP operated from Ilha do Sal to Bissau with the Boeings, and TAGP would operate the return flight with its light aircraft. When Portuguese Guinea gained independence from Portugal in 1974 and renamed Guinea-Bissau, the airline was also renamed to Linhas A√©reas da Guin√©-Bissau. The company was operating one HS-748, one Dornier Do 27 and a Cessna 206 at that time. By the mid 1980s the airline would be owned by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which at the time owned Maldives Airways as well. The name of the airline was changed to Transportes A√©reos da Guin√©- Bissau (TAGB). It operated services to Senegal, Cape Verde, The Gambia and Guinea, in addition to domestic services from Bissau to Bubaque. In 1988, a service from Bissau to Paris was inaugurated, as a joint-service with French airline Europe A√©ro Service, operated with a Boeing 727 from the latter. The name of the airline was changed to Air Bissau, its final name, in 1989. A Fokker F27 of the airline crashed near Dori in Burkina Faso on 15 August 1991, killing the three Palestinian crew members on board. The aircraft which was on a flight from Kano in Nigeria to Bamako, Mali struck trees and then crashed and broke up. The crash highlighted the role of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in the operations of Air Bissau, which reportedly supplied the airline with three Fokker F27s and which were operated by Palestinian crews. According to Flight International this role had been codified by an agreement between the PLO and Guinea-Bissau in 1988, which according to Daniel Pipes saw George Khallaq buying part equity in the airline from the government of Guinea-Bissau. The airline also operated an Antonov An-24, and it was this aircraft which crashed on 7 April 1992 near Ma'tan as-Sarra in Libya. The aircraft was on a flight from Khartoum, Sudan to Tunis, Tunisia, when it encountered a sandstorm in the Sahara Desert, forcing the Palestinian crew to attempt an emergency landing at Maaten al-Sarra Air Base. According to Libyan radio reports the aircraft vanished 15 minutes before reaching the base. The aircraft was carrying PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and an entourage of bodyguards and assistants. The aircraft was found by the Libyan Air Force almost 12 hours after the crash, where it was confirmed the three crew were killed, and all ten passengers, including Arafat, survived. It was reported that by 1996 all of the aircraft in the fleet were either sold or written off, and the government was planning to privatise the airline. All flights of the airline were being operated as joint services with other airlines, utilising their aircraft. Air Bissau was operating a joint-weekly service from Bissau to Lisbon with a Boeing 757 operated by Transportes A√©reos de Cabo Verde, and a weekly service from Bissau to Dakar, again in conjunction with the Cape Verde national airline, utilising one of its ATR 42s. The airline was liquidated in 1998, when the Guinea-Bissau government contracted all services to TACV of Cape Verde.

Mohun began his stage career as a boy player filling female roles; he was part of Christopher Beeston's theatrical establishment at the Cockpit Theatre, \\"eventually becoming a key member of Queen Henrietta's Men.\\"Deborah C. Payne, \\"Patronage and the Dramatic Marketplace Under Charles I and II,\\" in Brown, p. 166. For the period from 1642 to 1659, Mohun was an officer in military units loyal to the House of Stuart; he served in England, Ireland, and the Low Countries, and rose to the rank of major. He was seriously wounded at Dublin, and was a prisoner of war for two extended periods.Astington, p. 4. At the end of the English Interregnum, Mohun was one of the men -- George Jolly and John Rhodes were others -- who attempted to restart dramatic performance. In 1659 Mohun performed with other pre-Commonwealth actors in an unlicensed troupe at the Red Bull Theatre. As the manager of the troupe, Mohun came to an agreement with the Master of the Revels to pay fees for the privilege of performing; but eventually, like Jolly and Rhodes, he was out-manoeuvred by Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant. After a complex power struggle for the two company patents issued by Charles II at the Restoration of the monarchy, Mohun became a full sharer in Killigrew's King's Company. Along with Charles Hart, the other leading male actor, Mohun was in a position of some authority, often signing official papers on behalf of the sharing actors. He remained a member of the King's Company until he left the stage on account of age and ill-health in the late 1670s. Mohun regularly acted leading and major roles, mostly villains. His interpretations of Iago and of the title role in Ben Jonson's Volpone were famous, and he brought a sinister edge to the part of Pinchwife in William Wycherley's The Country Wife. Mohun repeatedly seconded Charles Hart's leads, playing Iago to Hart's Othello, and Cassius to Hart's Brutus. Mohun compiled a long list of noteworthy other roles in his career.Nunzeger, p. 253. He played Bellamente in Shirley's Love's Cruelty both before 1642 and after 1660, and he acted in other revivals besides those named above. He played: * Face in The Alchemist * Truewit in Epicene * Leontius in The Humorous Lieutenant * Don Leon in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife * Melantius in The Maid's Tragedy * Mardonius in A King and No King * Aubrey in Rollo Duke of Normandy. He took roles in contemporary Restoration dramas, by John Dryden -- * Maximin in Tyrannick Love * Ventidius in All for Love * Rhodophil in Marriage √† la mode * the Old Emperor in Aureng-zebe * Beaumont in Amboyna * Philocles in The Maiden Queen * Belamy in An Evening's Love * the Emperor in The Indian Emperour * the Duke of Mantua in The Assignation -- and by other playwrights: * Pinchwife in Wycherly's The Country Wife * Clytus in Nathaniel Lee's The Rival Queens * Britannicus in Lee's The Tragedy of Nero * Hannibal in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow * Mythridates in Lee's Mythridates, King of Pontus * Lord Burleigh in John Banks's The Unhappy Favourite * Matthias in John Crowne's The Destruction of Jerusalem * Breakbond in Edward Howard's The Man of Newmarket * King Edward III in The Black Prince by Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. Mohun retired from the stage in 1682, when the King's Company joined with the Duke's Company to form the United Company. He had trouble obtaining his pension; his petition to King Charles II on the subject is valuable for the amount of autobiographical material it contains.Nunzeger, p. 254.

Description and location The Headington Shark in 2009, after refurbishment. The shark first appeared on 9 August 1986, having been commissioned by the house's owner Bill Heine, a local radio presenter. The sculpture, which is reported to weigh and is long, and is made of painted fibreglass, is named Untitled 1986 (written on the gate of the house). It took three months to build. The sculpture was erected on the 41st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. It was designed by sculptor John Buckley and constructed by Anton Castiau, a local carpenter and friend of Buckley. Heine said \\"The shark was to express someone feeling totally impotent and ripping a hole in their roof out of a sense of impotence and anger and desperation... It is saying something about CND, nuclear power, Chernobyl and Nagasaki\\". The structure is in deliberate contrast with its otherwise ordinary suburban setting. For the occasion of the shark's 21st anniversary in August 2007, it was renovated by the sculptor, following earlier complaints about the condition of the sculpture and the house. On 26 August 2016 Heine's son Magnus Hanson-Heine bought the house in order to preserve the Shark.\\"Why I snapped up the Headington shark house\\", Guardian, 12 March 2017 The property has been run as an AirBnB guesthouse since 2018. Controversy Created by sculptor John Buckley, the shark was controversial when it first appeared. Oxford City Council tried to have it taken down on grounds of safety, and then on the grounds that it had not given planning permission for the shark, offering to host it at the local swimming pool instead, but there was much local support for the shark. Eventually the matter was taken to the central government, where Tony Baldry, a minister in the Department of the Environment, who assessed the case on planning grounds, ruled in 1992 that the shark would be allowed to remain as it did not result in harm to the visual amenity. Media appearances Throughout the early 1990s, updates on the controversy surrounding the shark were regularly featured on As It Happens, an interview show on CBC Radio. The unexpected shark appeared in a 2002 newspaper advertising campaign for a new financial advice service offered by Freeserve. The advertisement, designed by M&C; Saatchi, featured a photograph of the house with the caption \\"Freedom to find the mortgage that's right for you\\". Heine wrote a short book about the shark, which was published in 2011. In 2013, the sculpture was the subject of an April Fools' Day story in the Oxford Mail, which announced the establishment of a fictitious ¬£200,000 fund by Oxford City Council to support the creation of similar sculptures on the roofs of other homes in the area. In 2015, the sculpture was featured in the Channel 4 programme Damned Designs, which focuses on properties that have not followed planning permission. During 2019, it was also featured in a YouTube Video by the British group, the Sidemen. It appeared during their $10,000 vs. $100 Road Trip video.

It took place around Cer Mountain and several surrounding villages, as well as the town of ≈†abac. The battle, part of the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia, began on the night of 15 August when elements of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered Austro-Hungarian outposts that had been established on the slopes of Cer Mountain earlier in the invasion. The clashes that followed escalated into a battle for control over several towns and villages near the mountain, especially ≈†abac. On 19 August, the morale of the Austro-Hungarians collapsed and thousands of soldiers retreated back into Austria-Hungary, many of them drowning in the Drina River as they fled in panic. On 24 August the Serbs re- entered ≈†abac, marking the end of the battle. Serbian casualties after nearly ten days of fighting were 3,000‚Äì5,000 killed and 15,000 wounded. Those of the Austro-Hungarians were significantly higher, with 6,000‚Äì10,000 soldiers killed, 30,000 wounded and 4,500 taken as prisoners of war. The Serbian victory over the Austro-Hungarians marked the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the opening days of the First World War, and the first aerial dogfight of the war took place during the battle. Background Relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorated in the aftermath of the May Overthrow in 1903. Almost immediately, the new Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá government aligned itself with the Russian Empire and oriented its foreign policy away from its long time patron, the Habsburgs, and Austria-Hungary. In 1906, Austria-Hungary closed its border to Serbian agricultural exports in an episode known as the Pig War. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina‚Äîa territory with a large Serb population that it had been granted by the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The annexation prompted the Serbian public to call for war with Austria-Hungary. With no promise of Russian support in the event of war, the Serbian government decided against pursuing the matter militarily. Count Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf boasted that it would take Austro-Hungary only three months to defeat Serbia should war erupt between the two nations. The Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia was commanded by General alt=A male with a moustache wearing medals and a military uniform. With Bosnia-Herzegovina firmly in Austro-Hungarian hands, Serbia and several other Balkan states turned to forcing the Ottoman Empire from southeastern Europe. The ensuing Balkan Wars, which lasted from 1912 until 1913, saw Serbia take possession of Kosovo and Macedonia. On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The assassination precipitated the July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary to issue an ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers in order to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of the First World War. Fighting in Eastern Europe began with the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia in early August 1914. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because a large portion of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. Forty percent of this force was composed of South Slavs living within Austro-Hungarian borders. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and U≈æice Armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbian army was dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish its ammunition stocks. Its supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many Serbian recruits reported for duty barefoot, and many units lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a ≈°ajkaƒça. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians: many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro- Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry. Austro-Hungarian forces assigned to the invasion were placed under the command of General Oskar Potiorek, who had been responsible for the security detail of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Prior to the battle, Potiorek had predicted an easy victory over the Serbians, calling them \\"pig farmers.\\" The Serbian army was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, with the Chief of the General Staff, Field Marshal Radomir Putnik, who had commanded Serb forces in the Balkan Wars, as his deputy and de facto military leader. Generals Petar Bojoviƒá, Stepa Stepanoviƒá and Pavle Juri≈°iƒá ≈†turm commanded the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Serbian Armies, respectively. BattlePrelude= Mobilized Austro- Hungarian troops sent across Sarajevo for Serbia. From 29 July to 11 August, the Austro-Hungarian army launched a series of artillery attacks in northern and northwestern Serbia and subsequently managed to exploit the bombardments by constructing a system of pontoon bridges across the Sava and Drina rivers. The Serbians knew that it was impossible for their forces to line the entirety of the Austro‚ÄìSerbian border, which extended . Putnik therefore ordered the Serbian army to fall back on a traditional line of defence as he grouped the bulk of his forces in ≈†umadija, from where they could rapidly move either north or west. Strong detachments were posted in the towns of Valjevo and U≈æice, and outposts were stationed at every important point on the frontier. At this stage, all the Serbian General Staff could do was wait until the Austro-Hungarian invasion plan materialized. Belgrade, Smederevo and Veliko Gradi≈°te continued to be subjected to more vigorous artillery bombardments, and a number of failed attempts to cross the Danube resulted in heavy Austro- Hungarian losses. The bulk of the Austro-Hungarian forces were stationed in Bosnia, and the Serbian General Staff were not misled by these feints on the Danube. Subsequently, the Austro-Hungarians attempted to cross the Drina at Ljubovija and the Sava at ≈†abac, and these attacks were seen as more significant. On 12 August, Austro-Hungarian troops entered Serbia through the town of Loznica, crossing the Drina. There, and in the village of Le≈°nica, the Austro-Hungarian 13th Army Corps made a crossing, while on the same day the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army Corps crossed the Sava to the north of ≈†abac, while other Austro-Hungarian troops crossed the Drina. The town of ≈†abac was quickly taken. By 14 August, over a front of about , the Austro-Hungarians had crossed the rivers and converged on Valjevo. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd and 5th Armies moved towards Belgrade, where they encountered the Serbian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies. On 15 August, Putnik ordered his forces into counterattack. =Combat= Around 23:00 on 15 August, elements of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts set up by the invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divaƒça Range and dislodged the Austro- Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro- Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in ≈†abac. On 17 August, the Serbs attempted to retake ≈†abac, but their efforts failed. The 1st Combined Division attacked the villages of Trojan and Parlog before moving on towards the small town of Kosanin Grad. Elsewhere, the Austro-Hungarians succeeded in repulsing the Serbian 3rd Army, forcing it to manoeuvre one of its divisions to protect the approach to the town of Valjevo, which was threatened by the 42nd Mountain Division. In the early morning of 18 August, the Austro-Hungarians launched another attack, with the intention of pushing the 1st ≈†umadija Division off the ≈†abac bridgehead to allow the 5th Army to advance. However, the attack failed as the Serbs defeated the Austro- Hungarians at the Dobrava River, forcing their surviving soldiers to withdraw. Elsewhere, the Serbian 2nd Army's counter-offensive continued along the Cer and Iverak, with the 1st Combined Division attacking the village of Ra≈°ulijaƒça and coming under severe pressure at Kosanin Grad. The first Serbian assault was fought off, but a wave of further attacks followed throughout the night. In the early morning of 19 August, the Serbs finally defeated the Austro- Hungarians and seized the small town. The 1st Morava Division drove the 9th Infantry Division from its position and fought off the division's subsequent counterattack, inflicting heavy losses. The 4th Corps renewed its attack against the ≈†umadija Division, forcing the Serbs to withdraw having only sustained light casualties. Because the 4th Corps did not break the Serbs, the Austro-Hungarian division was unable to alter the direction of its advance towards Cer Mountain, since doing so would have put the ≈†umadija Division in a position to attack the 4th Corps from the rear. As a result, the 4th Corps was unable to join other Austro-Hungarian forces fighting at Cer. alt=A valley, mountain and forests photographed from the side of a road. The Serbs retook Ra≈°ulijaƒça at noon, and the 1st Combined Division exploited this to advance towards Le≈°nica. Meanwhile, the 1st Morava Division attacked Iverak and managed to drive the Austro-Hungarians back. The village of Velika Glava fell to the Serbs before mid-day, and by the late afternoon the Rajin Grob ridge had been retaken. At around this time, the Austro-Hungarians began retreating with increasing rapidity, their will and cohesion apparently shattered. The 3rd Army had similar success, routing the 36th Infantry Division and forcing it to retreat in considerable disorder. The Serbs then moved to pursue the fleeing Austro-Hungarians all along the front. By 20 August, Austro-Hungarian forces were fleeing across the Drina River, still being pursued by the Serbs back into Bosnia, with the entire 5th Army being forced across the Austro- Hungarian side of the river. Many Austro-Hungarian soldiers drowned in the water as they fled in panic. Serbian military reports announced that \\"the enemy is withdrawing in the greatest disorder.\\" Putnik then notified King Peter in a telegram, saying \\"the main enemy has been defeated in Jadar and on Mount Cer, and our troops are in hot pursuit.\\" Upon their triumph at Cer Mountain, the Serbs sought to recapture the heavily fortified town of ≈†abac. Violent clashes occurred on 21 and 22 August, during which Serb forces fought their way to the western approaches of the town. By 23 August, the Serbs had encircled the town and that evening they brought up their siege artillery. On 24 August, Serbian forces entered ≈†abac and discovered that the Austro- Hungarians had decamped the previous night. By 16:00, the Serbs reached the banks of the Sava River, bringing the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia to an end. Casualties Both sides suffered heavy casualties in the battles. Estimates of the number of Austro-Hungarian casualties vary. Jordan states that the Austro-Hungarians suffered a total of 37,000 casualties in the battle, of whom 7,000 were fatalities. Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000‚Äì10,000 were killed. Horne writes that the Austro-Hungarians had 8,000 soldiers killed and 30,000 wounded in the battle, compounded by the loss of 46 guns, 30 machine guns and 140 ammunition wagons. Historian David Stevenson states that 4,500 Austro- Hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner. Estimates of the number of Serbian casualties also vary. Horne and Jordan both agree that approximately 3,000 Serbian soldiers were killed and 15,000 were wounded in the battle. Glenny counters that 3,000‚Äì5,000 Serb soldiers were killed in the battle. Nevertheless, the number of fatalities suffered by both sides heralded the massive cost in human lives of the First World War. French journalist Henry Barby reported: Atrocities were committed by both the Austro-Hungarians and Serbs, although, according to author Lawrence Sondhaus, the majority were committed by the Austro-Hungarians. The Austro-Hungarians charged Serb civilians with mutilating Austro-Hungarian soldiers, while undisciplined Austro-Hungarian troops summarily executed hundreds of Serb men and raped and murdered numerous women and children during the battle, which Sondhaus ascribes to their hatred towards Serbs for starting the war. Many of those murdered by the Austro-Hungarians were the victims of fellow South Slavs (Croats and Bosnian Muslims) serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. Serbian commanders noted that the Austro-Hungarians had committed numerous reprisal killings over the course of the battle. General Pavle Juri≈°iƒá ≈†turm recounted: Legacy alt=A large stone monument topped by an eagle. Although they succeeded in repelling the Austro-Hungarian attack, the Serbs used up much of their ammunition during the battle, needing 6.5 million cartridges and 35,000 shells to prevail. The commander of the Serbian 2nd Army, General Stepa Stepanoviƒá, was promoted to the rank of field marshal (, ) for his successful command. In contrast, Austro-Hungarian commander Oskar Potiorek was humiliated in defeat and determined to launch a second invasion of Serbia. In September, he was given permission to launch such an invasion provided that he \\"not risk anything that might lead to a further fiasco.\\" Defeat at Cer Mountain also affected the morale of the Austro-Hungarian troops. The first aerial dogfight of the war occurred during the battle, when Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomiƒá encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over enemy positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot fired at Tomiƒá with his revolver. Tomiƒá managed to escape, and, within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns. The battle was the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the First World War. Serbia's triumph on the battlefield drew worldwide attention to the country and won the Serbs sympathy from both neutral and Allied countries. A number of foreigners flocked to Serbia in late 1914, offering financial, political, humanitarian and military aid. Articles in defence of Serbia became more frequent in the British press. Certain cultural circles in Italy advocated entering the war on the Allied side, citing Serbian and Montenegrin battlefield successes. The Serbian patriotic song March on the Drina was written by Serbian composer Stanislav Biniƒçki shortly after the battle to commemorate the victory. Biniƒçki dedicated the march to his favourite commander in the army, Colonel Milivoje Stojanoviƒá, who was killed during the fighting. A Yugoslav war film also titled March on the Drina was released in 1964 and is loosely based on the battle.

The rank scale is used for specifying posts within NATO. Definitions NATO maintains a \\"standard rank scale\\" in an attempt to match every member country's military rank to corresponding ranks used by the other members. The rank categories were established, in 1978, in the document STANAG 2116, formally titled NATO Codes for Grades of Military Personnel. There are two scales, though not all member countries use all the points on the NATO scales and some have more than one rank at some points (e.g. many forces have two ranks at OF-1, usually lieutenants): =Officer ranks= * OF1‚ÄìOF10 (bottom to top) are used for commissioned officers (\\"officer / officier\\"). =Warrant officers= * Most countries do not have an intermediate tier of ranks between Officers and Other Ranks (see below). The exception is the United States, and the NATO warrant officer grades of WO1‚ÄìWO5 (bottom to top) are used only for warrant officer ranks of the US military. In other countries with \\"Warrant Officer\\" ranks, they are considered part of Other Ranks. (For example a British Army WO1 has the NATO code OR-9.) =Other ranks= * OR1‚ÄìOR9 (bottom to top) are used for all Other Ranks (\\"other ranks/sous-officiers et militaires du rang\\"), including non-commissioned officers and privates. Comparison to other systems The numbers in the system broadly correspond to the US military pay grade system, with OR-x replacing E-x and WO-x replacing W-x. The main difference is in the commissioned officer ranks, where the US system recognises two ranks at OF-1 level (O-1 and O-2), meaning that all O-x numbers after O-1 are one point higher on the US scale than they are on the NATO scale (e.g. a major is OF-3 on the NATO scale and O-4 on the US scale). ;Officer { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !US DoD Pay Grade ! colspan=2 Special ! colspan=2 O-10 ! colspan=2 O-9 ! colspan=2 O-8 ! colspan=2 O-7 ! colspan=2 O-6 ! colspan=2 O-5 ! colspan=2 O-4 ! colspan=2 O-3 !

It takes its title from its incipit: {  : Vexilla regis prodeunt, : fulget crucis mysterium, : quo carne carnis conditor : suspensus est patibulo.  : The Banners of the King issue forth, : the mystery of the Cross does gleam, : where the Creator of flesh, in the flesh, : from the cross-bar is hung. } History The hymn was first sung in the procession (November 19, 569) when a relic of the True Cross, sent by the Byzantine Emperor Justin II from the East at the request of St. Radegunda, was carried in great pomp from Tours to her monastery of Saint-Croix at Poitiers. Its original processional use is commemorated in the Roman Missal on Good Friday, when the Blessed Sacrament is carried in procession from the Repository to the High Altar. Its principal use however, is in the Divine Office, the Roman Breviary assigning it to Vespers from the Saturday before Passion Sunday daily to Maundy Thursday, and to Vespers of feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14), and in pre-Vatican II breviary also for the feast of the Finding (May 3), and of the Triumph of the Holy Cross (July 16). Textual variations Originally the hymn comprised eight stanzas. In the tenth century, stanzas 7 and 8 were gradually replaced by new ones (O crux ave, spes unica, and the doxology, Te summa Deus trinitas), although they were still retained in some places. In the seventeenth century the correctors of the Breviary under Urban VIII revised the whole hymn in the interest of classical prosody. The Commission on Plain Chant under Pius X restored the ancient form of the text. The Graduale Romanum (1908) gives only the ancient form of the hymn, while the Antiphonary (2012) gives only the revised form. The Processionale (1911) gives both forms.History of Vexilla Regis Prodeunt on Catholic Encyclopedia Original text (strophes 1, 6 & 7) { Original Latin text on ChoralWiki style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"The Royal Banner forward goes, The mystic Cross refulgent glows: Where He, in Flesh, flesh who made, Upon the Tree of pain is laid.

Blest Trinity, salvation's spring, May every soul Thy praises sing; To those Thou grantest conquest By the holy Cross, rewards apply. Amen. } \\"Vexilla\\" has been interpreted symbolically to represent baptism, the Eucharist, and the other sacraments. Clichtoveus explains that as vexilla are the military standards of kings and princes, so the vexilla of Christ are the cross, the scourge, the lance, and the other instruments of the Passion \\"with which He fought against the old enemy and cast forth the prince of this world\\". Johann Wilhelm Kayser dissents from both, and shows that the vexillum is the cross which (instead of the eagle) surmounted, under Constantine, the old Roman cavalry standard. This standard became in Christian hands a square piece of cloth hanging from a bar placed across a gilt pole, and having embroidered on it Christian symbols instead of the old Roman devices. The splendour and triumph suggested by the first stanza can be appreciated fully only by recalling the occasion when the hymn was first sung--the triumphant procession from the walls of Poitiers to the monastery with bishops and princes in attendance and with all the pomp and pageantry of a great ecclesiastical function. \\"And still, after thirteen centuries, how great is our emotion as these imperishable accents come to our ears!\\" (Pimont). There are about forty translations into English verse. References in later works Both words and tune are quoted in a number of musical works. Gounod took a very plain melody based on the chant as the subject of his \\"March to Calvary\\" in the oratorio \\"La r√©demption\\" (1882), in which the chorus sings the text at first very slowly and then, after an interval, fortissimo. Franz Liszt wrote a piece for solo piano, Vexilla regis prodeunt, S185, and uses the hymn at the beginning and end of Via crucis (The 14 stations of the Cross), S53. Anton Bruckner composed a motet based on strophes 1, 6 and 7 of the text (1892). Gustav Holst used both the words and the plainchant melody of Vexilla regis in The Hymn of Jesus (1917). Dante makes an early literary allusion in Inferno, where Virgilius introduces Lucifer with the Latin phrase Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni. Dante's reference is itself later referenced in Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz. Vexilla regis is mentioned in Stephen's discussion of his aesthetic theory in chapter V of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. The poet-artist David Jones entitled a 1947 painting \\"Vexilla Regis\\", and mentions the hymn in his long poem The Anathemata: fragments of an attempted writing, and also in his book of essays \\"Epoch and Artist.\\" In \\"A Commentary on The Anathemata of David Jones\\" by Rene Hague, the latter makes several references to the \\"Vexilla Regis.\\" References  External links  * Vexilla Regis at Thesaurus Precum Latinarum * *Vexilla regis prodeunt sung by monks from Randol Abbey and nuns from St Cecilia's Abbey, Ryde *\\"The Royal Banners Forward Go\\" sung by the Gloucester Cathedral Choir Category:Latin-language Christian hymns Category:6th-century Christian texts Category:Liturgy_of_the_Hours ","title":"Vexilla regis"},{"id":"1614768","text":"ISAT can stand for: *International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial *Illinois Standards Achievement Test *Idaho Standards Achievement Test *In Situ Adaptive Tabulation *International Student Admissions Test *International Schools Association of Thailand *Internet Security Awareness Training *Innovative Space-based Radar Antenna Technology *Institut sup√©rieur de l'automobile et des transports *Iodine Satellite See also * I.Sat‚ÄîLatin American cable channel ","title":"ISAT"},{"id":"1614771","text":"Freaked is a 1993 American comedy film directed by Tom Stern and Alex Winter, both of whom wrote the screenplay with Tim Burns. Winter also starred in the lead role. Both were involved in the short-lived MTV sketch comedy show The Idiot Box, and Freaked retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. Freaked was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's Grand Piano. Originally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band Butthole Surfers, Freaked went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a black comedy set within a sideshow, which was picked up by 20th Century Fox for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \\"weird\\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for Australia and Japan) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States. Plot Skye Daley (Brooke Shields) is interviewing former child star Ricky Coogin (Alex Winter). Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story. Ricky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \\"Zygrot 24\\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after CEO (William Sadler) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels to the South American town of \\"Santa Flan\\" with his friend Ernie (Michael Stoyanov). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year-old fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane. Once Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with a group of environmentalists protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is Julie (Megan Ward), who Ricky becomes instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists, with Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages, and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local freak show, only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs (Randy Quaid) and his henchman, Toad (Jaime Cardriche). Utilizing his \\"Tasty Freeks Machine\\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated. Ricky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the Dog Boy (Keanu Reeves), Worm (Derek McGrath) a giant arthropod, Cowboy (John Hawkes) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the Bearded Lady (Mr. T in a dress) and Sockhead (Bobcat Goldthwait), who has a sock puppet for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act and performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \\"that's what I call entertainment.\\" The next day, Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the Weekly World News, but ends up being captured by a group of businessmen that work for E.E.S. Ricky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully-mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, all dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone, Ricky is named the new freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of macaroons which the freaks enjoy. Ricky eventually finds out that E.E.S. has been supplying Elijah's with Zygrot, and they arrive at Freek Land with new shipment and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into a race of E.E.S. workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way. On the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe. Right before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the coconut and punches Skuggs, tossing him into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down. Back at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky has returned to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a machete, only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.

Griffo as Eye N. Eye *Calvert DeForest (credited as Larry \\"Bud\\" Melman) as The President of the United States Production The film, under the working title of Hideous Mutant Freekz, was conceived around the time Winter and Stern had directed 1988's Bar-B-Que Movie, a short film starring and featuring the music of experimental rock band Butthole Surfers. Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman Gibby Haynes began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000. The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \\"Beach Blanket Bingo meets The Evil Dead\\". The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail. Following the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show The Idiot Box, staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the Monty Python and MAD Magazine-inspired humour that was present in The Idiot Box. Winter and Stern pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on 35mm film before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a PG-13 rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production. The makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: Tony Gardner's company Alterian, Inc., Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio. 20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts). =Complications= During filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by Rupert Murdoch and replaced with Peter Chernin, who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it. Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that Iggy Pop had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether. The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \\"Hideous Mutant Freekz\\" to the supposedly more accessible \\"Freaked\\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for. After several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads. Freaked had its official premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend. It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on VHS on April 20, 1994. Reception Freaked received a mostly mixed response from critics. Entertainment Weekly described the film as \\"having more laughs than a month of Saturday Night Live\\", The New York Times hailed it as one of the top comedies of the nineties, and John Kricfalusi, the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, called it \\"the funniest movie in years\\". Alternatively, Variety criticized the film, claiming \\"the filmmakers simply try too hard to displease\\", while Time Out New York stated \\"the sum is worse than (very ugly) parts\\". The movie currently holds a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews. Freaked eventually went on to win two awards: the Grand Prize at the 1995 G√©rardmer Film Festival and Best Actor (for \\"The Creatures of the Film\\") at the 1994 Fantafestival. The film was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Make- up. Home media On July 12, 2005, Anchor Bay Entertainment and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody Squeal Of Death and a black-and-white skit titled NYU Sight & Sound Project. This DVD has since gone out of print. On August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and Starz Inc. re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray. This new release does not include any of the bonus features from the earlier, now out of print DVD. Soundtrack A soundtrack release for Freaked was planned, but following the loss of their post-production budget, the idea never came to fruition. The score was composed by Kevin Kiner, with additional music by Paul Leary and Butthole Surfers, and Blind Idiot God. In 2020, Death Waltz Recording Co. released the soundtrack and score as a physical LP.https://bleedingcool.com/movies/mondo-music-announcement-of-the-week- freaked-soundtrack-and-screening/ The songs featured in the film were as follows: *\\"Freaked\\" - Henry Rollins and Blind Idiot God *\\"Gumby Jack Flash\\" - Paul Leary *\\"My Ass Is On Fire\\" - Mr. Bungle *\\"Rip/Stop\\" - Blind Idiot God *\\"Butter Queen\\" - Butthole Surfers *\\"Hideous Mutant Freekz\\" - Parliament Funkadelic and Bill Laswell *\\"Sweat Loaf\\" - Butthole Surfers *\\"Freekz!

Early life Robert Calder was born in Elgin, Scotland on 2 July 1745, second son to Sir James Calder and Alice Hughes, daughter of Admiral Robert Hughes.Tracy p.68 His father was the 3rd Baronet Calder of Muirton, who had been appointed Gentleman Usher of the Privy chamber to the queen by Lord Bute in 1761. His elder brother, who succeeded to his father's baronetcy, was Major General Sir Henry Calder. Calder was educated in Maidstone, before joining the Royal Navy in December 1758 at the age of thirteen. Early Career Calder initially served aboard his cousin's ship, the 70-gun Nassau, in the American theatre of the Seven Years' War. En route to England, in September 1759, Nassau was dismasted in storm and arrived at her destination with nine foot of water in her hold. As a midshipman, Calder received ¬£1,800 in prize money for his part in the capture of the Spanish treasure ship Hermione on 21 May 1762 (an exceptionally large prize), and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant. At that rank, he served aboard , under Captain the Hon. George Faulkner, in the Caribbean. In 1780 he attained the rank of master and commander, later post-captain. He commanded the frigate HMS Diana of the Channel fleet at Spithead under Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, and acquitted himself honourably in the various services to which he was called, but for a long time had no opportunity of distinguishing himself. In 1794 he commanded the ship Theseus of 74 guns, which formed part of Lord Howe's fleet. He was appointed in 1796 Captain of the Fleet to Admiral John Jervis aboard the HMS Victory, and saw action at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. After the battle, he was selected by Jervis to carry the dispatches announcing the victory back to Britain, and was knighted by George III on 3 March 1797 for his services. He also received the thanks of Parliament, and was created 1st Baronet Calder of Southwick on 22 August 1798. Parliament voted to award him an annum of ¬£1,200, which he declined. He continued in his service as Captain of the Fleet to Jervis, now Earl of St. Vincent, when the latter hoisted his flag in HMS Ville de Paris as Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1799, he was promoted to rear-admiral; and in 1804, now a Vice-Admiral, was despatched with a small squadron in pursuit of a French force under Admiral Ganteaume, conveying supplies to the French in Egypt. In this he was unsuccessful, and returning home at the peace he struck his flag. He had at this time become regarded as one of the Royal Navy's foremost experts on maneuvering by signal-flag and in administering a large fleet. In 1801 he quarreled with Admiral Sir John Duckworth over the payment of prize money. A court ruled in Calder's favor.  Battle of Cape Finisterre  In the War of the Third Coalition (1805‚Äì1806), he was in command of the squadrons blockading the ports of Rochefort and Ferrol, in which (among others) ships were being prepared for the invasion of England by Napoleon I. Calder held his position with a force greatly inferior to that of the enemy, and refused to be enticed out to sea. William Anderson On its becoming known that Napoleon intended to break the blockade of Ferrol as a prelude to his invasion, the Admiralty ordered Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling to join Calder and intercept the Franco- Spanish fleet on their passage to Brest. The approach of the enemy was concealed by fog. Finally, on 22 July 1805, the fleets came into sight. The allies outnumbered the British, but Calder ordered his fleet into action. In the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, fifteen British ships engaged twenty French and Spanish ships and captured two. The British losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the allies lost 158 dead and 320 wounded. After four hours, as night fell, Calder gave orders to discontinue the action. Over the following two days, the fleets remained close to one another, but did not re-engage. Calder focused on protecting his newly won prizes, while the French Admiral Villeneuve declined to force another engagement.\\"Trial of Vice- Admiral Robert Calder\\", The Naval Chronicle 1806, p. 79. Villeneuve left on 24 July, sailing to Ferrol, and eventually C√°diz, instead of resuming his course to Brest. Villeneuve had failed in all his objectives: he had landed no troops in Ireland, and the plan of linking with the fleet at Brest, driving off the British Channel squadrons, and supporting Napoleon's invasion of Britain came to nothing: the Arm√©e d'Angleterre waited uselessly at Boulogne as before. In the judgment of Napoleon, his scheme of invasion was baffled by this day's action; but much indignation was felt in England at the failure of Calder to win a complete victory. However, Calder's superior, Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, Commander of the Channel Fleet, found no complaint with his performance: Calder was shortly thereafter given command of a twenty ship force to continue in the effort to bring the Franco-Spanish fleet to battle. These twenty ships would later form the nucleus of the British fleet at Trafalgar.  Court-martial and later career  One of the primary reasons for the public outcry against Calder was the fact that his reports to Cornwallis were only printed in partiality ‚Äì making it thus seem as though Calder had not followed through on his own boasts. In consequence of the strong feeling against him, Calder demanded a court-martial. Admiral Horatio Nelson, who had now taken command of Calder's twenty ship fleet in addition to the force Nelson had brought back from the West Indies in his pursuit of Villeneuve, was ordered to send Calder home. Calder left in early October 1805, missing the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson wrote privately: \\"I should have fought the enemy, and so did my friend Calder; but who can say that he will be more successful than another?\\" Nelson - to whom Calder had never been close - entreated him to remain until the battle had been fought, attesting that Calder had an opportunity to vindicate any earlier conduct and silence his critics. Calder could not be dissuaded, however, and sailed to England. At Calder's request (a fact which would later negatively affect opinion against him), Nelson allowed him to return in his own 98-gun ship, the Prince of Wales, even though battle was imminent. The court-martial was held on 23 December 1805, being judged by, among others Admiral George Montague (serving as President of the court- martial) and future-Rear Admiral James Bisset. Calder's defense rested primarily on that the consequences of a defeat would have outweighed the fruits of a victory: despite his tactical success on 22 July, he was still outnumbered, and by concentrating his fleet to meet Villeneuve, he had of necessity been forced to abandon his blockade; thus if the French ships at Rochefort and Ferrol had sailed he would have found himself between two superior foes. This defense was undermined by the fact that Calder took no steps to verify the damage inflicted on Villeneuve's fleet, and that contrary winds prevented the forces at Ferrol, Rochefort, and Coruna from sailing (the latter a fact that Calder could not have been aware of at the time, but certainly could have been when he made his defense some months later). Nelson, at the time, wrote to the Second Sea Lord, that while he was sympathetic to Calder, \\"He appears to have had the ships at Ferrol more in his head than the ones in sight...he lays stress upon other considerations than fighting the enemy's squadron, if he could have done it, which he denies to be possible. I have ventured to recommend to Calder to keep to that; prove it, and his character is retrieved\\". Ultimately, Calder's defense rested on the discretion of a commander in battle, rather than in the physical impossibility of rejoining battle, contrary to Nelson's suggestions. However, in the time between the battle at Finisterre and his court-martial, Trafalgar had been fought, Nelson had been killed, and the threat of invasion by Napoleon forever ended. Therefore, as Calder later lamented, he had fought the battle under one set of standards, and been tried against another. The nation had become \\"infected\\" and \\"drunk with success\\" from Nelson's victories. The battle, which might have won Calder an earldom in 1795, was deemed a failure in 1805 when judged against the stunning successes of the previous ten years, especially Trafalgar. The trial resulted in an acquittal on the charges of cowardice and disaffection. However, Calder received a severe reprimand for not having done his utmost to renew the engagement on 24 July, and never served at sea again. Upham, England, United Kingdom However, he was not without his defenders. Both the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Romney spoke on his behalf in Parliament, and prior to his death in 1808 his brother-in-law, Admiral Robert Roddam wrote that were it not for Calder's action at Cape Finisterre, Nelson would not have had the opportunity to fight at Trafalgar. In time, there was a swing in public opinion back in favor of Calder, though not to the degree of the initial fury against him. Thus, when a change in government brought Charles Philip Yorke to the Admiralty, Calder's reputation was somewhat rehabilitated and he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in 1810. In the natural course of events, he was successively promoted due to seniority, eventually reaching Admiral of the Blue on 31 July 1810, and Admiral of the White on 12 April 1813. In the honors conferred on officers who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, he was created a Knight Commander, Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815. Nonetheless, his reputation never fully recovered from his court-martial. He died at Holt, near Bishop's Waltham, in Hampshire, in 1818.

In 1883, it was referred to as \\"unquestionably the most magnificent estate in Newport.\\" The home, which was acquired by Cornelius Vanderbilt II in 1885, was destroyed by fire in 1892 and replaced by the current Breakers. While only extant for 14 years, it \\"was widely known in the nineteenth century and continues to attract the attention of architectural historians today.\\" History Side view of the original Lorillard cottage On August 28, 1877, Pierre Lorillard IV paid $96,147 for 10 acres (480,736 square feet) on Ochre Point from Gov. William Beach Lawrence, through Alfred Smith. Lawrence had originally acquired 60 acres for $12,000 in 1850 from Newport farmer George Armstrong. Lorillard, of the extremely wealthy Lorillard Tobacco Company family, named their most popular cigarette after the town, Newport. Lorillard hired Peabody and Stearns who designed the residence in the Queen Anne style, construction began in 1877 and was completed in 1878 at a cost of $90,000. The landscaping was designed by Ernest Bowditch. The Breakers was notable for its high tower and steeply-gabled roof forms. During its construction, Peabody described the structure to the Newport Mercury as carrying \\"out fully the English design... The house throughout is furnished with heavy plate glass, and on the first floor the windows are all nearly French [doors]... When house and grounds are finished, the Lorillard estate will be among the most handsome of the multitude of handsome estates which Newport contains.\\" Upon its completion, the exterior of the home was described in The New York Times as follows: > It is eligibly situated on Ochre Point, and is 181 feet long, 84 feet wide > and three stories high. The underpinning was Cape Ann granite and the > exterior was Philadelphia brick, laid in red mortar, with trimmings of Nova > Scotia and North River blue-stone. The roof is gothic, and is indented with > high peaks, gables and dormer windows. At the side of the front entrance is > a large octagonal brick tower, rising high above the roof, and surmounted by > a gilded vane. The lookout at the top is reached by a spiral staircase. On > nearly all sides are broad piazzas with flooring of Philadelphia brick and > tiles bordered with blue-stone. Peabody and Stearns also designed a detached cottage that was built with the mansion in 1877 and used as a children's playhouse. This building survived the 1892 fire and is still standing on the grounds of The Breakers. It is open for tours on the grounds of the current mansion. In 1879, Lorillard purchased an additional three quarters of an acre (45,138 square feet) for $10,000 from Lawrence. Also in 1879, Lorillard helped found the Newport Casino. The estate and partnership between Lorillard and Peabody and Stearns may have led Lorillard's cousin, philanthropist Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, to purchase the property next door to his and to hire Peabody and Stearns to build her Vinland estate in 1882. The property acquired for $200,000, also from the estate of Gov. Lawrence, featured a Romanesque Revival style exterior consisting of red sandstone with Aesthetic Movement style elements.Peabody & Stearns  Schools After her death in 1896, the estate was also sold to a Vanderbilt descendant, Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly and her husband, Hamilton McKown Twombly. =Vanderbilt ownership= Rumors persisted for several years that the Lorillard estate was to be sold. In October 1883, it was reported that Cornelius Vanderbilt II purchased the \\"house and grounds, with all improvements\\" for an amount between $400,000 and $500,000. Lorillard actually sold the house in October 1885 to Vanderbilt for $400,000, in what was then the largest real estate deal ever made there. A week earlier, James Cook Ayer had offered Lorillard $375,000 for the property. Lorillard was interested in race horses and found that the Newport property lacked the space he needed. After the sale, he used the proceeds to buy an \\"undeveloped tract of hilly lakeside land about an hour northwest of New York\\" where he developed what would become Tuxedo Park, New York, a community of \\"rustic, shingle-style 'cottages' that would blend in with the beautiful wilderness setting.\\" After acquiring the property, Vanderbilt rehired Peabody and Stearns to remodel the building, becoming the first of many Vanderbilts to own property in Newport. Reportedly, Vanderbilt spent an additional $500,000 improving the estate over the next five years, with 80 men alone working on the renovations in 1886 which included tearing down a kitchen to make space for an elegant dining room and new building for the displaced kitchen. The new dining room, at 40 feet by 70 feet was the largest in Newport. =1892 fire and rebuilding= The Breakers, built in 1893, which replaced the original Breakers. The brick and shingle structure was destroyed by a fire, which started in the kitchen, in November 1892. The family, including Cornelius, Alice, Gertrude and Gladys, had been staying at the house for the Christmas holiday. At the time, Vanderbilt stated that the house was insured for $125,000, the furniture for $75,000 and the boiler for $10,000, a total of $210,000, at least several hundred thousand dollars less than what it was worth. In the wreckage, workers found two safes which contained his wife's jewelry that were only minimally damaged from the intense heat. Vanderbilt replaced the 1878 residence with a massive, and now more well known, house by the same name, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and constructed between 1893 and 1895. The new Breakers became a 70-room mansion with a gross area of and of living area on five floors that is today owned and operated by the Preservation Society of Newport County.

He wrote several books about Soviet espionage via the KGB and other agencies. Early life John Barron was born January 26, 1930, in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of a Methodist minister. He graduated from the University of Missouri and studied Russian at the United States Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He served in Berlin as a naval intelligence officer. Journalistic career In 1957, he joined the Washington Star as an investigative reporter. In 1965, Barron joined the Washington bureau of Reader's Digest. There he wrote more than 100 stories on a wide variety of subjects--notably a 1980 story concerning unanswered questions surrounding the drowning death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick in a car driven by Ted Kennedy. After Barron published his 1974 book KGB: The Secret World of Soviet Secret Agents, the KGB attempted to discredit him by faking claims that Barron was part of a Zionist conspiracy. In 1996, Barron published a book detailing the saga of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Operation SOLO, involving the infiltration of the top leadership of the Communist Party, USA by the FBI's secret informant Morris Childs. From 1958 through 1977, Childs traveled to Moscow over 50 times, acting as a courier between the CPUSA and Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Richard Gid Powers, \\"Double Agent,\\" New York Times, April 21, 1996.

Biography Cinquetti was born in Verona. At the age of 16 she won the Sanremo Music Festival in 1964 singing \\"Non ho l'et√†\\" (\\"I'm Not Old Enough\\"), with music composed by Nicola Salerno and lyrics by Mario Panzeri. Her win enabled her to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 in Copenhagen with the same song, where she claimed her country's first ever victory in the event. Cinquetti became the youngest winner of the contest to date, aged 16 years and 92 days. Only one younger artist has triumphed since; Sandra Kim in 1986.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official Celebration. Carlton Books, 2015. . Pages 32-33 The song became an international success, even spending 17 weeks in the UK Singles Chart and ending the year as the 88th best-selling single in the U.K. in 1964, something highly unusual for Italian-language material. It sold over three million copies, and was awarded a platinum disc in August 1964. In 1966, she recorded \\"Dio, come ti amo\\" (\\"God, How I Love You\\"), which became another international hit. In 1974, Cinquetti took part in the Eurovision Song Contest again, this time held in Brighton, Sussex, United Kingdom. Her song was called \\"S√¨\\" (which translates as 'yes' in English, and which became quite controversial in Italy at the time, with a referendum on the legalisation of divorce in the offing, because of the title), and came second to Swedish foursome ABBA with their song \\"Waterloo\\". Cinquetti scored a bigger UK hit single (in terms of chart placing) than she had ten years earlier, with an English-language version of \\"S√¨\\" (entitled \\"Go (Before You Break My Heart)\\") peaking at No. 8.

Performing the song \\"S√¨\\" (\\"Yes\\"), the music and lyrics of which were written by Mario Panzeri, Daniele Pace, Lorenzo Pilat and Carrado Conti, she came second after \\"Waterloo\\", sung by Sweden's ABBA. According to author and historian, John Kennedy O'Connor's, The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History, the live telecast of her song was banned in her home country by the Italian national broadcaster RAI, as the event partially coincided with the campaigning for the 1974 Italian referendum on divorce which was held a month later in May.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 RAI censored the song because of concerns that the name and lyrics of the song (which constantly repeated the word 'S√¨') could be accused of being a subliminal message and a form of propaganda to influence the Italian voting public to vote 'Yes' in the referendum. The song remained censored on most Italian state TV and radio stations for over a month. An English-language version of the song, \\"Go (Before You Break My Heart)\\", reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1974. Later career One of her other songs, \\"Alle Porte del Sole\\" (released in 1973), was re-recorded in English (as \\"Door of the Sun\\") and Italian by Al Martino, two years after its initial release, and reached No. 17 on Billboard's Hot 100 in the United States. Cinquetti's own English version of the song was released as a single by CBS Records in August 1974, with her original 1973 Italian version on the B-side. Cinquetti went on to co- host the Eurovision Song Contest 1991 with Toto Cutugno, who had brought the event to Italy with his victory in Zagreb the previous year ‚Äì the country's first win in the contest since her own twenty-six years earlier.

Chuprov was born in Mosal'sk but grew up and was educated in Moscow where his father, Alexander Ivanovich (1842‚Äì1908), a distinguished economist and statistician, was a professor. Alexander Alexandrovich graduated from the physico-mathematical faculty of Moscow University in 1896 with a dissertation on \\"The theory of probability as the foundation of theoretical statistics.\\" He spent the years 1897-1901 studying political economy in Germany, in Berlin and Strasbourg. His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Georg Friedrich Knapp (1842‚Äì1926) Die Feldgemeinschaft, eine morphologische Untersuchung was published in 1902. The most important result of his stay in Germany was his friendship with the statistician Ladislaus Bortkiewicz. On his return to Russia and, in order to get a teaching position, Chuprov completed master's examinations at the University of Moscow, concentrating on theoretical economics and the application of mathematical methods. He started teaching at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute and was in charge of the teaching of statistics until 1917. Chuprov used to go abroad regularly to work in foreign libraries. In June 1917, he went to Stockholm to the Statistical Bureau. He was away from Russia when the Bolshevik Revolution occurred. He intended to return but first illness and then money problems prevented him. In January 1919, he became director of the statistical bureau of the Central Union in Stockholm and in charge of its publication Bulletin of World Economy. In the middle of 1920, he moved to Dresden where in complete seclusion he wrote furiously. In 1925, he took up an appointment with the Russian College in Prague. The following year he died.

The curriculum he designed for the St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute was modern and his book on the theory of statistics was influential. He had some good students, the best known was Oskar Anderson. Chuprov's research was influenced by Bortkiewicz on the theoretical side and his father, A. I. Chuprov, on the empirical. Bortkiewicz was the leading exponent of the dispersion theory of Lexis and Chuprov contributed to this research. (There is a brief account of the history of this theory in Heyde & Seneta (1977.)) A. I. Chuprov was the leader of a movement to get statistical information on social conditions in Russia. By 1910, his son A. A. Chuprov was writing about the use of random sampling in such investigations. His work paralleled that of Bowley in England. Chuprov's first work on sampling was not mathematical but in the 1920s he developed the formula for optimal allocation in stratified sampling (to be rediscovered by Neyman in 1934 and usually associated with him). Chuprov also did demographic research. Chuprov tried to bring together the approaches of Bortkiewicz and Lexis, of the Russian mathematicians and of the English biometricians. He watched developments in Britain and was sympathetic to the work of Karl Pearson, much more so than A. A. Markov with whom he corresponded on statistical matters. Both Chuprov and his student Oskar Anderson published in Pearson's journal Biometrika. Chuprov was not above telling the English off, \\"English scientific tradition rejects the concept of 'mathematical probability' ... and the method of mathematical expectation has naturally shared the fate of the concept ... on which it rests.\\" For a brief period Chuprov was known in Britain. In John Maynard Keynes' Treatise on Probability (1921) he is put with Markov and Chebyshev as the three great Russian names in the theory of statistics. However, with the rise of Fisherian statistics, Chuprov was forgotten. In Scandinavia he had a more lasting influence, principally through the papers he published in the Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift.

The Westmore Family is a prominent family in Hollywood make-up. Led by their patriarch, George Westmore, the family has had four generations serve Hollywood as make-up artists in various capacities since George's establishment of Hollywood's first make-up department in 1917. Careers The Westmore Family star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The English wigmaker George Westmore, for whom the Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild's George Westmore Lifetime Achievement Award is named, founded the first (and tiny) film makeup department, at Selig Polyscope Company in 1917. He also worked at Triangle, but soon was freelancing across the major studios. He understood that cosmetic and hair needs were personal and would make up stars such as Mary Pickford (whom he relieved of having to curl her famous hair daily by making false ringlets) or the Talmadge sisters (Norma and Constance) in their homes before they left for work in the morning. He fathered three legendary and scandalous generations of movie makeup artists, beginning with his six sons‚ÄîPerc, Ern, Monte, Wally, Bud, and Frank‚Äîwho soon eclipsed him in Hollywood. By 1926, Monte, Perc, Ern, and Bud had penetrated the industry to become the chief makeup artists at four major studios, and all continued to break ground in new beauty and horror illusions until the end of their careers. In 1921, after dishwashing at Famous Players-Lasky, Monte became Rudolph Valentino's sole makeup artist. (The actor had been doing his own.) When Valentino died in 1926, Monte went to Selznick International where, thirteen years later, he worked himself to death with the enormous makeup demands for Gone with the Wind (1939). In 1923, Perc established a blazing career at First National-Warner Bros. and, over twenty-seven years, initiated beauty trends and disguises including, in 1939, the faces of Charles Laughton's grotesque The Hunchback of Notre Dame (for RKO) and Bette Davis's eyebrowless, almost bald, whitefaced look in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. In the early 1920s, he blended Stein Pink greasepaint with eye shadow, preceding Max Factor's Panchromatic. Ern, at RKO from 1929 to 1931 and then at 20th Century Fox from 1935, was adept at finding the right look for stars of the 1930s. Wally headed Paramount makeup from 1926, where he created, among others, Fredric March's gruesome transformation in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931). Frank followed him there. Bud led Universal's makeup department for twenty-three years, specializing in rubber prosthetics. Together, they built the House of Westmore salon, which served stars and public alike. Later generations have continued the name, including brothers Michael and Marvin who have excelled in special makeup effects, such as in Blade Runner (1982), Mask (1985) and Raging Bull (1980).

It is based on the true story of Jim Morris who debuted in Major League Baseball at age 35. The film stars Dennis Quaid as Morris, alongside Rachel Griffiths, Jay Hernandez, and Brian Cox. Plot Jim Morris is the son of a career Navy man, who moves the family from Hollywood, Florida to Big Lake, Texas, in order to maintain job security. Jim is shown to be a very skilled pitcher, though his father disapproves of Jim's dream of making it to Major League Baseball. It is later mentioned that the town to which Jim's family moved, Big Lake, has lost its love for baseball, preferring football instead. Thus, he was unable to play baseball in high school. He later gets a chance when he is drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers, but he tears up his shoulder, ending his hopes of achieving his lifelong dream. In 1999, Jim, married with three children, is a high school science teacher, as well as head baseball coach. His team, the Big Lake Owls, is very unsuccessful with many of his players skilled, but unmotivated, especially with very little community support. One day after practice, the team catcher offers to play catch with Jim. There, it is revealed that Jim may still have his fastball, and it is soon displayed to the rest of the team. The Owls believe that Jim could possibly pitch in the major leagues and offer him a deal: If the Owls can win district and make the state playoffs, Jim will try out again, which Jim accepts. Furthermore, the team urges him to throw his fastball in batting practice, which immensely improves their hitting. The Owls end up winning district, and after their final win, the team tells Jim that, since they kept up their end of the deal, it is now his turn to do his part. After the Owls' season ends with a loss in the state tournament, Jim is told of a tryout nearby for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Jim goes, without telling his wife, afraid that her fear of him re-injuring his shoulder would keep him from going. After his tryout, the professional scouts discover his ability to repeatedly throw a baseball at . The lead scout tells Jim that he could be signed to a minor-league deal. Jim's wife finds out after getting two phone messages from the Tampa Bay scouts and she is at first reluctant to let Jim go, citing his home responsibilities, but after seeing how Jim is inspiring their son, Hunter, she allows him to go. Jim tells his father, with whom he still has a cold relationship, of his situation, and his father once again tries to dissuade Jim from trying to achieve his dream again, telling Jim, \\"It's OK to think about what you want to do until it's time to start doing what you were meant to do.\\" He is initially assigned to the minor league Class AA Orlando Rays (now the Montgomery Biscuits) but quickly moves up to the AAA Durham Bulls. Concerned for his family due to mounting bills (the pay in the minor leagues being low), Jim decides to give it up and come home. But his wife Lorri talks him out of it, not wanting Jim to give up again. Jim gets inspired again when he watches a Little League game one night, remembering the same love for baseball he had as a kid. In September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up, and that they will be playing in Texas against the Rangers. Jim calls his family, who in turn informs the town. Advising his wife of the dress code in the majors, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie, and his St. Rita necklace hanging in his locker. St. Rita is the saint of impossible dreams. His family, high school players, and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called into the game to pitch to Royce Clayton and end the inning. Jim ends up striking out Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, Jim gets interviewed by the press. During the interview, Jim notices his father had also come to the game. Jim's father admits how special it is to be able to see his son play in the majors. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he had gotten the strikeout, and the two finally repair their relationship. Jim then meets with his family and all the townspeople who had come to the game, applauding Jim on his amazing success story. The final scene shows the Big Lake high school trophy case, which has Jim's Major League jersey prominently displayed. It is then mentioned that Jim would go on to pitch in the majors for two seasons before retiring and returning to teaching in Texas.

Philae was originally located near the expansive First Cataract of the Nile in Upper Egypt and was the site of an Egyptian temple complex. These rapids and the surrounding area have been variously flooded since the initial construction of the Aswan Low Dam in 1902.\\"Milestones in Archaeology: a Chronological Encyclopedia\\", Tim Murray, P464, ABC-CLIO, 2007ISBN 1-57607-186-3 The temple complex was dismantled and moved to nearby Agilkia Island as part of the UNESCO Nubia Campaign project, protecting this and other complexes before the 1970 completion of the Aswan High Dam.The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites, UNESCO project site about Nubia Campaign. The hieroglyphic reliefs of the temple complex are being studied and published by the Philae Temple Text Project of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna (Institute OREA). Geography Panoramic view of the Philae Temple from south, at its current location on Agilkia Island Philae is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including Strabo,i. p. 40, xvii. pp. 803, 818, 820 Diodorus Siculus,i. 22 Ptolemy,iv. 5. ¬ß 74 Seneca,Quaest. Nat. iv. 1 Pliny the Elder.v. 9. s. 10 It was, as the plural name indicates, the appellation of two small islands situated in latitude 24¬∞ north, just above the First Cataract near Aswan (Egyptian Swenet \\"Trade;\\" ). GroskurdStrab. vol. iii. p. 399 computes the distance between these islands and Aswan at about . Despite being the smaller island, Philae proper was, from the numerous and picturesque ruins formerly there, the more interesting of the two. Prior to the inundation, it was not more than long and about broad. It is composed of syenite: its sides are steep and on their summits a lofty wall was built encompassing the island. Since Philae was said to be one of the burying-places of Osiris, it was held in high reverence both by the Egyptians to the north and the Nubians (often referred to as \\"Ethiopians\\" in Greek) to the south. It was deemed profane for any but priests to dwell there and was accordingly sequestered and denominated \\"the Unapproachable\\" (). . It was reported too that neither birds flew over it nor fish approached its shores.Senec. Quaest. Nat. iv. 2. These indeed were the traditions of a remote period; since in the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Philae was so much resorted to, partly by pilgrims to the tomb of Osiris, partly by persons on secular errands, that the priests petitioned Ptolemy VIII Physcon (170-117 BC) to prohibit public functionaries at least from coming there and living at their expense. In the nineteenth century, William John Bankes took the Philae obelisk on which this petition was engraved to England. When its Egyptian hieroglyphs were compared with those of the Rosetta Stone, it threw great light upon the Egyptian consonantal alphabet. The islands of Philae were not, however, merely sacerdotal abodes; they were the centres of commerce also between Mero√´ and Memphis. For the rapids of the cataracts were at most seasons impracticable, and the commodities exchanged between Egypt and Nubia were reciprocally landed and re-embarked at Syene and Philae. The neighbouring granite quarries also attracted a numerous population of miners and stonemasons; and, for the convenience of this traffic, a gallery or road was formed in the rocks along the east bank of the Nile, portions of which are still extant. Philae also was remarkable for the singular effects of light and shade resulting from its position near the Tropic of Cancer. As the sun approached its northern limit the shadows from the projecting cornices and moldings of the temples sink lower and lower down the plain surfaces of the walls, until, the sun having reached its highest altitude, the vertical walls are overspread with dark shadows, forming a striking contrast with the fierce light which illuminates all surrounding objects.Ritter, Erdkunde, vol. i. p. 680, seq. =Construction= The most conspicuous feature of both islands was their architectural wealth. Monuments of various eras, extending from the Pharaohs to the Caesars, occupy nearly their whole area. The principal structures, however, lay at the south end of the smaller island. The most ancient was a temple for Isis, built in the reign of Nectanebo I during 380-362 BC, which was approached from the river through a double colonnade. Nekhtnebef was his ancient Egyptian royal titulary and he became the founding pharaoh of the Thirtieth and last native dynasty when he deposed and killed Nepherites II. For the most part, the other ruins date from the Ptolemaic Kingdom, more especially with the reigns of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, Ptolemy V Epiphanes, and Ptolemy VI Philometor (282-145 BC), with many traces of Roman work in Philae dedicated to Ammon-Osiris. In front of the propyla were two colossal lions in granite, behind which stood a pair of obelisks, each high. The propyla were pyramidal in form and colossal in dimensions. One stood between the dromos and pronaos, another between the pronaos and the portico, while a smaller one led into the sekos or adyton. At each corner of the adytum stood a monolithic shrine, the cage of a sacred hawk. Of these shrines one is now in the Louvre, the other in the Museum at Florence. Beyond the entrance into the principal court are small temples, one of which, dedicated to Isis, Hathor, and a wide range of deities related to midwifery, is covered with sculptures representing the birth of Ptolemy Philometor, under the figure of the god Horus. The story of Osiris is everywhere represented on the walls of this temple, and two of its inner chambers are particularly rich in symbolic imagery. Upon the two great propyla are Greek inscriptions intersected and partially destroyed by Egyptian figures cut across them. The monuments in both islands indeed attested, beyond any others in the Nile valley, the survival of pure Egyptian art centuries after the last of the Pharaohs had ceased to reign. Great pains have been taken to mutilate the sculptures of this temple. The work of demolition is attributable, in the first instance, to the zeal of the early Christians, and afterward, to the policy of the Iconoclasts, who curried favour for themselves with the Byzantine court by the destruction of images as well as Christian ones. It's notable that images/icons of Horus are often less mutilated than the other carvings. In some wall scenes, every figure and hieroglyphic text except that of Horus and his winged solar-disk representation have been meticulously scratched out by early Christians. This is presumably because the early Christians had some degree of respect for Horus or the legend of Horus - it may be because they saw parallels between the stories of Jesus and Horus (see Jesus in comparative mythology#Ancient Egypt). The soil of Philae had been prepared carefully for the reception of its buildings-being leveled where it was uneven, and supported by masonry where it was crumbling or insecure. For example, the western wall of the Great Temple, and the corresponding wall of the dromos, were supported by very strong foundations, built below the pre-inundation level of the water, and rested on the granite which in this region forms the bed of the Nile. Here and there steps were hewn out from the wall to facilitate the communication between the temple and the river. At the southern extremity of the dromos of the Great Temple was a smaller temple, apparently dedicated to Hathor; at least the few columns that remained of it are surmounted with the head of that goddess. Its portico consisted of twelve columns, four in front and three deep. Their capitals represented various forms and combinations of the palm branch, the doum palm branch, and the lotus flower. These, as well as the sculptures on the columns, the ceilings, and the walls were painted with the most vivid colors, which, owing to the dryness of the climate, have lost little of their original brilliance. HistoryPharaonic era= A sphinx in Philae The ancient Egyptian name of the smaller island meant \\"boundary\\". As their southern frontier, the pharaohs of Egypt kept there a strong garrison, and it was also a barracks for Greek and Roman soldiers in their turn. The first religious building on Philae was likely a shrine built by Pharaoh Taharqa of the 25th Dynasty, which was probably dedicated to Amun.However this structure is only known from a few blocks reused in later buildings, which Gerhard Haeny suspects may have been brought over for reuse from structures elsewhere. The oldest temple to have undoubtedly stood on the island, as well as the first evidence of Isis-worship there, was a small kiosk built by Psamtik II of the 26th Dynasty. This was followed by contributions from Amasis II (26th Dynasty) and Nectanebo I (30th Dynasty). Of these early buildings, only two elements built by Nectanebo I survive‚Äì a kiosk that was originally the vestibule of the old Isis temple, and a gateway which was later incorporated into the first pylon of the current temple. =Ptolemaic era= More than two thirds of Philae‚Äôs surviving structures were built in the Ptolemaic era, during which the island became a prominent site of pilgrimage not only for Egyptians and Nubians but for pilgrims from as far as Anatolia, Crete, and the Greek mainland. Some of these pilgrims marked their presence with inscriptions on the temple walls, including votive inscriptions known as proskynemata, as well as other types. Among these are inscriptions left by four Romans in 116 BC, which represent the oldest known Latin inscriptions in Egypt. Along with the various contributions of Ptolemaic rulers, Philae also received additions from the Nubian king Arqamani, who contributed to the Temple of Arensnuphis and the mammisi, and his successor Adikhalamani, whose name has been found on a stela on the island. Some experts have interpreted these additions as signs of collaboration between the Nubian and Ptolemaic governments, but others consider them to represent a period of Nubian occupation of the region, likely enabled by the revolt of Hugronaphor in Upper Egypt. The cartouches of Arqamani were later erased by Ptolemy V, while the stela of Adikhalamani was eventually reused as filling under the floor of the pronaos. =Roman era= The Roman era saw an overall decline in pilgrimage to Philae, especially from Mediterranean regions, as evidenced by the reduced number of inscriptions. Nevertheless it remained an important sacred site, especially for Nubians, who continued to visit both as individual pilgrims and in official delegations from their government in Mero√´. Several Roman emperors made artistic and architectural contributions to Philae. While most of the architectural additions date to the Julio-Claudian dynasty, the island continued to receive contributions to its temples up to the time of Caracalla as well as a triple arch built by Diocletian. In AD 298, Diocletian ceded Roman territory south of the First Cataract as part of an agreement made with the neighboring Nobades, withdrawing the border to about the area of Philae itself. The Kushite king Yesebokheamani made a pilgrimage to Philae in this period and may have taken over the Roman hegemony. During the Roman era, Philae was the site of the last known inscription in Egyptian hieroglyphs, written in AD 394, and the last known Demotic inscription, written in 452. Christianization Christian altar in the first hypostyle hall at Philae temple complex Christianity seems to have been present at Philae by the fourth century, at which point it coexisted with traditional Egyptian religion. According to the Coptic hagiography Life of Aaron, the first bishop of Philae was Macedonius, (attested in the early fourth century) who is said to have killed the sacred falcon kept on the island, though modern experts question the historicity of this account. By the mid fifth century, a petition from Bishop Appion of Syene to co-emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian III indicates the presence of multiple churches on the island functioning alongside the pagan temples. Traditional worship at Philae appears to have survived into at least the fifth century, despite the anti-pagan persecutions of that time. In fact, the fifth century historian Priscus mentions a treaty between the Roman commander Maximinus and the Blemmyes and Nobades in 452, which among other things ensured access to the cult image of Isis. According to the sixth century historian Procopius, the temple was closed down officially in AD 537 by the local commander Narses the Persarmenian in accordance with an order of Byzantine emperor Justinian I.Procopius Bell. Pers. 1.19.37This event is conventionally considered to mark the end of ancient Egyptian religion. However its importance has recently come into question, following a major study by Jitse Dijkstra who argues that organized paganism at Philae ended in the fifth century based on the fact that the last inscriptional evidence of an active pagan priesthood there dates to the 450s. Nevertheless, some adherence to traditional religion seems to have survived into the sixth century, based on a petition from Dioscorus of Aphrodito to the governor of the Thebaid dated to 567. The letter warns of an unnamed man (the text calls him ‚Äúeater of raw meat‚Äù) who, in addition to plundering houses and stealing tax revenue, is alleged to have restored paganism at ‚Äúthe sanctuaries,‚Äù possibly referring to the temples at Philae. Philae retained significance as a Christian center even after its closure as a pagan site. Five of its temples were converted into churches (including the Temple of Isis, which was dedicated to Saint Stephen), and two purpose built churches were constructed on the north side of the island. =1800s= The island of Philae attracted much attention in the 19th century. In the 1820s, Joseph Bonomi the Younger, a British Egyptologist and museum curator visited the island. So did Amelia Edwards, a British novelist in 1873-1874\\\\. These visits are only a small sample of the great interest that Victorian-era Britain had for Egypt. Soon, tourism to Philae became common. =1900s=Aswan Low Dam Philae flooded by the Aswan Low Dam in 1906. Kiosk of Emperor Trajan on Phylae Island before relocation In 1902, the Aswan Low Dam was completed on the Nile River by the British. This threatened to submerge many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae. The height of the dam was raised twice, from 1907‚Äì1912 and from 1929‚Äì1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always flooded. In fact, the only times that the complex was not underwater was when the dam's sluices were open from July to October. It was proposed that the temples be relocated, piece by piece, to nearby islands, such as Bigeh or Elephantine. However, the temples' foundations and other architectural supporting structures were strengthened instead. Although the buildings were physically secure, the island's attractive vegetation and the colors of the temples' reliefs were washed away. Also, the bricks of the Philae temples soon became encrusted with silt and other debris carried by the Nile. Rescue project The temples had been practically intact since the ancient days, but with each inundation the situation worsened and in the 1960s the island was submerged up to a third of the buildings all year round. In 1960 UNESCO started a project to try to save the buildings on the island from the destructive effect of the ever-increasing waters of the Nile. First, building three dams and creating a separate lake with lower water levels was considered. First of all, a large coffer dam was built, constructed of two rows of steel plates between which a of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away. Next the monuments were cleaned and measured, by using photogrammetry, a method that enables the exact reconstruction of the original size of the building blocks that were used by the ancients. Then every building was dismantled into about 40,000 units from 2 to 25 tons, and then transported to the nearby Island of Agilkia, situated on higher ground some away. The transfer itself took place between 1977 and 1980. Nearby locations of interest Prior to the inundation, a little west of Philae lay a larger island, anciently called Snem or Senmut, but now Bigeh. It is very steep, and from its most elevated peak affords a fine view of the Nile, from its smooth surface south of the islands to its plunge over the shelves of rock that form the First Cataract. Philae, Bigeh and another lesser island divided the river into four principal streams, and north of them it took a rapid turn to the west and then to the north, where the cataract begins. Bigeh, like Philae, was a holy island; its ruins and rocks are inscribed with the names and titles of Amenhotep III, Ramesses II, Psamtik II, Apries, and Amasis II, together with memorials of the later Macedonian and Roman rulers of Egypt. Its principal ruins consisted of the propylon and two columns of a temple, which was apparently of small dimensions, but of elegant proportions. Near them were the fragments of two colossal granite statues and also an excellent piece of masonry of much later date, having the aspect of an arch belonging to a church or mosque.

Publication history The Curtis Carr version of Chemistro first appeared in Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #12 and was created by Steve Englehart and George Tuska. The Archibald Morton version of Chemistro first appeared in Power Man #37 and was created by Marv Wolfman and Ron Wilson. The Calvin Carr version of Chemistro first appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #93 and was created by Kurt Busiek and Ernie Chan. Fictional character biographyCurtis Carr= Curtis Carr was born in Kansas City, Kansas. While working as a chemist and research scientist for Mainstream Motors, he created an \\"alchemy gun\\" capable of transmuting matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.). Horace Claymore, the company's president, was impressed until Curtis voiced his intent to keep the device. Claymore argued that since the gun was made on company time, it belonged to Mainstream. When Claymore fired him, Curtis adopted the persona of Chemistro to gain revenge and to extort his former employers. In combat with Luke Cage, Chemistro accidentally fired his alchemy gun at his own right foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.Luke Cage: Hero for Hire #12 Carr was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate Arch Morton into revealing the means by which the alchemy gun worked. Morton took on the Chemistro persona, and Carr invented a \\"nullifier\\" device which enabled Cage to defeat Morton.Power Man #37-39 Curtis's alchemy gun was later stolen by his younger brother Calvin, who became the third Chemistro. Curtis aided Cage and Iron Fist in defeating Calvin.Power Man and Iron Fist #94, 96 Later, Curtis came to work at a division of Stark Enterprises as a research scientist and Director of Research and Development at Stark Prosthetics in Denver, Colorado. He created an artificial prosthesis to replace his missing foot. Stark Prosthetics ended up attacked by the Wrecker during the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" when the Kingpin sent him to attack Iron Man. Curtis aided Iron Man and Jim Rhodes against the Wrecker and Calvin, although Calvin destroyed Curtis' left foot. After that attack, Curtis made another prostheses for his other foot.Iron Man #251-252 =Archibald Morton= Archibald \\"Arch\\" Morton was born in Sheridan, Wyoming, and became a professional criminal and was sent to prison. He forced Curtis Carr to reveal the secret of his alchemy gun while they were cellmates. Upon leaving prison, Morton attempted to replicate the alchemy gun, but it exploded in his hand, granting him superhuman powers and enabling him to transmute substances via touch. He battled Luke Cage on behalf of the Baron. Morton was ultimately apprehended, thanks in large part to the help of the original Chemistro. =Calvin Carr= Curtis' younger brother Calvin Carr stole the alchemy gun and took the Chemistro name. He embarked on a criminal career and battled Luke Cage and Iron Fist. Curtis intervened, and helped the heroes foil his brother's plans.Power Man and Iron Fist #93-96 Calvin's alchemy gun was turned into wrist blasters by the Wizard who sent him and the Wrecker to attack Iron Man and Jim Rhodes during the \\"Acts of Vengeance.\\" Curtis helped the heroes, and Calvin destroyed Curtis' other foot, but gave up when he was defeated by Iron Man. Calvin has been hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.New Avengers #35 Chemistro informs The Hood of a plot by Owl to sell Deathlok, which he stole from S.H.I.E.L.D., to the highest bidder. As Owl hasn't gained permission from his new crime syndicate, The Hood decides to gatecrash the auction. Sending Madame Masque, the Crimson Cowl, the Wizard, and Dr. Jonas Harrow as proxies he effortlessly ambushes and dispatches the Owl. John King and The Hood reconvene in the back room of run- down bar where they are confronted by a curious Wolverine who overhears their plans to run Deathlok through the lobby of Avengers Tower. They escape by shooting Wolverine and assuming the form the Nistanti who originally owned his hood, using this form to escape. Chemistro suggests that they change their plan and instead use Deathlok to rob a federal reserve bank under the Baxter Building. In the process they gain over 15 million in cash and lose Deathlok in the ensuing chaos. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange. In Secret Invasion, he is one among many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading Skrull force.Secret Invasion #6 He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 He later orchestrates a power-draining trap that was meant for the Dark Avengers only to end up having the New Avengers in his trap.New Avengers #55 Chemistro was seen during the Siege of Asgard as part of the Hood crime syndicate.New Avengers #63 Later Calvin is shown to be arrested, along with other members of the Hood's gang, by the U.S. Army.Dark Avengers #16 During the Shadowland storyline, Chemistro was seen as member of Flashmob (a group of former opponents of Luke Cage consisting of Cheshire Cat, Comanche, Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton, Mr. Fish II, and Spear) when they confront the new Power Man on the rooftop. Although Chemistro used his alchemy gun to free Iron Fist and Luke Cage, he was knocked out by Power Man. Chemistro ended up incarcerated at Ryker's Island. Although Deadly Nightshade's solicitor Big Ben Donovan mentioned that he has arranged for Chemistro to be released from Riker's Island.Shadowland: Power Man #2 During the Spider-Island storyline, Chemistro is among the villains that have been infected by the bedbugs that bestowed spider powers on him. He alongside Cheshire Cat, Commanche, Cottonmouth, Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton, Mr. Fish II, Nightshade, and Spear ended up fighting Heroes for Hire.Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire #1 Chemistro is among the Iron Man villains recruited by Mandarin and Zeke Stane to participate in a plot to take down Iron Man.Invincible Iron Man #513 Chemistro tried to kill Tony Stark (who had to take his armor away for legal issues) alongside Mauler. The new Iron Man arrived and saved Stark, but also killed Chemistro in the act.Invincible Iron Man #520 Powers and abilities Curtis Carr is a gifted research scientist, with advanced degrees in chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. He is a highly skilled inventor and built his alchemy gun, which fires radiation able to transmute any substance into any other form of matter. He also built a \\"nullifier\\" rifle which is able to neutralize and reverse the effects of the alchemy gun, and Arch Morton's transmutation powers. The devices are cybernetically linked to the user, enabling him to work any transformation he can imagine. The transformed material usually turns to dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time. Therefore, his alchemy gun cannot be used merely to transmute substances, such as turning lead or rock into gold. As High-Tech, Carr employed an armored exoskeleton suit and various devices of his own invention. Archibald Morton was granted the ability to transmute substances by the touch of his left hand in a similar fashion after his experimental version of the alchemy gun exploded. Calvin Carr used a set of wrist-blasters designed by the Wizard, which functioned in an identical manner as his brother's alchemy gun.

It also replaces former Civil Defence and Emergency Powers legislation of the 20th century. Background to the Act The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 repeals the Civil Defence Act 1948 and the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland) 1950. Part 1 of the Act establishes a new and broad definition of \\"emergency\\". The definition includes war or attack by a foreign power, which were defined as emergencies under previous legislation, as well as terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom and events which threaten serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom or to the environment of a place in the United Kingdom. Previous legislation, which was enacted during or after the Second World War, provided for civil protection solely in terms of \\"civil defence\\", which was defined as \\"measures, other than actual combat, for affording defence against a hostile attack by a foreign power\\". The Act also broadens the number of local bodies which have duties in the event of an emergency; previous legislation only related to local authorities, police authorities and certain fire authorities. Neither strand had seen any significant amendments in a number of years and they were not deemed able to cope in the event of domestic threats to services such as the fuel protests of 2000 or natural threats like the mass flooding in 2000 and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001. In the wake of these three events, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, announced a formal review into emergency planning arrangements. The review included a public consultation exercise, which generally supported the Government's conclusion that existing legislation was no longer adequate and that new legislation was required. A draft Bill was scrutinised in detail by the Joint Committee on the Draft Civil Contingencies Bill, which was very influential in shaping the legislation though several of its proposals (notably creation of a new agency) were rejected. The Act guides and authorises the creation of a Local Resilience Forum to consider such matters within an existing police force boundary and requires responders to undertake risk assessments, maintain them in a Community Risk Register and to publish this register. Risks in this context are those that could result in a major emergency. This Community Risk Register is the first step in the emergency planning process; it ensures that the plans that are developed are proportionate to the risk. The Act The Act is divided into three parts: * Part 1 defines the obligations of certain organisations to prepare for various types of emergencies. * Part 2 provides additional powers for the government to use in the event of a large scale emergency. * Part 3 provides supplementary legislation in support of the first two parts. =Part 1: Local arrangements for civil protection= Part 1 of the Act places a legal obligation upon emergency services and local authorities (defined as \\"Category 1 responders\\" under the Act) to assess the risk of, plan, and exercise for emergencies, as well as undertaking Business Continuity Management. Category 1 responders are also responsible for warning and informing the public in relation to emergencies. Finally, local authorities are required to provide business continuity advice to local businesses. It also places legal obligations for increased co-operation and information sharing between different emergency services and also to non-emergency services that might have a role in an emergency such as electric companies (non-emergency services are defined as Category 2 responders under the Act). =Part 2: Emergency powers= The second part of the Act provides that temporary emergency regulations are normally made through Order in Council or by a Minister of the Crown if arranging for an Order in Council would not be possible without serious delay. Such regulations are limited in duration to 30 days, unless Parliament votes to extend this period before it expires. The only primary legislation which may not be amended by emergency regulations is the Human Rights Act 1998 and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act itself. There was an attempt by Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers to add a number of other key constitutional laws to the exemption list during the Bill stage, but this was unsuccessful. They tried to protect these laws from emergency regulation: * Habeas Corpus Act 1679 * Bill of Rights 1689 * The clause in the Parliament Act 1911 that limits the duration of a Parliament to five years * Act of Settlement 1701 * House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 * Life Peerages Act 1958 * House of Lords Act 1999 The introduction of the Act comes with increased funding for emergency planning in the United Kingdom to help organisations comply with the Act and brings emergency planning funding more on par with European levels. =Category 1 and 2 responders= Category 1 and 2 responders are organisations defined in the Act as having responsibilities for carrying out the legislation. Each responder has an emergency planning officer (sometimes called a civil protection officer, civil contingencies officer, resilience officer, or risk manager) who is usually responsible for ensuring their organisation is in compliance with the Act and sharing information with other responders. The usual way of checking compliance is by regularly testing plans by reviews or exercises. Category 1 responders Category 1 responders are known as core responders; they include the usual \\"blue-light\\" emergency services, as well as others: * Local authorities * Police forces, including the British Transport Police * Fire services * Ambulance services * HM Coastguard * NHS hospital trusts, NHS foundation trusts (and Welsh equivalents), NHS England, Public Health England, and Public Health Wales * Port health authorities * The Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and Natural Resources Wales Category 2 responders Category 2 responders are key co-operating responders that act in support of the Category 1 responders. Category 2 responders are mostly utility companies and transport organisations: =Utilities= * Electricity distributors and transmitters * Gas distributors * Water and sewerage undertakers * Telephone service providers (fixed and mobile) =Transport= * Network Rail * Train operating companies (passenger and freight) * London Underground * Transport for London * Highways England * Airport operators * Harbour authorities =Others= * The Health and Safety Executive * Voluntary aid societies (VAS) ‚Äì such as St John Ambulance and the British Red Cross =Section 34 ‚Äì Commencement= The following orders have been made under sections 34(1) and (3): *The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/3281 (C. 148)) *The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/772 (C. 33)) *The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/2040 (C. 89)) *The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Commencement) (Scotland) Order 2005 (S.S.I. 2005/493 (C. 26)), made under sections 34(2) and (3).  Reactions  According to the leading commentary on the Act, by Clive Walker and Jim Broderick:The Civil Contingencies Act 2004: Risk, Resilience and the Law in the United Kingdom (372 + xxxviipp, Oxford University Press, 2006) > The Government‚Äôs handling of risks and emergencies in recent years has > failed to inspire public confidence.

Publication history The Mortimer Norris version of Mr. Fish first appeared in Luke Cage, Power Man #29 and was created by Bill Mantlo and George Tuska. Initially, Luke Cage, Power Man #29 was intended to continue a storyline from the 28th issue. The continuation of that story was running late. Because of these deadline considerations, the splash page admits, this fill-in story, \\"No One Laughs at Mr. Fish\\", was created to ensure #29 hit the stands on schedule. The Bill Morris version of Mr. Fish first appeared in Daughters of the Dragon #4 and was created by Justin Gray, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Khari Evans. Fictional character biographyMortimer Norris= Mr. Fish was once an ordinary human being, a petty crook named Mortimer George Norris who stumbled upon some stolen radioactive material while on a job. The exposure made him dizzy and caused him to fall into the East River. When he emerged, he had been mutated into an amphibious fish-man with enhanced strength. He used these powers to establish a Maggia branch in his area, aided by a group of thugs and his second-in- command, a dwarf named \\"Shrike\\". This attempt was cut short by a battle with Luke Cage. Mr. Fish initially seemed to have the upper hand: his men overpowered Cage and Fish himself used a mysterious concussive ray gun to knock Cage out, taking him to a deserted construction site. However, and despite Shrike's advice to finish Cage off before he awoke, Mr. Fish waited until Cage awoke so that he could recount his origin and master plan. Cage got his second wind and made short work of Fish's men. In a desperate move, Fish rushed towards Cage with a steel girder, but Cage dodged and Fish fell off the building, seemingly dying on impact.Luke Cage, Power Man #29 Mr. Fish turns up alive during the All-New, All-Different Marvel relaunch, to warn Tombstone that the Black Cat will be targeting him and his criminal empire during an upcoming gang war for control of Harlem. Burgeoning crime lord Alex Wilder later crashes one of Tombstone and Mr. Fish's meetings, beating the former and magically banishing the latter to Hell. After recovering from the attack, Tombstone rescues Mr. Fish from Hell, with the help of Black Talon. =Bill Norris= Bill Norris, the first Mr. Fish's similarly-mutated brother,Spider- Man: Back in Black Handbook #1 was introduced visiting an exotic nightclub with the Walrus.Daughters of the Dragon #4 He subsequently joined the Flashmob, a group of former opponents of Luke Cage, during Shadowland. The assemblage of villains confront the new Power Man, and are remanded to Ryker's Island after being defeated by him and Iron Fist. A few members of the Flashmob, including Mr. Fish, are eventually bailed out by Big Ben Donovan.Shadowland: Power Man #2 When a virus begins giving people spider- powers similar to Spider-Man's during the Spider-Island storyline, Mr. Fish and the rest of the Flashmob are among those infected, prompting them to try and escape from the quarantined Manhattan. They are prevented from doing so by the Heroes for Hire.Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire #1 Powers and abilities Mr. Fish has enhanced strength, a fish-like appearance, and a gun. Other versionsMarvel Adventures= This version of Mr. Fish was about to enact his master plan only for him and his henchmen to encounter the Fantastic Four. Human Torch used his flames to dehydrate Mr. Fish, enough for a police officer to knock him out and arrest him.Fantastic Four Giant-Size Adventures #1 In other mediaTelevision= * A variation of the Mortimer Norris version of Mr. Fish appears in season 2 of Luke Cage, portrayed by Hakim Callender. While he still has the nickname \\"Mr. Fish\\", he does not possess any superhuman abilities and resembles a normal man. He and his gang approach Misty Knight and Colleen Wing while they are having drinks in a bar and plans to assault Misty as retaliation for her sending his brother Bill to Dannemora. Misty manages to fight Mortimer and overpower him despite only having one arm to punch, while Colleen makes short work of his lackeys. Both of them leave as Misty tells the bartender to put their drinks on Mortimer's tab.

He was a successful sawmill and gristmill businessman who became a well-known pro-American activist in New Brunswick and Maine during the 19th century and was nicknamed \\"the Washington of the Republic of Madawaska\\", which he had declared in response to the unwillingness of the Van Buren Administration in Washington to support Maine's claim to sizable areas of territory covering adjacent parts of the British colonies of Lower-Canada and New Brunswick, part of British North America. At least 22 years earlier, the War of 1812 had ended in a draw and had seriously depleted the US Treasury, demonstrating the will of Britain to engage in full warfare to guard British North America against US encroachment, including invasion of US territories and punitive raids. This had resulted in Washington adopting a policy of appeasement towards states with claims to British territories, which clashed with Maine's expansionist intentions that continued to simmer during the 1830s. John Baker, often referred to in local lore as \\"Colonel\\" John Baker (a rank given him by a Maine militia) operated a gristmill and a sawmill on the north bank of the Saint John River, and was the leading American in the disputed territory. He was dissatisfied with the official borders, and in 1827 proclaimed an independent \\"Republic of Madawaska\\". John Baker was a native of Kennebec, Massachusetts. Kennebec was located within the area that became the state of Maine in 1820 and during his early adulthood Baker was a staunch promoter of the state's expansion toward the St.Lawrence. His confidence was such that he had established most of his mills (and himself) in an area that Washington had recognized as being under legitimate British control. The region was nonetheless claimed by Maine. Baker also had several facilities in the actual state of Maine but these were less substantial. Baker's \\"Republic\\" only included his New Brunswick properties and may have been a ploy to avoid paying taxes on either side, but the concept was popular with many of the local French speaking population who had no particular sympathies for the British or the Americans but felt a strong attachment to the area, as would Baker himself throughout his life. Baker was instrumental in the Aroostook War, a boundary dispute that led to resolution of the imprecise 1783 international border between New Brunswick and the state of Maine. Initiated by Maine, handling of the incident was quickly taken over by the US Government and settled with the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which left Baker's main residence and most of his mills firmly and definitively planted on British soil. Baker's name is interwoven with the boundary controversy that had led to the treaty. He had homes on both sides of the disputed territory, defied the officers of New Brunswick in many ways and was twice arrested and imprisoned in the Fredericton jail, where a statue and plaque today recognize his imprisonments and his contributions to the boundary settlement, as involuntary as they may have been. The last time that he was incarcerated was when he was indicted, tried and fined ¬£25 for high misdemeanors against King George IV on May 8, 1828, many years prior to the settlement of the dispute. By 1840 John Baker was in his mid-forties and his expanding business had become his main concern. His devotion to the cause of Maine was superseded by his own economic interests, and he remained in New Brunswick after the boundary settlement, grudgingly tolerating British sovereignty but never ceasing to consider himself nothing but an American. This put him at odds with the local British economic elite, and he associated mostly with like-minded French speaking and Irish settlers, providing financial support for local business ventures that would otherwise not have been possible and helping in the establishment of a mostly French speaking commercial class that rose much earlier than in other areas. He had also further endeared himself to French Canadians by supporting the establishment of a Roman Catholic mission in Baker Brook, which had never had as much as a chapel of any faith prior. Although Baker himself was nominally Protestant but not a religious man, he supported the mission as a welcome addition of community resources to \\"his\\" village. Most of his descendants married into Catholic French Canadian families, adopting both faith and language. Several hundred of his descendants still live in the \\"Republic\\" although very few bear his name. The millworks founded by Baker nearly two centuries ago is still in existence, supplying lumber to contractors in both New Brunswick and Quebec. John Baker has the distinction of being considered a hero to two causes. \\"Brayons\\" as French Canadians of the area are colloquially called, honor him as the founder of the \\"Republic of Madawaska\\", the strongest symbol of their unique identity. The state of Maine considers him a champion of American values. Ironically neither epithet is historically accurate. The Republic was not founded to cement regional identity, and Baker's support of Maine was not strong enough to keep him there. Baker's cultural legacy in northwestern New Brunswick was largely obscured in the century following his death. The steady rise of the Catholic Church's control over French Canadian educational and cultural institutions after 1840 had reached the area and found no reason to perpetuate the memory of a Protestant as a positive asset in local French Canadian history. Outside of Baker Brook, few heard bout him and the origins of the Republic were relegated to vague local legends. His memory would only be rekindled after the Catholic Church's demise among French Canadians in the 1960s and 70's. John Baker died at his country home on Chaleur Bay in 1868, shortly after New Brunswick had become part of the new sovereign country of Canada. He was buried in Baker Brook but would not be allowed to rest for all eternity. In 1895, his remains were transported to Fort Fairfield, Maine where a memorial to him as a \\"Maine Hero\\" had been established, owing to the efforts of his daughter.

Philips claims that in 1975 York's publications changed his declared birth year from 1935 to 1945, to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of The Mahdi, who is popularly believed to have been born in 1845.), also known as Malachi Z. York, Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi, Dr. York, et alii, is an American criminal, musician, and writer who is known as the founding leader of various religious/political groups, including most notably the United Nation of Nuwaubian Moors, a religious ministry/Native American tribe that has existed in some form since the 1960s.Moser, Bob. \\"'Savior' in a Strange Land: A black supremacist cult leader meets his match in rural Georgia\\", Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report 107 (Fall, 2002), as archived by the Internet Archive March 2005; He is a convicted child molester. He and his group were based in Brooklyn, New York. Around 1990 the community relocated to rural Putnam County, Georgia, where they built a large complex. York was convicted in 2004 of child molestation and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. He is serving a 135-year sentence. York began his ministry in the late 1960s. In 1967 he was preaching to the \\"Ansaaru Allah\\" (viz. African Americans) in Brooklyn, New York, during the period of the Black Power movement. He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on pseudo-Islamic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from \\"Ancient Egypt,\\" mixing ideas taken from black nationalism, cryptozoological and UFO religions, and popular conspiracy theory. He last called his group the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, or Nuwabians. York and the Nuwaubians came under scrutiny in the early 1990s, after they built Tama-Re, an Egyptian-themed \\"city\\" for about a hundred of his followers, in rural Putnam County, Georgia. Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers. York was arrested in May 2002. In 2004 he was convicted on federal charges of transporting minors across state lines for the purposes of sexual molestation, as well as racketeering and financial reporting violations. York's case was reported as the largest prosecution for child molestation ever directed at a single person in the history of the United States, both in terms of number of victims and number of incidents.

As an adolescent, he moved with his family to Teaneck, New Jersey. In the late 1960s York, calling himself \\"Imaam Isa\\", combined elements of the Moorish Science Temple of America, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths and Freemasonry, and founded a quasi- Muslim black nationalist movement and community. He called it \\"Ansaar Pure Sufi,\\" or the \\"Ansaaru Allah Community,\\" c. 1970.Carol Brennan, \\"York, Dwight D.\\", Encyclopedia.com, 2016 He instructed members to wear black and green dashikis. He later changed his name to \\"Imaam Isa Abdullah\\" and renamed his \\"Ansaar Pure Sufi\\" ministry to the \\"Nubians\\" in Brooklyn in 1967. The group was considered to be part of the Black Hebrews phenomenon, under the name \\"Nubian Islaamic Hebrews\\" and \\"Nubian Hebrew Mission\\" as of 1969.Glossary from McKee, Susan, \\"A Provisional History of Muslims in the United States\\" (work- in-progress), as archived by the Internet Archive, Jan. 2004; Unlike other groups, they were not Judeo-Christian but Judeo-Islamic.Philips, Abu Ameenah Bilal. The Ansar Cult in America Tawheed Publications, 1988, p. 3 This was also the period of Black Power among some African Americans. =Ansaaru Allah Community (1970)= York later traveled to Africa, to Sudan and Egypt in particular. He met and persuaded members of Mohamed Ahmed Al-Mahdi's family to finance him to set up a cell of their organization in the United States. This was to be a \\"west\\" or \\"American\\" political wing of Sudan's Ansar movement under Sadiq al-Mahdi (also see Umma Party). He began to develop the claim of his \\"Sudanese\\" roots in order to authenticate his American branch of the sect. After York returned from a pilgrimage to (Egypt and Sudan), he invited Sadiq Al-Mahdi to the US. In 1970 his group changed its name to the \\"Ansaaru Allah Community in the West.\\"\\"Ansaaru Allah Nubian Islamic Hebrews: Ourstory!\\", A 1993 FBI report described this group as a \\"front for a wide range of criminal activity, including arson, welfare fraud and extortion.\\"\\"Ancient Mystic Order of Malchizedek, Index of Cults and Religions\\", Watchman Fellowship ministry The group wrote: > The women of the Ansaaru Allah Community focus on memorizing history as > their Imam sees it, learning Arabic (many of them are quite fluent), > incorporating Sudanese etiquette into their mannerisms and memorizing the > Qur'an.

They practiced a mixture of Judaism and Islam. They were reported as numbering about 300 persons and in 1994 the group reportedly still owned nine apartment buildings, of which five were in tax arrears. Local politicians were concerned that the abandoned buildings would become centers of uses that would damage the neighborhood. Anecdotal reports were that some of the group went to Monroe County, New York, and others to Georgia.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Muslims Leave Bushwick: The Neighbors Ask Why,\\" New York Times, April 24, 1994  Musical productions  In the early 1980s, York performed as vocalist with his own groups, known as Jackie and the Starlights, the Students, and Passion. He launched his own record label, named Passion Productions, recording as the solo artist \\"Dr. York.\\" His debut release was the single \\"Only a Dream\\" (later included in the album New York, Hot Melt Records UK, 1985). \\"Dr. York\\" and Passion Productions were advertised in the May 4, 1985, issue of Billboard magazine. Later York formed York Records releasing the music of several successful artists within the genre of R&B;, Hip Hop, Gospel, and others.

They were called \\"Holy Tabernacle Ministries\\", \\" Church of Karast,\\" \\"Holy Seed Baptist Synagogue\\", \\"Ancient Mystic Order of Melchizedek\\", \\"Ancient Order\\", \\"All Eyez on Egypt\\", \\"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors\\", \\"Yamassee Native American Tribe\\", \\"Washitaw Tribe\\", and \\"Lodge 19 of the Ancient and Mystic Order of Malachizodok.\\"; While drawing from various religious and historical themes, Malachi York continued to focus on Nubia. He promoted a design featuring an ankh in the middle of a six-pointed star of Judaism and Islamic crescent, a symbol used by the Ansarullah Community. The ankh is associated with pre-Islamic Sudan, Nubia. Dwight York changed his name legally in 1990 to \\"Issa al Haadi al Mahdi\\" when he was still living in Brooklyn.\\"In the matter of the Application of Dwight York a/k/a/ Isa Muhammad, leave to change his name to Issa al Haadi al Mahdi,\\" N.Y.

He claimed to materialize sacred, healing ash in front of his followers, much in the fashion of Sathya Sai Baba.Philips, Abu Ameenah Bilal. The Ansar Cult, 1988, p. 36 (referring to York's 1985 books The Man of Miracles in This Day and Time and You Are Adam's Descendants) In 1988 York was convicted of obtaining a passport with a false birth certificate.Testimony of Jalaine Ward, quoted in Peecher, Rob. \\"FBI: York molested dozens; grand jury indicts Nuwaubian leader on 116 state counts\\", The Macon Telegraph, May 14, 2002 =Move to Georgia and construction of Tama-Re (1993‚Äì2002)= The central part of the \\"Tama-Re\\" compound, as seen from the air, 2002. Photograph by Kenneth C. Budd. York left Brooklyn with an estimated 300 followers about 1990. Some settled in upstate New York. He later moved with numerous followers to Georgia. Others joined them from such cities as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, New York and Washington, D.C. According to former follower Robert J. Rohan, who later wrote a book about the movement, York moved in order to avoid criminal investigations and other charges in New York.Sharon E. Crawford, \\"Former Nuwaubian writes book, tells how York duped followers,\\" The Macon Telegraph, 14 March 2005, posted at New Age Fraud website; accessed May 26, 2016 Perhaps to avoid scrutiny from the international Muslim community, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, legal troubles, and the negative history of his group during their New York period, he changed his own name several times, as well as the group's name, and masked different parts of their doctrine. In Georgia, they changed their name to the \\"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.\\" At York's direction, the community purchased land and built Tama-Re (originally named Kadesh), an Egyptian-themed complex built on of land near Eatonton, Georgia. It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993. Tensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney. Within Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to activists, claiming to be persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores \\"in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad.\\" And York purchased a $557,000 mansion in Athens, Georgia, about 60 miles away, the base of the University of Georgia. In July 1999, Time magazine reported on the \\"40-ft. pyramids, obelisks, gods, goddesses and a giant sphinx,\\" built by York's followers in rural Georgia in an article titled \\"Space Invaders\\".Joe Kovac Jr., \\"New Book Asks Provocative Questions About Dwight York\\", The Macon Telegraph, May 20, 2007, accessed May 25, 2016 In 2005 federal government officials acquired the property of Tama-Re through asset forfeiture after York was convicted and sentenced to prison for 135 years. He owed money for violating financial laws. After the property was sold, new owners demolished the buildings and monuments. = Arrest and conviction of child molestation (2002‚Äìpresent)= Beginning in Brooklyn, York had established strict sexual practices within the community, reserving for himself sexual access to many women and girls, including wives and children of followers. Theodore Gabriel wrote about these practices: > [W]hile extolling the virtues and importance of family life and the conjugal > relationship, he [York] denies such relationships to his followers except at > strictly controlled intervals.

UFO Religions, Routledge, 2003, p. 152 Anonymous letters were sent to Putnam County officials alleging child molestation at the Nuwaubian community. The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case: > When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut > back the number of counts listed ‚Äî from well beyond a thousand to slightly > more than 200 ‚Äî because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the > magnitude of York's evil.‚Ä¶ [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child > molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number > of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.Osinski, Bill.

York, Petitioner v. United States Docket for 05-1503] York's followers assert a number of defenses, including that their leader Malachi Z. York, who was charged and convicted, is not the same person as the Dwight D. York who is listed in court documents as the defendant. (One of York's sons is named Dwight, and sometimes the claim is made that it is York's son and not York who is or should be the real defendant.) Others say that York was \\"set up\\" by his son Jacob in coordination with al Qaeda-linked American mosques jealous of York's influence among black Muslims. York believes that his betrayal, arrest, trial and imprisonment (and eventual release) were foretold in chapter 10 of Zecharia Sitchin's The Wars of the Gods and the Men, with York being represented by Mar-duq in that story.York, Malachi Z.

His projected release date is July 12, 2120.Inmate Locator, Federal Bureau of Prisons York's followers have said that since 1999 York has been a Consul General of Monrovia, Liberia, under appointment from then-President Charles Taylor. They argue he should be given diplomatic immunity from prosecution and extradited as a persona non-grata to Liberia.\\"Liberian Repatriation Efforts\\" Nuwaubian Administration of International Affairs ; see also Johnson, Joe \\"Notaries play role in fake document ploy: York's sect at it again,\\" Athens Banner-Herald 20 December 2009 Officials have not accepted this claim.  Teachings  York has taught an ever-changing and multifaceted doctrine over the years, with influences and borrowings from many sources. It has included a baroque cosmology, unconventional theories about race and human origins, cryptozoological and extraterrestrial speculations, black nationalism, conspiracy theory, and religious practices invented or borrowed from many existing religions.  Claim of extraterrestrial origin  York has claimed to be an extraterrestrial master teacher from the planet Rizq. He wrote, \\"We have been coming to this planet before it had your life form on it. ... My incarnation as an Ilah Mutajassid or Avatara was originally in the year 1945 A.D. In order to get here I travelled by one of the smaller passenger crafts called SHAM out of a Motherplane called MERKABAH or NIBIRU.\\" This version of York came to Earth on March 16, 1970. (Comet Bennett, which was visible on that date, is said to have really been York‚Äôs spacecraft.) York taught that the Motherplane/NIBIRU would launch the Crystal City or New Jerusalem (see: Book of Revelation 21:2) to our solar system from its position in Orion. A 40-year process of taking the 144,000 Chosen Few (see: Book of Revelation 14:1) ‚Äî 12,000 each from the Twelve Tribes of Israel ‚Äî into the Planet Craft NIBIRU began on August 12, 2003 and will end on August 12, 2043. These Chosen Few will be groomed for 1,000 years and returned to Earth for the final battle against the Luciferians and also to redeem man from the 6,000-year rulership of the Devil and his seed. Descent York has had a variety of stories about his ancestry and birth, including that he was born in Omdurman, Sudan. This has not been documented. His parents of record are Mary C. York (n√©e Williams), now also known as Faatimah Maryam, and her husband David Piper York. York has claimed that his biological father was Al Haadi Abdur Rahman Al Mahdi, whom his mother ostensibly met while studying as a student in the Sudan. This is not supported by any documentary sources. York claims that the name he was given at birth was \\"Isa Al Haadi Al Mahdi\\" and that he was not given the name \\"York\\" (without a first name) until a month later when he and his mother returned to Boston.\\"Issue #1 Who is Dwight D.

As a result of these modifications, the improved version of Morane had a 36-mph speed advantage over all previous versions. Lakomaa was recruited to Saab in 1944 as an aircraft designer. He was involved in the development of the fighters Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen, and later headed R&D; at Saab where he designed a number of prototypes, including a rocket propelled interceptor, nuclear weapon carriers, replacements for the Draken and Viggen, which was initially developed to substitute the Saab 32, and a supersonic business jet.

He was active in the Civil Rights Movement as one of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and as a minister. Boyd was also active in the anti- Vietnam War movement. In 1977 Boyd \\"came out\\", revealing that he was homosexual and becoming a spokesman for gay rights. In 1965, Boyd published a book of prayers, Are You Running with Me, Jesus?, which became a bestseller.Pat McCaughan, \\"Malcolm Boyd at 90: Still writing, still ‚Äòrunning,‚Äô still inspiring\\" , Episcopal News Service, 7 June 2013, accessed 11 January 2015 In 2005 it was published in a 40th-anniversary edition. In 2013 he served as a poet/writer in residence at St. Paul Cathedral in Los Angeles.  Early life  Boyd was born in 1923 in Buffalo, New York, the son of Beatrice Lowrie, a fashion model, and Melville Boyd, a financier and investment banker whose own father (also named Malcolm) was an Episcopal priest... Boyd was raised as an Episcopalian (his maternal grandfather was Jewish).. In the early 1930s Boyd's parents divorced; his mother retained custody of him. Boyd moved with his mother to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then to Denver. During his time in college, despite early spiritual interests, he decided he was an atheist. In the 1940s Boyd moved to Hollywood and rented a room in $15.00 a week boarding house on Franklin Avenue. He owned few possessions and only one shirt, but was eventually given a position at a large agency and became a Hollywood junior producer.. He began moving up in the Hollywood world, eventually founding PRB, a production company, with Mary Pickford, becoming her business partner. At the same time, amidst all the abundance and glamour of Hollywood, he found himself looking for meaning in different places, including churches.  Priesthood  In 1951 Boyd began studying to become a priest at the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, California.. He graduated in 1954 and was ordained a deacon. In 1955 he continued his studies abroad in England and Switzerland and returned to Los Angeles for ordination as a priest. During 1956 and 1957, Boyd studied further at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York and wrote his first book, Crisis in Communication. In 1959 Boyd became Episcopal Chaplain at Colorado State University. In the 1960s Boyd became known as \\"the Espresso Priest\\" for his religiously themed poetry-reading sessions at the Hungry i nightclub in San Francisco, at the time of the San Francisco Renaissance poetry movement. Boyd recalled in an interview with The Lavender effect that the San Francisco Chronicle once called him \\"Marlon Brando in a collar,\\" due to his Hollywood connections and attractive appearance.  Activism  Boyd went on to become a minister in the American Civil Rights Movement, promoting integration and voting rights. He participated as one of the Freedom Riders in 1961. Later that year he became the Episcopal Chaplain at Wayne State University in Detroit. He held a weekly meeting about civil rights, influencing Viola Liuzzo. Three years later she went to Selma, Alabama, to participate in the voting rights marches organized by SCLC and SNCC. She was murdered by the Klan while transporting marchers from Montgomery back to Selma following the successful march ending on March 25. In 1963 Boyd attended an interfaith conference for racial integration in Chicago. Malcolm X referred to Boyd at the conference in his 1963 speech, \\"The Old Negro and the New Negro.\\" Malcolm X said, \\"Rev. Boyd believes that the conference might have accomplished much good if the speakers had included a white supremacist and a Negro race leader, preferably a top man in the American Black Muslim movement.\\" He quotes Boyd: Boyd was also active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, leading demonstrations and teach-ins in protest of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1970, Boyd was among 17 antiwar protesters, which also included Daniel Berrigan, who were arrested for attempting to celebrate a \\"mass for peace\\" at The Pentagon. = Later life and works = In 1977 Boyd came out of the closet, becoming one of the first prominent American clergymen to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality. In the 1980s Boyd met Mark Thompson, an author, journalist and activist. Boyd and Thompson were domestic partners for almost 30 years and were married in 2013.. Boyd considered his partnership and marriage to Thompson to be one of the most fulfilling aspects of his life. They resided in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Boyd served on the Advisory Board of White Crane Institute, and was a frequent contributor to the homosexual wisdom and culture magazine White Crane. Boyd was the author of over 30 books, including a bestselling collection of prayers, Are You Running with Me, Jesus? (1965). Are You Running With Me, Jesus was a great success, and gained Boyd a reasonable amount of public attention and fame, which continued throughout his life. It was re-issued in a 40th-anniversary edition. Until his death he wrote a column for The Huffington Post.. He served as a poet/writer in residence for the Diocese of Los Angeles. Boyd died of complications from pneumonia at the age of 91 in Los Angeles on February 27, 2015.

Publication history Madcap first appeared in Captain America #307 (July 1985), and was created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary. Most of the villains Gruenwald introduced Captain America in were created to symbolize aspects of contemporary American culture and the world political situation. Gruenwald stated, \\"Madcap represents purposelessness, the disaffected youth of today who thinks 'What's the reason for doing anything?' The ultimate dropout generation.\\" Fictional character biography Madcap (true name unknown) was originally a deeply religious young man. On the way to a picnic with his family and church community, their bus collides with a tanker truck full of Compound X07 (an experimental nerve agent developed by A.I.M.). Everyone aboard the bus, including his parents and sister Katy, are killed, leaving him as the only survivor, his body mixing with the Compound. When being told of the deaths of all his friends and family, his mind shatters, his belief in a rational universe swept away. Leaving the hospital, he attempts suicide by throwing himself in front of traffic. He is injured but the wounds heal almost instantly. This pushes him further over the edge. After purchasing a toy soap bubble pistol from a dime store and donning a garish clown costume stolen from the Ace Costume Shop, the newly christened Madcap sets out to convince others that life is entirely without reason. Spewing absurdist philosophy, he runs rampant through the streets of Manhattan, causing mass chaos and a riot. Nomad tries to stop him, but Madcap uses his madness-inducing powers on him as well.Captain America #307 Nomad recovers, tracks Madcap to a shack in an old fairground at Coney Island, and defeats him there.Captain America #309 Madcap is confined to a mental hospital but escapes. He gets back into costume and breaks up a shipment of illegal arms organized by the Rose. In the course of the fight he meets Dollar Bill, who runs a Manhattan public-access television cable TV show. The two film A Day in the Life of a Superhero, which is interrupted when Rose's underlings abduct Madcap. Taken to a warehouse, Madcap is tied up, beaten, and assaulted with an axe. Daredevil intervenes, but in the subsequent fight the warehouse is burned down, and Madcap ignores Daredevil's repeated appeals to get out of the fire. When his body is found, Madcap is declared legally dead but slowly returns to life while in the morgue. He returns to Dollar Bill's show.Daredevil #234 While watching an episode of the show, a bored Katie Power and Franklin Richards of Power Pack decide that Madcap would be someone with whom they could go on an \\"adventure\\". Madcap agrees, but his idea of adventure is to cause chaos and confusion all over town and even go head-on to confront armed bank robbers. Katie and Franklin disapprove of his irreverent attitude, but it teaches the two pre-adolescents a lesson in responsibility.Power Pack #34 Madcap encounters She-Hulk, and she defeats him on a day when she is trying to have a quiet walk in the park.She-Hulk Vol. 2 #9; This appearance has a more comical tone. The Sensational She-Hulk series was a satirical commentary on comics; She-Hulk and other characters often break the fourth wall and address the writers and artists directly. The actual continuity of this issue is ambiguous. Madcap is later captured by Vice and Triphammer of the Power Tools on the order of Dr. Karl Malus and is rescued by Hawkeye.Avengers Spotlight #29 The Impossible Woman asks Madcap to teach her daughter Impia how to have fun. As part of his demonstration, Madcap uses his powers on Quasar.Impossible Man Summer Vacation Spectacular #1 Madcap exercises his power at Grand Central Station. By the time Ghost Rider arrives, the entire station is rampant with people murdering each other and killing themselves. Ghost Rider saves whomever he can, then beats Madcap and subjects him to the Penance Stare. Madcap feels all the pain he has caused his victims and likes it: it is the first real sensation he has felt in some time, and he vows to continue, in order to experience the Stare again.Ghost Rider vol. 3 #33 He later tries to escape from the Vault, a prison for superhumans and is stopped by Citizen V.Thunderbolts Annual 1997 Silver Sable, leader of the country of Symkaria, hires a team of super-powered heroes to help protect a mad scientist from capture by the group Heroes for Hire. Sable believes one of her employees is the aforementioned Nomad but soon discovers she hired Madcap instead. The teams confront each other in the monastery of St. Eboar's, deep in Symkaria. Deadpool and Madcap each learn the other is hard to injure and, delighted, fight on that basis. Deadpool is overwhelmed and teleports out. Madcap, despite his chaotic nature, obeys orders, guarding Misty Knight and Colleen Wing. His bad Monty Python routines are interrupted by Deadpool, who temporarily defeats him with a blow that seemingly snaps Madcap's neck. Madcap returns minutes later to battle Deadpool once again. The entire incident, plus more, turns out to have been engineered by the villain Master of the World. Madcap is among those considered by Blackout and the Deacon to help them assassinate Ghost Rider.Ghost Rider vol. 6 #33 He then works on a mission to kill Ghost Rider.Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire #2 Madcap later appears as a member of the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil, at the time when the Secret Avengers raid Bagalia to recruit Taskmaster to their side.Secret Avengers Vol. 2 #2 Prior to the Secret Invasion, Madcap once again encounters Deadpool, and in the midst of an altercation with Daredevil and Thor, Thor's lightning reduces the two to a large pile of ash. Though it initially seems that only Deadpool regenerates and survives, he eventually realizes the two actually regenerated as one being, with Madcap becoming one of the \\"voices\\" within Deadpool's head (explaining the appearance of a new, \\"extra\\" voice in Deadpool's appearances in Wolverine: Origins and Deadpool vol. 2). After Madcap's personality asserts itself sufficiently to use his own powers in a later altercation with Thor and Luke Cage, Deadpool convinces Madcap to manipulate the two affected heroes into tearing Deadpool's body in half, with one half regenerating fully as Deadpool, and the other as Madcap.Deadpool Annual #1 Eight months after the events of Secret Wars, Madcap was revealed to have been psychologically damaged even further by his fusion with and separation from Deadpool. When Deadpool founded the Mercs for Money, Madcap infiltrated the team, feigning benevolence and incompetence. Madcap afterward began impersonating Deadpool, attacking the anti-hero's allies and using his powers to incite violence throughout New York City in Deadpool's name. Upon discovering that Madcap was responsible for the chaos, Deadpool lured him out by using his own daughter, Ellie, as bait, and confronted Madcap alongside Masacre, the Deadpool of Mexico. Madcap gained the upper hand in the brawl, which ended with him using Deadpool's own Chitaurian molecular disintegrator on himself. Afterward, Deadpool found himself being \\"haunted\\" by vivid hallucinations of Madcap. Madcap resurfaces during Civil War II as a parasitic entity that is forcing its human host to act against Deadpool. After luring Deadpool to the Central Park Zoo, Madcap and his host infect him with a stolen virus that Deadpool begins unknowingly spreading to the people of New York City. Deadpool acquires a cure to the virus and locates Madcap, whose host is revealed to be Bob, Agent of Hydra. When Deadpool infers that everything that Madcap remembers about his past is a lie, an enraged Madcap detaches from Bob to attack him, and proceeds to escape under the cover of an explosion while swearing further revenge on Deadpool. After Madcap nearly ruins his Valentine's Day, Deadpool ventures into space in search of a weapon that can permanently kill the villain, and while there he strikes a bargain with the Collector, who agrees to imprison Madcap in his museum. When Madcap seeks him out, Deadpool successfully ensnares \\"the indestructible clown\\" for the Collector. As Madcap is hauled away, Deadpool realizes that the victory is a hollow one after Madcap gloats that he no longer cares about ruining Deadpool's life, as Deadpool's recent dealings with Stryfe and Hydra have already accomplished that for him. Powers and abilities Madcap possesses two superpowers, as a result of the mutagenic effects of his exposure to Compound X07. * He heals from any physical injury instantly, and even if he sustains enough damage to kill him (such as being flattened or having his neck snapped) or destroy him (such as being incinerated), he will immediately resurrect. Somehow linked to this is a total inability to perceive pain. The only time he ever felt pain was when he was trapped in Deadpool‚Äôs head. He can mentally control his severed limbs. His rapid healing ability also gives him phenomenal endurance, as his body both eliminates fatigue poisons and heals muscle damage caused by overexertion almost instantaneously. * Madcap has a specialized form of insanity-inducement that immediately affects those he makes eye contact with. He wears a garish purple-and-yellow costume and uses a distracting toy soap bubble-gun, called a \\"fun-gun\\", to draw the attention of others towards him, so they can meet his gaze. He has the ability to stimulate the inhibition centers in other people's brains. People affected by his power act in a euphoric, outlandish, uninhibited manner that verges on or becomes insanity and can end up killing themselves. Madcap cannot control how the person acts. The duration of the state seems to be approximately 15‚Äì30 minutes, though Madcap risks making a person \\"pleasantly loony\\" permanently if he makes additional eye contact with them. This power can interact unpredictably with individuals already affected with mental instability; for example, exposure initially seemed to have no effect on Deadpool, but then resulted in his experiencing a brief period of clarity and sanity. Later, his power's effect on normal humans seems to show that he can influence their behavior to some extent.

Just as the IJA in general was modeled mainly on the German Army, the IJAAS initially developed along similar lines to the Imperial German Army Aviation; its primary mission was to provide tactical close air support for ground forces, as well as a limited air interdiction capability. The IJAAS also provided aerial reconnaissance to other branches of the IJA. While the IJAAS engaged in strategic bombing of cities such as Shanghai, Nanking, Canton, Chongqing, Rangoon, and Mandalay, this was not the primary mission of the IJAAS, and it lacked a heavy bomber force. It did not usually control artillery spotter/observer aircraft; artillery battalions controlled the light aircraft and balloons that operated in these roles. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service was responsible for long-range bomber and attack aircraft, as well as strategic air defense. It was not until the later stages of the Pacific War that the two air arms attempted to integrate the air defense of the home islands. HistoryOrigins= French Military Mission to Japan 1918-1919. The Imperial Japanese Army made use of hydrogen balloons for observation purposes in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 and in 1909, together with the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Tokyo Imperial University, the Rinji Gunyo Kikyu Kenkyukai (Temporary Military Balloon Research Association) was set up. In 1910, the society sent Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa and Captain Hino Kumaz≈ç to France and Germany, respectively, to receive pilot training and purchase aircraft. Japan purchased its first aircraft, a Farman biplane and a Grade monoplane, which had been brought back by the officers from Western Europe. On December 19 1910, Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa in a Farman III conducted the first successful powered flight on Japanese soil at Yoyogi Parade Ground in Tokyo. The following year in 1911, several more aircraft were imported and an improved version of the Farman III biplane, the Kaishiki No.1, was built and flown in Japan by Captain Togugawa. In 1914, with the outbreak of war, the Japanese laid siege to the German colony of Tsingtao, aircraft from the army together with the navy conducted reconnaissance and bombing operations. The Provisional Air Corps consisting of four Maurice Farman MF.7 biplanes and a single Nieuport VI-M monoplane flew 86 sorties between them. In December 1915, a air battalion was created under the Army Transport Command, which became responsible for all air operations. However, serious interest in military aviation did not develop until after World War I. Japanese military observers in Western Europe were quick to spot the advantages of the new technology, and after the end of the war, Japan purchased large numbers of surplus military aircraft, including Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutters, Nieuport 24s, and Spads. =Interwar Years= Siberian intervention In 1918, a French military mission was invited to Japan to help develop aviation. The mission was headed by Jacques-Paul Faure and composed of 63 members to establish the fundamentals of the Japanese aviation, the mission also brought several aircraft including Salmson 2A2, Nieuport, Spad XIII, two Breguet XIV, as well as Caquot dirigables. Japanese army aviation was organized into a separate chain of command within the Ministry of War of Japan in 1919, and aircraft were being used in combat roles during the 1920 Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army near Vladivostok. The first aircraft factory in Japan, Nakajima Aircraft Company, was founded in 1916 and later obtained a license to produce the Nieuport 24 and Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 C.1 (as the Nakajima Ko-4) as well as the Hispano- Suiza engine. Nakajima later license-produced the Gloster Sparrowhawk and Bristol Jupiter. Similarly, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries started producing aircraft under license from Sopwith in 1921, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries started producing the Salmson 2 A.2 bomber from France, and hired German engineers such as Dr. Richard Vogt to produce original designs such as the Type 88 bomber. Kawasaki also produced aircraft engines under license from BMW. In May 1925, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Corps was established under the command of Lieutenant General Kinichi Yasumitsu, it was regarded as a branch equal to the artillery, cavalry or infantry, and contained 3,700 personnel with about 500 aircraft. By the end of the 1920s, Japan was producing its own designs to meet the needs of the Army, and by 1935 had a large inventory of indigenous aircraft designs that were technically sophisticated. By 1941, the Japanese Army Air Force had about 1,500 combat aircraft. During the first years of the war, Japan continued technical development and deployment of increasingly advanced aircraft and enjoyed air superiority over most battlefields due to the combat experience of its crews and the handling qualities of its aircraft. However, as the war continued, Japan found that its production could not match that of the Allies. On top of these production problems, Japan faced continuous combat and thus continued losses. Furthermore, there were continual production disruptions brought on by moving factories from location to location, each transfer with the goal of avoiding the Allied strategic bombing. Between these factors and others, such as the restricted strategic materials, the Japanese found themselves materialistically outmatched. In terms of manpower, Japan was even worse off. Experienced crews were killed and replacements had not been planned. The Japanese had lost skilled trainers, and they did not have the fuel or the time to use the trainers they did have. Because of this, towards the end of its existence the JAAF resorted to kamikaze attacks against overwhelmingly superior Allied forces.

The officer commanding the chutai was the Chutaicho, whose rank was usually that of captain. The commander's aircraft often had distinctive markings, often a partly or totally scarlet, red, orange or yellow tail. In a reorganization of 1927-05-05, the was created, each consisting of two battalions, with each battalion consisting of up to four squadrons. Each Air Regiment was a mixed purpose unit, consisting of a mixture of fighter and reconnaissance squadrons. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, operational conditions favored the use of many small units, resulting in the creation of many or even , each with its own distinctive markings. In August 1938, a complete re-organization of the Army Air Service resulted in the creation of the , which replaced all of the former Air Battalions and Air Regiments. Each Air Combat Group was a single-purpose unit consisting typically of three Squadrons, divided into three of three aircraft each. Together with reserve aircraft and the headquarters flight, an Air Combat Group typically had 45 aircraft (fighter) or up to 30 aircraft (bomber or reconnaissance). Two or more Air Combat Groups formed an , which, together with base and support units and a number of Independent Squadrons, formed an . In 1942, the Air Corps were renamed , to mirror the terminology for infantry divisions, but the structure remained the same. Two Air Divisions, together with some independent units made an . Throughout most of the Pacific War, the Japanese Army Air Service was organized into four Air Armies, with two more added in the final stages of the war: * 1st Air Army ‚Äì HQ Tokyo, basing in the Kanto Plain covering the Japanese home islands, Taiwan, Korea, Chishima, and Karafuto. * 2nd Air Army - HQ Hsinking, covering Manchukuo * 3rd Air Army - HQ Singapore, covering Southeast Asia * 4th Air Army - HQ Rabaul, covering the Solomon Islands and New Guinea * 5th Air Army - HQ Nanking, covering Japanese- occupied portions of southern and eastern China. * 6th Air Army ‚Äì on Ky≈´sh≈´ covering Taiwan and Okinawa In April 1944, a reorganization of the Japanese Army Air Service occurred. Maintenance and ground service units, formerly a separate command, were merged into the Air Combat Group (Hiko Sentai). The flying squadrons of the Air Combat Group were re-designated as , and the ground units were designated . Other changes in the final stages of the war was the formation of \\"Special Attack Units\\" and \\"Air-shaking Units\\", which were short-lived units with their own names (often taken from Japanese mythology or history) and markings, but located within existing squadrons. These units were specially designated and trained with the mission of air-to- air ramming of Allied bomber aircraft. They usually had their armaments removed and their airframes reinforced. In the final phase of the war, the Special Attack Units evolved into dedicated suicide units for kamikaze missions. Around 170 of these units were formed, 57 by the Instructor Air Division alone. Notionally equipped with 12 aircraft each, it eventually comprised around 2000 aircraft. The final reorganisation of the took place during preparation for Operation Ketsu-Go, the defence of the home islands in 1945 when all the Air Armies were combined under a centralised command of General Masakazu Kawabe .p.107, Skates Special Operations Forces Teishin Shudan (\\"Raiding Group\\") was the IJA's special forces/airborne unit during World War II. The word teishin may be literally translated as \\"dash forward\\", and is usually translated as \\"raiding\\". It may also be regarded as similar to the \\"commando\\" designation in the terminology of other armies. Called a division, the unit was a brigade-sized force, and was part of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS). The Teishin units were therefore distinct from the marine parachute units of the Special Naval Landing Forces. Captain Okuyama and Giretsu Airborne unit depart on their mission to Okinawa was an airborne special forces unit of the Imperial Japanese Army formed from Army paratroopers, in late 1944 as a last-ditch attempt to reduce and delay Allied bombing raids on the Japanese home islands. The Giretsu Special Forces unit was commanded by Lieutenant General Kyoji Tominaga.  Strength  In 1940 the Japanese Army Air Service consisted of the following: ** 33,000 personnel ** Over 1,600 aircraft (including 1,375 first line combat aircraft). ** The aircraft were organized into 85 Squadrons; *** 36 fighter *** 28 light bomber *** 22 medium bomber *Total military in August 1945 was 6,095,000 including 676,863 Army Air Service. First Tachikawa Army Air Arsenal The Japanese Air Army Force had one technical section, the First Tachikawa Air Army Arsenal, which was in charge of aviation research and development. The Arsenal included a testing section for captured Allied aircraft, the Air Technical Research Laboratory (Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo). The Army Air Arsenal was also connected with Tachikawa Hikoki K.K. and Rikugun Kokukosho K.K., the Army-owned and operationed aircraft manufacturing companies. much as the IJNAS operated its own firm, the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal.  Army Escort-Aircraft Carriers  Due to the poor relations between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy, the Army found it necessary to procure and operate their own aircraft carriers for the purposes of providing escort and protection for Army transport shipping convoys. These escort/transport carriers were converted from small passenger liners or merchant ships and possessed the capacity to operate from eight to 38 aircraft, depending on type and size, and were also used to transport personnel and tanks. These vessels included the Taiy≈ç Maru, Unyo Maru, Chuyo Maru, Kaiy≈ç Maru, Shinyo Maru, Kamakura Maru, Akitsu Maru, Nigitsu Maru, Kumano Maru, Yamashiro Maru, Shimane Maru, Chigusa Maru (not completed), and Otakisan Maru (not completed) and were operated by civilian crews with Army personnel manning the light and medium anti-aircraft guns.  Uniforms and equipment  As an integral part of the IJA, the Army Air Service wore the standard Imperial Japanese Army Uniforms. Only flying personnel and ground crews wore sky blue trim and stripes, while officers wore their ranks on sky blue patches.

Symptoms range from amenorrhea, infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and pain, to normal functioning depending on the nature of the defect. Types The American Fertility Society (now American Society of Reproductive Medicine) Classification distinguishes: * Class I: M√ºllerian agenesis (absent uterus). ** Uterus is not present, vagina only rudimentary or absent. The condition is also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. The patient with MRKH syndrome will have primary amenorrhea. * Class II: Unicornuate uterus (a one- sided uterus). ** Only one side of the M√ºllerian duct forms. The uterus has a typical \\"banana shape\\" on imaging systems. * Class III: Uterus didelphys, also uterus didelphis (double uterus). ** Both M√ºllerian ducts develop but fail to fuse, thus the patient has a \\"double uterus\\". This may be a condition with a double cervix and a vaginal partition (v.i.), or the lower M√ºllerian system fused into its unpaired condition. See Triplet-birth with Uterus didelphys for a case of a woman having spontaneous birth in both wombs with twins. * Class IV: Bicornuate uterus (uterus with two horns). ** Only the upper part of that part of the M√ºllerian system that forms the uterus fails to fuse, thus the caudal part of the uterus is normal, the cranial part is bifurcated. The uterus is \\"heart-shaped\\". * Class V: Septated uterus (uterine septum or partition). ** The two M√ºllerian ducts have fused, but the partition between them is still present, splitting the system into two parts. With a complete septum the vagina, cervix and the uterus can be partitioned. Usually the septum affects only the cranial part of the uterus. A uterine septum is the most common uterine malformation and a cause for miscarriages. It is diagnosed by medical image techniques, i.e. ultrasound or an MRI. MRI is considered the preferred modality due to its multiplanar capabilities as well as its ability to evaluate the uterine contour, junctional zone, and other pelvic anatomy. A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. A uterine septum can be corrected by hysteroscopic surgery. Hysterosalpingography of a T shaped uterus * Class VI: DES uterus. ** The uterine cavity has a \\"T-shape\\" as a result of fetal exposure to diethylstilbestrol. An additional variation is the arcuate uterus where there is a concave dimple in the uterine fundus within the cavity. A rudimentary uterus is a uterine remnant not connected to cervix and vagina and may be found on the other side of a unicornuate uterus. Patients with uterine abnormalities may have associated renal abnormalities including unilateral renal agenesis. Diagnosis Besides a physical examination, the physician will need imaging techniques to determine the character of the malformation: gynecologic ultrasonography, pelvic MRI, or hysterosalpingography. A hysterosalpingogram is not considered as useful due to the inability of the technique to evaluate the exterior contour of the uterus and distinguish between a bicornuate and septate uterus. In addition, laparoscopy and/or hysteroscopy may be indicated. In some patients the vaginal development may be affected. Treatment Surgical intervention depends on the extent of the individual problem. With a didelphic uterus surgery is not usually recommended. A uterine septum can be resected in a simple out-patient procedure that combines laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. This procedure greatly decreases the rate of miscarriage for women with this anomaly. Prevalence The prevalence of uterine malformation is estimated to be 6.7% in the general population, slightly higher (7.3%) in the infertility population, and significantly higher in a population of women with a history of recurrent miscarriages (16%).

The film was produced by HIT Entertainment and released in the United States on April 22, 2005 and the United Kingdom on May 13, 2005. Although Lady and Diesel 10 appear in this special, it is not an exact sequel to Thomas and the Magic Railroad, in which those characters first appeared. Plot One summer day, the Fat Controller announces that a new airport is to be built on Sodor, to accommodate more holiday makers, but Arry and Bert biff their trucks into Thomas and Percy, angering them. At the timberyard later, they boast to Thomas that they got a very important job because Diesels are better than steam engines, and Thomas responds by biffing them so hard, their timber falls onto the tracks. When Diesel confronts them, giving a similar boast, Thomas replies by pranking Diesel and giving him bananas to pull, but as a result, Tidmouth Sheds, having been demolished for renovations, is not rebuilt on time. As a result, all the engines are forced to sleep on different parts on the Island. That night, a huge storm sweeps across the island and the Sodor Suspension Bridge collapses. The next morning, the Fat Controller orders the engines to clear up the storm damage before the work can continue. At the suspension bridge, a beam needs to be placed and Thomas is nearly unable to carry it, but using all his strength, he manages to lower the beam into place. Later, Thomas is collecting paint for the bridge, but Diesel rams Thomas's flatbed and makes paint splash all over Thomas. The event escalates until all the engines are fighting. That evening, The Fat Controller is furious at such delays and warns the engines that any more disturbances may result in the airport being unopened and the railway being put out of business. Most of the engines dream of humiliating fates for them if the Fat Controller decides to also close the railway. In the dreams, James becomes a carnival game, Gordon becomes a playground, Edward becomes a scarecrow and Percy becomes a roller coaster ride. However, Thomas dreams of seeing Lady telling him about the need for teamwork. The next morning, Thomas finds Mavis, and they agree to arrange a meeting for the steam engines and Diesels at the coaling plant. The following day, at the meeting, Thomas proposes that the steam engines and Diesels finally put their differences aside and begin working together to save the airport. Very soon, the airport is complete and the first aeroplane is sent to Sodor, but when Thomas accidentally derails some trucks due to bumpy rails, they hit the water tower, which falls and shatters on the runway, cracking it. With even Harvey coming too late to fix it himself, Thomas gathers his courage and asks Diesel 10 to help them and he eventually follows Thomas to the airport. With the aid of even Arry and Bert, Thomas collects George to fix the runway and the aeroplane lands at last. That evening, the engines are happy to see Tidmouth Sheds rebuilt, especially Emily when she finds that an extra berth has been built for her. Characters All the members of \\"The Steam Team\\" (the main cast of characters as portrayed since Season 8) make appearances in the film. Diesels with major roles include Diesel, Mavis, 'Arry, and Bert. Various supporting characters make appearances in the feature's music videos. Daisy makes her first appearance in the series since Season 4, and Derek appears for the first (and only) time outside of \\"Double Teething Troubles\\" from Season 5. 2 engines introduced in Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Lady and Diesel 10 play roles in the film, although no direct references are made to Magic Railroad.

(born Francesco Possenti March 1, 1838 ‚Äì February 27, 1862) was an Italian Passionist clerical student. Born to a professional family, he gave up ambitions of a secular career to enter the Passionist congregation. His life in the monastery was not extraordinary, yet he followed the rule of the congregation perfectly and was known for his great devotion to the sorrows of the Virgin Mary. He died from tuberculosis at the age of 23 in Isola del Gran Sasso, in the province of Teramo. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920. Early life Francesco Possenti was born on March 1, 1838, in Assisi, Italy, the eleventh of thirteen children born to his mother, Agnes, and his father, Sante. The family were then resident in the town of Assisi where Sante worked for the local government. Possenti was baptised on the day of his birth in the same font in which Saint Francis of Assisi had been baptised.Burke C.P., E., ‚ÄúHappy Was My Youth ‚Äì Saint Gabriel ‚Äì Passionist‚Äù, page 2. Gill and Son, 1961 Shortly after Francis' birth Sante Possenti was transferred to a post at Montalta and thence to Spoleto where, in 1841, he was appointed legal assessor. In Spoleto the family was struck with a number of bereavements: the deaths of a baby girl, Rosa, in December 1841; of seven-year-old Adele in January 1842; and of Francis‚Äô mother, Agnes, in 1842. As a child and young man, Francesco Possenti was well liked by his peers and had a reputation for great charity and piety. He was also known for the great care he took with regard to his appearance and would spend hours in preparing himself for parties. Francesco could be a difficult child and was liable to bouts of anger. Francesco was deeply involved with the social scene of Spoleto and soon earned for himself the nickname of \\"the dancer\\".Cingolani, C.P., G., ‚ÄúSaint Gabriel Possenti, Passionist: A Young Man in Love‚Äù, page 24. Alba House, 1997 He was a ladies man and had several romantic involvements and on the night he left for the Passionists there were still hopes that he might become engaged to a local girl, Maria Panachetti, who was in love with him and who had been on several dates with him. (This same girl later attended Gabriel's Beatification and Canonisation.) He was educated first by the Christian Brothers and then by the Jesuits in the town's college and there excelled, particularly in Latin. In 1851 Francis became desperately ill and promised to enter religious life if he recovered. Once he had recovered, his promise was soon forgotten. The same thing happened when he narrowly escaped a stray bullet during a hunting expedition with friends.Mead C.P., J. ‚ÄúSt. Gabriel: A Youthful Gospel Portrait‚Äù, page 42. L‚ÄôEco di S. Gabriele, 1985 His brother Paul had died in 1848 and his brother Lawrence committed suicide in 1853. In 1853 Francesco again fell ill, this time afflicted with a throat abscess. He attributed his healing to the recently beatified Andrew Bobola, SJ. Once more he had promised to enter religious life upon his recovery and this time actually set the process in motion. He applied to join the Jesuits, but for some unknown reason never proceeded. Tragedy struck again when his sister, Mary Louisa, who had cared for Francesco after their mother's death, died of cholera. Vocation After the cholera epidemic that killed Gabriel's sister ended, Spoleto clergy and civic authorities organised a procession of the ancient icon of the Virgin Mary in Spoleto's cathedral. Francis attended the procession and as the image passed by him, he felt an interior voice asking why he remained in the world. This event was the galvanising force behind the first serious steps in Francis‚Äô religious vocation.Cingolani, C.P., G., ‚ÄúSaint Gabriel Possenti, Passionist: A Young Man in Love‚Äù, page 50. Alba House, 1997 After the procession he sought the advice of a priest and resolved to enter the Passionist Congregation. As there was no Passionist house near Spoleto, it is most likely that Francis‚Äô choice was based on a personal devotion to the Passion of Christ.Mead C.P., J. ‚ÄúSt. Gabriel: A Youthful Gospel Portrait‚Äù, page 29. L‚ÄôEco di S. Gabriele, 1985 His father refused to give him permission to leave for the Passionists and enlisted several relatives to dissuade Francis from his course. Their attempts were unsuccessful and soon his father was convinced that Francis' intentions were sincere and not capricious. Passionist St. Gabriel Accompanied by his brother Aloysius, a Dominican friar, Francis set out for the novitiate of the Passionists at Morrovalle. During their journey they visited several relatives who had been enlisted by Sante to encourage Francis to return to Spoleto, but this was to no avail. He arrived at the novitiate on September 19, 1856. Two days later he received the habit of the Passionists and the name \\"Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows\\". The following year Gabriel pronounced his vows. During this time, and indeed until his death, Gabriel's spiritual life was under the care of his director, Father Norbert of Holy Mary. In June 1858 Gabriel and the other students moved to Pietvetorina to continue their studies. Local disturbances meant they would stay only a year and, in July 1859, the group moved to the monastery of Isola del Gran Sasso in the province of Teramo.Mead C.P., J. ‚ÄúSt. Gabriel: A Youthful Gospel Portrait‚Äù, page 37. L‚ÄôEco di S. Gabriele, 1985 Gabriel proved an excellent student and his excellence in academic life was only outdone by the great progress he was making in his spiritual life. At the same time Gabriel began to display the first symptoms of tuberculosis. The news did not worry Gabriel who was, in fact, joyful; he had prayed for a slow death so as to be able to prepare himself spiritually. Throughout his illness he remained cheerful and kept up all his usual practises. He was a source of great edification and inspiration to his fellow students, who sought to spend time with him at his deathbed. Gabriel had proved himself an exemplary religious and a perfect follower of the Passionist Rule, being especially devoted to the Virgin Mary. On his deathbed he ordered his spiritual writings to be burnt for he feared they would tempt him to pride. Only his letters survive, alongside his ‚ÄòResolutions‚Äô which map the spiritual progress he made in his few years as a Passionist.Cingolani, C.P., G., ‚ÄúSaint Gabriel Possenti, Passionist: A Young Man in Love‚Äù, page 147. Alba House, 1997 Before he could be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso the early hours of February 27, 1862, in the presence of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he sat up in bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death. Canonization Gabriel was buried the day of his death. His companion in the novitiate, Bernard Mary of Jesus, exclaimed: Immediately thereafter Father Norbert wrote a biography of his life. In 1866, four years after the death of Gabriel, the Passionists were forced to abandon the monastery of Isola del Gran Sasso, and the church where Gabriel lay buried went deserted for 30 years. Since his death, the fame of Gabriel's sanctity had spread through the local area, as well as amongst the Passionists.Ward C.P., N. ‚ÄúLife of Venerable Gabriel C.P.‚Äù, page 246. Burns and Oates, 1904 In 1891 the Congregation decided to formally open proceedings for Gabriel's canonisation and, a year later, a committee visited his grave to examine his remains. Upon the arrival of the committee at Isola del Gran Sasso, the townspeople surrounded the church, determined not to have the body of Gabriel taken from their midst.Ward C.P., N. ‚ÄúLife of Venerable Gabriel C.P.‚Äù, page 249. Burns and Oates, 1904 Two years later the Passionist returned to resume their life at Isola del Gran Sasso near the city of Teramo. The two miracles presented for the beatification of Gabriel were the inexplicable healings of Maria Mazzarella from pulmonary tuberculosis and periostitis, and the instantaneous cure of Dominic Tiber from an inoperable hernia.Mead C.P., J. ‚ÄúSt. Gabriel: A Youthful Gospel Portrait‚Äù, page 48. L‚ÄôEco di S. Gabriele, 1985 Gabriel was beatified by Pope Pius X on May 31, 1908. Present at the ceremony were his brother Michael, his companion Brother Sylvester, and his director, Father Norbert. The outbreak of the First World War delayed Gabriel's canonisation for a while, but on May 13, 1920, he was raised to the altars by Pope Benedict XV. Patronage The Shrine of Saint Gabriel At the canonization of Saint Gabriel, Pope Benedict XV declared him a patron saint of Catholic youth, of students, and of those studying for the priesthood. In 1959, Pope John XXIII named him the patron of the Abruzzi region, where he spent the last two years of his life. Millions of pilgrims visit St. Gabriel's shrine in Isola del Gran Sasso d'Italia near Teramo each year to see the saint's burial place and the monastic house in which he lived out his final years. There is an ongoing tradition every March, when thousands of high school students from the Abruzzo and the Marche regions of Italy visit his tomb 100 days before their expected graduation day and pray to him in order to achieve good scores on their final. Every two years, from mid-July to the beginning of October, the Italian Staur√≥s ONLUS foundation hosts at the Sanctuary of Saint Gabriel a celebrated exposition of contemporary religious arts. With an average of 2 million visitors per year, this is one of the 15 most visited sanctuaries in the world. The cult of Saint Gabriel is especially popular amongst Italian youth; Italian migrants have spread the cult to areas such as the United States, Central America and South America. The Passionist Congregation also spreads devotion to the saint wherever they have monasteries. Many miracles have been attributed to the saint's intercession; Saint Gemma Galgani held that it was St Gabriel who had cured her of a dangerous illness and led her to a Passionist vocation. Saint Gabriel Possenti Society The Saint Gabriel Possenti Society was a U.S. organization promoting the public recognition of Gabriel and lobbying for his designation by the Vatican as the \\"patron saint of hand gunners\\". The society was founded by gun lobbyist John M. Snyder, who began his effort in 1987. According to the society, Gabriel's marksmanship and proficiency with handguns allegedly saved the village of Isola del Gran Sasso from a band of 20 Garibaldi Red Shirts in 1860. But at the time of the alleged incident, in 1860, Gabriel was reported to be in the later stages of tuberculosis.

While the school is supported and partially controlled by the Church in Wales, it includes students from other Christian denominations. The school is one of the highest achieving in the country with examination performance at all levels consistently well above expectations. In recent years, The Bishop of Llandaff has been active in supporting other school. This has included a local secondary school following a challenging inspection and, more recently, through its work as a regional consortia hub school. In this area the school provides support to both primary and secondary schools around the areas of leadership development, improving teaching and, specifically, through support in English. In 2018, the school was inspected by Estyn and awarded ‚ÄòExcellent‚Äô in every category and asked by inspectors to produce case studies to support other schools.  House System There are four school houses used within the school. These are: St David, St John, St Teilo and St Paul. The houses are colour-coded as well. St David is blue, St John is red, St Teilo is green and St Paul is yellow. Every student and teacher is placed into one of the houses and compete in a range of events/activities to help win the annual house shield. In October 2016, the school commissioned a company to design shield badges for each of the houses, which students and staff can wear as part of their uniform.

He entered the Court of Financial Auditors in 1970, but he began a political career in the Neo-Gaullist party RPR. In 1978, he was elected to the National Assembly as a deputy for the Vosges d√©partement. He was Mayor of √âpinal between 1983 and 1997. Representing the social tradition of the Gaullism, he was Minister of Social Affairs in Jacques Chirac's cabinet, from 1986 to 1988. After Chirac's defeat at the 1988 presidential election, he allied with Charles Pasqua and criticized the abandonment of Gaullist doctrine by the RPR executive. He accused Alain Jupp√© and √âdouard Balladur of wanting an alignment on liberal and pro-European policies. In 1992, he played a leading role in the No campaign against the Maastricht Treaty. On the eve of the vote he opposed President Fran√ßois Mitterrand in a televised debate. As president of the National Assembly from 1993 to 1997, he supported the winning candidacy of Jacques Chirac at the 1995 presidential election. He inspired the theme of Chirac's campaign which was named \\"the social fracture\\". Their relations deteriorated when he took the lead of the RPR, after the right-wing defeat at the 1997 legislative election. He failed to change the name of the party to \\"The Rally\\". He criticized the ascendancy of President Chirac within the party, refusing to be the leader of a \\"Chirac's fan-club\\". He resigned in 1999 just before the European elections, leaving his deputy Nicolas Sarkozy in charge. As the RPR's official candidate, he lost the 2001 mayoral election in Paris. Refusing the merge of the Neo-Gaullist party with the right-wing classical forces in the Union for a Popular Movement, he quit politics in 2002.

It is cosecreted with insulin from the pancreatic Œ≤-cells in the ratio of approximately 100:1 (insulin:amylin). Amylin plays a role in glycemic regulation by slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety, thereby preventing post-prandial spikes in blood glucose levels. IAPP is processed from an 89-residue coding sequence. Proislet amyloid polypeptide (proIAPP, proamylin, proislet protein) is produced in the pancreatic beta cells (Œ≤-cells) as a 67 amino acid, 7404 Dalton pro-peptide and undergoes post-translational modifications including protease cleavage to produce amylin.  Synthesis  ProIAPP consists of 67 amino acids, which follow a 22 amino acid signal peptide which is rapidly cleaved after translation of the 89 amino acid coding sequence. The human sequence (from N-terminus to C-terminus) is: (MGILKLQVFLIVLSVALNHLKA) TPIESHQVEKR^ KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTYG^ KR^ NAVEVLKREPLNYLPL. (the current NCBI RefSeq) The signal peptide is removed during translation of the protein and transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. Once inside the endoplasmic reticulum, a disulfide bond is formed between cysteine residues numbers 2 and 7. Later in the secretory pathway, the precursor undergoes additional proteolysis and posttranslational modification (indicated by ^). 11 amino acids are removed from the N-terminus by the enzyme proprotein convertase 2 (PC2) while 16 are removed from the C-terminus of the proIAPP molecule by proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3). At the C-terminus Carboxypeptidase E then removes the terminal lysine and arginine residues. The terminal glycine amino acid that results from this cleavage allows the enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) to add an amine group. After this the transformation from the precursor protein proIAPP to the biologically active IAPP is complete (IAPP sequence: KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY).  Regulation  Insofar as both IAPP and insulin are produced by the pancreatic Œ≤-cells, impaired Œ≤-cell function (due to lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity) will affect both insulin and IAPP production and release. Insulin and IAPP are regulated by similar factors since they share a common regulatory promoter motif. The IAPP promoter is also activated by stimuli which do not affect insulin, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and fatty acids. One of the defining features of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. This is a condition wherein the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively, resulting in increased insulin production; since proinsulin and proIAPP are cosecreted, this results in an increase in the production of proIAPP as well. Although little is known about IAPP regulation, its connection to insulin indicates that regulatory mechanisms that affect insulin also affect IAPP. Thus blood glucose levels play an important role in regulation of proIAPP synthesis.  Function  Amylin functions as part of the endocrine pancreas and contributes to glycemic control. The peptide is secreted from the pancreatic islets into the blood circulation and is cleared by peptidases in the kidney. It is not found in the urine. Amylin's metabolic function is well-characterized as an inhibitor of the appearance of nutrient [especially glucose] in the plasma. It thus functions as a synergistic partner to insulin, with which it is cosecreted from pancreatic beta cells in response to meals. The overall effect is to slow the rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose in the blood after eating; this is accomplished via coordinate slowing down gastric emptying, inhibition of digestive secretion [gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile ejection], and a resulting reduction in food intake. Appearance of new glucose in the blood is reduced by inhibiting secretion of the gluconeogenic hormone glucagon. These actions, which are mostly carried out via a glucose-sensitive part of the brain stem, the area postrema, may be over-ridden during hypoglycemia. They collectively reduce the total insulin demand. Amylin also acts in bone metabolism, along with the related peptides calcitonin and calcitonin gene related peptide. Rodent amylin knockouts do not have a normal reduction of appetite following food consumption. Because it is an amidated peptide, like many neuropeptides, it is believed to be responsible for the effect on appetite.  Structure  The human form of IAPP has the amino acid sequence KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY, with a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 2 and 7. Both the amidated C-terminus and the disulfide bridge are necessary for the full biological activity of amylin. IAPP is capable of forming amyloid fibrils in vitro. Within the fibrillization reaction, the early prefibrillar structures are extremely toxic to beta-cell and insuloma cell cultures. Later amyloid fiber structures also seem to have some cytotoxic effect on cell cultures. Studies have shown that fibrils are the end product and not necessarily the most toxic form of amyloid proteins/peptides in general. A non-fibril forming peptide (1‚Äì19 residues of human amylin) is toxic like the full-length peptide but the respective segment of rat amylin is not. It was also demonstrated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy that the fragment 20-29 of the human-amylin fragments membranes. Rats and mice have six substitutions (three of which are proline substitutions at positions 25, 28 and 29) that are believed to prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils, although not completely as seen by its propensity to form amyloid fibrils in vitro. Rat IAPP is nontoxic to beta-cells when overexpressed in transgenic rodents.  History  IAPP was identified independently by two groups as the major component of diabetes-associated islet amyloid deposits in 1987. The difference in nomenclature is largely geographical; European researchers tend to prefer IAPP whereas American researchers tend to prefer amylin. Some researchers discourage the use of \\"amylin\\" on the grounds that it may be confused with the pharmaceutical company. Clinical significance ProIAPP has been linked to Type 2 diabetes and the loss of islet Œ≤-cells. Islet amyloid formation, initiated by the aggregation of proIAPP, may contribute to this progressive loss of islet Œ≤-cells. It is thought that proIAPP forms the first granules that allow for IAPP to aggregate and form amyloid which may lead to amyloid-induced apoptosis of Œ≤-cells. IAPP is cosecreted with insulin. Insulin resistance in Type 2 diabetes produces a greater demand for insulin production which results in the secretion of proinsulin. ProIAPP is secreted simultaneously, however, the enzymes that convert these precursor molecules into insulin and IAPP, respectively, are not able to keep up with the high levels of secretion, ultimately leading to the accumulation of proIAPP. In particular, the impaired processing of proIAPP that occurs at the N-terminal cleavage site is a key factor in the initiation of amyloid. Post-translational modification of proIAPP occurs at both the carboxy terminus and the amino terminus, however, the processing of the amino terminus occurs later in the secretory pathway. This might be one reason why it is more susceptible to impaired processing under conditions where secretion is in high demand. Thus, the conditions of Type 2 diabetes‚Äîhigh glucose concentrations and increased secretory demand for insulin and IAPP‚Äîcould lead to the impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP. The unprocessed proIAPP can then serve as the nucleus upon which IAPP can accumulate and form amyloid. The amyloid formation might be a major mediator of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the islet Œ≤-cells. Initially, the proIAPP aggregates within secretory vesicles inside the cell. The proIAPP acts as a seed, collecting matured IAPP within the vesicles, forming intracellular amyloid. When the vesicles are released, the amyloid grows as it collects even more IAPP outside the cell. The overall effect is an apoptosis cascade initiated by the influx of ions into the Œ≤-cells. General Scheme for Amyloid Formation In summary, impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP is an important factor initiating amyloid formation and Œ≤-cell death. These amyloid deposits are pathological characteristics of the pancreas in Type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unclear as to whether amyloid formation is involved in or merely a consequence of type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, it is clear that amyloid formation reduces working Œ≤-cells in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This suggests that repairing proIAPP processing may help to prevent Œ≤-cell death, thereby offering hope as a potential therapeutic approach for Type 2 diabetes. Amyloid deposits deriving from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin) are commonly found in pancreatic islets of patients suffering diabetes mellitus type 2, or containing an insulinoma cancer. While the association of amylin with the development of type 2 diabetes has been known for some time, its direct role as the cause has been harder to establish. Recent results suggest that amylin, like the related beta-amyloid (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease, can induce apoptotic cell-death in insulin-producing beta cells, an effect that may be relevant to the development of type 2 diabetes. A 2008 study reported a synergistic effect for weight loss with leptin and amylin coadministration in diet-induced obese rats by restoring hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin. However, in clinical trials, the study was halted at Phase 2 in 2011 when a problem involving antibody activity that might have neutralized the weight-loss effect of metreleptin in two patients who took the drug in a previously completed clinical study. The study combined metreleptin, a version of the human hormone leptin, and pramlintide, which is Amylin's diabetes drug Symlin, into a single obesity therapy. Finally, a recent proteomics study showed that human amylin shares common toxicity targets with beta-amyloid (Abeta), providing evidence that type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease share common toxicity mechanisms.  Pharmacology  A synthetic analog of human amylin with proline substitutions in positions 25, 26 and 29, or pramlintide (brand name Symlin), was approved in 2005 for adult use in patients with both diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetes mellitus type 2. Insulin and pramlintide, injected separately but both before a meal, work together to control the post-prandial glucose excursion. Amylin is degraded in part by insulin-degrading enzyme.  Receptors  There appear to be at least three distinct receptor complexes that amylin binds to with high affinity. All three complexes contain the calcitonin receptor at the core, plus one of three receptor activity-modifying proteins, RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3.

After the war she created the Lena Ashwell Players. Biography She was born Lena Margaret Pocock on the Wellesley while anchored in the River Tyne at North Shields, at the time under her father's 'command' as a home for ‚Äúboys 'unconvicted of crime' but under suspicion‚Äù. Ashwell's father was Commander Charles Ashwell Boteler Pocock, Royal Navy (March 1829‚ÄìFebruary 1899), a nephew of Nicholas Pocock, and her mother was Sarah Margaret Stevens (December 1839‚ÄìMay 1887), who died as a result of an accident in Canada. Lena, the second youngest of seven siblings, had two brothers and four sisters. One of her siblings died as a child while the family was in New Zealand. She grew up in Canada, and studied music in both Lausanne and at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Her voice however was insufficient for performance and she took up acting instead, thereafter styling herself as \\"Lena Ashwell\\". In 1891, she debuted in The Pharisee, and in 1895 she appeared in King Arthur, by J. Comyns Carr, with Dame Ellen Terry and Sir Henry Irving. She went on to appear in a number of Shakespeare productions, in Quo Vadis (1900), and as the lead in Mrs Dane's Defence (1900) and Leah Kleschna (1905). In 1906, Ashwell starred in The Shulamite, a melodrama about a South African woman in an unhappy marriage who falls in love with a visiting Englishman. The show ran for 45 performances at the Savoy Theatre between 12 May and 26 June 1906. Ashwell took the play to the US, where it ran for just 25 performances at the Lyric Theatre on Broadway. The New York Times critic wrote that Ashwell \\"had been rather badly handicapped on her first visit here by a bad play.\\" The ashes of Lena Ashwell and Sir Henry Simson, Dean Cemetery Beginning in 1906, Ashwell took up theatre management, initially at the Savoy Theatre, then in 1907 she established her own theatre known as the Kingsway. In February 1914, Ashwell was one of the founder members of the new United Suffragists group, led by the Pethick-Lawrences, which broke away from the moderate NUWSS and the militant WSPU suffragettes, seeking women's rights. World War One During World War I she was an enthusiastic supporter of British war aims. Partly due to the influence of her acquaintance Princess Helena Victoria, and her connections to the YWCA, she was given permission to take a group of entertainers to the Western Front.Telegraph (newspaper) 10 June 2018, article by Kate adie In 1915, she began to organise companies of actors, singers and entertainers to travel to France and perform; by the end of the war there were 25 of them, travelling in small groups around France. Ashwell herself travelled to the front and became involved in fundraising and logistics of the concerts, as she believed in 'uplifting and therapeutic' power of music. . She organised all-male concert parties to perform shows near to the front line. In her writings about this experience she emphasised that ordinary soldiers had been enthusiastic about high culture ‚Äì in particular, Shakespeare plays. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her efforts in organising such shows. After the war After the war Ashwell sought funding from the Carnegie Trust and the British Drama League. After some years the trustees allowed her a ¬£500 grant for capital outlay after get good results of a survey of local councils. The aim was to bring theatre to London, but some areas such as Canning Town were thought to be a very likely loss maker. The Drama League agreed to underwrite up to ¬£100 of losses there. By 1923 there was a \\"Friends of the Players\\" with members receiving the \\"Lena Ashley Players Magazine\\". Ashwell formed the Lena Ashwell Players Ltd in April 1923. The directors were Ashwell, Esme Church, Marion Fawcett and Cicely Hamilton. The first three of these were to be the company's theatre managers and Fawcett was also the first manager of the new company. The players continued to appear throughout London and of whom Laurence Olivier was later to become a member. In 1924, she took over the old Bijou Theatre in Bayswater, London and renamed it The Century Theatre. This became the headquarters of The Lena Ashwell Players. It was there that she produced new plays including her own adaptations of Crime and Punishment and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In her last years, she embraced the Moral Re-Armament movement.Leask, Margaret, Doctoral thesis on the life and work of Lena Ashwell, University of Sydney (2000) Her ashes are buried with her husband in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave lies in the Victorian north extension on a north-south path north of the main path close to Elsie Maud Inglis. Family She married actor Arthur Playfair in 1896; he began divorce proceedings in 1903 following her adultery with Robert Taber, the former husband of actress Julia Marlowe. Playfair and Ashwell finally divorced in 1908. She married the royal obstetrician Sir Henry John Forbes Simson in 1908, who had the claim to fame of delivering both the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Princess Margaret.http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/4073 She met him through her cousin, Sir Alfred Fripp, surgeon to the King, who recommended Simson to her.

Although the term usually refers to applications of synthetic (man-made) resins, many materials, in particular soil. Typical ion exchangers are ion-exchange resins (functionalized porous or gel polymer), zeolites, montmorillonite, clay, and soil humus. Ion exchangers are either cation exchangers, which exchange positively charged ions (cations), or anion exchangers, which exchange negatively charged ions (anions). There are also amphoteric exchangers that are able to exchange both cations and anions simultaneously. However, the simultaneous exchange of cations and anions can be more efficiently performed in mixed beds, which contain a mixture of anion- and cation-exchange resins, or passing the treated solution through several different ion-exchange materials. Ion exchanger. This device is packed with ion exchange resin. Ion exchanges can be unselective or have binding preferences for certain ions or classes of ions, depending on their chemical structure. This can be dependent on the size of the ions, their charge, or their structure. Typical examples of ions that can bind to ion exchangers are: * H+ (proton) and OH‚àí (hydroxide). * Singly charged monatomic ions like Na+, K+, and Cl‚àí. * Doubly charged monatomic ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+. * Polyatomic inorganic ions like SO42‚àí and PO43‚àí. * Organic bases, usually molecules containing the amine functional group ‚àíNR2H+. * Organic acids, often molecules containing ‚àíCOO‚àí (carboxylic acid) functional groups. * Biomolecules that can be ionized: amino acids, peptides, proteins, etc. Along with absorption and adsorption, ion exchange is a form of sorption. Ion exchange is a reversible process, and the ion exchanger can be regenerated or loaded with desirable ions by washing with an excess of these ions.  Applications  Ion exchange is widely used in the food and beverage industry, hydrometallurgy, metals finishing, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical technology, sugar and sweetener production, ground- and potable-water treatment, nuclear, softening, industrial water treatment, semiconductor, power, and many other industries. A typical example of application is preparation of high-purity water for power engineering, electronic and nuclear industries; i.e. polymeric or mineralic insoluble ion exchangers are widely used for water softening, water purification, water decontamination, etc. Ion exchange is a method widely used in household (laundry detergents and water filters) to produce soft water. This is accomplished by exchanging calcium Ca2+ and magnesium Mg2+ cations against Na+ or H+ cations (see water softening). Another application for ion exchange in domestic water treatment is the removal of nitrate and natural organic matter. Industrial and analytical ion-exchange chromatography is another area to be mentioned. Ion- exchange chromatography is a chromatographical method that is widely used for chemical analysis and separation of ions. For example, in biochemistry it is widely used to separate charged molecules such as proteins. An important area of the application is extraction and purification of biologically produced substances such as proteins (amino acids) and DNA/RNA. Ion-exchange processes are used to separate and purify metals, including separating uranium from plutonium and the other actinides, including thorium, neptunium, and americium. This process is also used to separate the lanthanides, such as lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, europium, and ytterbium, from each other. The separation of neodymium and praseodymium was a particularly difficult one, and those were formerly thought to be just one element didymium - but that is an alloy of the two. There are two series of rare-earth metals, the lanthanides and the actinides, both of whose families all have very similar chemical and physical properties. Using methods developed by Frank Spedding in the 1940s, ion exchange processes were formerly the only practical way to separate them in large quantities, until the development of the \\"solvent extraction\\" techniques that can be scaled up enormously.. A very important case of ion-exchange is the PUREX process (Plutonium-URanium Extraction Process), which is used to separate the plutonium-239 and the uranium from americium, curium, neptunium, the radioactive fission products that come from nuclear reactors. Thus the waste products can be separated out for disposal. Next, the plutonium and uranium are available for making nuclear-energy materials, such as new reactor fuel and nuclear weapons. The ion-exchange process is also used to separate other sets of very similar chemical elements, such as zirconium and hafnium, which is also very important for the nuclear industry. Physically, zirconium is practically transparent to free neutrons, used in building nuclear reactors, but hafnium is a very strong absorber of neutrons, used in reactor control rods. Thus, ion-exchange is used in nuclear reprocessing and the treatment of radioactive waste. Ion-exchange resins in the form of thin membranes are also used in chloralkali process, fuel cells, and vanadium redox batteries. Idealised image of water-softening process, involving replacement of calcium ions in water with sodium ions donated by a cation-exchange resin. Large cation/anion ion exchangers used in water purification of boiler feedwater Ion exchange can also be used to remove hardness from water by exchanging calcium and magnesium ions for sodium ions in an ion-exchange column. Liquid-phase (aqueous) ion-exchange desalination has been demonstrated. In this technique anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations respectively using electrophoresis. Calcium and carbonate ions then react to form calcium carbonate, which then precipitates, leaving behind fresh water. The desalination occurs at ambient temperature and pressure and requires no membranes or solid ion exchangers. The theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. = Other applications = * In soil science, cation-exchange capacity is the ion- exchange capacity of soil for positively charged ions. Soils can be considered as natural weak cation exchangers. * In pollution remediation and geotechnical engineering, ion-exchange capacity determines the swelling capacity of swelling or expansive clay such as montmorillonite, which can be used to \\"capture\\" pollutants and charged ions. * In planar waveguide manufacturing, ion exchange is used to create the guiding layer of higher index of refraction. * Dealkalization, removal of alkali ions from a glass surface. * Chemically strengthened glass, produced by exchanging K+ for Na+ in soda glass surfaces using KNO3 melts.  Waste water produced by resin regeneration  Most ion-exchange systems contain containers of ion-exchange resin that are operated on a cyclic basis. During the filtration process, water flows through the resin container until the resin is considered exhausted. That happens only when water leaving the exchanger contains more than the maximal desired concentration of the ions being removed. Resin is then regenerated by sequentially backwashing the resin bed to remove accumulated solids, flushing removed ions from the resin with a concentrated solution of replacement ions, and rinsing the flushing solution from the resin. Production of backwash, flushing, and rinsing wastewater during regeneration of ion-exchange media limits the usefulness of ion exchange for wastewater treatment.Kemmer, pp. 12‚Äì17, 12 ‚Äì 25. Water softeners are usually regenerated with brine containing 10% sodium chloride. Aside from the soluble chloride salts of divalent cations removed from the softened water, softener regeneration wastewater contains the unused 50 ‚Äì 70% of the sodium chloride regeneration flushing brine required to reverse ion-exchange resin equilibria. Deionizing resin regeneration with sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide is approximately 20‚Äì40% efficient. Neutralized deionizer regeneration wastewater contains all of the removed ions plus 2.5‚Äì5 times their equivalent concentration as sodium sulfate.Kemmer, p. 12 ‚Äì 18.

Its flagship paper was The San Diego Union-Tribune.  History  Founder Ira Clifton Copley launched Copley Press c. 1905, eventually amassing over two dozen papers. After selling the Western Utility Corporation, Copley purchased twenty-four newspapers in Southern California for $7.5 million. He managed these publishing holdings as Copley Press, Inc. and was its first president, serving until 1942. Copley Press purchased Springfield's Illinois State Journal in 1927. In 1942, Copley bought the Journal's Democratic-oriented competitor, the Illinois State Register, promising that the Register could keep its independent editorial voice.Swanson, Walter S.J. The Thin Gold Watch (2nd ed.) (Copley Press, 1970). The two papers were merged in 1974 into The State Journal-Register. In 1928, Copley bought the San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune, which eventually became the company's flagship publications. Later that year, Senator George W. Norris accused Copley Press of receiving money from public utility companies, but Copley successfully defended his position before the Federal Trade Commission in 1929. The two papers operated separate editions until 1992, when they were merged as The San Diego Union-Tribune. Copley News Service ‚Äî a wire service that distributed news, political cartoons, and opinion columns ‚Äî was founded in 1955. =Dissolution= Copley Press began selling off properties in the 2000s.

The remaining Illinois papers (The State Journal-Register, the Peoria Journal Star, The Repository, and some smaller papers) were sold to GateHouse Media in 2007. In 2006, the Daily Breeze was sold to Hearst. In December 2007, the Union-Tribune reported that Copley Press was selling La Casa del Zorro, a resort it owned in Borrego Springs. Copley News Service itself was sold to Creators Syndicate for an undisclosed price and renamed Creators News Service, on 1 July 2008. In late July 2008, the company began seeking buyers for the Union-Tribune, as well as several other businesses like Enlace, a free Spanish-language tabloid, and SignOnSanDiego.com, the online arm of the U-T.\\"Sale of U-T explored by Copley Press,\\" San Diego Union-Tribune, July 25, 2008; by David Hasemyer.

Reporters Joe Trento and Dave Roman claimed that James S. Copley, who served as publisher until 1973, had cooperated with the CIA since its founding in 1947. They also reported that a subsidiary division, Copley News Service, was used in Latin America by the CIA as a front. Trento and Roman also said that reporters at the Copley-owned San Diego Union and Evening News spied on antiwar protesters for the FBI. They alleged that, at the height of these operations, at least two dozen Copley employees were simultaneously working for the CIA. James S.

Hockey, Page 20 - \\"sources give Fontana, Torricelli, or Niccol√≤ Zucchi... credit for first noting the dark belts girding jupiter...\\" and reported spots on Mars in 1640. His \\"Optica philosophia experimentis et ratione a fundamentis constituta\\", published in 1652‚Äì56, described his 1616 experiments using a curved mirror instead of a lens as a telescope objective, which may be the earliest known description of a reflecting telescope. In his book he also demonstrated that phosphors generate rather than store light. He also published two other works on mechanics and machines. Biography Niccol√≤ Zucchi was fourth of eight children born into the noble family of Pierre Zucchi and Francoise Giande Marie. Three of his sisters became nuns, three of his brothers became Jesuits, and one brother became a secular priest. =The Jesuit order= Niccol√≤ studied rhetoric in Piacenza and philosophy and theology in Parma. He finished his studies at the age of sixteen and entered the Jesuit order in Padua on October 28, 1602, in which he remained for the rest of his life. Zucchi taught mathematics, rhetorics and theology as a professor at the Collegio Romano, and then was appointed as rector of a new Jesuit college in Ravenna by Cardinal Alessandro Orsini. He later served as the apostolic preacher, a post often referred to as ‚Äúpreacher to the pope‚Äù, for about seven years. He received patronage from Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma, to which Zucchi dedicated his book Nova de machinis philosophia in 1642. He also dedicated his 1652 book Optica philosophia, to Archduke Leopold of Austria. Near the end of his life, he was an official of the Jesuit house in Rome. Zucchi died in Rome on May 21, 1670. Scientist Niccol√≤ Zucchi published many books on science, including two works on the \\"philosophy of machines\\" (analyses of mechanics) in 1646 and 1649, and Optica philosophia in 1652. He also wrote an unpublished Optica statica, which has not survived. Some of the subjects Zucchi wrote about were magnetism, barometers (denying the existence of the vacuum), and demonstrated that phosphors generate rather than store light. He also asserted that since Venus represented beauty, it was closer to the Sun than Mercury (which represented skill). =Astronomer= In 1623, Zucchi was a member of a Papal legate sent to the court of Ferdinand II. There he met Johannes Kepler, the German mathematician and astronomer.Irving Lav√≠n, Gianlorenzo Bernini New Aspects of His Art and Thought A Commemorative Volume for THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA by THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS UNIVERSITY PARK AND LONDON, 1985, page 210 Kepler encouraged Zucchi‚Äôs interest in astronomy. Zucchi maintained correspondence with Kepler after returning to Rome. At one point when Kepler was in financial difficulties, Zucchi, at the urging of the Jesuit scientist Father Paul Guldin, gave a telescope of his own design to Kepler, who mentioned the gift in his book ‚ÄúThe Dream‚Äù.How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization by Thomas E.

Zucchi described an experiment he did with a concave lens and a bronze parabolic mirror he found in a cabinet of curiosities.The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences ..., Volume 16, page 533 Zucchi used the concave lens as an eyepiece, trying to observe the focused image produced by the mirror to see if it would work like a telescope. Although Zucchi described the mirror as \\"ab experto et accuratissimo artifice elaboratum nactus\\" (fabricated by an experienced craftsmanStargazer By Fred Watson, Inc. NetLibrary Page 109) he apparently did not get a satisfactory image with it, possibly due to the mirror not being accurate enough to focus an image, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the view. Zucchi abandoned the idea.The History of the Telescope by Henry C. King Page 44 If Niccol√≤ Zucchi's claim of exploring the idea of a reflecting telescope in 1616 was true, then it would be the earliest known description of the idea of using a curved mirror as an image forming objective, predating Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Francesco Sagredo's discussions of the same idea in the 1620s. =Claimed functionality= There are many descriptions of Niccol√≤ Zucchi successfully using his early \\"reflecting telescope\\". The French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's 1700 work History of the Academy of Sciences stated Zucchi used it to observe \\"celestial and terrestrial objects\\".The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, Volume 14, Joseph Parker, 1832, page 602 There are also modern claims that Zucchi used a reflecting telescope to observe the belts of Jupiter and examine the spots on the planet Mars,magnet.fsu.edu, Nicolas Zucchi (1586-1670) Such claims have been disputed. The 1832 Edinburgh Encyclopaedia noted Zucchi's use of a tilted mirror \\"must have distorted and spoiled the image\\" and the 1858 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described Fontenelle's claim as \\"recklessly (ascribing) the invention\\" Historian Al Van Helden notes in his The Galileo Project that the claims Zucchi used a reflecting telescope to observe Jupiter and Mars as \\"wildly improbable\\".Al Van Helden, Zucchi, Niccolo - The Galileo Project, 9.

The Logos or Word in John 1:1 (\\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God), is often interpreted, especially by Trinitarians, to identify the pre-existent Jesus with this Word. The disputed Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7) includes the Son in the formula \\"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.\\" Christians believe that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16). Jesus identified himself in New Testament canonical writings. \\"Jesus said to them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.' \\" (John 8:58), which some Trinitarians believe is a reference to Moses in his interaction with preincarnate God in the Old Testament. \\"And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, \\"I AM has sent me to you.\\" ' [Exodus 3:14] A manuscript variant in John 1:18 (ŒòŒµ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œø·ΩêŒ¥Œµ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºëœéœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒΩ œÄœéœÄŒøœÑŒµ¬∑ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩ·Ω¥œÇ ŒòŒµ·Ω∏œÇ ·ΩÅ ·Ω¢ŒΩ Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ†Œ±œÑœÅ·Ω∏œÇ, ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ ·ºêŒæŒ∑Œ≥ŒÆœÉŒ±œÑŒø) has led to translations including \\"God the One and Only\\" (NIV, 1984) referring to the Son. Later theological use of this expression (compare Latin: Deus Filius) reflects what came to be the standard interpretation of New Testament references, understood to imply Jesus' divinity, but with the distinction of his person from another person of the Trinity called the Father. As such, the title is associated more with the development of the doctrine of the Trinity. Trinitarians believe that a clear reference to the Trinity occurs in , \\"Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\\" Dissenting views Groups of both trinitarian and antitrinitarian Christians reject the term 'God the Son' to describe Jesus Christ (as well as 'God the Holy Ghost' to describe the Holy Spirit). Jehovah's Witnesses reject the term along with the word 'Trinity' as extrabiblical terminology, along with the Deity of Christ. However, Oneness Pentecostals, who affirm his divinity, object to the term as an unauthorized reversal of the language of Scripture which describes him 40 times as the \\"Son of God.\\" Son of God: The Title Son of God Affirms Jesus Christ's Divine NatureJesus is the Son of God; not God the Son The Church of Christ, which accepts both the Deity of Christ and the trinity doctrine, also avoids the term because they stress the importance to 'Call Bible things by Bible names, and talk about Bible things in Bible ways.'New Philadelphia Church of Christ See also * Divi filius * Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament * Sons of God ReferencesExternal links *Catholic Encyclopedia: The Blessed Trinity *The Jewish Encyclopedia: Son of God‚Äîby Kaufmann Kohler, Emil G.

The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The success of drilling for oil at this well led to \\"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\\" There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans harvested \\"the oil for medicinal purposes by digging small pits around active seeps and lining them with wood\\" at least as far back as 1410 AD. European settlers skimmed the \\"oil from the seeps and using the petroleum as a source of lamp fuel and machinery lubrication.\\" Pennsylvania grade crude oil can be broken down into gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, gas oil, wax distillate, cylinder stock (or bottoms) and other refined products such as white oil and paraffin. Pennsylvania grade crude oil when seen in reflected sunlight has a green color and under ultraviolet light looks fluorescent. Pennsylvania grade crude oil is thermally stable and has a high viscosity index. It is generally free of asphalt and has only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen. It is also high in paraffin and other waxes making it highly desirable for refinement into petroleum lubricants such as motor oil. Its products are also valuable for use in certain hydraulic applications. By-products are commonly found in consumer goods such as cosmetics, and topical ointments. Products refined from this type of oil are particularly prized as lubricants and many oil companies prominently display the fact that they use Pennsylvania Grade crude oil in their products. Bradford, Pennsylvania is major center for the refining of Pennsylvania grade crude oil. Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil: the first well Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil was first extracted from the Drake Well, which was drilled by Edwin Drake in \\"the middle of quiet farm country in northwestern Pennsylvania\\" in 1859. It was the \\"first successful oil well that was drilled for the sole purpose of finding oil.\\" His success led to \\"an international search for petroleum, and in many ways eventually changed the way we live.\\" Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil: the first oil boom With the success of the first drilled well, in the quiet farming region around Oil Creek towns like Bradford were created and the area was rapidly transformed into the center of the Pennsylvania oil rush in the late 19th century, similar to the growth of gold rush towns of the Wild West. The original Drake Well burned to the ground only a few months after it was built and a second well was erected. In the late nineteenth century, early developers had no geological knowledge of the geological formation and wells were drilled at random with derricks built very close together. \\"There were frequent fires that raged out of control.\\" Until the East Texas oil boom the oil Regions in Pennsylvania were responsible for fifty percent of the world's oil production. Bradford The community of Bradford emerged as a wild oil boom town in the Pennsylvania oil rush in the late 19th century. In 1881, Joseph Newton Pew (1848‚Äì1912), founder of Sun Oil Company (now Sunoco) developed the Keystone Gas Company which used the by-products of oil, such as natural gas, to provide heat and light for By 1889 Newton's Keystone Gas Company was delivering gas to Pittsburgh.

The process was patented in 1840 by Wright's associate George Richards Elkington. He was born on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent and was apprenticed to a Dr Spearman in Rotherham, Yorkshire. He then completed his medical training in Edinburgh, Paris and London. He moved to the Bordesley district of Birmingham in 1833, in the centre of the metal working industry, where he experimented with electricity in his spare time. After reading an article by Carl Wilhelm Scheele on the behaviour of the cyanides of gold and silver in a solution of potassium cyanide he devised an experiment to test such a solution as an electrolyte. The results were promising with a good coating of gold or silver being achievable. He contacted the plating firm of Elkingtons who paid him ¬£300 for the rights to patent the procedure plus a further ¬£500 when the patent (British Patent 8447) was approved in 1840. The process became widely used in preference to the dangerous techniques previously used and Wright benefited from a steady royalty income. He died in 1844 at a young age from the effects of falling from his carriage.

The perturbation changes the corresponding Hamiltonian and the outcome is change in eigenvalues; several distinct energy levels emerge in place of the former degenerate (multi-state) level. This may occur because of external fields, quantum tunnelling between states, or other effects. The term is most commonly used in reference to the electron configuration in atoms or molecules. The simplest case of level splitting is a quantum system with two states whose unperturbed Hamiltonian is a diagonal operator: , where is the identity matrix. Eigenstates and eigenvalues (energy levels) of a perturbed Hamiltonian :\\\\hat H_\\\\varepsilon = \\\\hat H_0+\\\\varepsilon\\\\sigma_3 =\\\\begin{pmatrix} E_0+\\\\varepsilon & 0  0 & E_0-\\\\varepsilon \\\\end{pmatrix} will be: : : the level, and : : the level, so this degenerate eigenvalue splits in two whenever . Though, if a perturbed Hamiltonian is not diagonal for this quantum states basis , then Hamiltonian's eigenstates are linear combinations of these two states. For a physical implementation such as a charged spin-¬Ω particle in an external magnetic field, the z-axis of the coordinate system is required to be collinear with the magnetic field to obtain a Hamiltonian in the form above (the Pauli matrix corresponds to z-axis). These basis states, referred to as spin-up and spin-down, are hence eigenvectors of the perturbed Hamiltonian, so this level splitting is both easy to demonstrate mathematically and intuitively evident. But in cases where the choice of state basis is not determined by a coordinate system, and the perturbed Hamiltonian is not diagonal, a level splitting may appear counter- intuitive, as in examples from chemistry below. Examples In atomic physics: * The Zeeman effect ‚Äì the splitting of electronic levels in an atom because of an external magnetic field. * The Stark effect ‚Äì splitting because of an external electric field. In physical chemistry: * The Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect ‚Äì splitting of electronic levels in a molecule because breaking the symmetry lowers the energy when the degenerate orbitals are partially filled. * Resonance (chemistry) leads to creation of delocalized electron states.

She is a member of Alpha Flight and an honorary member of the Avengers. Publication history Marrina first appeared in Alpha Flight #1 (August 1983) and was created by John Byrne. Byrne has clarified that Marrina was created after the Alpha Flight title was green lit, and was not a character he had thought up earlier. Namor, the Sub-Mariner writer Glenn Herdling said that issue #61 was his favorite of the series, because \\"I had never been comfortable with how Namor had used the Black Knight's Ebony Blade to slay Marrina, even though she was a mindless leviathan at the time. Being slain by the Ebony Blade is a fate worse than death. The enchanted blade actually traps the souls of its victims in its obsidian void rather than allowing them to roam free to meet their eternal reward. In one fell stroke, Namor had condemned his wife's soul to an eternity of hell. Two years earlier, I had created a character called Bloodwraith, who was the new (and nastier!) wielder of the blade. The connection that Namor had to the Ebony Blade made the Blood Wraith's presence an organic progression of the story rather than a forced guest appearance. In the end, Namor got to free his wife's soul. By redeeming Marrina, he redeemed himself.\\" Fictional character biography Marrina is a member of the alien species the Plodex, which sends its eggs to various planets. When the eggs hatch, young Plodex take the forms of the native species they encounter. As an egg, Marrina landed in the Atlantic Ocean about 40,000 years ago, at the turn between the Middle Paleolithic and the Upper Paleolithic and remained dormant for thousands of years. This incubation place was responsible for her adaptations to aquatic environments. The egg was found by fisherman Tom Smallwood as he was drowning during a storm. It proved buoyant enough to bring him to the surface and thus save his life. Tom took it home to Newfoundland, Canada. The egg was opened prematurely by his wife Gladys Smallwood, causing Marrina to imprint a humanoid female form. The Smallwoods accepted her as their daughter. She leaves home at sixteen years of age to join Beta Flight, a team of superheroes trained and funded by the Canadian government. After performing well in Beta Flight, Marrina is promoted to Alpha Flight, although her field duties only begin after the team went freelance.Alpha Flight #1 She learns of her alien origin when captured by the Master of the World, and is rescued by Alpha Flight and Namor alongside the Invisible Woman.Alpha Flight #3‚Äì4 Following this she leaves Alpha Flight and stays with Namor.

He uses her as an endgame plan against Namor (who recently betrayed him and allied with the X-Men). Osborn has her D.N.A. spliced and modified, making her a snake-like leviathan, driven by a hunger for Atlantean blood. Once released, Marrina wreaks havoc in the undersea kingdom, injuring and killing many. Eventually Namor drags a weakened Marrina underwater, where he performs a mercy killing.Dark Reign the List: X-Men During the Chaos War storyline, Marrina (alongside Alpha Flight members Guardian, Vindicator, and Shaman) returns from the dead. She joins up with the still-living Alpha Flight members in order to fight the Great Beasts.Chaos War: Alpha Flight #1 Marrina remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.Chaos War #5 Powers and abilities Thanks to her genetic structure that is a hybrid combination of Plodex and Earth DNA, Marrina's body is totally amphibious, and she has pale yellow skin, large fish-like eyes, and webbed hands and feet. Possessing both lungs and gills, she can breathe and exist indefinitely on land or under the sea. She is able to withstand freezing temperatures and underwater pressures without harm. Her hydrodynamic proportions, sleek skin, webbed extremities, and superhuman strength aid in her swimming. She can sustain underwater speeds approaching 51 knots (roughly 59 mph) for several hours and is capable of massive acceleration by shedding the outer layer of her skin to expose a nearly frictionless inner skin layer, allowing her to briefly reach speeds in the range.Alpha Flight #1‚Äì2 She has further demonstrated some ability to control water ‚Äî in combination with her massive underwater speed, she was able to raise and ride the crest of a huge waterspout, letting her travel from an ocean shore up to three miles inland. After such feats, her outer skin layer can quickly regenerate to normal. Her skin also secretes an oil which can cause extreme constriction of the pupils ‚Äî with one slap, she was able to temporarily blind the Sub-Mariner,Alpha Flight #15 himself superhumanly adapted to underwater existence. On dry land, she can sprint at tremendous speeds. Although Marrina has a friendly personality, thanks to her upbringing by her foster parents, her mental programming by the Plodex repeatedly emerges from her subconscious mind. Her savage instincts can even be triggered by chemical stimuli given off by other Plodex. When her Plodex DNA takes over, she takes on a more beast-like appearance. Her hands turn into talons that easily cut through most material.Alpha Flight #2 Marrina can change shape to an unknown degree under the influence of her savage instincts.

He was awarded The Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1933. Biography Manhattan BridgeMoisseiff was born in Riga, Latvia, to a Jewish family.Leon S. Moisseiff, Bridge Builder and Jewish Writer, Dead, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, September 7, 1943 He started his education there and studied at the Baltic Polytechnic Institute for three years; he emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of 19 because of political activities. In the US, he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in civil engineering in 1895. He began his career in New York, and gained a national reputation as one of the designers of the Manhattan Bridge over the East River. He also assisted chief engineer Ralph Modjeski in designing the Benjamin Franklin Bridge across the Delaware River. He was an early advocate of all-steel bridges, which began to replace concrete and stone structures in the 1920s. He became known for his work on \\"deflection theory,\\" which held that the longer bridges were, the more flexible they could be. Charles Alton EllisCharles Alton Ellis elaborated on Moiseiff's theories, and applied them in the design of the famed Golden Gate Bridge. Moisseiff served as a consulting engineer on the bridge, but declined to speak up for his colleague Charles Ellis when he was fired from the project. Moisseiff called the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the first bridge that he designed as the leading engineer, the \\"most beautiful bridge in the world.\\" However, he lost his strong reputation when this narrow span across the Puget Sound in Washington State collapsed in a windstorm four months after it opened in 1940. The motion of the bridge earned it the name Galloping Gertie. The dramatic film of the bridge's collapse, as a twisting motion added to the stress of longitudinal waves along the span, is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as a good example of torsional flutter gone awry. Moisseiff died of a heart attack in 1943. Though he had designed many other famous spans, the Narrows collapse overshadowed them all. It became a symbol of failed engineering and the dangers of arrogance in design. As tragic as this disastrous design flaw became to Moisseiff personally, it motivated the engineers to further research and substantially improve the design and safety of suspension bridges.

Biography Regge obtained the laurea in physics from the University of Turin in 1952 under the direction of Mario Verde and Gleb Wataghin, and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Rochester in 1957 under the direction of Robert Marshak. From 1958 to 1959 Regge held a post at the Max Planck Institute for Physics where he worked with Werner Heisenberg. In 1961 he was appointed to the chair of Relativity at the University of Turin. He also held an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1965 to 1979. He was emeritus professor at the Polytechnic University of Turin while contributing work at CERN as a visiting scientist. Regge died on October 23, 2014. He was married to Rosanna Cester, physicist, by whom he had three children: Daniele, Marta and Anna. In 1959, Regge discovered a mathematical property of potential scattering in the Schr√∂dinger equation‚Äîthat the scattering amplitude can be thought of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determines power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle (i.e. \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, requiring complex angles).Tullio Regge, \\"Introduction to complex angular momentum,\\" Il Nuovo Cimento Series 10, Vol. 14, 1959, p. 951. This formulation is known as Regge theory. In the early 1960s, Regge introduced Regge calculus, a simplicial formulation of general relativity. Regge calculus was the first discrete gauge theory suitable for numerical simulation, and an early relative of lattice gauge theory. In 1968 he and G. Ponzano developed a quantum version of Regge calculus in three space-time dimensions now known as the Ponzano- Regge model. This was the first of a whole series of state sum models for quantum gravity known as spin foam models. In mathematics, the model also developed into the Turaev-Viro model, an example of a quantum invariant.

Measuring in length and in width, it has an area of . The subsurface is composed of Ordovician sandstone and shale with red hematite. It was once the site of large iron ore mines. It is home to three communities, the largest of which is the incorporated town of Wabana. The provincial government operates a ferry service from Portugal Cove‚ÄìSt. Philip's to Bell Island daily using either the MV Flanders or the MV Legionnaire. It is primarily used by commuters who work in the St. John's metropolitan area. History Bell Island iron ore pier, circa 1900 Probably settled by Maritime Archaic and/or Dorset people, Bell Island, as with the rest of the island of Newfoundland, was probably inhabited by the Beothuk Nation at the time of European discovery. The first European inhabitants settled during the 18th century and attempted to farm and fish, with the island having a subsistence economy throughout much of the 19th century. The first recorded settler was an Englishman, Gregory Normore, in 1740. The economy expanded tremendously during the 1890s when iron ore mining began near the community of Wabana. Wabana grew to become the island's largest community and the mine became one of the largest producers of iron ore in northeastern North America. The mine's workings extended beneath the seabed of Conception Bay, creating one of the most extensive submarine iron mines in the world. Most of Bell Island's ore was shipped from loading facilities to Sydney, Nova Scotia where it was smelted in a steel mill. The steel mill at Sydney and the iron mine at Bell Island were owned by the Dominion Steel and Coal Company (DOSCO), which at one point was one of the largest private employers in Canada. =World War II= Two QF 4.7-inch B Mark IV* guns were emplaced on Bell Island early in World War II. They can still be seen on their mountings. During the Second World War, the anchorage for bulk carriers shipping iron ore was attacked by German U-boats in two attacks on 5 September and 2 November 1942, by U-513 and U-518. Four ships were sunk and 70 merchant mariners lost their lives: * SS Saganaga * SS Lord Strathcona * SS P.L.M 27 * SS Rose Castle In addition to the four cargo ships, an errant German torpedo also struck the DOSCO iron ore loading dock on shore. A memorial overlooks the waters at Lance Cove where the wrecks lie just a few hundred yards offshore. Bell Island was one of the very few locations in North America to see enemy action during the war, and the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces during World War II (due to the errant torpedo hitting land). = Closure of iron ore mine = Being an underground operation, the Bell Island iron ore mine was extremely expensive to operate. During the 1950s, some of the largest surface iron ore deposits in the world were discovered in northeastern Quebec and the western part of Labrador. After the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway was built in the latter part of the decade, Bell Island iron ore became uncompetitive. A Canadian Forces Labrador helicopter landing on \\"The Clapper\\", a sea stack off the tip of Bell Island, in 1987. During the early 1960s, the steel and coal industries on Cape Breton Island began to falter in the face of foreign competition. In 1966 the steel mill in Sydney and nearby coal mines were slated to be closed. At the same time, iron ore mining at Wabana stopped. Bell Island's resource-based economy was hard- hit by the shutdown, resulting in a large out-migration of residents. Some moved to the nearby growing metropolitan centre of St. John's. In recent decades a reverse move has occurred where housing is being built on Bell Island to accommodate residents who wish to commute by ferry (20 minutes each direction) to Portugal Cove and travel to work in the city. The scenic and sheltered waters of Conception Bay are also seeing an increase in pleasure boating activity as the suburban communities grow around nearby Conception Bay South. In September 2015, concerns were expressed over the possible collapse of the abandoned tunnels that formed part of the Bell Island mine. A retired miner, Peter Young, told CBC Radio's On The Go that tunnels under the abandoned mines, going down as far as two kilometres, hold the potential for a large-scale disaster. He felt that a collapse would initiate a local earthquake giving rise to the secondary effect of the water level in Conception Bay around the mine dropping which in turn could force a tsunami from the surrounding ocean.  Bell Island boom  On April 2, 1978, there was a loud explosion on Bell Island which caused damage to some houses and the electrical house wiring in the surrounding area. Two cup-shaped holes about two feet deep and three feet wide marked the major impact. A number of TV sets in Lance Cove, the surrounding community, exploded at the time of the blast. It was initially thought to be caused by ball lightning. Meteorologists stated that atmospheric conditions at the time were not conducive to lightning. The boom was heard 55 kilometers away in Cape Broyle. The impact occurred in the Bickfordville area, on the southwestern side of the island. The incident was investigated by John Warren and Robert Freyman from Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, in New Mexico. It has been speculated that, due to the two men's place of work, they were investigating a secret weapons test and were military attach√©s. However, reacting to data received from the Vela satellites, they were in fact investigating a \\"superbolt\\" ‚Äì an unusually large bolt of lightning, lasting an unusually long time: about a thousandth of a second. A documentary that aired on the History Channel about electromagnetic pulse weapons investigated the speculation that the incident may have been a result of top secret experiments. It was postulated that either the Soviet or the U.S. governments were the cause of the 'attack' and that it involved high energy beams focused into the ionosphere that were attracted by the iron in abandoned mines. In the Skeptoid podcast \\"The Bell Island Boom\\", presenter Brian Dunning dismissed that theory, stating, \\"Although iron is magnetic and can be magnetized, natural iron ore has its molecules jumbled in every direction and rarely happens to have a significant magnetic field, certainly not strong enough to divert or attract a particle beam.\\" Although some have pointed out that the natural oolitic iron ore on Bell Island is magnetic due to its hematite content, such ore does not generate a magnetic field, for the reasons Dunning discussed.√ñzdemir, √ñ.; Deutsch, E. R., \\"Magnetic properties of oolitic iron ore on Bell Island, Newfoundland,\\" Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 69, Issue 2, pp. 427‚Äì41. On April 23, 2019, hundreds of people on Bell Island heard a \\"loud bang\\" that \\"sounded like an explosion\\" followed by shaking that was felt as far as ten miles away in Harbour Grace. The cause was almost immediately determined to have been a massive section of rock breaking away from the northern part of the island and impacting the ground and sea with extreme force. Large cracks almost two feet across had been observed developing in the area in the years prior to the collapse and signs placed to warn visitors to stay away from the unstable features. The incident has cast doubt on some of the suspected causes of the original \\"Bell Island Boom\\". Bell Island mine expedition Steve Lewis, an experienced cave diver, wreck diver and member of The Explorers Club, led a team that photographed and assessed the Bell Island mine for \\"condition, safety and feasibility\\" of future research in 2006. On February 4, 2007, expedition member Joseph T. Steffen died of an air embolism during a dive into the mine. The project continued despite the loss of this explorer and team members managed to lay approximately two kilometers of line and document many of the mine's artifacts. Their report also provided the Bell Island Heritage Society with important information on artifacts left when mining operations ended in 1966.

The original portion of the building was constructed in 1903 for the Woodward's Department Store when that area of Cordova Street was the heart of Vancouver's retail shopping district. At one time this was the premiere shopping destination in Vancouver. The store was famous for its Christmas window displays and its basement Food Floor, and the \\"W\\" sign at the top of the building was a distinctive landmark on the Vancouver skyline. Since the bankruptcy of Woodward's in 1993 the building remained vacant except for a housing occupation in 2002 that initiated the redevelopment process. Redevelopment was seen by many as a key to revitalizing the Downtown Eastside, but the demolition of the structure in 2006 and redevelopment of the site has been met with much local resistance from the existing residents of the neighborhood. The Woodward's redevelopment is now complete with many residents and businesses now in the buildings.http://www.woodwardsdistrict.com/ HistoryEarly history= The building was built in 1903 by Charles A. Woodward as the second location for the Woodward's department store. Woodward's pioneered the concept of one- stop shopping; the store included a food floor which was at the time North America's largest supermarket, household items, men's and women's fashion, and provided cheque cashing, travel booking and other services. The store was well known for carrying a large variety of goods that were not available anywhere else. The store soon became a feature attraction in Vancouver, and it expanded over 12 separate phases to a final size of 12 storeys. It occupied approximately 2/3 of the city block. The popularity of Woodward's attracted many other businesses to the area. The building grew over many years in incremental phases, so the structure varied in each phase of the building. The majority of the building was supported by concrete slabs and columns with only the original 1903‚Äì08 building using massive heavy timber construction from the old growth forests that were available near Vancouver at the turn of the 20th century. Much of the square footage of the building was not retail space; mazes of stockrooms and offices comprised much of the building's space, outside the view of customers. In 1944, the landmark \\"W\\" was installed on the top of the building on a 25-metre replica of the Eiffel Tower, replacing a pre-war searchlight-beacon which had until then been the building's hallmark. The beacon, which was visible at night from as far away as Abbotsford and Mission, was shut down at the beginning of World War II because of its potential use as a landmark for aerial attacks. =Decline= Woodward's Building, 2005 Woodward's fortunes declined as customers gravitated toward suburban shopping malls during the 1960s. The relocation of the Eaton's department store from West Hastings and Richards (a few blocks away), to the uptown location of Pacific Centre in the 1960s, signaled the demise of West Hastings Street as the central retail district of the city. This was further exasperated by the deindustrialization of the old city centre, which lead to the migration of working class residents out of the area and the loss of an important source of clients. Immediately following deindustrialisation was the expansion of the quaternary sector of the post-industrial economy over at the West End, shifting major economic activities to the new city centre near Burrard and Georgia streets, further reducing Woodward's prominence. In the 1980s, Woodward's sold the food floor ‚Äì long known for its quality and its line of unusual specialities ‚Äì to Safeway. The flagship food floor became an IGA store until the building closed as Safeway showed no interest in that location. During the same time, the area around the Woodward's building started to decline socially and economically. In 1993, Woodward's went bankrupt and closed its doors. Many of the store's suburban locations were sold to the Hudson's Bay Company for conversion to Zellers and Bay stores, but there was little interest in the historic downtown building. The closing of the Woodward's store precipitated an even more rapid decline in the area. RedevelopmentEarly proposals= In 1995 the building was acquired by Fama Holdings. The firm by using services of Brook Development Planning, Davidson Yuen Simpson and Foad Rafii Architects developed a plan to build private housing in the building.http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/udp/1997/UDPJUL30.HTM However, many of those in the neighbourhood strongly objected, as they felt it important that the project incorporate social housing. The provincial government of British Columbia decided to fund some social housing as part of the project, but Fama and the province could not come to an agreement, and the project died. The building stood largely vacant, except for the occasional film shoot. In 2001 the province bought the building from Fama for $22 million. A variety of options were pursued to develop the building, but in early 2002 the new Provincial government put the project on hold. In the fall of 2002 a small group of community activists squatted the empty building for one week in a campaign to secure social housing from the Provincial government. After the police eviction a tent city was erected on the sidewalks around the building for another three months. The series of events is known as the Woodward's Squat, or \\"Woodsquat\\", which has been acknowledged for \\"setting in motion the eventual redevelopment of the landmark department store building\\".Doug Ward, ‚ÄúAnti-Olympic protesters get their game on‚Äù, The Vancouver Sun (29 January 2010) =Community-led redevelopment= Demolition of the Woodward's Building on 30 September 2006. The original 1903 section can be seen standing behind the cloud at Abbott and Hastings Streets. In 2003, the City of Vancouver, led by City Council member Jim Green, purchased the building from the province for $5 million, and began a public consultation process, asking the community what they wanted from the redevelopment. After a two-stage competition between three developers in September 2004, the city selected Westbank Projects/Peterson Investment Group to develop the project together with architecture firm of Henriquez Partners lead by Gregory Henriquez and structural engineers Glotman Simpson Consulting Engineers. The 400 million dollar, nearly one million square foot project, includes 536 market housing units, 125 singles non-market housing units to be operated by PHS Community Services, 75 family non-market housing units to be operated by Affordable Housing Society, Nesters Market, London Drugs, TD Canada Trust, the National Film Board of Canada and civic offices, a daycare, public atrium and plaza, and a new 130,000 square foot addition to Simon Fraser University's downtown campus, the SFU School for Contemporary Arts.http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/newsreleases2005/NRwoodwards_sfu.htm On the morning of 30 September 2006, all but the oldest original portion (1903‚Äì08 building) of the Woodward's structure was demolished with a \\"roll-over\\" implosion by Pacific Blasting which signalled the beginning of the construction of the new complex of buildings. =Results= The market housing units constructed in the building feature both modern-look finishes and vintage analog thermostats. The oldest part of the complex (built 1903‚Äì1908) was restored, and serves as a non-profit office and community space (31,500 sf), with tenants including W2 Community Media Arts. The development permit for construction was issued on January 26, 2007, and while substantial completion was scheduled for June 2010, delays pushed that completion date back to September 2010.

Life Sebastian was born to a Jewish family in BrƒÉila. After finishing his secondary studies, Sebastian went on to study law in Bucharest, but was soon attracted to the literary life and the exciting ideas of the new generation of Romanian intellectuals, as epitomized by the literary group Criterion which included such luminaries as Emil Cioran, Mircea Eliade and Eug√®ne Ionesco. Sebastian published several novels, including Accidentul (\\"The Accident\\") and Ora≈üul cu salc√¢mi (\\"The Town with Acacia Trees\\"), heavily influenced by French novelists such as Marcel Proust and Jules Renard. Although initially an apolitical movement, Criterion came under the increasing influence of Nae Ionescu's own brand of philosophy, called TrƒÉirism, which mixed jingoistic nationalism, existentialism and Christian mysticism, as well as that of the fascist and anti-Semitic paramilitary organization known as the Iron Guard. As a Jew, Sebastian came to be regarded as an outsider within the group, even by his friends. In 1934 he published another novel, De douƒÉ mii de ani (For Two Thousand Years), about what it meant to be a Jew in Romania, and asked Nae Ionescu, who at the time was still friendly with Sebastian, to write the preface. Ionescu agreed, generating uproar by inserting paragraphs both antisemitic and against the very nature of the book they introduced.See Paul Bailey, Guardian, 19 March 2016 Sebastian \\"decided to take the only intelligent revenge\\"Sebastian, Mihail. Cum am devenit huligan and publish the preface, which only heightened the controversy. Sebastian's decision to include the preface prompted criticism from the Jewish community (notable Jewish satirist Ludovic Halevy, for instance, referred to Sebastian as \\"Ionescu's lap dog\\"), as well as the far-right circles patronized by Ionescu and the Iron Guard. The anti-semitic daily newspaper SfarmƒÉ PiatrƒÉ (literally \\"Breaking Rocks\\") denounced Sebastian as a \\"Zionist agent and traitor\\", despite the fact that Sebastian vocally declared himself to be a proud Romanian with no interest in emigrating from his Romanian homeland. In response to the criticism, Sebastian wrote Cum am devenit huligan (How I Became a Hooligan), an anthology of essays and articles depicting the manner in which For Two Thousand Years was received by the Romanian public and the country's cultural establishment. In the book, he answered his critics by holding up a mirror to their prejudice, detailing and assailing the claims of both his right-wing and left-wing detractors. He addresses the rabid antisemitism of the former in a clear and unaffected manner, underlining its absurdity: > I was born in Romania, and I am Jewish. That makes me a Jew, and a Romanian. > For me to go around and join conferences demanding that my identity as a > Jewish Romanian be taken seriously would be as crazy as the Lime Trees on > the island where I was born to form a conference demanding their rights to > be Lime Trees. As for anyone who tells me that I'm not a Romanian, the > answer is the same: go talk to the trees, and tell them they're not trees. Yet for all the sharpness and clarity of his response, he could not help but feel betrayed and saddened by Ionescu's vicious preface: > What hurt me was not the idea that the preface would be made public - what > hurt me was the idea that it had been written. Had I known it would have > been destroyed immediately afterwards, it still would have hurt me had it > been written... Sebastian became known in Romanian literature mainly for his plays, such as Steaua fƒÉrƒÉ nume (\\"The Star Without a Name\\"), Jocul de-a vacan≈£a (\\"Holiday Games\\"), and Ultima orƒÉ (\\"Breaking News\\").  Journal of 1935-1944  For 10 years, Sebastian kept a journal that was finally published in Bucharest in 1996 to ‚Äúconsiderable debate‚ÄùRandu Ioanid, director of the Archival Program Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, noted that the Romanian publication of the diary ‚Äúcaused considerable debate‚Ä¶ which showed once again that anti- Semitism remains a fundamental element.‚Äù Ioanid, Radu, ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô to Mihail Sebastian‚Äôs Journal 1935-1944, London: Pimlico, 2003, xix. and in America under the title Journal, 1935-1944: The Fascist Years. It records the mounting persecution he endured and documents the disdain former friends began showing him in Romania's increasingly antisemitic sociopolitical landscape.See for instance, Alice Kaplan, New York Times, November 5, 2000 and Eugen Weber, LRB, 15 November 2001 A friend of Mircea Eliade, he was deeply disappointed when the latter supported the Iron Guard. Despite this ominous tone, the diary also reveals Sebastian's unflagging sense of humor and self-irony. A fundamental testimony of anti-Semitism in Europe prior to, and during, the years of World War II, the Journal has been compared to those of Victor Klemperer or Anne Frank.Philip Roth wrote that the work \\"deserves to be on the same shelf as Anne Frank's Diary and to find as huge a readership.\\" Quoted from his review on the cover of the British edition. He was a great lover of classical music and often attended concerts. In his Journal, there are many references to various classical composers and reviews of radio broadcast concerts. After being kicked out of his home due to the new antisemitic laws, Sebastian moved into a tenement slum where he continued his writing. On August 23, 1944, the Romanian government of Ion Antonescu was overthrown, and Romania joined the Allies (see Romania during World War II). Death Sebastian was hit by a truck and died on May 29, 1945. Legacy In the 2000s, Sebastian's Journal gained a new audience in Western countries due to its lyrical, evocative style and the brutal honesty of its accounts. The manuscript of the journal was obtained by Harry From, who arranged for their publication in 1996, by the Romanian publishing house Humanitas. In 2004, American playwright David Auburn wrote a one-man play based on Sebastian's diary titled, The Journals of Mihail Sebastian. It debuted the same year in New York City and starred Stephen Kunken in the role of Mihail Sebastian. Sebastian's niece, Michelle Hechter, a French writer and translator, published in 2000 an autobiographical work titled M. et M. dealing extensively with her uncle's life and writings. In 2006, Mihail Sebastian was posthumously awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for Voller Entsetzen, aber nicht verzweifelt.

First appearing in Doctor Strange #6 (February 1975) by writer Steve Englehart and artist Gene Colan, Gaea is the embodiment of the spirit of life, growth, harvest, and renewal on Earth. She is also the biological mother of Thor. *Galacta *Galactus - The devourer of worlds and sole survivor of the destruction of the previous universe, reborn in the Big Bang as a \\"galactic ravager\\".Super-Villain Classics #1 (May 1983) Although not an abstract, non-corporeal being,Quasar #38 his true form is unknown.As seen FF volume 1, #262, known as \\"The Trial of Galactus\\". He has stated that he exists to rectify the imbalances of Eternity and Death,Silver Surfer vol. 3 #18 prevents Abraxas' destructive influence on the universe, and in one alternate future initiates the creation of the next universe.The Last Galactus Story The Silver Surfer has stated that Galactus' death would cause an explosion with a span of 42 light years,Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter #4 (September 2009) and Eternity has stated that Galactus' death would result in the eventual collapse of the universe.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #10 (April 1988) Eternity has referred to him as the \\"third force of the universe\\", he has called Eternity \\"father\\",Fantastic Four vol.1, #262 and Death has called him \\"my husband and father, my brother and son\\", as they were \\"born at the same moment\\" and are \\"two corners of that great triangle which is the universe\\".Fantastic Four vol.1, #257 The Living Tribunal likened Galactus to equity.Silver Surfer #31 * Griever - Expressly female, Griever at the End of All Things is an aspect of Entropy and claims that her purpose is to witness the last light fade from the edge of Eternity and grieve for everything that ever was and was ever meant to be. She commands strange creatures called Endlings and had been following the Future Foundation during their journey to create and add new universes to the Multiverse which she repudiates as they overstepped their purpose. =H= *Hawk God of Arcturus - A long time enemy of Eternity *The Horde *Hunger - A universal-scale parasite that lives within the great Cosmic Vortex and feeds on whole realities. *Hyperstorm =I= *Infinites - Higher-dimensional entities far above Eternity, who once tried to 'align' the universe to a more balanced and efficient configuration.

Believed to embody the concept of space, and along with Eternity embodies the space/time continuum. Perhaps better described as \\"the other side of the coin,\\" and not as a fully separate entity from Eternity.Quasar #25; Infinity War #6 Infinity is the embodiment of the seventh Marvel Universe.Ultimates 2 #100 *Infinity Gauntlet *In-Betweener - Represents the synthesis between all concepts within the universe, such as life and death, order and chaos, love and hate, god and man, impotence and omnipotence. However, it resents its servitude to Order and Chaos, and has tried to break free several times. The In-Betweener was directly created by Order and Chaos and is looked upon by them as an agent. The Living Tribunal likened it to equity.Silver Surfer #31 =J= *Mad Jim Jaspers =K= *Korvac *Kosmos *Kronos- Once the ruler of Eternals of Earth. One of his experiments blew his atoms apart, so he now exists as a humanoid nebula. Apparently considered a cosmic entity with control over time and Power Cosmic on a universal level.Infinity Gauntlet #5 *Kubik *Knull God of Symbiotes =L= *The Living Tribunal - Judge of the cosmic entities who ensures that the cosmic laws are obeyed,Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1 and safeguards the multiverse from mystical imbalance. It has declared itself to \\"transcend the realms of Death and Eternity, Order and Chaos. All the opposing realities\\", likening itself to all spectra and scales of dualities and balance.Silver Surfer #31 Before the Living Tribunal can act his three faces must reach a unanimous verdict; these represent Necessity, Vengeance and Equity. It claims to act as a representative for an even higher being, that has never been explicitly shown. The Tribunal is generally considered to be the most powerful of all known cosmic entities, although Mephisto compared him to merely \\"the biggest kid in the schoolyard\\", adding that he is none too forthcoming about the \\"headmaster\\". Note that the Tribunal rules over all of the Marvel Universe's alternate versions as well; an M-Body of the Living Tribunal is present in each universe of the Marvel multiverse. *Logos - The self-proclaimed embodiment of Order after the Marvel Universe was reborn in its eighth incarnation. Due to the First Firmament influence, Master Order and Lord Chaos killed the Living Tribunal and forced their agent, the In-Betweener, to become the uniting force in a fusion that combined all three into a single being therefore giving birth to Logos. However the merger was later undone and Logos as since ceased to exist after it was split apart into the individual beings that composed it. *Lord Chaos - Embodies the universal concept of Chaos.

Numinus also received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #5, and appears in Groot #4 & 5 (Fall 2015). *Nemesis =O= *Oblivion - The counterpart of Death, but appears as a male. Embodies the nothingness from which everything came and will eventually return to. Perhaps better described as \\"the other side of the coin,\\" and not as a fully separate entity from Death.Quasar #25 * Odin *The One Above All - Also known as Above All Others, he is the God and the embodiment concept of the Marvel Multiverse and the superior of the Living Tribunal. * One Above All - The leader and most powerful member of the Celestials. While not much is known about him, the One Above All has been depicted as being far more emotional than the other Celestials, as he has been seen openly displaying fear, hate and sorrow. The material form of The One Above All would be used by the Queen of Nevers to bring forth the Fifth Host to thwart the First Firmament's attempt to take over the Multiverse. * One Below All - The evil counterpart of One Above All, he is the Demon God of the Below-Place, the deepest layer of the Hell dimension, and the gamma radiation. * Origin - A being apparently responsible for the existence of all superheroes and villains, by manipulating events and implanting ideas in their minds.

Its enemy is the Un-Being. *Onslaught =P= *Phoenix Force - The culmination of all psionic energy that exists, has existed, or ever will exist, via sentient life, it has been described as \\"a manifestation of the prime universal force of life\\" and \\"the passion of creation\\". It has a tendency to materially manifest via telepathic mortals at which times it is often portrayed as being a powerful force throughout the Marvel universe. At other times, it is known to exist as a non-conscious essence of nature, devoid of interaction with the physical realms. The Phoenix Force is usually associated with the mortal mutant Jean Grey who serves as avatar/host of the Phoenix Force. Jean Grey had actually become one with the Force, with all others merely serving as temporary vessels. Currently, Jean Grey has been revived once again and requested that the Phoenix Force leave her be to live her life. *The Proemial Gods - \\"Conceived through intent\\" by the Universe itself in the earliest stages of the creation event, as \\"order to balance chaos\\", and \\"caretakers\\", \\"tasked to maintain cosmic consonance\\". When Diableri of Chaos wished to impose his own will upon the Universe, a civil war broke out amongst them. Eventually, Diableri brought the war to Galactus. Galactus personally slew Diableri, and imprisoned the latter's two main lieutenants, Tenebrous of the Darkness Between and Aegis Lady of All Sorrows, possibly along with Antiphon the Overseer, within the Kyln.Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #2 Brio of Life, tasked with the welfare of fledgling life-forms, is the fifth Proemial God known by name. *Prot√©g√© *Proteus =Q= *Queen of Nevers - The embodiment of possibility and that which is not. She was romantically involved with the entity known as Eternity, the embodiment of all time and reality, creating moments when the universe and all possibility were one and anything could happen, a Land of Couldn't-Be Shouldn't-Be. =S= * The Second - Expressly male this mysterious entity is the first of a new breed and originator of the Omega Force, it is the incarnation of the second Marvel Universe.Ultimates 2 #100 *Shaper of Worlds *Lord Shiva *Shuma- Gorath *The Sixth - Expressly male, he is the inventor of science, builder of the junction to everywhere. He is the embodiment of the sixth Marvel Universe incarnation.Ultimates 2 #100 It is known that towards the period of multiversal renewal, in which he would give way for a new personification of the Multiverse to rise in his place, the Sixth Cosmos approached Galan of Taa and merged his essence with him, leading to the birth of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds, in the Seventh Cosmos.Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 *Sphinx *Stranger ‚Äì A cosmic mystery. The Living Tribunal once stated that on the empty fourth side of its skull \\"there could have been the face of the Stranger\\", and \\"I bestride all dualities, but I am not unified! I judge the dualities, and must thus know their nature! I who could be all must be but a part! I must be apart!.\\"Silver Surfer #31 The Stranger initially claimed to be a composite being, the result of the planet Gigantus' population merged into one entity, although this is likely a lie told by the Stranger to keep his true origin shrouded in mystery. The Stranger himself may not know his true origins, thus making him a stranger even to himself. *Star Brand the Original *Super-Ego - A sentient bio-verse of galactic proportions created by the Stranger, powerful enough to fight dozens of Celestials =T= *The Third - Expressly female this mysterious entity represents the continuation and is revealed to be the embodiment of the third incarnation of the Marvel Universe.Ultimates 2 #100 *Tyrant at original power. * The Sentry/Void (Robert 'Bob' Reynolds). =U= *Un-Being - An agent of Oblivion, seeks to kill Origin and erase all reality.

He ran the route from Los Angeles to New York City, much of it along U.S. Route 66, in 573 hours, 4 minutes, 34 seconds, (23 days) averaging over an 84-day staged run. Payne, a member of the Cherokee tribe, grew up in Foyil, Oklahoma which was one of the check point towns along the route of the race. His father was a friend of Will Rogers and had worked on the ranch of the latter's family during his youth. The footrace was organized to promote U.S. Route 66 which had recently been built as a simple, well-paved route across the country, and dubbed \\"the main street of America\\".

Life Robert was the second son of Archibald Campbell, fier of Glenlyon (eldest son of Duncan Campbell, 4th of Glenlyon), and his wife Jean, daughter of Sir Robert Campbell (1575-1657), 3rd Baronet and 9th Laird of Glenorchy. He inherited Meggernie Castle, in Glenlyon, from his father and set about improving it in line with current fashions. He roofed it with slates instead of thatch, he enlarged it very substantially and in the process created one of the stately homes of Perthshire. This, along with heavy drinking, gambling and a string of unwise investments, pushed him to the brink of bankruptcy. Though he borrowed from his friends, his relatives and his tenants, he still could not meet his debts. In a last effort to clear his debts, he sold all the woods of Glenlyon which were part of the old Caledonian forest. Workmen arrived from the lowlands to fell the trees, which were sent floating down the Lyon, choking the river, causing widespread flooding and consolidating his financial position. While Robert Campbell was still unable to satisfy his creditors, his own tenants offered him half their cattle to pay off his debts but he refused, and sold almost all of the estate to the Earl of Tullibardine in 1684. All that he retained was Chesthill, a house and small estate between Glenlyon and Fortingall, which belonged to his wife. In 1689, on their return from the Battle of Dunkeld, the MacIains of Glencoe (a sept of Clan MacDonald), together with their Glengarry cousins, looted Glenlyon, stole his livestock, and razed Campbell's last remaining holdings, increasing his financial problems from debts. In his subsequent appeal for compensation, Campbell showed he clearly believed the Glengarry men to be the more culpable, making no mention of Glencoe. In a final effort to support his wife and family, Robert Campbell, at the age of fifty nine, joined the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot and came to play his part in the Glencoe massacre. The fact of the stolen cattle and Glenlyon's involvement in the massacre were used by the authorities in an attempt to thinly veil the massacre as simply the outcome of thievery and clan rivalry. The available evidence, including the aforementioned appeal for compensation, shows that this was not the case.Massacre of Glencoe The Argyll Regiment was sent to fight in Flanders, in the War of the Grand Alliance, but was defeated by the French armies at Diksmuide in 1696, and Campbell died in poverty in Bruges on 2 August 1696. Family Campbell married (contract dated 1 October 1663) Helen, the daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay 1st Bt., of Evelick and his wife Marjorie, daughter of Sir Alexander Falconer 1st Bt., of Glenfarquhar in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. Lady Glenlyon was the sister-in-law of her cousin Sir Charles Ramsay, 3rd Bt., of Balmain. Their children included: * John Campbell, 6th of Glenlyon (born c. 1675); married Katherine, daughter of Patrick Smythe, 6th of Braco, 1st of Methven * Duncan Campbell, of Duneaves * Robert Campbell, who married Sarah Wood, daughter of John Wood of Tulliallan * Alexander Campbell, who married Mary, daughter of Duncan Stewart, 1st of Strathgarry; Minister of Dunoon. * James Campbell * Elizabeth Campbell, who married Alexander Campbell, 1st of Wester Ardeonaig * Janet Campbell, who married Robert Campbell, 1st of Borland * Jean Campbell, who married Robert MacNab of that Ilk, 10th Laird and 14th Chief of Bovaine.Gordon A.C.MacGregor, Campbell of Glenlyon, in The Red Book of Perthshire (Perthshire Heritage Trust, 2006) Notes and references  Category:1630 births Category:1696 deaths Category:Scottish soldiers Category:People from Perth and Kinross ","title":"Robert Campbell of Glenlyon"},{"id":"1615308","text":"Josette Banzet, Marquise de Bruyenne (born April 6, 1938) is an American-based actress.

Voruta is mentioned briefly only once in written sources and its exact location is unknown. Despite all the uncertainties, the concept of Voruta is well-known and popular in the Lithuanian imagination. Historiography Mindaugas, the first and the only crowned Lithuanian king, defended himself in Voruta during an internal war against his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas and Duke of Samogitia Vykintas in 1251. This information, taken from the Hypatian Chronicle, is the only recorded message about Voruta. A castle of Mindaugas was mentioned on two more occasions, but neither its name nor location was specified. It is unclear whether these brief mentions referred to the same location. Nevertheless, some historians in 19th and 20th centuries called it \\"the first capital of Lithuania\\" and attempted to identify its location. In total there were about fourteen suggested locations of Voruta. Others argue that Voruta was not an actual city, but just a misinterpretation of a word that means capital.

Al-Qadim uses One Thousand and One Nights as a theme and is set in the land of Zakhara, called the Land of Fate. Thematically, the land of Zakhara is a blend of the historical Muslim Caliphates, the stories of legend, and a wealth of Hollywood cinematic history. Zakhara is a peninsula on the continent of Faer√ªn in the world of Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, although Al-Qadim is designed to stand on its own or be added to any existing campaign setting. The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products: Al-Qadim: Arabian Adventures, a sourcebook describing character creation rules, equipment, and spells unique to the setting, and Al-Qadim: Land of Fate, a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara, with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master. Publication The first Al-Qadim product, Arabian Adventures, was released in 1992. Arabian Adventures presents only the basic rules for playing a D&D; game set in a general Arabian setting, much like the Oriental Adventures book. The specific details of the setting are dealt with in later publications. The Al-Qadim setting was designed to be limited in scope, and was conceived as a two-year project. Due to its popularity, it was extended by an extra year. Shannon Appelcline commented on Al-Qadim's 1992 release as \\"an Arabic setting that ended up placed in the southern Forgotten Realms. Like the other games of this period it had a strong artistic design, here overseen by Andria Hayday. The 'cultural book' as Grubb called it ‚Äì trying to suggest that it was an Oriental Adventures like release, rather than a full-blown campaign ‚Äì was well received. Grubb would later say that was because they had managed to hide the setting's potential from 'the suits'.\\" Important concepts There are a number of important concepts to the Zakharan culture including honor, family, social station, purity, piety, and hospitality. Zakharan society is broken into two main divisions: * Al-Badia: The nomadic desert people. * Al-Hadhar: The city people. Zakhara's society is made up mainly of humans, but demihumans such as elves and dwarves are present in the setting as well, as well as humanoids such as orcs, goblinoids, and ogres. Unlike most settings, there is practically no racial disharmony in Zakhara: humans, elves, and orcs alike share the same culture, lifestyle, and social status, and races traditionally considered evil savages, such as goblins, are instead valued members of society. The nomadic Al-Badia are predominantly human, whereas the Al-Hadhar possess greater diversity. The nomads and city-dwellers, humans and non-humans alike are all united as a single culture under a single religion (a polytheistic pastiche of Islam) and as subjects of the caliph; the entire continent is effectively a single empire, although different regions, city- states, and tribes have unique local cultures. Not all inhabitants of Zakhara belong to the shared culture, however: there are many tribes of pagan human barbarians who reject the Law of the Loregiver and the worship of the Pantheon, and certain monstrous races‚Äîincluding the yuan-ti, the vile yak-men (or yikaria as they call themselves), and most giants‚Äîdwell apart in their own societies. The people of Zakhara speak and write a common language called Midani (represented by Arabic). Zakhara has a wide variety of gods, but all recognize the power of Fate. Fate may cast down the mightiest sultan or raise up the meanest beggar. None can agree on her nature, whether the mother of the gods or an elemental force. All acknowledge her power, however. In Dungeons & Dragons game terms, Fate is not given statistics, spells, or priesthoods as are most deities. In the distant past, a woman known only as the Loregiver penned the scrolls that clearly laid out the laws of the land, some say guided by the hand of Fate. The wisdom of this Lore was immediately recognized and became the basis of law in Zakhara. The vast majority of Al-Hadhar and most Al-Badia are Enlightened in the way of the Loregiver. Characters Player characters in the Al-Qadim setting can choose from any of a number of character types. Al-Qadim uses the concept of character kits, a more rigid layer atop the traditional Dungeons & Dragons character classes. These kits are generally available to all characters, with certain restrictions based on the race of the character. All standard races are present, including humans, elves, dwarves, half-elves, gnomes, and halflings, although they do not suffer many of the racial prejudices traditional to most Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. Non-human characters are rarer than they are in other traditional Dungeons & Dragons settings, including the rest of Toril. The City of Delights accessory suggests goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, lizard men, ogres, half- ogres, orcs, and half-orcs as appropriate PC races as well. Standard classes allowed include all the classes from the player's handbook except specialty priests (including druids) and specialist wizards. Kits described in the core campaign setting are as follows: =Warriors= * Askar: citizen warriors * Corsair: swashbuckling seaborne warriors * Desert Rider: nomadic fighters who ride horses and camels across the desert * Faris: holy warriors fighting for their faith and their people * Mamluk: slave warriors noted for the special tattoos they wear * Mercenary Barbarian: warriors from abroad who come to fight for money, fame, or power * Outland Warrior: fighters truly foreign to the land of Zakhara =Wizards= * Elemental Mage: masters of one of the four elements: sand (earth), sea (water), flame (fire), or wind (air) * Sha' ir: wizards whose magic centers on genies and is aided by their familiars, gens (minor genies) * Sorcerer: the most common wizards in Zakhara, who deal with two elemental forces * Ajami: outland wizards from beyond the Land of Fate Additional wizard kits are presented in the Complete Sha'ir's handbook, which include the Astrologer, Clockwork Mage, Digitalogist, Ghul Lord, Jackal, Mageweaver, Mystic of Nog, and Spellslayer. =Rogues= * Sa'luk: free men or women who follow their own path * Barber: experts in the ways of the bazaar and the city * Beggar-Thief: often overlooked, they can go places others would be noticed * Holy Slayer: assassins working for an assassin order * Matrud: tribal cast outs making their own way in the Land of Fate * Merchant-Rogue: masters of the mercantile arts who carry their trade from town to town * Rawun: the story-tellers and bards of Zakharan society =Priests= * Pragmatist: the most liberal and common of all priests who try to adapt their faith to the everyday world * Ethoist: conservative priests who promote a particular path * Moralist: the most conservative and intolerant among the priests * Hakima: wise women who serve as valuable advisers to the outer tribes * Kahin: the idol-priests of Zakhara, often champions of nature * Mystic: eremitic priests who tend to visit populous centers to deliver prophetic pronouncements * Outland Priest: priests who follows a faith foreign to the Land of Fate Additional kits are presented in the \\"Scimitars Against the Dark\\" article in Dragon #198. These include the Priest Defender (Priest) and Sungazer (Wizard). In addition, the Tomb Robber (Rogue) is adapted from the Burglar kit.

Modeled after early 1960s groups like The Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul and Mary, the group was named after New York City's Washington Square Park, emblematic of Greenwich Village. The group, consisting of Bruce Jay Paskow, Tom Goodkind, and Lauren Agnelli, came up with their name over free drinks provided by Agnelli, who was a waitress at a Mickey Ruskin's Chinese Chance off Washington Square Park where Goodkind and Paskow were regulars. Paskow, Goodkind, and Agnelli dressed, played, and sang in a style evocative of the idealistic, left-leaning folk revival groups of the Kennedy era, but added a layer of post-punk Reagan-era irony. Paskow had previously played in the punk band The Invaders; Agnelli had been in the Nervus Rex and a writer for the Village Voice; Goodkind, the band's leader, had knocked around in U.S. Ape and was best known as creator and manager of large alternative music venues in Manhattan such as Irving Plaza, the Peppermint Lounge, and Roseland. The revivalist concept preceded any real familiarity with this genre of music: to put together their repertoire, the band bought a bunch of records, picked the brains of veteran folksingers, and pooled their money to send Goodkind to Washington, D.C. to do research on folk songs at the Library of Congress. They followed the Kingston Trio in covering \\"Greenback Dollar\\" and Peter, Paul and Mary in the traditional folk song, \\"Samson and Delilah\\", and also performed many other traditional folk songs including a bittersweet Polish song associated with the union Solidarity. Many of their own original songs were powerfully political, albeit tempered; for example, \\"You Can't Kill Me\\" alludes to the assassination of gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk with its line \\"Assassinated in Frisco for a straight man's crime\\". The band released two records while active; The Washington Squares and Fair and Square. Their first was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and was produced by Mitch Easter, best known for his work with R.E.M.. Their second was produced by Steve Soles, noted for his work with Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder Revue, and as a member of the Alpha Band with T-Bone Burnett. Three more albums of previously unreleased recordings are in the planning with the first due Thanksgiving 2016. The group broke up after Paskow's death in 1994. They reunited for one more concert at New York City's The Bottom Line, hosted by K-Rock's Vin Scelsa, where Tom played Tom Paxton's \\"Rambling Boy\\" to his old friend Bruce in tribute. The New York Dolls' David Johansen, Patti Smith Group's Lenny Kaye, Marshall Crenshaw, joined the Squares (with Joey Ramone - [the Ramones]from the audience) for the reunion. Agnelli has continued to perform on and off (she sings on some of Brave Combo's albums). Goodkind left the music business for some years, re-emerging as the conductor and arranger for the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor, an orchestra of volunteers who live near the World Trade Center site. He is also a voting member of his local local community board in lower Manhattan. The group reunited in 2018 at a sold out City Winery show with Peter Yarrow bringing Tom Goodkind to lead guitar and banjo with Billy Ficca on drums and Mike Fornatale on bass and vocals joining Tom and Lauren. Goodkind died after a long battle with a degenerative illness in February 2019 at the age of 65.

Image width is 1 km Mons Agnes: the only named hill inside Ina. Image width is 1 km Ina is a peculiar small depression (\\"crater\\" in IAU nomenclature) on the Moon, in Lacus Felicitatis. It is , wide and 64 m deep (from the deepest point of the bottom to the highest point of the rim). Ina is remarkable for several dozens low hills with flat or rounded tops and very sharp rounded boundaries, looking like drops of mercury. Their surface looks like the usual surface of the Moon while the space between them is very different. Ina is the most prominent of several dozen similar features on the Moon. Their origin is unclear. Discovery, exploration and naming Ina was discovered on photographs taken in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15 from lunar orbit. It could have been found 5 years earlier on images taken by Lunar Orbiter 4 had a photographic flaw not prevented this. At the end of 1972 Ina was observed and photographed by the crew of Apollo 17. After Apollo it was reconnoitred by several orbiting spacecraft beginning in 2009 when the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter obtained photos of Ina with resolution of about 0.5 m/pixel and with varying illumination angles. On a topophotomap published in 1974 by NASA this feature was given the Latin female name Ina, in accordance with the convention to give small lunar craters human first names. In 1979 this name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union. In Apollo-era publications the feature is called D-caldera due to its shape, and at the time it was believed to be a unique feature on the moon. Two neighbouring features were named in 1976. They are the small craters Osama on Ina's southwestern edge and Dag to its northwest (both 400 m in diameter). The widest hill in the eastern part of Ina (650 m wide) was named Mons Agnes in 1979. Description Ina is located on top of a rounded upland (dome) 300 m high and 15 km in diameter. It is situated on an elongated plateau (horst) about 30 km wide. This plateau stands in the middle of Lacus Felicitatis ‚Äí a small lunar lake between Mare Serenitatis, Mare Vaporum and Mare Imbrium. Ina is a D-shaped depression 2.9√ó1.9 km wide. It has an elevated rim 600‚Äì1000 m wide and 30‚Äì40 m high. The eastern part of the rim is 10 m higher than the western. Its outer slope is very gently sloping (1‚Äì3¬∞) and lacks a distinct edge while the inner slope is very steep (tens of degrees) and has a very sharp border with the depression. The deepest point of the depression is located somewhat to the northwest of its center. This point is 30 m deeper than the edges of the depression and 64 m deeper than the highest point of the rim. There are 2 clearly distinct types of surface inside Ina: hills and lowlands. The surface of the hills looks like the usual surface of Lacus Felicitatis while the surface of the lowlands is very different. There are several dozen hills within Ina. They are diverse in size and have rounded amoeba-like edges, like drops of mercury. Many of them are interconnected with other hills or with the edge of the depression. They are rather low (5‚Äì25 m, usually 10‚Äì15 m). Their tops are flat or slightly rounded while their slopes are steep. The edges of the hills are usually very sharp. Often they are surrounded by a little moat. The boundary between the hills and the lowland has the same appearance as the outer boundary of the depression. The surface of the hills is very smooth compared to the lowlands. In addition, although the sample size is not great, the hills do have an impact crater density intermediate between the fresh lowlands and the ancient neighboring plains of Lacus Felicitatis. Ina's lowlands are much rougher than its hills and show lots of small irregular relief features who's height is no more than several meters. Some craters are also discernible there. Some of the lowlands contain small patches with very bright tone. These are outcrops of scattered rocks in size. Such patches are located mainly near the border between the lowlands and the hills, especially in the lowest places. Ina's lowlands are bright bluish-grey. The hills are darker and brown (the usual lunar surface colour). The lowlands resemble freshly exposed basalt with high titanium content like the basalt seen in some young impact craters. Ina is surrounded by a weak dark halo. The surface of its surroundings is slightly more blue than the more distant surface. Analogs Ina is the most prominent, large and well-known representative of a class of features called irregular mare patches,Wood, Charles. \\"Strange Little IMPs.\\" Sky and Telescope, February 2015 issue. which are also known as \\"meniscus hollows\\" for the similarity of their edges to a convex meniscus. Several dozen such features are known on the Moon, all located on the maria. They are hypothesized to be volcanic in origin but several alternative hypotheses exist (see Origin below) and their origin is far from certain. Somewhat similar but distinct features, called hollows, are rather common on Mercury. These features differ from lunar meniscus hollows in having bright halos; they are also more widespread, often bigger and usually located in impact craters. Image:14284-Moon-Maskelyne-LRO-20141012.jpgIna-like feature in lunar Mare Tranquillitatis. Width of the image is 3 km. Image:Hollows in Raditladi 250.png\\"Hollows\\" on Mercury. Colors are enhanced. Width of the image is 7 km. InterpretationsAge= The surface of Ina's lowlands seems to be much younger than the surface of its hills and outer surroundings. Evidence of this includes the light color and low concentration of craters on these lowlands. The Moon's surface darkens over time and multiple meteorite impacts dot it with craters, blur sharp edges of all relief features and make slopes more gentle. Ina seems to be one of the youngest features on the Moon. The surface of the hills is much older: its age seems to be roughly equal to the age of the usual surface of Lacus Felicitatis (more than 1 billion years) but the slopes and edges of these hills are young: they couldn't maintain their steepness and sharpness even for 50 million years. The dome on which Ina sits seems to be somewhat younger than its surroundings, judging from crater concentration. On the other hand, there is a lower estimate for the age of the tops of Ina's hills: 33¬±2 million years (based on crater counts with the result of 137 craters/km2 for craters >10 m in diameter). The latest research suggests Ina is not so young. The study looked at well-studied volcanoes on Earth that might be similar to Ina. Ina appears to be a pit crater on a shield volcano, a gently sloping mountain similar to the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Kilauea has a pit crater similar to Ina known as the Kilauea Iki crater, which last erupted in 1959. As lava from that eruption solidified, it created a highly porous rock layer inside the pit with underground vesicles as large as three feet in diameter and surface void space as deep as two feet. That porous surface, Head and his colleagues say, is created by the nature of the lava erupted in the late stages of events like this. As the subsurface lava supply starts to diminish, it erupts as \\"magmatic foam\\" - a bubbly mixture of lava and gas. When that foam cools and solidifies it forms the highly porous surface. The researchers suggest that an Ina eruption would also have produced magmatic foam. And because of the Moon's decreased gravity and nearly absent atmosphere the lunar foam would have been even fluffier than on Earth so it is expected that the structures within Ina are even more porous than on Earth. It is the high porosity of those surfaces that throws off date estimates for Ina, both by hiding the buildup of regolith and by throwing off crater counts. A highly porous surface, the researchers say, would allow loose rock and dust to filter into surface void space, making it appear as though less regolith has built up. That process would be perpetuated by seismic shaking in the region, much of which is caused by ongoing meteor impacts. \\"It's like banging on the side of a sieve to make the flour go through,\\" Head said. \\"Regolith is jostled into holes rather than sitting on the surface, which makes Ina look a lot younger.\\" Porosity could also skew crater counts. Laboratory experiments using a high-speed projectile cannon have shown that impacts into porous targets make much smaller craters. Because of Ina's extreme porosity, the researchers say, its craters are much smaller than they would normally be, and many craters might not be visible at all. That could drastically alter the age estimate derived from crater counts. The researchers estimate that the porous surface would reduce by a factor of three the size of craters on Ina's mounds. In other words, an impactor that would make a 100-foot-diameter crater in lunar basalt bedrock would make a crater of a little over 30 feet in a foam deposit. Taking that scaling relationship into account, the team gets a revised age for the Ina mounds of about 3.5 billion year. That's similar to the surface age of the volcanic shield that surrounds Ina, and places the Ina activity within the timeframe of common volcanism on the Moon. The researchers believe this work offers a plausible explanation for Ina's formation without having to invoke the puzzling billion-year pause in volcanic activity. \\"We think the young-looking features in Ina are the natural consequence of magmatic foam eruptions on the Moon,\\" Head said. \\"The landforms created by these foams simply look a lot younger than they are.\\" =Origin= Ina's origin is unclear as of 2015. Firstly it was interpreted as a caldera of a very low ancient volcano. Another version considers it as a result of powerful ejection of some gases (volcanic or even radiogenic), which removed regolith. In that case the hills are places where the original regolith was preserved. The other hypothesis says that the hills are lava flows, inflated during growth under some dense coating. All these versions have flaws. In particular, Ina does not seem to have a ring of volcanic ejecta, and the volcanic activity on the Moon seems to have ceased a long time ago. According to one another version, Ina appeared (and continues to form) due to collapse of the regolith into some underground cavities. These may be ancient lava tubes or the result of evaporation of volatile compounds. In that case the bright rocky places on Ina's floor are where the regolith has already fallen while darker parts of the lowlands are where collapse is incomplete collapsing, and the hills are the slowly diminishing remains of the primigenial surface.

Development The French gun-making company Darne, which became famous for its innovative shotguns, entered the world of military weapons in 1915, when it was contracted by French government to manufacture Lewis machine guns. In 1916 this same company announced development of its own machine gun of indigenous design. This belt-fed weapon was designed especially for rapid manufacturing techniques, and without any unnecessary refinements typical for most contemporary small arms. External finish and appearance of the Darne machine gun was crude, but worked well and its price was much lower than of any contemporary weapon of compatible combat characteristics. The French Army tested Darne machine guns during 1917/1918, but the Great War ended before production contracts could have been signed. Despite that fact, during the 1920s and 1930s Darne company managed to refine an aircraft variant of the machine gun to the point of its adoption by French and some other air forces for the role of an observers gun. However, there were many more variants of the Darne machine gun, although most others were certainly less successful. For example, in the 1920s and 1930s Darne offered a number of lightweight belt-fed machine guns for infantry or vehicle use. All these machine guns were made to the same concept of least expensive finish, and unlike its aircraft variants found no buyers during the inter-war period. It was eventually replaced by the MAC 1934 for Air Force use, although the French Navy continued to use them into World War II. Small numbers were also exported to Brazil, Spain, Yugoslavia, Italy and Lithuania, and captured French Darnes were used by German occupation forces for coastal defense. The initial guns were made by Darne in France but it appears that later production was outsourced to Spain, where it could be done more cheaply. Overview The MAC 32 Reibel prototype, and a Darne machine gun on display at the Ouvrage Fermont museum. The Darne machine gun is gas operated, firing from open bolt in full automatic only. Breech is locked by tilting the rear part of the bolt up into the mortise cut in the roof of receiver (A la M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle). The Darne machine gun has an unusual belt feed between the gas piston and barrel, using the two-stage cartridge feed system (cartridge withdrawn from the belt to the rear, and then pushed forward into the barrel). The weapon usually has provisions to attach a belt box directly below the receiver to improve handling characteristics of the gun. Earlier versions of the Darne were chambered for the 8mm Lebel cartridge, but the weapon was quickly updated to the new 7.5mm French military cartridge. Some export guns were also made in 8mm Mauser, and various other cartridges. VariantsLand Variant= Infantry versions of the Darne machine gun were normally fitted with a pistol grip and rifle-type trigger below receiver, and a wooden buttstock. Alternate variants featured skeletonized pistol grip made of metal and a top-folding shoulder stock, also made of metal. A folding bipod or a compact lightweight tripod was used to mount the Darne machine guns in ground roles. =Aircraft Variant= The aircraft variant equipped French aircraft until 1935 when it was replaced by the MAC 1934, except in naval aircraft. Often criticized for its lack of reliability in the aircraft role, as other similar rifle calibers, the 7.5 mm bullets proved to be too light for air combat in World War II.

ECA is an initialism for ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin, with variants of it including the EC stack, which removes the aspirin for those who can not tolerate it. Dietary supplements based on or including elements of ECA were popular through the 1990s and early 2000s, but the marketing of ephedra- or ephedrine-containing stimulant combinations for weight loss and bodybuilding is now restricted or illegal in the United States, Canada and Netherlands due to reports of heart attack, stroke, and death associated with these supplements.  Use as a supplement  While it was available as a supplement, ECA was marketed with claims that it would aid weight loss, improve athletic performance and increase energy. Placebo-controlled studies have consistently found ephedrine in combination with caffeine to be effective in promoting moderate fat loss in the already-obese. A meta-analysis combining results from all available studies estimated average weight loss of 1 kg/month more than placebo. There is insufficient evidence to support use of ephedra for athletic performance. Natural supplements that contain ephedra (aka Ma Huang) as an ephedrine substitute have been linked to cases of heart attack, stroke, and death in healthy young adults even when taken at the labeled dosage. A 2003 meta-analysis of all available studies and case reports concluded that: \\"ephedrine- and ephedra-containing dietary supplements [...] have harms in terms of a 2- to 3-fold increase in psychiatric symptoms, autonomic symptoms, upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and heart palpitations. More serious adverse effects from ephedra use cannot be excluded at a rate less than 1.0 per thousand, and case reports raise the possibility that a causal relationship with serious adverse events may exist.\\" Legal status Due to deaths linked to ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the potential use of ephedrine as a precursor in illegal methamphetamine manufacture, many countries have taken steps to regulate these products. =Status in The United States= In the United States, it is illegal to market products containing ephedrine or ephedra alkaloids as a dietary supplement. In 2004, ephedra, a botanical source of ephedrine alkaloids, was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to serious safety concerns, injuries, and deaths linked to ephedra-containing supplements. However, ephedrine itself has never been illegal in the United States and is currently available over-the-counter. Reporting requirements and quantity limitations vary by state.

Souchon commanded the Kaiserliche Marines Mediterranean squadron in the early days of the war. His initiative played a major part in the entry of the Ottoman Empire into World War I. Biography Wilhelm Anton Souchon was born on 2 June 1864 in Germany to a family of Huguenot ancestry. In July 1914, hostilities erupted between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia. Rear Admiral Souchon, a native of Leipzig, feared being trapped in the Adriatic Sea in the event of other nations joining in the conflict. Because of this, Souchon took his two ships, the battlecruiser and the light cruiser , into the western Mediterranean. When World War I began on 4 August 1914, he bombarded the French-Algerian ports of B√¥ne and Philippeville. He successfully eluded British attempts to corner him (see Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau) and on 10 August 1914, his small squadron arrived at the Dardanelles. Admiral Souchon and His Officers After two days of negotiations, he was allowed to take his ships to Istanbul where they were subsequently transferred officially into the Ottoman Navy. Souchon was appointed Commander-in-chief of the Ottoman Navy and served in this position until September 1917. This gesture by Germany had an enormously positive impact with the Turkish population. At the outbreak of the war, Winston Churchill caused outrage when he \\"requisitioned\\" without compensation two almost completed Turkish battleships in British shipyards, Sultan Osman I and Reshadieh, that had been financed by public subscription. These ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy as and , respectively. On 15 August 1914, in the aftermath of Souchon's daring dash to Constantinople, Turkey cancelled their maritime agreement with Britain and the Royal Navy mission under Admiral Limpus, and left by 15 September. The Dardanelles were fortified with German assistance and the Bosporus was secured by the presence of Goeben (now Yavuz Sultan Selim). On 27 September 1914, the Straits were officially closed to all international shipping. On 29 October 1914, Souchon's fleet launched the Black Sea Raid, a naval attack which brought the Ottoman Empire into World War I. His ships laid several sea minefields and shelled the Russian Black Sea ports of Sevastopol, Odessa, and others, destroying the Russian minesweeper, Prut, in the process. British naval units quickly retaliated on Turkish merchant ships off ƒ∞zmir. On 2 November 1914, Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. On 5 November, Britain followed suit and on 12 November 1914, the Ottoman government officially declared war on the Triple Entente. For the next three years, Souchon attempted to reform the Ottoman Navy while conducting a number of raids on Russian shipping, ports, and coastal installations in the Black Sea. Promoted to vice admiral, Souchon was awarded the Pour le M√©rite, Germany's highest military order, on 29 October 1916. In September 1917, Souchon returned to Germany. There he received command of the Fourth Battleship Squadron of the High Seas Fleet during Operation Albion. By the end of the war, he was commanding officer of the Imperial Navy base at Kiel. At the outbreak of the Kiel mutiny on 3 November 1918, Souchon asked for outside troops, but revoked his request for military help when his staff claimed the situation was under control. Souchon had been deployed to Kiel a few days earlier on 30 October 1918, and had therefore to rely heavily on his staff. On 4 November, the request had to be renewed. Altogether six infantry companies were brought to Kiel. Some units stayed in the city quarter Wik, and in the Marinestation der Ostsee. However, these troops showed signs of disintegration and some joined the revolutionaries. Souchon had to negotiate and order the withdrawal of the units. Dirk D√§hnhardt: Revolution in Kiel. Neum√ºnster 1978, S. 83 f. In the course of the events, Souchon stepped down as governor and was replaced by the civilian social democratic politician, Gustav Noske. Admiral Souchon died in Bremen on 13 January 1946. Legacy Souchon's nephew, Hermann Souchon (1894‚Äì1982), was the assassin of Rosa Luxemburg.

Commissioned on 30 September 1911, the ship was the second battlecruiser of the Imperial Navy. Moltke, along with her sister ship , was an enlarged version of the previous German battlecruiser design, , with increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret. Compared to her British rivals‚Äîthe ‚ÄîMoltke and her sister were significantly larger and better armored. The ship participated in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the German Navy during the First World War, including the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea in 1915 and 1916, respectively. She also took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915 and Operation Albion in 1917 in the Baltic. Moltke was damaged several times during the war: the ship was hit by heavy-caliber gunfire at Jutland, and torpedoed twice by British submarines while on fleet advances. Following the end of the war in 1918, Moltke, along with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was scuttled, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them from falling into Allied hands. The wreck of Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929.  Design  As the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) continued in its arms race with the British Royal Navy in 1907, the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) considered plans for the battlecruiser that was to be built for the following year. An increase in the budget raised the possibility of increasing the caliber of the main battery from the guns used in the previous battlecruiser, , to , but Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Navy, opposed the increase, preferring to add a pair of 28 cm guns instead. The Construction Department supported the change, and ultimately two ships were authorized for the 1908 and 1909 building years; Moltke was the first, followed by . Moltke was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of fully loaded. The ship displaced normally, and at full load. Moltke was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by twenty-four coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . At , the ship had a range of . Her crew consisted on 43 officers and 1,010 enlisted men. The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/50 gunss mounted in five twin-gun turrets; of these, one was placed forward, two were en echelon amidships, and the other two were in a superfiring pair aft. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/45 guns placed in individual casemates in the central portion of the ship and twelve SK L/45 guns, also in individual mounts in the bow, the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. The ship's armor consisted of Krupp cemented steel. The belt was thick where it covered the ship's ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. The belt tapered down to on either end. The deck was thick, sloping downward at the side to connect to the bottom edge of the belt. The main battery gun turrets had faces, and they sat atop barbettes that were equally thick.  Service history  Moltke in New York in 1912 = Pre-war = The contract for \\"Cruiser G\\" was awarded on 17 September 1908, under building number 200. The keel was laid on 7 December 1908, and the ship was launched on 7 April 1910. \\"Cruiser G\\" was commissioned on 30 September 1911, as SMS Moltke. At the launching of the ship on 7 April 1910, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger christened her after his uncle, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army in the mid-19th century. On 11 September 1911, a crew composed of dockyard workers transferred the ship from Hamburg to Kiel through the Skagerrak. On 30 September, the ship was commissioned, under the command of Kapit√§n zur See von Mann, and replaced in the Reconnaissance Unit. Sea trials continued until 1 April 1912. Moltke was the only German capital ship to ever visit the United States. On 11 May 1912 she left Kiel, accompanied by the light cruisers and , and arrived off Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 30 May. After touring the East Coast for two weeks, she returned to Kiel on 24 June. In July 1912, Moltke escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht to Russia. Upon returning, Moltkes commander was replaced by KzS Magnus von Levetzow, and the ship became the Reconnaissance Force flagship until 23 June 1914, when the commander's flag was transferred to the new battlecruiser . There was some consideration given to deploying Moltke to the Far East in order to replace the armored cruiser , but the plan was abandoned when it became apparent that needed replacement in the Mediterranean. Moltke was then scheduled to transfer to replace her sister ship, but this plan was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. = World War I = As was the case with almost all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was somewhat limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.  Battle of Heligoland Bight  Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, on 28 August 1914, Moltke participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight. During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the Heligoland Bight. Six German light cruisers‚Äî, , Stettin, , , and ‚Äîresponded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. However, the arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage. Along with the rest of the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, Moltke was stationed in the Wilhelmshaven Roads on the morning of the battle. By 08:50, Rear Admiral Hipper had requested permission from Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, to send Moltke and Von der Tann to relieve the beleaguered German cruisers. Moltke was ready to sail by 12:10, but the low tide prevented the ships from being able to pass over the sand bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary safely. At 14:10, Moltke and Von der Tann were able to cross the Jade bar; Hipper ordered the German cruisers to fall back to his ships, while Hipper himself was about an hour behind in the battlecruiserSeydlitz. At 14:25, the remaining light cruisers‚ÄîStrassburg, Stettin, Frauenlob, Stralsund, and Ariadne‚Äîrendezvoused with the battlecruisers. Seydlitz arrived on the scene by 15:10, while Ariadne succumbed to battle damage and sank. Hipper ventured forth cautiously to search for the two missing light cruisers, and C√∂ln, which had already sunk. By 16:00, the German flotilla turned around to return to the Jade Estuary, arriving at approximately 20:23.  Bombardment of Yarmouth  On 2 November 1914, Moltke, Rear Admiral Hipper's flagship Seydlitz, Von der Tann, and Bl√ºcher, along with four light cruisers, left the Jade Estuary and steamed towards the English coast. The flotilla arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port, while the light cruiser Stralsund laid a minefield. The British submarine responded to the bombardment, but struck one of the mines laid by Stralsund and sank. Shortly thereafter, Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters. However, while Hipper's ships were returning to German waters, a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight, so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved so they could safely navigate the defensive minefields. The armored cruiser left the Jade without permission, and while en route to Wilhelmshaven made a navigational error that led the ship into one of the German minefields. Yorck struck two mines and quickly sank; the coastal defense ship was able to save 127 men of the crew.  Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby  It was decided by Admiral von Ingenohl that another raid on the English coast was to be carried out, in the hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat, where it could be destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Moltke, Seydlitz, Von der Tann, , and , along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover. On 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser had run aground in the Gulf of Finland; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found codebooks used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy. Room 40 began decrypting German signals, and on 14 December, intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough. However, the exact details of the plan were unknown, and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port, as in the previous bombardment. Vice Admiral Beatty's four battlecruisers, supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, along with the 2nd Battle Squadron's six dreadnoughts, were to ambush Hipper's battlecruisers. During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Seydlitz, Moltke, and Bl√ºcher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. During the bombardment of Hartlepool, Moltke was struck by a shell from a coastal battery, which caused minor damage between decks, but no casualties. Bl√ºcher was hit six times and Seydlitz three times by the coastal battery. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward. alt=Map showing the locations of the British and German fleets; the German light cruisers pass between the British battleship and battlecruiser forces while the German battlecruisers steam to the northeast. The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships. By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape. Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents. Admiral Ingenohl's reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity. The captain of Moltke was furious; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back \\"because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been eliminated ... under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing.\\" The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet, stating: \\"he decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory.\\"  Battle of Dogger Bank  alt=A large ship steams at full speed: the ship plows into the sea while dark gray smoke pours from its smoke stacks. In early January 1915, it became known that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area. Ingenohl was initially reluctant to destroy these forces, because I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance. However, Konteradmiral Richard Eckermann, the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank. On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with his flag in Seydlitz, followed by Moltke, Derfflinger, and Bl√ºcher, along with the light cruisers Graudenz, Rostock, Stralsund, and Kolberg and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. Graudenz and Stralsund were assigned to the forward screen, while Kolberg and Rostock were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached. Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. Although they were unaware of the exact plans, the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area. To counter it, Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Archibald Moore's 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron and Commodore William Goodenough's 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were to rendezvous with Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force at 08:00 on 24 January, approximately north of the Dogger Bank. At 08:14, Kolberg spotted the light cruiser and several destroyers from the Harwich Force.Aurora challenged Kolberg with a searchlight, at which point Kolberg attacked Aurora and scored two hits. Aurora returned fire and scored two hits on Kolberg in retaliation. Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire, when, almost simultaneously, Stralsund spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position. This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming towards Hipper's ships. Hipper turned south to flee, but was limited to , which was the maximum speed of the older armored cruiser Bl√ºcher. The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at , and quickly caught up to the German ships. At 09:52, opened fire on Bl√ºcher from a range of approximately 20,000 yards (18,300 m); shortly thereafter, and began firing as well. At 10:09, the British guns made their first hit on Bl√ºcher. Two minutes later, the German ships began returning fire, primarily concentrating on Lion, from a range of 18,000 yards (15,460 m). At 10:28, Lion was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker. At 10:30, , the fourth ship in Beatty's line, came within range of Bl√ºcher and opened fire. By 10:35, the range had closed to 17,500 yards (16,000 m), at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts. However, confusion aboard Tiger led the captain to believe he was to fire on Seydlitz, which left Moltke able to fire without distraction. At 10:40, one of Lions shells struck Seydlitz causing nearly catastrophic damage that knocked out both of the rear turrets and killed 159 men. Disaster was averted when the executive officer ordered the flooding of both magazines to avoid a flash fire that would have destroyed the ship. By this time, the German battlecruisers had zeroed in on Lion and began scoring repeated hits. At 11:01, an shell from Seydlitz struck Lion and knocked out two of her dynamos. At 11:18, Lion was hit by two shells from Derfflinger, one of which struck the waterline and penetrated the belt, allowing seawater to enter the port feed tank. This shell eventually crippled Lion by forcing the ship to turn off its engines because of seawater contamination. By this time, Bl√ºcher was severely damaged after having been pounded by heavy shells. However, the chase ended when there were several reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships; Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance from their pursuers. At this time, Lions last operational dynamo failed, which dropped her speed to 15 knots. Beatty, in the stricken Lion, ordered the remaining battlecruisers to \\"Engage the enemy's rear,\\" but signal confusion caused the ships to solely target Bl√ºcher, allowing Moltke, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger to escape. By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded Princess Royal, the German ships had too far a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase.  Battle of the Gulf of Riga  On 3 August 1915, Moltke was transferred to the Baltic with I Reconnaissance Group (AG) to participate in the foray into the Riga Gulf. The intention was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, including the pre-dreadnought , and to use the minelayer to block the entrance to Moon Sound with naval mines. The German forces, under the command of Vice Admiral Hipper, included the four and four s, the battlecruisers Moltke, Von der Tann, and Seydlitz, and a number of smaller craft. On 8 August, the first attempt to clear the gulf was made; the old battleships and kept Slava at bay while minesweepers cleared a path through the inner belt of mines. During this period, the rest of the German fleet remained in the Baltic and provided protection against other units of the Russian fleet. However, the approach of nightfall meant that Deutschland would be unable to mine the entrance to Moon Sound in time, and so the operation was broken off. On 16 August, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf. The dreadnoughts and , four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats breached the defenses to the gulf. Nassau and Posen engaged in an artillery duel with Slava, resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that prompted her withdrawal. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the gulf the following day. Throughout the operation, Moltke remained in the Baltic and provided cover for the assault into the Gulf of Riga. On the morning of the 19th, Moltke was torpedoed by the British E-class submarine . The torpedo was not spotted until it was approximately 200 yards (183 m) away; without time to maneuver, the ship was struck in the bow torpedo room. The explosion damaged several torpedoes in the ship, but they did not detonate themselves. Eight men were killed, and of water entered the ship. The ship was repaired at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, between 23 August and 20 September.  Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft  Moltke also took part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24‚Äì25 April. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker. The German battlecruisers Derfflinger, , Moltke, Seydlitz and Von der Tann left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of six light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Boedicker's ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50. The German battlecruisers bombarding Lowestoft By 14:00, Boedicker's ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, Seydlitz struck a naval mine, which tore a 50-foot (15 m) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400 short tons (1,250 long tons) of water to enter the ship. Seydlitz turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of . The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, Seydlitz was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat brought Boedicker to L√ºtzow. At 04:50 on 25 April, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers and , which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Commodore Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force. Boedicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers destroyed two 6 in (15 cm) shore batteries and inflicted other damage to the town. In the process, a single 6 in shell from one of the shore batteries struck Moltke, but the ship sustained no significant damage. At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one salvo each, with the exception of Derfflinger, which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47 encountered for the second time the Harwich Force, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the screening force. Boedicker's ships opened fire from a range of 13,000 yards (12,000 m). Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, Boedicker broke off the chase and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany.  Battle of Jutland  Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916 =Deployment= Moltke, and the rest of Hipper's battlecruisers in I Scouting Group, lay anchored in the outer Jade Roads on the night of 30 May 1916. The following morning, at 02:00 CEST, the ships slowly steamed out towards the Skagerrak at a speed of . Moltke was the fourth ship in the line of five, ahead of Von der Tann, and to the rear of Seydlitz. The II Scouting Group, consisting of the light cruisers , Rear Admiral Boedicker's flagship, , , and Elbing, and 30 torpedo boats of the II, VI, and IX Flotillas, accompanied Hipper's battlecruisers. An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet under the command of Admiral Scheer left the Jade; the force was composed of 16 dreadnoughts. The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser Rostock. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00. =Run to the south= alt=A large ship is sinking in the distance; a large dense cloud of smoke emanates from the wreck. Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force encountered Vice Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000 m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. At 16:52, Moltke hit Tiger with two main gun shells, but neither of these hits caused any significant damage. Moltke then fired a further four shells, two of which hit simultaneously on the midships and after turrets, knocking both out for a significant period of the battle. Approximately 15 minutes later, the British battlecruiser was suddenly destroyed by Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter, Moltke fired four torpedoes at Queen Mary at a range between . This caused the British line to fall into disarray, as the torpedoes were thought to have been fired by U-boats. At this point, Hipper's battlecruisers had come into range of the V Battle Squadron, composed of the new s, which mounted powerful guns. At 17:06, opened fire on Von der Tann. She was joined a few minutes later by , Malaya, and ; the ships concentrated their fire on Von der Tann and Moltke. At 17:16, one of the 15 in shells from the fast battleships struck Moltke, where it pierced a coal bunker, tore into a casemate deck, and ignited ammunition stored therein. The explosion burned the ammunition hoist down to the magazine. Von der Tann and Moltke changed their speed and direction, which threw off the aim of the V Battle Squadron and earned the battered ships a short respite. While Moltke and Von der Tann were drawing the fire of the V Battle Squadron battleships, Seydlitz and Derfflinger were able to concentrate their fire on the British battlecruisers; between 17:25 and 17:30, at least five shells from Seydlitz and Derfflinger struck Queen Mary, causing a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the ship. Moltkes commander, Kapit√§n zur See von Karpf, remarked that \\"The enemy's salvos lie well and close; their salvos are fired in rapid succession, the fire discipline is excellent!\\" =Battlefleets engage= By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. However, he had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre- dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line. Moltke and the other battlecruisers followed the move, which put them astern of K√∂nig. Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer's ships led Admiral Jellicoe to turn his ships eastward, towards what he thought was the likely path of the German retreat. The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships at the center of the British fleet. The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent Moltke, Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700 yards (7,040 m) of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line. However, three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack. =Withdrawal= A chunk of armor blown off Moltke during the Battle of Jutland A pause in the battle at dusk allowed Moltke and the other German battlecruisers to cut away wreckage that interfered with the main guns, extinguish fires, repair the fire control and signal equipment, and ready the searchlights for nighttime action. During this period, the German fleet reorganized into a well-ordered formation in reverse order, when the German light forces encountered the British screen shortly after 21:00. The renewed gunfire gained Beatty's attention, so he turned his battlecruisers westward. At 21:09, he sighted the German battlecruisers, and drew to within before opening fire at 20:20. The attack from the British battlecruisers completely surprised Hipper, who had been in the process of boarding Moltke from the torpedo boat . The German ships returned fire with every gun available, and at 21:32 hit both Lion and Princess Royal in the darkness. The maneuvering of the German battlecruisers forced the leading I Battle Squadron to turn westward to avoid collision. This brought the pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron directly behind the battlecruisers, and prevented the British ships from pursuing the German battlecruisers when they turned southward. The British battlecruisers opened fire on the old battleships; the German ships turned southwest to bring all of their guns to bear against the British ships. By 22:15, Hipper was finally able to transfer to Moltke, and then ordered his ships to steam at towards the head of the German line. However, only Moltke and Seydlitz were in condition to comply; Derfflinger and Von der Tann could make at most 18 knots, and so these ships lagged behind. Moltke and Seydlitz were in the process of steaming to the front of the line when the ships passed close to Stettin, which forced the ship to drastically slow down to avoid collision. This forced Frauenlob, Stuttgart, and M√ºnchen to turn to port, which led them into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; at a range of , the cruisers on both sides pummeled each other. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter decided to attempt to lure the British cruisers towards Moltke and Seydlitz. However, nearly simultaneously, the heavily damaged British cruisers broke off the attack. As the light cruisers were disengaging, a torpedo fired by struck Frauenlob, and the ship exploded. The German formation fell into disarray, and in the confusion, Seydlitz lost sight of Moltke. Seydlitz was no longer able to keep up with Moltkes , and so detached herself to proceed to the Horns Reef lighthouse independently. By 23:30 on her own, Moltke encountered four British dreadnoughts, from the rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapit√§n von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, hoping he had not been detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapit√§n von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape. alt=A large gray warship, heavily flooded; its deck is nearly submerged. Thick black smoke pours from the funnels. An in-photo caption reads: \\"Seydlitz nach der Skaggerack- schlacht\\", or \\"Seydlitz after the Skaggerak battle.\\" Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Admiral Scheer informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, Derfflinger and Von der Tann each had only two guns in operation, Moltke was flooded with 1,000 tons of water, and Seydlitz was severely damaged. Hipper reported: \\"I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbour by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet.\\" During the course of the battle, Moltke had hit Tiger 13 times, and was hit herself 4 times, all by shells. The No. 5 starboard 15 cm gun was struck by one of the 15 in shells and put out of action for the remainder of the battle. The ship suffered 16 dead and 20 wounded, the majority of which were due to the hit on the 15 cm gun. Flooding and counter-flooding efforts caused 1,000 tons of water to enter the ship.  Later operations  During the fleet advance on 18‚Äì19 August, I Scouting Group was to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. As Moltke was one of only two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition in the Group (Von der Tann being the other), three dreadnoughts were assigned to the Group for the operation: , , and the newly commissioned . Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. In September 1917, KzS von Karpf left Moltke; KzS Gygas assumed command of the ship. Between September and October 1917, the ship took part in Operation Albion supporting the German invasion of the Russian islands of √ñsel, Dag√∂, and Moon (in present-day Estonia). Following the successful operation in the Baltic, Moltke was detached to support the II Reconnaissance Group (II AG), but did not actively participate in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet beginning to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer the opportunity for which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet. At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. At 05:10 on 24 April, Moltke suffered machinery failure: the starboard propeller had fallen off the shaft, and before the turbine could be stopped, a gear wheel was destroyed. The destroyed wheel flung pieces of steel into an auxiliary condenser, which flooded the engine room and stopped the operation of the center and starboard engines. Saltwater entered the boilers, reducing the ship's speed to a mere four knots; by 08:45, the captain of Moltke reported to Scheer that his ship was \\"out of control\\", and that the ship would need to be towed. At 09:38, the cruiser Strassburg attempted to take the ship under tow, but was unable to do so. At 10:13, the dreadnought was detached from the battle fleet to tow Moltke back to port. At 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. By 17:10, Moltkes engines had been repaired, and the ship was able to steam at a speed of 17 knots. At 19:37, the British submarine spotted the ship and fired a torpedo into Moltke. The ship took in 1,800 tons of water, but was able to reach harbor under her own power. Repairs were carried out in Wilhelmshaven in the Imperial Dockyard, between 30 April and 9 September 1918. Following repairs, Moltke took part in training operations in the Baltic from 19 September to 3 October. Starting on 1 November, the ship served as the I Scouting Group flagship for Rear Admiral von Reuter, after the battlecruiser had gone into dry dock for repairs. = Fate = Moltke sailing to internment at Scapa Flow, November, 1918 Moltke was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the \\"death ride\\" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Gro√üadmiral of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. However, while the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began deserting en masse. As Von der Tann and Derfflinger passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's inner harbor and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore. On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships mutinied; three ships from the III Squadron refused to weigh anchor, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships and . The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt. In early November 1918, the German Revolution began; it led to the Armistice that ended the war and it toppled the monarchy. Moltke was surrendered with the rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Wollante. Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed and his fleet was about to be seized by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.

His interest in avant-garde music, sound generators and prepared tapes caught the eye of Michael Guenther, the bassist of Agitation Free, and he joined the band in February 1971. In March 1975, Hoenig was hired to replace Peter Baumann in Tangerine Dream for an Australian tour and a London Royal Albert Hall concert, and subsequently left Agitation Free, which broke up shortly after. Baumann rejoined Tangerine Dream soon after, and Hoenig went on to collaborate with Klaus Schulze on the short-lived project \\"Timewind\\" (unrelated to the 1975 Schulze album of the same name). In 1976 he had a brief collaboration with Manuel G√∂ttsching of Ash Ra Tempel; a recording of one of the sessions was released in 1995 under the title \\"Early Water\\". In 1977, he released his first solo album, the highly acclaimed Berlin School classic Departure from the Northern Wasteland, and left for Los Angeles shortly after it was released.

Such Codeblocks may be returned as a value, or by means of an argument passed BY REFERENCE, in such case the Codeblock will \\"outlive\\" the routine in which it was defined, and any variables it references, will be a DETACHED variable. Detached variables will maintain their value for as long as a Codeblock referencing them still exists. Such values will be shared with any other Codeblock which may have access to those same variables. If the Codeblock did not outlive its containing routine, and will be evaluated within the lifetime of the routine in which it is defined, changes to its Detached Variables(s) by means of its evaluation, will be reflected back at its parent routine. Codeblocks can be evaluated any number of times, by means of the Eval( BlockExp ) function. Variables All types can be assigned to named variables. Named variable identifiers are 1 to 63 characters long, start with [A-Z_] and further consist of the characters [A-Z0-9_] up to a maximum of 63 characters. Named variables are not case sensitive. Variables have one of the following scopes: * LOCAL: Visible only within the routine which declared it. Value is lost upon exit of the routine. * STATIC: Visible only within the routine which declared it. Value is preserved for subsequent invocations of the routine. If a STATIC variable is declared before any Procedure/Function/Method is defined, it has a MODULE scope, and is visible within any routine defined within that same source file, it will maintain its life for the duration of the application lifetime. * GLOBAL Visible within any routine defined in the same source module where the GLOBAL variable is declared, as well as any routine of any other source module, which explicitly declares it, by means of the GLOBAL EXTERNAL declaration. Both GLOBAL and GLOBAL EXTERNAL declarations must be declared before any Procedure/Function/Method is defined. * PRIVATE: Visible within the routine which declared it, and all routines called by that routine. * PUBLIC: Visible by all routines in the same application. LOCAL, STATIC, and GLOBAL are resolved at compile time, and thus are much faster than PRIVATE and PUBLIC variables which are dynamic entities accessed by means of a runtime Symbol table. For this same reason, LOCAL, STATIC and GLOBAL variables are not exposed to the Macro compiler, and any macro code which attempts to reference them will generate a runtime error. Due to the dynamic nature of PRIVATE and PUBLIC variables, they can be created and destroyed at runtime, can be accessed and modified by means of runtime macros, and can be accessed and modified by Codeblocks created on the fly. Control structures The basic control structures include all of the standard dBase, and Clipper control structures as well as additional ones inspired by the C or Java programming languages: =Loops= [DO] WHILE ConditionExp ... [LOOP] [EXIT] END[DO] FOR Var := InitExp TO EndExp [STEP StepExp] ... [LOOP] [EXIT] NEXT FOR EACH Var IN CollectionExp ... [HB_EnumIndex()] [LOOP] [EXIT] NEXT * The ... is a sequence of one of more xHarbour statements, and square bracketes \`[]\` denote optional syntax. * The HB_EnumIndex() may be optionally used to retrieve the current iteration index (1 based). * The LOOP statement restarts the current iteration of the enclosing loop structure, and if the enclosing loop is a FOR or FOR EACH loop, it increases the iterator, moving to the next iteration of the loop. * The EXIT statement immediately terminates execution of the enclosing loop structure. * The NEXT statement closes the control structure and moves to the next iteration of loop structure. In the FOR statement, the assignment expression is evaluated prior to the first loop iteration. The TO expression is evaluated and compared against the value of the control variable, prior to each iteration, and the loop is terminated if it evaluates to a numeric value greater than the numeric value of the control variable. The optional STEP expression is evaluated after each iteration, prior to deciding whether to perform the next iteration. In FOR EACH, the Var variable will have the value (scalar, or complex) of the respective element in the collection value. The collection expression, may be an Array (of any type or combinations of types), an Hash Table, or an Object type. =IF statements= IF CondExp ... [ELSEIF] CondExp ... [ELSE] ... END[IF] ... represents 0 or more statement(s). The condition expression(s) has to evaluate to a LOGICAL value. =DO CASE statements= DO CASE CASE CondExp ... [CASE CondExp] ... [OTHERWISE] ... END[CASE ] Above construct is logically equivalent to: IF CondExp ... ELSEIF CondExp ... [ELSEIF CondExp] ... [ELSE] ... END[IF] =SWITCH statements= xHarbour supports a SWITCH construct inspired by the C implementation of switch(). SWITCH SwitchExp CASE LiteralExp ... [EXIT] [CASE LiteralExp] ... [EXIT] [DEFAULT] ... END * The LiteralExp must be a compiled time resolvable numeric expression, and may involve operators, as long as such operators involve compile time static value. * The EXIT optional statement is the equivalent of the C statement break, and if present, execution of the SWITCH structure will end when the EXIT statement is reached, otherwise it will continue with the first statement below the next CASE statement (fall through). =BEGIN SEQUENCE statements= BEGIN SEQUENCE ... [BREAK] [Break([Exp])] RECOVER [USING Var] ... END[SEQUENCE] or: BEGIN SEQUENCE ... [BREAK] [Break()] END[SEQUENCE] The BEGIN SEQUENCE structure allows for a well behaved abortion of any sequence, even when crossing nested procedures/functions. This means that a called procedure/function, may issue a BREAK statement, or a Break() expression, to force unfolding of any nested procedure/functions, all the way back to the first outer BEGIN SEQUENCE structure, either after its respective END statement, or a RECOVER clause if present. The Break statement may optionally pass any type of expression, which may be accepted by the RECOVER statement to allow further recovery handing. Additionally the xHarbour Error Object supports canDefault, canRetry and canSubstitute properties, which allows error handlers to perform some preparations, and then request a Retry Operation, a Resume, or return a Value to replace the expression triggering the error condition. =TRY [CATCH] [FINALLY] statements= TRY ... [BREAK] [Break([Exp])] [Throw([Exp])] CATCH [Var] ... END TRY ... [BREAK] [Break([Exp])] [Throw([Exp])] CATCH [Var] ... FINALLY ... END or: TRY ... [BREAK] [Break([Exp])] [Throw([Exp])] FINALLY ... END The TRY construct is very similar to the BEGIN SEQUENCE construct, except it automatically integrates error handling, so that any error will be intercepted, and recovered by means of the CATCH statement or forwarded to an outer CATCH handler otherwise. The FINALLY section is guaranteed to be executed before the TRY or CATCH sections forward flow control by means of RETURN, BREAK, or THROW. Procedures/Functions [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName() [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName( Param1' [, ParamsN] ) INIT PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName EXIT PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName() [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName( Param1' [, ParamsN] ) Procedures/Functions in xHarbour can be specified with the keywords \`PROCEDURE\`, or \`FUNCTION\`. Naming rules are same as those for Variables (up to 63 characters non case sensitive). Both Procedures and Functions may be qualified by the scope qualifier STATIC to restrict their usage to the scope of the module where defined. The INIT or EXIT optional qualifiers, will flag the procedure to be automatically invoked just before calling the application startup procedure, or just after quitting the application, respectively. Parameters passed to a procedure/function appear in the subroutine as local variables, and may accept any type, including references. Changes to argument variables are not reflected in respective variables passed by the calling procedure/function/method unless explicitly passed BY REFERENCE using the @ prefix. PROCEDURE have no return value, and if used in an Expression context will produce a NIL value. FUNCTION may return any type by means of the RETURN statement, anywhere in the body of its definition. An example procedure definition and a function call follows: x := Cube( 2 ) FUNCTION Cube( n ) RETURN n ** 3 Database support xHarbour extends the Clipper Replaceable Database Drivers (RDD) approach. It offers multiple RDDs such as DBF, DBFNTX, DBFCDX, DBFDBT, and DBFFPT. In xHarbour multiple RDDs can be used in a single application, and new logical RDDs can be defined from combination of other RDD. The RDD architecture allows for inheritance, so that a given RDD may extend the functionality of other existing RDD(s). 3rd party RDDs, like RDDSQL, RDDSIX, RMDBFCDX, Advantage Database Server, and Mediator exemplify some of the RDD architecture features. xHarbour also offers ODBC support by means of an OOP syntax, and ADO support by means of OLE. Macro Operator (runtime compiler) One of the most powerful features of the xBase languages is the MACRO Operator '&'. xHarbour‚Äôs implementation of the Macro Operator allows for runtime compilation of any valid xHarbour expression. Such compiled expression may be used as a VALUE, i.e. the right side of an Assignment, but such compiled expression may be used to resolve the LEFT side of an assignment, i.e. PRIVATE, or PUBLIC variables, or Database FIELD. Additionally the Macro Operator may compile and execute function calls, complete assignments, or even list of arguments, and the result of the macro may be used to resolve any of the above contexts in the compiled application. IOW, any xHarbour application may be extended, and/or modified in runtime, to compile and execute additional code on demand. The xHarbour implementation of this feature is so complete that the xHarbour interpreter, xbScript, uses it heavily, to compile xHarbour scripts. Syntax: &( ... ) The text value of the expression '...' will be compiled, and the value resulting from the execution of the compiled code is the result. &SomeId; is the short form for &( SomeId ). &SomeId.postfix; is the short form of &( SomeId + \\"postfix\\" ). Example code Hello, world! = The typical \\"hello world\\" program would be: ? \\"Hello, world!\\" Or: QOut( \\"Hello, world!\\" ) Or: Alert( \\"Hello, world!\\" ) Or, enclosed in an explicit procedure: PROCEDURE Main() ? \\"Hello, world!\\" RETURN = OOP = #include \\"hbclass.ch\\" PROCEDURE Main() LOCAl oPerson := Person( \\"Dave\\" ) oPerson:Eyes := \\"Invalid\\" oPerson:Eyes := \\"Blue\\" Alert( oPerson:Describe() ) RETURN CLASS Person DATA Name INIT \\"\\" METHOD New() CONSTRUCTOR ACCESS Eyes INLINE ::pvtEyes ASSIGN Eyes( x ) INLINE IIF( ValType( x )  'C' .AND. x IN \\"Blue,Brown,Green\\", ::pvtEyes := x, Alert( \\"Invalid value\\" ) ) // Sample of IN-LINE Method definition INLINE METHOD Describe() LOCAL cDescription IF Empty( ::Name ) cDescription := \\"I have no name yet.\\" ELSE cDescription := \\"My name is: \\" + ::Name + \\";\\" ENDIF IF ! Empty( ::Eyes ) cDescription += \\"my eyes' color is: \\" + ::Eyes ENDIF ENDMETHOD PRIVATE: DATA pvtEyes ENDCLASS // Sample of normal Method definition. METHOD New( cName ) CLASS Person ::Name := cName RETURN Self Scripting xHarbour is also available as an interpreted language in few flavors of scripting engines. * Stand alone Interpreter: Portable, self-contained, interpreter xBaseScript. * ActiveScript: Microsoft ActiveScript compliant OLE DLL, which supports xHarbour scripting in: ** Windows Script Host (WSH). ** Internet Explorer, HTML client side scripting. ** IIS, and any other ASP compliant server.

After studies at the City College of New York, Henry earned his Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University in 1935. His classmates included Irving Goldman, Ruth Landes and Edward Kennard. His instructors at Columbia included Franz Boas and Margaret Mead. Henry lived with and mastered the language of the Kaingang natives of the highlands of southern Brazil. In writing about the experience, Henry married the then newly popular psychoanalytic notions of Sigmund Freud with the non-invasive, observational discipline of professional anthropology. The resulting monograph, Jungle People, was, as Henry himself put it, \\"the first anthropological monograph written from a psychoanalytic point of view.\\" In 1936, Henry began an 18-month observational residence with the Pilaga natives of Argentina, which, as with his experience in Brazil, figures in his two books, both of which figured in the orthopsychiatry movement becoming popular at that time (orthopsychiatry is the psychiatric study, treatment, and prevention of emotional and behavioral problems, especially of those that arise during early development). According to Harold Gould, writing in the American Anthropologist in 1969, his experiences with people largely unexposed to Western, industrial culture led Henry \\"beyond the primitive band into the broader and more universal questions of how human behavior (indeed, the human condition) is transmitted from generation to generation and with what consequences.\\" Afterwards, he was employed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Labor and held various teaching positions at the University of Chicago and in Mexico City. From 1947 to his death in 1969, Henry served as professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis. His most significant publications before his two major books (cited below) include \\"Environment and Symptom Formation\\" (1946), ‚ÄúCultural Discontinuity and the Shadow of the Past‚Äù (1948), ‚ÄúThe Principle of Limits with Special Reference to the Social Sciences‚Äù (1950), ‚ÄúFamily Structure and Psychic Development‚Äù (1951), ‚ÄúFamily Structure and the Transmission of Neurotic Behavior‚Äù (1951), ‚ÄúChild Rearing, Culture and the Natural World‚Äù (1952), ‚ÄúCulture, Education and Communications Theory‚Äù (1954), ‚ÄúAmerican Culture and Mental Health‚Äù (1956), ‚ÄúAttitude Organization in Elementary School Classrooms‚Äù (1957), ‚ÄúThe Problem of Spontaneity, Initiative and Creativity in Suburban Classrooms‚Äù (1959), ‚ÄúThe Naturalistic Observations of Families of Psychotic Children‚Äù (1961), ‚ÄúNotes on the Alchemy of Mass Misrepresentation‚Äù (1961), ‚ÄúValues, Guilt, Suffering and Consequences‚Äù (1963), ‚ÄúAmerican Schoolrooms: Learning the Nightmare‚Äù (1963), ‚ÄúOn Regimentation‚Äù (1964), ‚ÄúMy Life with the Families of Psychotic Children‚Äù (1964), ‚ÄúSham‚Äù (1966), ‚ÄúPublic Education and Public Anxiety‚Äù (1967), and ‚ÄúAttitude Organization in Elementary School Classrooms‚Äù (1969). The article, ‚ÄúCapital‚Äôs Last Frontier,‚Äù published in The Nation magazine in 1966 induced a flurry of letters to the editor. His similarly toned speech at the Canadian Centennial celebration in 1967, ‚ÄúThe United States: From Barbarism to Decadence Without Civilization?‚Äù also caused a stir in academic circles. Henry's first book, Culture Against Man (1963) questioned the authority of, and rationale behind, cultural institutions, particularly public education. The collection of essays and anthropological study first drafted in the mid 1950s also examined the influence of American advertising in the Mad Men era and the ‚Äúhuman obsolescence‚Äù and profitable ‚Äúwarehousing‚Äù of the elderly in institutional settings. His second book, Pathways to Madness (1965), focused on interpersonally-induced mental and developmental disorders, raising the question of how disease and disorder arise from behavioral conditioning in families of origin and cultural institutions. Others developing similar ideas included Gregory Bateson (double binding), Paul Watzlawick (paradoxical injunction), Don D. Jackson (the etiology of schizophrenia) and Ronald D. Laing (crazy-making families). His third (posthumous) book, On Sham, Vulnerability and other forms of Self-Destruction (1973)Henry, J., On Sham, Vulnerability and other forms of Self-Destruction (City of Westminster, London: Allen Lane, 1973). is a collection of essays, among them his famed eight-page essay on \\"Sham,\\" originally prepared for the 1966 Conference on Society and Psychosis at the Hahnemann Medical College (now Drexel University Medical School) in Philadelphia. In it, Henry describes how children are socialized to accept and utilize dishonesty as an interpersonal tool despite being taught to \\"always tell the truth.\\"  References External links *Jules Henry's papers at Washington University *Jules Henry 1904 - 1969 - Obituary from the American Anthropologist, Volume 73, Issue 3, which includes a complete listing of all Henry's published papers * Online copy of Culture Against Man * online copy of Pathways to Madness -- https://www.pdf- archive.com/2017/02/02/pathways-to-madness/ Category:Cultural anthropologists Category:Psychological anthropologists Category:American anthropologists Category:American sociologists Category:American psychology writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Washington University in St. Louis faculty Category:Columbia University alumni Category:1904 births Category:1969 deaths Category:20th-century anthropologists ","title":"Jules Henry"},{"id":"1615388","text":"Paolo Camillo Thaon, Marquess of Revel (10 June 1859 - 24 March 1948), latterly titled by Benito Mussolini with the honorary title of 1st Duke of the Sea, was an Italian admiral of the Regia Marina during World War I and later a politician. Early life and career Thaon di Revel was born in Turin from a family of the Savoyard and Ni√ßard nobility of Scottish descent, a minor son of Marquess and Count Ottavio Thaon di Revel. He took part as Rear-admiral in the Italo-Turkish War, commanding Italian cruisers in the Battle of Beirut. He was named Chief of Staff of the Regia Marina in 1913; he supported the signing of a naval convention between the nations of the Triple Alliance, knowing of Italy's vulnerability to seaborne threats and its dependence on its sealanes, which was concluded on October of that year. When World War I broke out, he warned the government of Antonio Salandra that chances of Austro-Italian success against the combined force of the French and British fleets was small, and that the Regia Marina could not guarantee the safety of the Italian coast. This factors weighed in Salandra's decision to proclaim Italy's neutrality.Halpern, p. 54-6 and144 World War I When Italy joined the Entente on 24 May 1915, Thaon di Revel became the leading figure of Italy's naval war, and remained so for the duration. He resigned in October 1915 because of friction between him and the Minister of the Navy Camillo Corsi over the respective authority, and took command of the naval base of Venice. On 3 February 1917, he was reappointed Chief of Staff, and combined the position with that of Commander in Chief of the mobilized naval forces (i.e. the Regia Marina's main forces), replacing Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi. On one hand, Thaon di Revel was \\"energetic and autocratic\\", a tireless defender of perceived allied indifference towards Italian needs and merits and of Italian independent command, and the major reason as to why a unified Mediterranean naval command never came to be (which would have led to dangerous ambiguity had a combined fleet action been imminent), which led to a less than optimal relationship with the allied navies and officers; however, he was also \\"thoroughly realistic\\", having a picture of the Adriatic theater that discouraged aggressive actions to lure out the Austrian fleet, and which led to his decision not to risk his battleships and to fight the war with smaller ships and insidious means such as the MAS (which would score several successes in the conflict, notably the sinking of the battleship SMS Szent Istv√°n).Halpern, p. 359-62 After the Italian rout at Caporetto in November 1917, he secured the coastal area. In the late days of the war he led the bombardment of Durazzo and the quick occupation of the coasts of Istria and Dalmatia. Later life In 1917 Thaon di Revel was named to the Italian Senate. In November 1921, while serving as the Chief of the Italian Naval Staff, he was Italy's naval representative to the Washington Armaments Conference. In 1922, he was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel III and given the victory title of 1st Duca del Mare (\\"Duke of the Sea\\"). In October 1922 he was appointed Minister of the Navy in the Mussolini Cabinet; he resigned in 1925, to protest the creation of the position of Chief of the General Staff, to be assigned exclusively to Army officers. He was named Grand Admiral (Grande Ammiraglio) on 4 November 1924. He was President of the Italian Senate from 1943 to 1944 after the fall of fascist regime. Thaon di Revel died in Rome in 1948. He was buried in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, next to general Armando Diaz.

Overview In 1994 Todd McFarlane was working with Mattel to produce action figures based on his comic book characters. When the two could not decide on how to make the toys to McFarlane's satisfaction, he reclaimed the toy rights to his characters and started his own toy company. Originally dubbed \\"Todd's Toys,\\" the name was changed in 1995 following pressure from Mattel, who feared that the new company's name would be confused with that of Barbie's younger brother. Production began with action figures based upon Todd McFarlane's Spawn comic series and has since grown to feature a large number of licensed property lines including The Simpsons and \\"Movie Maniacs\\" (which features numerous famous horror icons such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, The Terminator, Leatherface, and The Thing), as well as other characters and lines like basketball, hockey and baseball legends, along with characters from video games such as Soulcalibur, Onimusha, and Metal Gear Solid. Other media such as story book characters from Where the Wild Things Are have been represented. The company has produced original works, giving a grotesque twist to fairy tale stories such as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and historical figures. McFarlane has collaborated with artists like Clive Barker and H.R. Giger to produce other original figures. Spawn figures The first line of Spawn toys ever produced was released in 1994 and consisted of six figures, the hero Spawn and his medieval counterpart (aptly named Medieval Spawn) with Tremor and the villains Violator, Overt-Kill, and Clown, as well as a Spawn Alley Playset, the Spawnmobile and the Violator Monster Rig. They were notably different from the toys common on shelves at the time because of their level of detail in both sculpting and painting. Other toys utilized only a few colors painted in general areas (a single \\"flesh tone\\" for the face, etc.) and were tacked to cardboard backs. McFarlane's figures had individual items such as spikes, teeth, claws, and buttons painted individually and packaged encased by hard plastic which surrounded both the figure and blister card, making them more suitable collectors items. Each toy in the first line came with a regular-sized comic (although with fewer pages than the standard 22), which were individualized to the character. The series would include alternate timeframes and different takes on the classic characters with Series 10, 20 and 30 showing homage to the core characters of the books. Series 35 was out by July 2008 and was called \\"Robot Wars\\". It refers to a villainous Mechanoid Army. Anime figures Throughout the course of the company's history, McFarlane Toys has produced licensed figures based on various Japanese anime and manga properties. Series McFarlane have merchandised include Akira, Tenchi Muyo, Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan and Naruto Shippuden. In 2019, it was announced that the company had also gained the rights to create figures based on One- Punch Man and My Hero Academia. Horror figures McFarlane had been a long- time fan of the horror genre and decided to produce his own perspective on the classic monsters with the \\"Todd McFarlane's Monsters Playsets\\" line in 1997. McFarlane continued the idea of generating new versions of classic stories and characters, releasing a shocking line subtitled \\"Twisted Land of Oz\\" in 2003, which featured vicious or sadistic versions of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz characters created by L. Frank Baum. In 2004, the third series, subtitled 6 Faces of Madness, used historical killers and madmen as its theme, generating vividly detailed figurines of the 5th-century conqueror Attila the Hun, American \\"Wild West\\" gunslinger Billy the Kid, the \\"mad monk\\" Rasputin, the British serial killer Jack the Ripper, the Hungarian \\"Blood Queen\\" Elizabeth Bathory, and the real-life inspiration for Dracula, Vlad the Impaler. The fourth series featured Twisted Fairy Tales. The figures were of classic children‚Äôs stories, including Peter Pumpkin-Eater, Hansel & Gretel, Little Miss Muffet, Humpty Dumpty, & Red Riding Hood, and incorporated many of the gory elements that consumers had come to expect from McFarlane, but with a sense of ironic humor. Series 5 featured McFarlane's Twisted Christmas. Like the previous series, the figures all are twisted variations of Christmas, including a hunchback and obese Santa Claus who hides a lifeless skull under a gasmask-like headpiece and wears contraptions on his hands similar to the glove of Freddy Krueger. =Movie Maniacs= In 1998 McFarlane introduced the Movie Maniacs line of figures. Series One began as a line of horror and science fiction based figures that had been licensed from influential and financially successful horror films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th. The second series of figures expanded the character base for the line into the realms of cult and action cinema, with a figure based on the title character to The Crow. Series three would further push the boundaries of character selection into fantasy, with Edward Scissorhands, straight action with Shaft, and back into cult/sci-fi with Escape from L.A.. These conventions would continue, with character selections in future series frequently containing a mix of many, or even all of these various film genres, much to the chagrin of a small section of fans and collectors who, incorrectly, saw the line as being meant to be horror specific. Music figures McFarlane Toys did not solely limit itself to creating figures based on Todd McFarlane's creations. Rather it branched out into other forms of media, capitalizing on the popularity of famous rock musicians with the release of figures based on the rock legends KISS in 1997. The number of music figures produced by the company continued to grow in number, diversity, and quality in the following years as they acquired the action figure rights to famous properties such as the Beatles, Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Slash, Iron Maiden's mascot Eddie, Jimi Hendrix, Freddie Mercury and Elvis Presley. =KISS= In 1997, action figures were part of an overall marketing deal between McFarlane Toys and the rock band KISS, with both toys and comic books based on their album Psycho Circus. Release of new KISS products from McFarlane continues to the present day. =The Beatles= The second musical property that McFarlane released was based on the Beatles, featuring figures of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr as they appeared in their 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, as well as their appearance in the 1965 ABC cartoon show also titled The Beatles. Despite three figure series based on cartoon versions of the band (two incarnations of the Yellow Submarine figures in 1996 and 2004), no figures of the real-life band members have been created by McFarlane Toys. Sports figures McFarlane Toys reflects Todd McFarlane's love of sports in its creations of popular figures from all five major North American sports (baseball, football, basketball, hockey and stock car racing). The company has official licensing rights to the major professional leagues of all of these sports, and began this line, officially known as McFarlane Sports Picks, in 2001. Television figures In January 2007, McFarlane Toys announced plans for a line of 24 action figures. Other series figures have included Lost and The Walking Dead. In 2015, McFarlane toys launched a line of construction sets based on HBO's popular Game of Thrones TV series, followed by a line of 6\\" action figures to be released in 2019. The company also produces action figures based on the Netflix series Stranger Things. =The McKenzie Brothers= Released in September 2000, the figures were based on the characters of SCTV and Strange Brew fame, Bob and Doug McKenzie. Originally portrayed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, respectively. The figures were sold separately and each came with half of the diorama from the Great White North set. Each had a sound chip with famous lines from the film and various extras to complete the scene. =The Simpsons= In 2005, McFarlane acquired the rights held by rival manufacturer Playmates Toys to produce figures based on the popular Fox TV series The Simpsons. =Star Trek= In 2017, McFarlane Toys inked a deal to produce action figures and role play items based on the popular Star Trek franchise. Controversy ensued when the company's Star Trek Discovery phaser toy was cancelled just months before its scheduled release date. In a statement, McFarlane Toys said that the product was cancelled due to disagreements regarding the safety regulations around toy guns in the United States. The first action figures were released in early 2019, with James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard serving as the inaugural entries in the line while the next figures Michael Burnham and Spock is in production. Video game figures McFarlane Toys has produced a number of products based on video games, including Metal Gear Solid, Soulcalibur II (The Xbox version of which featured McFarlane's own Spawn as a guest character), Halo, Five Nights at Freddy's, Call of Duty, Destiny, Cuphead, Borderlands and Assassin's Creed. In 2018, McFarlane Toys launched a series of Fortnite action figures, which differed greatly from the company's previous figures (which were often statue- like and had very limited movement) by including at least 18 points of articulation each. The toys proved very popular, and Todd McFarlane later announced that the increased articulation scheme would become standard in the company's product from then on, including their upcoming line of Mortal Kombat 11 figures. Other figuresDC Multiverse= At the tail end of 2018, news broke that Mattel had lost the rights to create figures based on the characters of the DC Universe to Spin Master Studios after 15 years of producing DC merchandise. In February 2019, it was announced that McFarlane Toys had secured the rights to create 6\\"-12\\" collector figures based on the various comic books, movies, cartoons, live-action TV shows and video games featuring DC's characters. Dubbed DC Multiverse, the line will be aimed at adult collectors, in contrast to the all-ages oriented DC toys produced by Spin Master. In a subsequent interview with IGN, Todd McFarlane confirmed that the new figures will target the same collectors who bought other 6\\" superhero toy lines, such as Mattel's DC Universe Classics or Hasbro's Marvel Legends. He also revealed that the figures will use the new articulation system first seen in the company's Fortnite toys, meaning that they will all include between 18 and 24 points of articulation. =McFarlane's Dragons= McFarlane's Dragons are a line of action figures which were launched in 2005 under the \\"Horror, Fantasy and Sci-Fi Action Figures\\" section of McFarlane Toys. These figures were released biannually. This set features several highly detailed six inch dragon action figures and a slightly larger and more expansive \\"boxed set\\" figure. For the first five series, the figures were broken into these clans: Eternal Dragon Clan, Fire Dragon Clan, Komodo Dragon Clan, Sorcerer's Dragon Clan, Water Dragon Clan, and Berserker Clan. Series Six includes new clans: Fossil Dragon Clan, Hunter Dragon Clan, Ice Dragon Clan, Scavenger Dragon Clan, and Warrior Dragon Clan. In addition to these highly detailed dragons, McFarlane released a part of the dragon's history with each dragon set; some had a piece of the story with each dragon, and some had whole chunks of the story in one boxed set. =McFarlane's Military= The company launched a \\"toy soldier\\" range in 2005 with McFarlane's Military. The figures did not depict actual people so much as it did their professions, named simply by their job descriptions, such as \\"Army Ranger\\" or \\"Navy SEAL.\\" All were of stern-looking males in full military gear, with highly detailed weapons and accessories modeled after the exact materials each soldier would be carrying in real life. =Where the Wild Things Are= In 2000, McFarlane Toys produced figures based on Maurice Sendak's classic children's book Where the Wild Things Are. Figures include Max, Goatboy (packaged together), Moishe, Emil, Bernard, Aaron and Tzippy. Each character was sculpted with the same crosshatch style from Sendak's original illustrations. Controversies A number of McFarlane's figures have attracted criticism and led to boycotts for the subject matter they depict, such as Death Row Marv, which depicts the central character from the graphic novel Sin City in the electric chair, which includes a toggle switch that allows the user to \\"execute\\" the character, who shakes and speaks as if being electrocuted when the switch is flipped. Others, such as the company's Austin Powers doll, were criticized for risque language in their sound chips and packaging.

His father was the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, one of the pioneers of modern weather forecasting. His paternal grandfather was Norwegian mathematician and physicist Carl Anton Bjerknes. His maternal grandfather was Norwegian politician Jacob Aall Bonnevie, after whom he was named.The Life and Science of Jacob Bjerknes (Creighton University Department of Atmospheric Sciences)Carl Anton Bjerknes (Norsk biografisk leksikon) Professional career Bjerknes was part of a group of meteorologists led by his father, Vilhelm Bjerknes, at the University of Leipzig. Together they developed the model that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, introducing the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. This concept is known as the Norwegian cyclone model.Jacob Aall Bonnevie Bjerknes (1897‚Äì1975) (American Geophysical Union) Bjerknes returned to Norway in 1917, where his father founded the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen in Bergen. They organized an analysis and forecasting branch which would evolve into a weather bureau by 1919. The scientific team at Bergen also included the Swedish meteorologists Carl-Gustaf Rossby and Tor Bergeron. As pointed out in a key paper by Jacob Bjerknes and Halvor Solberg (1895-1974) in 1922, the dynamics of the polar front, integrated with the cyclone model, provided the major mechanism for north-south heat transport in the atmosphere. For this and other research, Jacob Bjerknes was awarded the Ph.D. from the University of Oslo in 1924.Halvor Solberg (Store norske leksikon) In 1926, Jacob Bjerknes was a support meteorologist when Roald Amundsen made the first crossing of the Arctic in the airship Norge. In 1931, he left his position as head of the National weather service at Bergen to become professor of meteorology at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. Jacob Bjerknes lectured at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1933-1934 school year and emigrated to the United States in 1940 where he headed a government-sponsored meteorology annex for weather forecasting, at the department of physics of the University of California, Los Angeles. During the second world war Bjerknes served the US armed forces and serving as a colonel in the US Air Force he helped find the best dates for the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Magasinet, supplement to Dagbladet, 11 February 2014. pp 14-24 Bjerknes founded the UCLA Department of Meteorology (now the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences). As a professor at the University of California, he was the first to see a connection between unusually warm sea- surface temperatures and the weak easterlies and heavy rainfall that accompany low-index conditions. At UCLA, Bjerknes and fellow Norwegian-American meteorologist, Jorgen Holmboe, further developed the pressure tendency and the extratropical cyclone theories. In 1969, Jacob Bjerknes helped toward an understanding of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, by suggesting that an anomalously warm spot in the eastern Pacific can weaken the east-west temperature difference, disrupting trade winds, which push warm water to the west. The result is increasingly warm water toward the east. Personal life In 1928, he married Hedvig Borthen (1904-1998). They were the parents of two children. He died on 7 July 1975 in Los Angeles, California. Honors and awards He was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1932 and a member of both the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1933. *Royal Meteorological Society - Symons Gold Medal (1940) *American Geophysical Union - William Bowie Medal (1945) * Knight 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (1947). *Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography - Vega medal (1958) *World Meteorological Organization - International Meteorological Organization Prize (1959). *American Meteorological Society - Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal (1960) *National Medal of Science (1966) ReferencesExternal links *Biographie de Jacob Bjerknes by Arnt Eliassen *Tribute to J.

As a substituent, it is known as a sulfo group. A sulfonic acid can be thought of as sulfuric acid with one hydroxyl group replaced by an organic substituent. The parent compound (with the organic substituent replaced by hydrogen) is the parent sulfonic acid, HS(=O)2(OH), a tautomer of sulfurous acid, S(=O)(OH)2.Neither the parent sulfonic acid nor the parent sulfurous acid have been isolated or even observed, although the monoanion of these hypothetical species exists in solution as an equilibrium mixture of tautomers: HS(=O)2(O‚äñ)‚áåS(=O)(OH)(O‚äñ). Salts or esters of sulfonic acids are called sulfonates. Preparation Ball-and-stick model of methanesulfonic acid. Sulfonic acids are produced by the process of sulfonation. Usually the sulfonating agent is sulfur trioxide. A large scale application of this method is the production of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids: :RC6H5 \\\\+ SO3 ‚Üí RC6H4SO3H In this reaction, sulfur trioxide is an electrophile and the arene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution. Direct sulfonation also converts methanesulfonic acid to methanedisulfonic acid. Many alkane sulfonic acids are obtained from bisulfite, which adds to terminal alkenes or is alkylated by alkyl halides: :HSO3‚àí \\\\+ RCH=CH2 \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí RCH2CH2SO3H :HSO3‚àí \\\\+ RBr ‚Üí RSO3H + Br‚àí Sulfonic acids can be prepared by oxidation of thiols: :RSH + O2 ‚Üí RSO3H Such a pathway is the basis of the biosynthesis of taurine. =Hydrolysis routes= Many sulfonic acids are prepared by hydrolysis of sulfonyl halides and related precursors. Thus, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid is prepared by hydrolysis of the sulfonyl fluoride, which in turn is generated by the electrofluorination of octanesulfonic acid. Similarly the sulfonyl chloride derived from polyethylene is hydrolyzed to the sulfonic acid. These sulfonyl chlorides are produced by free-radical reactions of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and the hydrocarbons using the Reed reaction. Vinylsulfonic acid is derived by hydrolysis of carbyl sulfate, (C2H4(SO3)2), which in turn is obtain by the addition of sulfur trioxide to ethylene. Properties Sulfonic acids are strong acids. They are commonly cited as being around a million times stronger than the corresponding carboxylic acid. For example, p-Toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid have pKa values of ‚àí2.8 and ‚àí1.9, respectively, while those of benzoic acid and acetic acid are 4.20 and 4.76, respectively. However, as a consequence of their strong acidity, their pKa values cannot be measured directly, and values commonly quoted should be regarded as indirect estimates with significant uncertainties. For instance, various sources have reported the pKa of methanesulfonic acid to be as high as ‚àí0.6 or as low as ‚àí6.5. Sulfonic acids are known to react with solid sodium chloride (salt) to form the sodium sulfonate and hydrogen chloride. This property implies an acidity within two or three orders of magnitude of that of HCl(g), whose pKa was recently accurately determined (pKaaq = ‚àí5.9). Because of their polarity, sulfonic acids tend to be crystalline solids or viscous, high-boiling liquids. They are also usually colourless and nonoxidizing, which makes them suitable for use as acid catalysts in organic reactions. Their polarity, in conjunction with their high acidity, renders short-chain sulfonic acids water-soluble, while longer-chain ones exhibit detergent-like properties. The structure of sulfonic acids is illustrated by the prototype, methanesulfonic acid. The sulfonic acid group, RSO2OH features a tetrahedral sulfur centre, meaning that sulfur is at the center of four atoms: three oxygens and one carbon. The overall geometry of the sulfur centre is reminiscent of the shape of sulfuric acid.

File:Coenzyme M (CoM).svgCoenzyme-M, is a cofactor required for the biosynthesis of methane, found in natural gas. Applications Although both alkyl and aryl sulfonic acids are known, most of the applications are associated with the aromatic derivatives. =Detergents and surfactants= Detergents and surfactants are molecules that combine highly nonpolar and highly polar groups. Traditionally, soaps are the popular surfactants, being derived from fatty acids. Since the mid-20th century, the usage of sulfonic acids has surpassed soap in advanced societies. For example, an estimated 2 billion kilograms of alkylbenzenesulfonates are produced annually for diverse purposes. Lignin sulfonates, produced by sulfonation of lignin are components of drilling fluids and additives in certain kinds of concrete.Kosswig, K. ‚ÄúSurfactants‚Äù in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . =Dyes= Many if not most of the anthroquinone dyes are produced or processed via sulfonation. Sulfonic acids tend to bind tightly to proteins and carbohydrates. Most \\"washable\\" dyes are sulfonic acids (or have the functional sulfonyl group in them) for this reason. p-Cresidinesulfonic acid is used to make food dyes. =Acid catalysts= Being strong acids, sulfonic acids are also used as catalysts. The simplest examples are methanesulfonic acid, CH3SO2OH and p-toluenesulfonic acid, which are regularly used in organic chemistry as acids that are lipophilic (soluble in organic solvents). Polymeric sulfonic acids are also useful. Dowex resin are sulfonic acid derivatives of polystyrene and is used as catalysts and for ion exchange (water softening). Nafion, a fluorinated polymeric sulfonic acid is a component of proton exchange membranes in fuel cells. =Drugs= Sulfa drugs, a class of antibacterials, are produced from sulfonic acids. Sulfonates are the basis of most ion exchange resins used in water softening. =Lignosulfonates= In the sulfite process for paper-making, lignin is removed from the lignocellulose by treating wood chips with solutions of sulfite and bisulfite ions. These reagents cleave the bonds between the cellulose and lignin components and especially within the lignin itself. The lignin is converted to lignosulfonates, useful ionomers, which are soluble and can be separated from the cellulose fibers. idealized scheme for lignin depolymerization by the Sulfite process. ReactionsHydrolysis= Arylsulfonic acids are susceptible to hydrolysis, the reverse of the sulfonation reaction. Whereas benzene sulfonic acid hydrolyzes above 200 ‚Ä≥C, most related derivatives are easier to hydrolyze. Thus, heating aryl sulfonic acids in aqueous acid produces the parent arene. This reaction is employed in several scenarios. In some cases the sulfonic acid serves as a water-solubilizing protecting group, as illustrated by the purification of para-xylene via its sulfonic acid derivative. The synthesis of 2,6-dichlorophenol, phenol is converted to its 4-sulfonic acid derivative, which then selectively chlorinates at the positions flanking the phenol. Hydrolysis releases the sulfonic acid group. =Esterification= Sulfonic acids can be converted to esters. This class of organic compounds has the general formula R‚àíSO2‚àíOR. Sulfonic esters such as methyl triflate are considered good alkylating agents in organic synthesis. Such sulfonate esters are often prepared by alcoholysis of the sulfonyl chlorides: :RSO2Cl + R‚Ä≤OH ‚Üí RSO2OR‚Ä≤ + HCl =Halogenation= Sulfonyl halide groups occur when a sulfonyl functional group is singly bonded to a halogen atom. They have the general formula R‚àíSO2‚àíX where X is a halide, almost invariably chloride. They are produced by chlorination of sulfonic acids using thionyl chloride and related reagents. =Displacement by hydroxide= Although strong, the (aryl)C‚àíSO3‚àí bond can be broken by nucleophilic reagents. Of historic and continuing significance is the Œ±-sulfonation of anthroquinone followed by displacement of the sulfonate group by other nucleophiles, which cannot be installed directly. An early method for producing phenol involved the base hydrolysis of sodium benzenesulfonate, which can be generated readily from benzene.Manfred Weber, Markus Weber, Michael Kleine-Boymann \\"Phenol\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH. . :C6H5SO3Na + NaOH ‚Üí C6H5OH + Na2SO3 The conditions for this reaction are harsh, however, requiring 'fused alkali' or molten sodium hydroxide at 350 ¬∞C for benzenesulfonic acid itself. Unlike the mechanism for the fused alkali hydrolysis of chlorobenzene, which proceeds through elimination-addition (benzyne mechanism), benzenesulfonic acid undergoes the analogous conversion by an SNAr mechanism, as revealed by a 14C labeling, despite the lack of stabilizing substituents. Sulfonic acids with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., with NO2 or CN substituents) undergo this transformation much more readily.

He is an evil sorcerer, possessing a grotesque appearance and various mystical powers. Publication history Mister Jip has almost exclusively appeared as a villain to Cloak and Dagger, first in Strange Tales volume 3 and later in their own series with one appearance in an X-Men annual. Creator Terry Austin recounted that \\"readers had obviously gotten tired of seeing Cloak and Dagger endlessly go up against drug dealers, who, let‚Äôs face it, would never pose much of a challenge to them. Characters are never more interesting than when they have a seemingly unopposable force to push against, and to that end I came up with what I hoped would be their major reoccurring arch-foe, the maniacal Mr. Jip, and his foot soldiers Night and Day.\\" Fictional character biography The man who would become known as Mister Jip was born centuries ago somewhere in Asia. He roamed the world as a scholar in the pursuit of knowledge and went to Tibet to find the legendary city of Kamar-Taj. Though the city was in ruins, Jip encountered the Ancient One and became his first apprentice. As his student, Jip was instructed in the arts of benevolent magic, but unknown to his master, he sought out books of dark magic and practiced forbidden rituals to increase his own power. When the Ancient One discovered this, he cast Jip out of his service. Jip began extending his lifespan by usurping the bodies of others.as revealed in Strange Tales Vol. 3 #11 These days Jip likes to think that he still did some good, as it was his example that allowed the Ancient One to recognize the signs of Baron Mordo's betrayal centuries later. Out on his own, Jip wanted to increase his knowledge of the dark arts even further. To do so he started to extend his life at the costs of others, but these dark arts twisted and corrupted his own body into a monstrous shape. Despite his desire to dominate the world, Jip stayed hidden over the centuries and rarely revealed himself to others. He appeared to Cloak, disguised in the host body of a store clerk. Cloak had become powerless and felt that without his powers his partner Dagger wouldn't be interested in him anymore. Jip returned his powers in exchange for a price.Strange Tales Vol. 3 #8 Jip later battled Cloak and Dagger with his thralls, Night and Day, who had powers similar to Cloak and Dagger. Jip's price for his services would turn out to be Cloak's body as his new host. Dagger was shocked that Cloak would give up his chance at a normal life and left him, but returned in time to stop Jip from taking over Cloak's body and drove him off.Strange Tales Vol. 3 #11 Jip then forced Cloak to deliver Dagger into his clutches, then imprisoned him.Strange Tales Vol. 3 #16-17 Jip would fight and manipulate Cloak and Dagger over the next few months, often acting through his minions Day and Night, while at other times he would act to protect them. Through Night, Jip later fomented battle between the possessed Dagger and members of X-Factor. The plot was foiled by Cloak, but Dagger was blinded as a result. Jip was revealed as the master of the insane former priest Francis Delgado.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 3 #1 Jip was revealed to have restored Brigid O'Reilly and made her his spy by replacing one of her eyes with one of his own.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 3 #6 Jip also used the X-Men as his agents once during the events of Atlantis Attacks. He repulsed an attempt by the members of the Serpent Society to steal one of his mystical artifacts. He temporarily switched the minds of the captive Dazzler and Diamondback into each other's bodies. He fomented a battle between the X-Men and the Serpent Society. However, he failed to prevent the theft of his artifact by Sidewinder and Diamondback, who turned it over to their clients Ghaur and Llyra.Uncanny X-Men Annual #13 Mister Jip later bargained with Doctor Doom to trade Dagger for a book of black magic in Doom's possession. Jip murdered Francis Delgado and usurped his body. As Delgado, he murdered Father Michael Bowen, Dagger's uncle, and in disguise accompanied Dagger to Latveria.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 3 #12 Jip's attempt to deliver Dagger to Doctor Doom was foiled by Cloak, Night, Brigid O'Reilly and \\"Rusty\\" Nales. Jip restored Dagger's sight, but was seemingly destroyed by a \\"bullet of living darkness\\" formed by Night and fired by Rusty.Cloak and Dagger Vol. 3 #13 Powers and abilities Mister Jip has enormous magical abilities, especially in the realm of black magic. He has the ability to manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, the ability to cancel out or tamper with the magic of others, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He can create illusions, observe other places by scrying and conjure into being mindless minions to perform simple tasks, like a flying creature that he uses as his spy. He uses a large part of these powers to mask his presence to hide himself from more powerful mages like Doctor Strange. Jip can grant powers to others, but always asks a price in return. His most important ability is the ability to take over a host body, adding his victim's life span to his own. To do this, he has to initiate a process where he removes the ties between his victim's body and soul and absorb the body into his own. This ability has several limitations though: * the victim must lack an \\"inner light\\" that can repel Jip. This usually means that his victims are evil men, but it can also mean that they have a link to supernatural darkness like Cloak has. * the victim must be unaware of the existence and intentions of Mister Jip. * Mister Jip and the victim must be in constant physical contact during the whole process. After the process is completed, Jip can take on the appearance of any of his former hosts, though probably only for a short time. Jip has a grotesque misshapen humanoid form which appears to be formed of the decaying remains of various previous host bodies. Mister Jip has a gifted intellect, and has extensive knowledge of black magical lore. Other version In the Ultimate Marvel imprint, a more human looking Mister Jip appears in the pages of All-New Ultimates. He is in the profession of selling narcotics and is shown working with King Cobra and Crossbones.All-New Ultimates #3 He answers to Ecstasy and begins displaying side-effects to the narcotics due to long- term exposure to them.All-New Ultimates #11 After Crossbones barges into a meeting demanding payment, Jip suddenly transforms into a large, terrifying, purple monstrosity and attempts to kill him and Ecstasy, but is thwarted by the New Ultimates and Terror Inc..All-New Ultimates #12 Eventually, Bombshell creates an opening within him and Terror enters and heads to Jip's heart. Terror feeds energy to Jip ending his suffering and melting him into a pool of flesh.All-New Ultimates #13 In other media On the series Cloak & Dagger in the episode \\"Funhouse Mirrors\\", when Tyrone Johnson touches an individual by the name of Kev and looks into his fears, he sees a tall black cloaked figure with a white mask. Series showrunner Joe Pokaski has stated his intention for this to be Mister Jip, should the series be renewed for a second season.

He lived contemporaneously with Pharaoh Akhenaten. Labaya is mentioned in several of the Amarna Letters (abbreviated \\"EA\\", for 'el Amarna'). He is the author of letters EA 252‚Äì54. Labaya was active over the whole length of Samaria and slightly beyond, as he gave land to Habiru in the vicinity of ≈†akmu (Shechem) and he and his sons threatened such powerful towns as Jerusalem and Gazru (Gezer) to the south, and Megiddo to the north. Career Map of Samaria and its eastern and northern neighbors The Amarna letters give an incomplete look at Labaya's career. In the first of Labaya's letters thus far discovered (EA 252), he defends himself to the Pharaoh against complaints of other city rulers about him, for example, the complaint that he has hired mercenaries from among the Habiru. Labaya further admitted to having invaded Gezer and insulting its king Milkilu. He denied any knowledge of his son's alleged collaboration with the Habiru: Other Canaanite rulers, such as Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, complained of Labaya's depredations (e.g. EA 289)Moran, pp. 332-333 but note that in later years, Abdi-Heba would himself be referred to as \\"another Labaya\\" in EA 280.Moran, p. 321 Labaya was accused of capturing cities that were under Egyptian protection. Biridiya, the king of Megiddo, accused him of besieging his city: After receiving numerous complaints about Labaya's behavior, the pharaoh (probably Amenhotep III) finally ordered several Canaanite rulers to take Labaya prisoner and send him to Egypt. Biridiya, ruler of Megiddo, wrote to the pharaoh that Zurata, governor of Akko, had captured Labaya, but accepted a bribe from the latter and released him (EA 245).Moran, pp. 299-300 Labaya was eventually killed by the citizens of Gina (Beth-Hagan, possibly modern-day Jenin). His death was reported to the Pharaoh's agent, Balu-Ur-Sag, by Labaya's two sons. The sons of Labaya continued to campaign against other Egyptian vassals in Canaan. One of Labaya's sons, Mutbaal, ruled Pella in the Trans-Jordanian part of Canaan. Biryawaza, king of Damascus, was eventually asked to take armed action against Labaya's sons (EA 250).Moran, pp. 303-304 List of Labaya's three letters to Pharaoh EA 161, letter by Aziru (leader of Amurru) stating his case to pharaoh, one of the Amarna letters in cuneiform writing on a clay tablet Labaya's name is referenced in fourteen el Amarna letters and his name used thirty-two times.

See: Commissioner Addaya. Identifications with Biblical figures Some researchers, such as Richard Abbott, note the possibility that Labaya and the biblical figure of Abimelech ben Gideon, from Judges 9, were identical.Abimelech, Saul, and Amarna - Abimelech and Labayu Still others, such as David Rohl, have advocated a totally revised chronology of ancient Israelite and Egyptian history, and instead identify Labaya with Saul, and Mutbaal with Saul's son Ishbaal. Ish-baal and Mutbaal, whose names have the same meaning, \\"Man of Baal\\", moved their capital to Transjordan after the death of their fathers, whose center of power had been west of the Jordan river. Rohl further identifies Dadua, Ayab and Yishaya, three figures mentioned by Mutbaal in a later Amarna Letter, with King David, his general Joab and David's father Jesse. ~~Arguments identifying Labaya with Saul~~ (dead link). See also EA 256, title: \\"Oaths and denials\\", in Moran, p. 309-310. The Rohl chronology is not, however, widely accepted. Rohl's suggestions are rejected by other Egyptologists, such as Kenneth Kitchen, who argue that there are discrepancies between the Labaya of the Amarna texts and King Saul as he is described in the Books of Samuel.

Each vehicle is timed through numerous circuits of the track. The racers make a preliminary circuit, then run the timed laps, and then finish with a cool-down lap. Time Attack and time trial events differ by competition format and rules. Time Attack has a limited number of laps, time trial has open sessions. Unlike other timed motorsport disciplines such as sprinting and hillclimbing, the car is required to start off under full rolling start conditions following a warm up lap in which they will have to accelerate out as fast as possible to determine how fast they enter their timed lap.Time Attack FAQ's Commonly, as the cars are modified road going cars, they are required to have tires authorized for road use. Time attack events began in Japan in the mid-1960s. They have since spread around the world. In the United States, the Super Lap Battle is held at Buttonwillow Raceway Park since 2004. In February 2019 a new event called Superlap Battle USA was run at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, TX. The outright winner was Cole Powelson in the Lyfe Nissan GTR. An international event known as World Time Attack ChallengeWorld Time Attack Challenge home page has been held at Sydney Motorsport Park, Australia since 2010 attracting the fastest time attack teams from around the globe to compete. United States National Auto Sport Association Time Trial (NASA TT) series is a national auto competition program, utilizing regional series based on a time trial style format, with rules that establish car classifications to provide a contest of driver skill. NASA TT is designed to bridge the gap between NASA HPDE (High Performance Driving Events), and wheel-to-wheel racing. NASA TT provides a venue for spirited on-track competition with a high degree of both safety and convenience. NASA TT competition will take place during NASA HPDE-4 sessions or in separate TT run groups, depending on the event schedule and number of participants. In addition to having a set of National NASA TT Rules, the rules, safety guidelines, and driving requirements of the HPDE-4 program apply to NASA TT. These rules can be found in the NASA CCR (Club Codes and Regs). Flying Pigs Racing Street Modified FWD class Mini Cooper S. Driver Ben Marouski. Other events such as Gridlife offer a Time Attack event taking place in various locations across North America. The competition is divided into various groups based on car specification. The level varies from everyday driven vehicles to non road legal race cars. Each class also has its own set of rules and regulations on car specifications as the higher class one goes the less regulations one is faced with. The top 12 competitors regardless of class will participate in the Final grid event in which the driver is allowed one warm up lap, one hot lap, and one cool down lap. The hot lap, however, will not count towards the overall trackbattle event. There is also a seasonal championship with every class having a champion based on points earned throughout the season.  Germany  In Germany, the German Timeattack Masters is a time attack championship, held since 2013. It started being limited to Japanese cars only and opened up to vehicles of all makes in 2016. From 2013 to 2017 the championship consisted of four events, in 2018 that number increased to five for the overall championship. Events are held on various racing tracks, most of them located in Germany, like the N√ºrburgring Grand Prix course, the Lausitzring and the Hockenheimring. Additionally, for years, the TT Circuit Assen is used in cooperation with the Dutch Time Attack Masters. Formerly, races also took place on the German course Oschersleben. Each event consists of Warm Up, Qualifying and the Hotlap finals, with Qualifying rank and Hotlap rank counting for the overall championship. The Hotlap is only driven by the five fastest starters from the Qualifying. Groups are split according to car specifications, mainly regarding severity of modifications and aerodynamics. With more powerful classes, safety regulations are also tighter. Classes range from Club-class, being close-to-production, via the Pro-class, with more allowed aerodynamics and allowed engine swaps, to the Extreme-class in which everything is allowed, that is not forbidden explicitly. While in lower classes a distinction between 2WD and 4WD is made, this is neglected in the Extreme-class. The series is independent and not connected to any larger organization like the DMSB. Video games  Many computer and video games include a time attack (or time trial) mode, in which the main goal is to complete levelsor, in some cases, the entire gameas quickly as possible. This mode prioritizes completion time ahead of other measures of success such as high scores. In cases in which a game does not have a dedicated time attack or trial mode, a fast completion is frequently known as a speedrun. Usually the best results achieved in a time attack mode are stored in long-term memory by the game (on a hard disk or non-volatile memory), so they can be shared with friends or improved upon at a later date. Racing games often feature \\"ghost cars\\" which are saved when the player sets a record time. In subsequent races, the ghost car follows the path the player took when setting that record, allowing them to clearly gauge how they are performing against the previous achievement. Saved ghost cars can often be shared with other players. The inclusion of a time attack mode can often be an effective way of adding replay value to a game. Racing games may also include ghost cars recorded by the development staffattempting to beat their times can provide a final challenge to players who have mastered the rest of the game. Often the game provides other incentives to use the time attack feature; GoldenEye 007, a first-person shooter on the Nintendo 64, encouraged players to revisit levels more than once by offering unlockable cheat options as a reward for completing them within target times. Sometimes, the settings of a time attack mode are \\"locked\\" in order to standardize competition between players. For example, Soul Calibur features a time attack mode automatically set to two rounds for a win, the normal difficulty setting and a default time limit; but it also features an alternative Arcade mode, which allows any option settings to be used and saves record times separately. Both speedrunning and time attacking have extensive online communities dedicated to achieving the fastest times possible.

The appended notes say \\"the map of the western lands drawn by Columbus\\"To The End of the Earth, Jeremy Harwood, Struik Publishers, 2007, , p.69 The Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis (). Approximately one third of the map survives; it shows the western coasts of Europe and North Africa and the coast of Brazil with reasonable accuracy. Various Atlantic islands, including the Azores and Canary Islands, are depicted, as is the mythical island of Antillia and possibly Japan. The map's historical importance lies in its demonstration of the extent of global exploration of the New World by approximately 1510, and in its claim to have used a map of Christopher Columbus, otherwise lost, as a source. Piri also stated that he had used ten Arab sources and four Indian maps sourced from the Portuguese. More recently, the map has been the focus of claims for the pre-modern exploration of the Antarctic coast. The Piri Reis map is in the Library of the Topkapƒ± Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, but is not usually on display to the public. Description The map is the extant western third of a world map drawn on gazelle skin parchment, with dimensions variously reported as 90 cm √ó 63 cm,.. 86 cm √ó 60 cm,. 90 cm √ó 65 cm,... 85 cm √ó 60 cm,.. 87 cm √ó 63 cm,. and 86 cm √ó 62 cm.. These discrepancies are largely due to the damaged corner. The surviving portion primarily details the western coast of Africa and the eastern coast of South America. The map was signed by Piri Reis, an Ottoman-Turkish admiral, geographer and cartographer, and dated to the month of Muharram in the Islamic year 919 AH, equivalent to 1513 AD... It was presented to Ottoman Sultan Selim I in 1517.From the preface of Piri's Kitab-ƒ± Bahriye (1521), as translated in Kahle 1933: \\"This poor man [Piri Reis] had previously constructed a map which, in comparison with maps hitherto known, displayed many more [and] different details, [and] in which he had included even the newly published maps of the Indian and Chinese Oceans which at that time were totally unknown in the country of R≈´m [the Ottoman Empire]; and he had presented it in Cairo to the Turkish Sultan Selim I, who graciously accepted it.\\" In the map's legend, Piri inscribed that the map was based on about twenty charts and mappae mundi...Inscription 6 on the map reads: \\"In this age, no one has seen a map like this. The hand of this poor man [Piri Reis] has drawn it and completed it from about twenty charts and mappaemundi. These are charts drawn in the days of Iskender dhu-l Karnian [Alexander the Great], which the inhabited quarter of the world. The Arabs name these charts Jaferya.\\" Translation from . According to Piri, these maps included eight Ptolemaic maps, an Arabic map of India, four newly drawn Portuguese maps from Sindh, and a map by Christopher Columbus of the western lands. From Inscription 6 on the map: > From eight Jaferyas of that kind and one Arabic map of Hind [India], and > from four newly drawn Portuguese maps which show the countries of Sind [now > in modern day Pakistan], Hind and √áin [China] geometrically drawn, and also > from a map drawn by Qul≈´nb≈´ [Columbus] in the western region, I have > extracted it. By reducing all these maps to one scale this final form was > arrived at, so that this map of these lands is regarded by seamen as > accurate and as reliable as the accuracy and reliability of the Seven SeasIn > this case, the Seven Seas are the Chinese Sea, the Indian Sea, the Persian > Gulf, the Caspian Sea, the Western Sea (Atlantic Ocean), the Red Sea and the > East African Sea (sea surrounding the East African island of Zanzibar), as > identified by Piri in Kitab-ƒ± Bahriye (1521). . on the aforesaid > maps.\\"Translation from . There is some scholarly debate over whether the 20 charts and mappae mundi in Piri's inscriptions includes the eight Ptolemaic maps, the four Portuguese maps, the Arabic map and the Columbus map. From one perspective, the number of charts and mappae mundi used by Piri equals 20,.. while in the other, it could mean a total of 34..... Some have claimed that the source maps were found in the ancient Library of Alexandria,. based on Piri's allusions to Alexander the Great, the founder of Alexandria, Ptolemy I, who ruled Alexandria in the 4th century BC, and Claudius Ptolemy, the Greek geographer and cartographer who lived in Alexandria during the 2nd century AD. Gregory McIntosh states \\"Arab writers often confused Claudius Ptolemy, the geographer of the second century C.E., with Ptolemy I, one of Alexander's generals... Piri Reis has undoubtedly made the same error, resulting in his believing the charts and maps were from the time of Ptolemy I instead of Claudius Ptolemy.\\" History The map was discovered serendipitously on 9 October 1929, through the philological work of the German theologian Gustav Adolf Deissmann (1866‚Äì1937). He had been commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Education to catalogue the Topkapƒ± Palace library's non-Islamic items.A. Gerber, Deissmann the Philologist, Berlin, 2010, 198-201. At Deissmann's request to search the palace for old maps and charts, the director Halil Edhem (1861‚Äì1938) managed to find some disregarded bundles of material, which he handed over to Deissmann. Realizing that the map might be a unique find, Deissmann showed it to the orientalist Paul Kahle, who identified it as a map drawn by Piri Reis.G. A. Deissmann, Forschungen und Funde im Serai, Berlin, 1933, 111-122. The discovery caused an international sensation, as it represented the only then known copy of a world map of Christopher Columbus (1451‚Äì1506),P. Lunde, ‚ÄòPiri Reis and the Columbus Map‚Äô, Aramco World, 43, 3, 1992, 48-59 and was the only 16th-century map that showed South America in its proper longitudinal position in relation to Africa. Geographers had spent several centuries unsuccessfully searching for a \\"lost map of Columbus\\" that was supposedly drawn while he was in the West Indies. After reading about the map's discovery in The Illustrated London News, United States Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson contacted the United States Ambassador to Turkey Charles H. Sherrill and requested that an investigation be launched to find the Columbus source map, which he believed may have been in Turkey.. In turn, the Turkish government complied with Stimson's request, but they were unsuccessful in locating any of the source maps..

Analysis The map is a portolan chart, as shown by the four compass roses (two large and two small) from which lines of bearing radiate. Some analyses assert that the map is an azimuthal equidistant projection centered on Cairo, but a 1998 analysis by Steven Dutch of the University of Wisconsin Green Bay shows a better fit with a point near the intersection of the present-day prime meridian and the equator. There are extensive notes in Ottoman Turkish around the edges of the map, as well as some interior detail which is mostly inaccurate and fanciful. The Iberian peninsula and the coast of Africa are rendered accurately; as for the Americas, the northern portion of the South American coast is also fairly accurate and positioned correctly with respect to Africa. Much of the Caribbean is also mapped fairly accurately and appears to reflect Columbus's maps of the area. The area representing North America bears almost no resemblance to its real coastline except for one projection which might be Newfoundland; an island labelled \\"Antilia\\" may actually be Nova Scotia, since it has a note attached which refers to the legendary voyages of Saint Brendan. There is some suggestion that this area may represent the Asian coast. Island groups in the east Atlantic are accurately placed, but are depicted out of scale. Although there are frequent claims for the extreme accuracy of this chart, McIntosh, in comparing the Piri Reis map to several other portolan- style maps of the era, found that > The Piri Reis map is not the most accurate map of the sixteenth century, as > has been claimed, there being many, many world maps produced in the > remaining eighty-seven years of that century that far surpass it in > accuracy. The Ribeiro maps of the 1520s and 1530s, the Ortelius map of 1570, > and the Wright-Molyneux map of 1599 (‚Äòthe best map of the sixteenth > century‚Äô) are only a few better-known examples.. =The Antarctic coast= There are two major discrepancies from known coastlines: the North American coast mentioned above, and the southern portion of the South American coast. On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day Rio de Janeiro. Another interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the Queen Maud Land coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact hypotheses. Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in Charles Hapgood's 1966 book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilisation based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps. More notoriously, these claims were repeated in Erich von D√§niken's Chariots of the Gods? (which attributed the knowledge of the coast to extraterrestrials) and Gavin Menzies's 1421: The Year China Discovered the World (which attributed it to supposed Chinese voyages), both of which were roundly denounced by mainstream scholars. A more sober analysis of these claims was published by Gregory McIntosh, a historian of cartography, who examined the map in depth in his book The Piri Reis Map of 1513 (Athens and London: University of Georgia Press, 2000). He was able to find sources for much of the map in Columbus's writings. Certain peculiarities (such as the appearance of the Virgin Islands in two locations) he attributed to the use of multiple maps as sources; others (such as the errors in North American geography) he traced to the continued confusion of the area with East Asia. As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of kilometres north of its proper location; second, the Drake Passage is completely missing, with the Antarctic Peninsula presumably conflated with the Western Patagonian coast. The identification of this area of the map with the frigid Antarctic coast is also difficult to reconcile with the notes on the map which describe the region as having a warm climate. Maps of the period generally depicted a large continent named Terra Australis Incognita of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by Ptolemy as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere; due to a lack of exploration and various misunderstandings, its existence was not fully abandoned until circumnavigation of the area during the second voyage of James Cook in the 1770s showed that if it existed, it was much smaller than imagined previously. The first confirmed landing on Antarctica was not until 1820, and the coastline of Queen Maud Land did not see significant exploration before Norwegian expeditions began in 1891. In 1513, Cape Horn had not yet been discovered, and indeed Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation was not to set sail for another six years. It is unclear whether the mapmaker saw South America itself as part of the unknown southern lands (as shown in the Miller Atlas),https://www.diegocuoghi.com/Piri_Reis/PiriReis_eng.htm Diego Cuoghi, Thorough article on Piri Reis and Oronteus maps refuting the Antarctica claims. or whether (as Dutch thought) he drew what was then known of the coast with substantial distortion, but in any case, serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.

Aerial view of main excavation area (2009) Pistiros (Ancient Greek, Œ†ŒØœÉœÑŒπœÅŒøœÇ) was an inland Ancient Greek emporion, or trade center, in Ancient Thrace.

The emporion sustained intensive relations with the main economic centers in Aegean Thrace, including Thasos, Maroneia, and Apollonia, and flourished in the 4th century BC.  History  Founding = Pistiros was founded in the 3rd quarter of the 5th century BC. This would place her founding during the reign of the first kings of the Odrysian kingdom: Teres I, Sparatocos or Sitalkes.

The location of the emporion offered many strategic advantages. In addition to the site's proximity to lumber sources and copper, iron, and gold mines, it was situated on the Hebros River, which was navigable for small boats, and was at the intersection of several major roads.Jan Bouzek and Lidia Domardzka, \\"Emporion Pistiros Between Greater Powers (ca. 450-278 B.C.): An Attempt to Sketch Its History,\\" in Pistiros III: Excavations and Studies, ed.

The co-existence between the Greeks and Thracians rendered them allies to a certain extent. The grave inscriptions of Greeks originating from Apollonia and Maroneia, discovered in Pistiros, and the names incised on pottery (graffiti) both of Thracians and Greeks, prove that the people from Pistiros were not ethnically homogeneous. Adjacent to the territory of emporion Pistiros were the Bessoi, the keepers of the Dionysian sanctuary in the Rhodopes. The oath taken in Dionysos‚Äô name by King Cotys I and his successor, according to the Vetren inscription (see below), represents additional proof for the significance of that cult in the official ideology of the Odrysian state. The excavations have produced a great deal of evidence regarding cult practices in Pistiros. Among the artifacts discovered are preserved or fragmented clay altars with various forms and decorations (several of them preserved in situ), cult zoomorphic figurines made of clay or stone, clay anthropomorphic figurines, and miniature objects and portable hearths (pyraunoi). = Economy = Coin hoard (3rd century BCE) found in PistirosEmporion Pistiros maintained wide trade contacts. Under Cotys I (384 BC‚Äì359 BC) and his successors, the Thasian, Apollonian, and Maroneian traders of the city obtained guarantees, as described in the Vetren inscription (see below), concerning the integrity of their life, property and activity. This status coincided with the period of greatest economic prosperity for Pistiros. More than 1000 copper and silver coins discovered during the excavations in Pistiros shed light on its internal and external trade contacts. This is the unique numismatic complex discovered during ordinary excavations where the coinage of several Thracian rulers is represented, including Amadocus I, Bergaios, Cotys I, Amadocus II, Teres II, Cersobleptes, and Seuthes III. The collection also contains coins from several Greek city-states, including Thasos, Maroneia, Parion, Thracian Chersonese, Kypsela, Enos, Apollonia, Messembria, Damastion, Sermyle, and Kardia. Also included in the find is coinage of Ancient Macedonian and Hellenistic rulers (Philip II, Alexander the Great, Cassandros, Demetrios Poliorketes, Lysimachos, Seleucus I, etc.). In 1999 another fundamental discovery was made ‚Äì a collective find consisting of 552 silver and gold coins issued by Alexander the Great, Demetrios Poliorketes, Lysimachos and Seleucus I. The inhabitants of this antique center imported luxury pottery from Attic workshops for their domestic usage. Among the painted pottery discovered in Pistiros, vessels of krater and scyphos types predominate, while those of the kylix and pelike types are more uncommon. Scenes of everyday life, mythology, leisure, and games of the ancient Greeks are depicted on the vessels. Represented in more variety are black glazed pottery wares, including scyphoi, kanthaoroi, bowls and one- handled cups, kylices and various shapes of latter type, lekythoi, and fish plates. The import of luxurious Attic pottery in Pistiros was interrupted around the mid 3rd century BC. This trend is typical for the entire Thracian plain. Among the significant number of amphora fragments, the greatest number are of those manufactured in Thasian workshops or in those belonging to the Thasian peraea. Various patterns of autochthonous pottery (both wheel- and hand-made) prevail compared to the imported pottery. In some cases, the vessels have been entirely preserved, as in the case of several sealed oenochoai representing various scenes of the Dionysian cult (Silenus abducting a menade, a Satyr‚Äôs masque). Thrace with its rich ledges succeeds in attracting the interest of the population from Aegean region. Emporion Pistiros, which was created under the tutelage of the Thracian kings, became a key center in the export of metals from Thrace to Greece. In addition to exporting metal, Thracians also produced jewellery, and a variety of archaeological finds in Pistiros, including crucibles, blowers, cuts, matrixes, and molds, are evidence for the presence of jewellery workshops within the emporion. After the Celts burned down the emporion in the early 3rd century BC, a village was built on its remains, in which fibulae and other ornaments made of iron, bronze, silver and gold were manufactured. The Vetren inscription Vetren inscription found near Pistiros (4th century BCE) The discovery in 1990 of the Vetren inscription led to the identification of the excavation site as Emporion Pistiros, a site attested in the ancient literary tradition. The inscription was discovered at the nearby site of Bona Mansio, approximately 3 km away. Survey evidence from Bona Mansio reveals that a large number of stones used in the construction of the mansio were taken from the city walls of Emporion Pistiros. Given the proximity of Bona Mansio to the modern excavation site, this discovery presents strong evidence that the site is in fact Emporion Pistiros. The inscription in Ancient Greek states: \\"If a merchant brings suit against another merchant (in Pistiros) they shall be judged among their kinsmen and with regard to whatever is owed to the merchants by Thracians, there shall be no cancellation of these debts. All land and pasture owned by the merchants shall not be taken away from them. He shall not send holders of estates(?) to the merchants. He shall not install a garrison at Pistiros nor will he transfer Pistiros to another. He shall not exchange the land lots of the Pistirians nor transfer them to another. Neither he nor members of his family shall seize the property of the merchants. He shall not levy road taxes on any goods exported by the merchants from Pistiros to Maronea or from Maronea to Pistiros or to the market place Belana of the Praseoi. The merchants shall open and close their wagons. Just as also in the time of Cotys [I swear this oath]; neither I nor anyone of my family will blind or kill a citizen of Maronea; nor shall I or any member of my family seize the property of a citizen of Maronea, whether he be alive or dead; nor shall I nor anyone of my family will blind or kill a citizen of Apollonia or Thasos who is living in Pistiros whether he is alive or dead\\".D.

The inscription further indicates the close social and economic ties between the Greek and Thracian inhabitants of the region. Archaeological excavations The memorial plaque in Pistiros of the discoverer of the ancient settlement, Mieczyslaw Domaradzki.The excavation of the archaeological site on the left bank of Maritsa began in 1988, at which time excavators discovered a large trade center ‚Äì Emporion Pistiros ‚Äì that played a major role in the economical and cultural life of Ancient Thrace. The excavations of Emporion Pistiros are conducted by a team of Bulgarian, British (Liverpool University), Polish, Czech (Prague University), and French (French School in Athens) archaeologists. The research work is carried out under the scientific guidance of the National Archaeological Institute with Museum ‚Äì Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in co-operation with the Archaeological Museum ‚ÄúProf. Mieczys≈Çaw Domaradzki‚Äù in the town of Septemvri. Archaeologists are still working to understand how it was possible to found a strongly fortified Greek city so far inland, even if the settlement was apparently accessible for small boats on the Hebrus River. An early theory offered by Professor Mieczyslaw Domaradzki was that the city was also a royal residence of the sub-king of the Upper Thrace. However, no palace, or any other archaeological evidence for significant social hierarchy, has been uncovered at Pistiros, in contrast to other Thracian sites such as Seuthopolis, and M. Domardzki changed his mind soon after the inscription was found. Only a few scholars, among them G. Tsetskhladze, still expressed such opinion still in late nineties. The identification of the site as Emporion Pistiros continues to present some controversy.For an engagement with the arguments against the identification of the site as Emporion Pistiros, see Jan Bouzek and Lidia Domaradzka, \\"What was the proper function of the fortified settlement at Adzijska Vodenica? Why to call it Emporion Pistiros?\\" in Pistiros IV: Excavations and Studies, ed. Jan Bouzek, Lidia Domaradzka, and Zofia H. Archibald (Prague, Charles University, 2010), 235-240. 858x858px Since 2013, an annual archaeological field school has operated in Pistiros as part of the Balkan Heritage Field School program. The program is run by the Balkan Heritage Foundation with the cooperation of the Septemvri Archaeological Museum \\"Prof. Mieczyslaw Domaradzki,\\" and the New Bulgarian University. The rich archaeological material found in Pistiros is preserved in the Archaeological Museum ‚ÄúProf. Mieczys≈Çaw Domaradzki,‚Äù in the town of Septemvri. The archaeological excavations in Pistiros have been discussed in many scientific conferences, publications, and exhibitions.Such conferences include the international symposium \\"Pistiros et Thasos. Structures commerciales dans la peninsule Balkanique VII-II s. av. J.C.,\\" held in the town of Septemvri, Bulgaria, 22-26 April 1998; and the international symposium \\"The Culture of Thracians and Their Neighbours,\\" held in the towns of Kazanluk and Septemvri, Bulgaria, 1-3 October 1999. Honours Pistiros Lake in Antarctica is named after the emporium.

Biography His father was Jean Babinet and mother, Marie‚ÄêAnne F√©licit√© Bonneau du Chesn. Babinet started his studies at the Lyc√©e Napol√©on, but was persuaded to abandon a legal education for the pursuit of science. A graduate of the √âcole Polytechnique, which he left in 1812 for the Military School at Metz, he was later a professor at the Sorbonne and at the Coll√®ge de France. In 1840, he was elected as a member of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences. He was also an astronomer of the Bureau des Longitudes. Among Babinet's accomplishments are the 1827 standardization of the √Öngstr√∂m unit for measuring light using the red Cadmium line's wavelength, and the principle (Babinet's principle) that similar diffraction patterns are produced by two complementary screens. He was the first to suggest using wavelengths of light to standardize measurements. His idea was first used between 1960 and 1983, when a meter was defined as a wavelength of light from krypton gas. Babinet was interested in the optical properties of minerals throughout his career. He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the polariscope and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The Babinet compensator, an accessory useful in polarized light microscopy, was built with twin, opposed quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy. This design avoids the problems inherent in the basic quartz wedge, where the zero reading coincides with the thin end of the wedge, which is often lost when grinding the plate during manufacture. Expanding his fascination of diffraction to meteorology, Babinet spent a significant amount of time in the study of rainbow optics. His astronomical research focused on Mercury's mass and the Earth's magnetism, while his inventions included valve improvements for air pumps and a hygrometer. In geography and hydrogeomorphology, the Baer‚ÄìBabinet law helps to explain and predict directionality in the course of rivers. Babinet's cartography work includes homalographic projections where the parallels are rectilinear and meridian lines are elliptical. In addition to his brilliant lectures on meteorology and optics research, Babinet was also a great promoter of science, an amusing and clever lecturer, and a brilliant, entertaining and prolific author of popular scientific articles. He was beloved by many for his kindly and charitable nature. Family Life On October 30, 1820, Jacques Babinet was married to Adela√Øde Laugier (July 14, 1795-July 27, 1849). They had two children: Charles Babinet (December 8, 1821-May 31 1907) and L√©on Babinet (July 26, 1825-1913).

A detachable collar is a shirt collar separate from the shirt, fastened to it by studs. The collar is usually made of a different fabric from the shirt, in which case it is almost always white, and, being unattached to the shirt, can be specially starched to a hard cardboard-like consistency. Man wearing detachable collar, 1910 USA History Some believe that Hannah Montague invented this collar in Troy, New York, in 1827, after she snipped off the collar from one of her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it back on. The Rev. Ebenezar Brown, a businessman in town, proceeded to commercialize it. The manufacture of detachable collars and the associated shirts became a significant industry in Troy. It was later that the benefit of being able to starch the collars became apparent, and for a short time, various other parts of the shirt, such as the front and cuffs, were also made detachable and treated to rigid stiffness. As more emphasis started to be placed on comfort in clothing this practice declined, and the stiff collar is the last surviving use of such heavily starched cotton in daywear; while a full dress shirt (worn with white tie and occasionally black tie) still has a stiff, but attached, front and cuffs to accompany the stiff detachable collar. Using a detachable collar A pair of collar studs; the longer left one is the front stud The collar is attached to the shirt by a pair of studs like those shown. The shirt has a tunic collar, a short upright band of fabric with a hole at the back and one on each side at the front. The stiff collar is attached at the back before the shirt is donned (and the tie placed under the collar for a turndown collar), then the shirt is put on, after which the front stud is pushed through the collar to fasten it. Detachable collars are often used by barristers in the UK, Ireland and Canada, many of whom wear a winged collar when in court to allow the use of bands. On the way to and from court, a turndown collar and tie is worn. Another common use of detachable collars now is a clerical collar (or \\"Roman Collar\\"), though these are now often made from flexible plastic for ease of washing, and are not always now attached in the traditional way with studs. Also, at Eton College, all pupils wear stiff collars, mostly turndown collars, while students in positions of authority wear 'stick-ups', which includes a wing collar. Outside these situations, detachable collars are less common. Stiff collars in particular with daywear in the 21st century are generally rare, but if one is worn, it is usually a turndown collar, though morning dress is seen still with a wing collar. Older styles, such as the imperial collar (a high collar with no wings last popular with the Edwardians), are not frequently seen now. A more common use of detachable collars is with eveningwear, in which case a high wing collar is worn in America although turn-down collars are preferred for black-tie in Britain as per Edward VIII. To starch a collar, it must be rinsed in boiling water to remove any starch, then laundered as normal. After soaking in a concentrated warm starch solution, it is left until nearly dry, then ironed until hard. While ironing, the shape is added by curling, or using a collar press.

The name of the castle is most likely an old misspelling of the French word \\"Millepertuis\\", meaning \\"St. John's Wort\\", which was considered a sacred plant during the days the Reynard cycle was first written. Labyrinthine Maleperduys is full of holes, crooked and long, with multiple exits, which Reynard can open and shut to elude his enemies. Full of secret chambers and passageways, in William Caxton's The Historie of Reynart the Foxe (1485) the castle of Maleperduys is described as the \\"best and the fastest burgh that [Reynard] had. There lay he in when he had need, and was in any dread or fear.\\" (Chapter VII, How Bruin the Bear was sped of Reynard the Fox). Over time, the word came to mean a place of refuge.

These vector spaces make it possible to use techniques of linear algebra in studying the graph. Definition Let G:=(V,E) be a finite undirected graph. The vertex space \\\\mathcal{V}(G) of G is the vector space over the finite field of two elements \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}:=\\\\lbrace 0,1 \\\\rbrace of all functions V\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}. Every element of \\\\mathcal{V}(G) naturally corresponds the subset of V which assigns a 1 to its vertices. Also every subset of V is uniquely represented in \\\\mathcal{V}(G) by its characteristic function. The edge space \\\\mathcal{E}(G) is the \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}-vector space freely generated by the edge set E. The dimension of the vertex space is thus the number of vertices of the graph, while the dimension of the edge space is the number of edges. These definitions can be made more explicit. For example, we can describe the edge space as follows: * elements of the vector space are subsets of E, that is, as a set \\\\mathcal{E}(G) is the power set of E * vector addition is defined as the symmetric difference: P+Q:=P \\\\triangle Q \\\\qquad P,Q \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}(G) * scalar multiplication is defined by: **0 \\\\cdot P := \\\\emptyset \\\\qquad P \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}(G) ** 1 \\\\cdot P := P \\\\qquad P \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}(G) The singleton subsets of E form a basis for \\\\mathcal{E}(G). One can also think of \\\\mathcal{V}(G) as the power set of V made into a vector space with similar vector addition and scalar multiplication as defined for \\\\mathcal{E}(G). Properties The incidence matrix H for a graph G defines one possible linear transformation :H:\\\\mathcal{E}(G) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{V}(G) between the edge space and the vertex space of G. The incidence matrix of G, as a linear transformation, maps each edge to its two incident vertices. Let vu be the edge between v and u then :H(vu) = v+u The cycle space and the cut space are linear subspaces of the edge space.

The primary star is slightly more massive than our Sun, but cooler being a type K star. Therefore, it is a subgiant clearly more evolved than the Sun. In visual light it is four times brighter than the Sun, but because of its distance, about 205 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With binoculars it should be easily visible. The primary star is known to have two extrasolar planets orbiting around it. Stellar system The secondary star is a Red dwarf star orbiting at a distance of 100 to 200 AU with a likely period of roughly 800 years. Planetary system On November 1, 1999, the discovery of a planet HD 177830 b was announced by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the very successful radial velocity method and an analysis on data released by the team performed by amateur astronomer Peter Jalowiczor along with two other planets. This planet is nearly 50% more massive than Jupiter () and takes 407 days to orbit the star in an extremely circular orbit. In 2000 a group of scientists proposed, based on preliminary Hipparcos astrometrical satellite data, that the orbital inclination of HD 177830 b is as little as 1.3¬∞. If that was the case, the planet would have a mass of , making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet. However, it is very unlikely that the planet would have such orbit. Furthermore, brown dwarfs with short orbits around solar-mass () stars are exceedingly rare (the so-called \\"brown dwarf desert\\") making the claim even more unlikely. On November 17, 2010, the discovery of a second planet HD 177830 c was announced along with four other planets. The planet has 50% the mass of Saturn and takes 111 days to orbit the star in a very eccentric orbit. This planet is in a near 4:1 resonance with the outer planet.

It evolved out of the far-right anti-communist Edmund Burke Society that had been founded in 1967 by Don Andrews, Paul Fromm, Leigh Smith and Al Overfield. In 1971, the EBS had taken over Social Credit Party of Ontario. Fromm was elected as party president and EBS installed members to the party's executive. However, in 1972, the Social Credit Party of Canada declared Western Guard membership incompatible with Social Credit and expelled the group. Andrews became the dominant figure in the EBS, and relaunched it as the Western Guard, narrowing the group's focus to racism, antisemitism and white supremacy. Fromm left the group later in 1972 as the Western Guard descended into violent activity. In 1975, Andrews was charged with offences ranging from plotting arson, possession of weapons and explosives, and mischief, and was sentenced to two years in jail. Although Western Guard did plot to bomb a visiting Israeli soccer team, Don Andrews was not convicted of this crime. In order to fulfill his bail conditions, Andrews separated himself from the Western Guard. Veteran fascist John Ross Taylor became the group's leader in 1976. Taylor changed the name of the group to Western Guard Party. The group's membership declined under his idiosyncratic leadership. Many members, including Wolfgang Droege, left to join the Nationalist Party of Canada which had been founded by Andrews when he was released from prison in 1978. In 1979, Taylor was charged with hate speech for the Western Guard's telephonic messages and was brought before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He was ultimately imprisoned for contempt of court when he continued the Guard's racist answering machine messages. The group became an essentially one-person party in the 1980s, and was defunct by the middle of the decade. Despite calling itself a party, the Western Guard never registered as a federal or provincial political party and is not known to have ever nominated candidates for office under its name.

Combining a cartoon influenced visual vocabulary with a highly polished technical ability, based on the exacting painting methods of the Old Masters, Schorr weaves intricate narratives that are often biting yet humorous in their commentary on the human condition. While growing up as a child in New Jersey, Schorr showed a compulsion for drawing at an early age and was enrolled in Saturday morning art classes by the age of five. Deeply affected by fantasy movies such as the 1933 classic King Kong and the early animated cartoons of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer, their influence along with comic books such as Mad would have a lasting effect on Schorr‚Äôs developing visual vocabulary. While visiting the Uffizi gallery in Italy on a trip to Europe in the summer of 1970, Schorr began to formulate his idea of combining his love of cartoons with the techniques of the old masters. In 1972 he entered the Philadelphia College of Art (now the University of the Arts) wanting to be a painter but was advised to pursue illustration. Schorr started professional illustration work while still in college, and soon after graduating in 1976, he moved to New York City where he produced work for projects including album covers for AC/DC, movie posters for George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, and covers for Time magazine that now reside in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC. By 1985 Schorr began making a concentrated effort to break away from illustration and focus on fine art painting. He was invited to show work in the 1986 landmark exhibition American Pop Culture Images Today at the Laforet Museum in Tokyo, Japan, along with notable artists Robert Williams, Suzanne Williams, Neon Park, Bob Zoell, Georganne Deen, Mark Mothersbaugh, Gary Panter, and his wife Kathy Staico Schorr, which in large part galvanized the ‚ÄúLowbrow‚Äù and Pop Surrealism movements. Schorr continued to exhibit in group shows but by the time of his wildly successful first solo show in 1992 at the Tamara Bane Gallery in Los Angeles he had severed all ties to illustration. Schorr and his wife relocated to Los Angeles in 1999. The so-called ‚ÄúLowbrow‚Äù art movement that he and his contemporaries helped form almost 25 years ago is now a global phenomenon. In 2008 Schorr‚Äôs work was shown at the Laguna Art Museum as part of In the Land of Retinal Delights: The Juxtapoz Factor. His work has also been exhibited in three career retrospectives to date: Secret Mystic Rites 2001, Art and Culture Center, Hollywood, Florida, American Surreal, 2009, San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, CA and Designed for Extinction, 2010, Otis Ben Maltz Gallery, Los Angeles, CA. Schorr‚Äôs work has been featured in many books and periodicals on the arts including Juxtapoz as well as the documentary film The Treasures of Long Gone John. Three monographs on his work, Secret Mystic Rites (1998), Dreamland (2004), and American Surreal have been published by Last Gasp.  Clash of Holidays Controversy in Florida  Clash of Holidays caused a scandal when it was exhibited in 2002, when South Florida civil leaders accused Schorr of blasphemy and others raising this as an issue over artistic freedom. A retrospective for Schorr entitled, Secret Mystic Rites: Todd Schorr Retrospective, was organized by the Art and Culture Center of Hollywood, Florida, on December 14, 2001 - February 17, 2002.Art and Culture Center of Hollywood A huge controversy immediately ensued due to the museum's invitation for the exhibition which depicted Shorr's Clash of Holidays painting. The \\"museum managers mailed out about 4000 post cards showing Clash of the Holidays. The outrage started there. Clash of the Holidays depicts...Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny locked in mortal combat. Santa's wielding an ax. The rabbit has a knife. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Baby Jesus, who's munching on an ear from a chocolate rabbit, stand by.\\" \\"It was just a joke, really, like lot of my paintings that poke fun at things, comments Schorr, who completed the piece in 2000, then sold it to Courteney Cox of Friends television show fame.\\" Initially, \\"leaders of Art and Culture Center of Hollywood...had decided to take down the painting that had drawn nasty phone calls, e-mails, and criticism from the City Commission.\\" The controversy died down after meetings between local, state, and museum officials concerning artist's rights, free speech and censorship.  The Treasures of Long Gone John  In 2006, a feature-length documentary titled The Treasures of Long Gone John, was released.The Treasures of Long Gone John official site The film is described as \\"A chronicle of the eccentric art and musical obsessions of indie record producer and self-described 'anti-mogul,' Long Gone John\\".Scott Weinberg. SXSW '06 Interview: The Treasures of Long Gone John Director Greg Gibbs, eFilmCritic.com The film features Schorr, Long Gone John and other Lowbrow artists as it chronicles the progress of the commissioned painting A Pirate's Treasure Dream using time-lapse photography.  American Surreal Schorr was given a career retrospective entitled American Surreal at the San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, CA, from June 20-September 16, 2009.

In contrast to other types of races, athletes race alone since they are sent out in intervals (interval starts), as opposed to a mass start.

In rowing, time trial races, where the boats are sent out at 10 to 20 second intervals, are usually called \\"head races.\\" In many forms of motorsport, a similar format is used in qualifying to determine the starting order for the main event, though multiple attempts to set the fastest time are often allowed.

The show originally aired from October to December 2003 on UHF syndication in Japan, and each episode has a run time of only 12 minutes. It has been licensed in North America by Geneon and was released on two DVDs during 2005 and 2006. Synopsis Bottle Fairy is a comedy series. The show follows a simple pattern, consisting of the Bottle Fairies misinterpreting the world around them. The fairies learn about Japanese culture and traditions with each episode taking place in a different month. Plot The Bottle Fairies, who have come from another world, are attempting to learn many things about the world so they can gain knowledge and turn into humans - a feat they finally achieve in episode 12, set in the twelfth month, thus making the series span a whole year. However, as their wish to stay together is stronger than their wish to become human, they merge into one human, while retaining their several personalities. The thirteenth episode shows the fairies attempting to function as a single human girl, before eventually splitting into four fairies again. This extra episode makes Bottle Fairy the typical length of a small anime series. CharactersThe Bottle Fairies= The Bottle Fairies are identified by their eye color, their individual quirks, and their association with the seasons (represented by season songs). They sleep in appropriately colored jars. *Kururu is the blue Bottle Fairy; she has pink hair and blue eyes. She is associated with spring. Kururu is hyperactive, and what she imagines is often very extreme. : *Chiriri is the yellow Bottle Fairy; she has blonde hair and yellow eyes. She is associated with summer. She is friendly and slightly reserved, with a surreal imagination. She is obsessed with soap opera and hats. She can also turn wishes into reality. : *Sarara is the red Bottle Fairy; she has grey hair and red eyes. She is associated with autumn. She is quiet, but what she imagines tends to be tomboyish. : *Hororo is the green Bottle Fairy; she has black hair and green eyes. She is associated with winter. She is a somewhat distant character, with a slow, rambling personality. Hororo is always thinking about something and is usually shy meeting new people. She is often caught thinking about food. : *Kusachiho, Her name is a contraction of the fairies' names by using the first Japanese character of each. Predictably, she has what may be classified as dissociative identity disorder, and has the personality traits of all the Bottle Fairies. Which fairy is in control is indicated by the color of her eyes and her voice. Her color is orange. She only appears in the final two episodes. *Rere is the purple Bottle Fairy; she appears in illustration book Bottle Fairy Funbook illustrated by Tokumi Yuiko (). She is not associated with the seasons. She has an energetic, serious character and almost always repeat her phrases twice with another different way of talking. Although Rere is serious-type and tried to push other fairies to work in order to become human, she always swayed or distracted by other fairies' happy-go- lucky and ended up running gags with them. =Other characters= *Oboro is a small feline toy with wings that was enchanted by the Bottle Fairies. Oboro is white. It floats gently up and down when it is not being held or played with (usually it plays with Hororo). He is a silent character, and has only one facial expression, the one that it was made with (generally suggested to be bored or exacerbated). *Sensei-san, Bottle Faries' Papa, who is never given a real name, looks after the bottle fairies. He is represented by the colors brown and green. It is given that his character teaches them things about the world, but his appearances in the series are rarely significant. However, a love letter in the third episode is a crucial plotpoint to the third episode. Though his job is never stated, the last episode shows that he is a teaching assistant at a university. Kururu, Chiriri, Sarara, and Hororo also develops a crush on him by the end of the series. : *Tama-chan is the (approximately 5-year-old) next door neighbor of the Bottle Fairies and Sensei-san. In the 12th episode, March, she graduates from first grade. She is represented by the color purple and wears crayons in her hair with a large white ribbon down the back. She is happy to help the Bottle Fairies, who trust her (usually misleading) advice since she seems so self-assured. She occasionally expresses surprise at how childlike the fairies are even though they are supposed to be older than she is. Additionally, she was the mascot of the magazine Magi-Cu. : *Hanana is a plant that appeared in only one episode, and was cared for by the Bottle Fairies. It was enchanted to be immortal and stay in bloom forever, but they removed the spell when they realized Hanana would want to have children and spread around other flowers. Hanana does not have a color. Episode list #April: The fairies try to picture a school entrance ceremony, then animate Oboro-chan. They then try out Hanami. #May: Tama-chan explains several May things: the Golden Week, Kodomo no hi sekku, koinobori, kashiwa mochi, gogatsubyou. #June: Because of a letter sensei received, the fairies explore the highlights of love: confession, marriage, adultery. #July: The gang enjoys summer adventures in the jungle, in the mountain and a pyramid. #August: Swimsuits, the beach, pools, torrent, Matsuri, fireworks. #September: The fairies imagine their school life, with Japanese class, home economics, PE, medical check-up, school trips and graduation. #October: The fairies undertake an autumn themed poetic contest (dead leaves, typhoon, nabe), then a sports contest. #November: The fairies help a flower bloom, then use magic to prevent it from withering. #December: The fairies perform New Year's Eve activities: cleaning and cooking become a drama, K≈çhaku Uta Gassen a historical. #January: First day of the new year, a time for Karuta, Onsen and aerobics. #February: The fairies make chocolate and give it to sensei-san. #March: For Hinamatsuri, the fairies receive a magic star that can turn them into humans. #And then: Merged as one human being, the fairies go to school to bring sensei his bento, joining the excavation, baseball and idol clubs on the occasion. Music The series has one OP, \\"Oshiete Sensei-san\\" composed by Sora Izumikawa, and five variations of the ED. The ED has the same music and melody, but different lyrics for each version. The first four versions are named after the four seasons and are sung by a different Bottle Fairy according to her season. The final version, \\"Four Seasons Song\\", features all four of the Bottle Fairies. All five EDs are used in the anime, the first four playing three episodes each to roughly correspond with the progression of seasons and months and the final song playing in episode 13. Each episode of the anime also features a different ED animation corresponding to the month shown in the episode. Episode 13 shows multiple images to feature not only the fairies but also Sensei-san and Tama. An OST, Bottle Fairy ~Four Seasons~ was released in both Japan and North America. It features image songs, the OP and the EDs, and instrumental music for the entire series.

It peaked at number 18 on the Billboard 200 and number 5 in the UK. The first single from the album, \\"An Honest Mistake\\", was released on February 28, 2005. The UK and Japanese releases of the album contain the bonus track \\"Hot Pursuit\\". The version on the Japanese edition is a different mix, featuring Gillian Conway (keyboardist John Conway's sister) on vocals, along with Sam Endicott. The track \\"Swollen Summer\\" is featured in the PlayStation 2 game, Gran Turismo 4. The Bravery opened up their set with this song at the July 27, 2008 Projekt Revolution concert held in the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia. The song \\"Unconditional\\" is featured in the PlayStation 2 game, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. The song \\"An Honest Mistake\\" is featured in the video games True Crime: New York City and MVP Baseball 2005. Critical reception The Bravery garnered positive reviews from music critics who praised their interpretation of the new wave revival movement. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 24 reviews. Steve Sutherland of Uncut gave high praise to the new wave revivalist production and the band's musicianship resembling that of their inspirations, in terms of vocals and instrumentals, concluding that, \\"This album is already one of the debuts of the year. All hail The Bravery and their new bold dream.\\" MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic praised the band for taking their influences and making them their own with catchability and upbeat optimism, saying that, \\"The Bravery isn't sonically mind-blowing, but the new millennium new wave revival remains intriguing. This New York five-piece makes an interesting effort without it coming off contrived and dishonest.\\" While finding Endicott's vocal delivery mediocre at best, Nicholas Taylor of PopMatters praised the danceable production and devil-may-care lyrics for giving the band a nice platform to start from, concluding with, \\"This debut is certainly promising, and I look forward to seeing whether the Bravery can begin to carve out a more concrete and distinctive image and place for themselves.\\" Robert Christgau graded the album as a \\"dud\\", indicating \\"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\\" Pitchfork writer Adam Moerder criticized the band's unremarkable take on '80s new wave with lacklustre instrumentals and Endicott's vocals sounding too close to Robert Smith and Simon Le Bon. He gave praise to the tracks \\"An Honest Mistake\\" and \\"Tyrant\\" for their intricacies in terms of synth and vocal choices, concluding that \\"Despite these highlights, though, this is still rock made on an assembly line‚Äî predictable, economically efficient, and about as dynamic as a Model T.\\" Track listingBonus tracks= # * \\"Hot Pursuit\\" (Endicott, Conway) ‚Äì 3:07 (UK/Japanese bonus track) #\\"Hey Sunshiney Day\\" (Endicott, Conway) ‚Äì 2:26 (Japanese bonus track) #\\"Unconditional\\" (video) (Japanese bonus track) #\\"An Honest Mistake\\" (video) (Japanese bonus track) Personnel Adapted from the album's liner notes. ;The Bravery *Sam Endicott ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Michael Zakarin ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals *John Conway ‚Äì keyboards, backing vocals *Mike Hindert ‚Äì bass, backing vocals *Anthony Burulcich ‚Äì drums, backing vocals ;Additional musicians *Steven Lourie ‚Äì drums on tracks 1-4 and 6-8 *Joshua Kessler ‚Äì tambourine on track 10 ;Production *Nic Hard ‚Äì mixing *Brian Gardner ‚Äì mastering ;Artwork *Louis Marino ‚Äì art direction References Category:2005 debut albums Category:Island Records albums Category:The Bravery albums ","title":"The Bravery (album)"},{"id":"1615521","text":"Heinrich is a surname of German origin.

From 1947 to 1969 he was the design chief for the Toronto firm John B. Parkin Associates with partner John B. Parkin. At the time it was the largest architectural firm in the Canada. In 1970 he formed his own firm, where he worked until his retirement in 1987. He is credited as one of the leaders in developing the mid-century modern style in Canada. Biography John C. Parkin was born on 24 March 1922 in Sheffield to two parents who were both Parkins, distantly related. His father was a chartered accountant with Parkin and Co., which had been established in the 1880s. In 1939 Parkin entered the University of Manitoba, and graduated in 1944. Upon graduation, he left for Toronto with fellow graduate Harry Seidler. Parkin took a job with the firm Marani and Morris, and Seidler with William Somerville. Shortly after arriving, Parkin met John B. Parkin, who was of no relation. In October 1944, John C. Parkin left Marani and Morris to work with John B. The two Parkins decided to form a partnership, but realized that the younger partner required additional design training. John C. Parkin had been offered several scholarships to Harvard. In January 1946 he left Toronto for Harvard, graduating a year later. In January 1947, John B. Parkin and John C. Parkin officially formed their partnership, called John B. Parkin Associates. The elder Parkin acted as head of the organization, while the younger acted as design chief. In March 1947, John B.'s younger brother, Edmund T. Parkin, joined the firm as a partner. A landscape architect by trade, his responsibility was handling contracts. The new firm modeled its business approach off of that of architect Albert Kahn's firm, with clear divisions of tasks amongst departments. The firm's first offices were located at 96 Bloor Street West, a building they shared with the firm Mathers and Haldenby. After the firm outgrew this space, it moved to 648 Church Street, a converted house. In 1951 they again moved, this time to an office building on 717 Church Street. In 1955 The firm finally settled at an originally-designed office in the new neighbourhood of Don Mills, the office being located at 1500 Don Mills Road. Throughout the 1950s the firm acquired several large commissions including the Salvation Army National Headquarters, a new terminal at the Toronto Airport, and the Don Mills Shopping Centre. By 1960, John B. Parkin Associates had grown to be the largest architectural firm in Canada. In 1969, John B. Parkin moved to Los Angeles to form an American branch of the firm, leaving John C. Parkin in charge of the Toronto office. In 1970, John C. Parkin left to form his own firm, which was called Parkin Partnership. Although unbuilt, the new firm won the 1976 competition for a new building for the National Gallery of Canada. In 1945 Parkin married Jeanne Wormith of Toronto. Wormith was a 1945 graduate of the University of Toronto and also earned a Master of Arts in art history that year from Harvard University. At the time they met, Wormith was working at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario). The Parkins had three children ‚Äì John, Geoffrey, and Jennifer ‚Äì and lived in a home he designed in the Bridal Path neighbourhood of North York. Parkin died on 22 November 1988 in Toronto. Parkin's records are held at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal as the John C. Parkin fonds and at the University of Calgary's Canadian Architectural Archives as the John B.

It is loosely based on the War dance. Fancy dance was considered appropriate to be performed for visitors to reservations and at \\"Wild West\\" shows. But today, fancy dancers can be seen at many powwows across the nation and even the world.  History  Native American dances, the practices of medicine men, and religious ceremonies were banned by White authorities with the promulgation of the ‚ÄúRules for Indian Courts‚Äù on April 10, 1883. As in many oppressed cultures, the ceremonies simply went underground to avoid detection by the authorities.Ellis, 18 Tribes created new dances that could legally be danced in public.Ellis, 19 Kiowa and Comanches created new styles of dance regalia in the 1930s that included long-johns with bells attached to the knee up to the waist, two small arm bustles with white fluff, two bustles with white down, beadwork harnesses, and some feathers, and the roach being tall and usually with fluffs. This regalia would be incorporated into the fancy dance. The fancy dance was developed after 1928, when the Ponca Tribe built their own dance arena in White Eagle, Oklahoma.Ellis, 110-1 Two young Ponca boys are specifically credited with developing the fast-paced dance that the audiences loved. One of the boys was the grandfather of Parrish Williams, a Ponca roadman. The Wild West shows popularized the dance. Gus McDonald (Ponca) was the first World Champion Fancy War Dancer.\\"Fancy Feather Dancing.\\" Powwows.com. (retrieved 22 Sept 2009) The intertribal powwow circuit was established in the early 20th century, spreading across the Southern Plains. The Kiowa held contest powwows as early at 1918. Among Kiowa, fancy dancing was incorporated into the O-ho-mah Society.Ellis, 115 Contest powwows became an important source of income during the Great Depression. Professional fancy dancers of the 1930s included Chester Lefthand (Arapaho), Stephen Mopope (Kiowa), Dennis Rough Face (Ponca), and George \\"Woogie\\" Watchetaker (Comanche).Ellis, 112 In the 1940s, Elmer Sugar Brown added back flips to his fancy dancing and Gus McDonald added both cartwheels and splits. Gombey dancers at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 2001. In the late 1930s, women began fancy dancing, wearing the same regalia as men. By the 1940s, women's fancy dancing was well established. Shalah Rowlen (Sac and Fox) fancy danced with her sisters, wearing bustles, in the early 1940s. Women's fancy dancing declined in the 1950s, but in the 1960s and 1970s, the dance came back as the women's fancy shawl dance.Ellis, 152-3 Despite its name, derived from an African language, the Gombey dancers of Bermuda appear to owe more to Algonquian traditions, thanks to hundreds of Native Americans sent to Bermuda as slaves during the Seventeenth Century. Their modern costume is completely reliant on materials that would have been difficult or impossible to obtain in Bermuda during the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, including the tailfeathers of the Asian peacock that adorn the head dress. Feathers of native birds perhaps once were used to adorn a simpler, but still colourful costume. Their dance was clearly once a war dance, using tomahawk and bow and arrow, and the steps were recognised by Wampanoag dancers after the Wampanoag and Pequots began a series of Reconnection festivals with Bermudians in 2000.In the steps of long-lost kin: Bermudian dancers and the Mashpee Wampanoag connect at Pow Wow. Boston Globe, 7th of July, 2013  Description Young girls fancy shawl dancing at Spokane Powwow Men's fancy dance is flashy, colorful and highly energetic. It requires strength and stamina and is usually performed by younger men and boys. The drum can play a medium war beat, a ruffle, crow hop, and a fast beat. It is always expected that a fancy dancer should do a pose at each end of the beat. Some might do splits or stop in mid-air. Male fancy dancers typically wear brightly colored regalia. Twin feather bustles are one of the hallmarks of modern fancy dance regalia, along with a beaded bodice, leggings or breech cloth and side tabs (most popular), bells just below the knees, Icelandic sheep hair or also known as \\"Goats\\", moccasins, a roach with two feathers (Most wear a roach rocker which rocks the feathers with the dancer's movements), beaded cuffs, beaded headband, and other feathered or beaded accouterments. The regalia often has a fringe of many colors. The old style regalia is making a comeback. The women's fancy shawl dance represents the opening of a cocoon when the butterfly emerges. The shawl is usually the most extravagant piece. The fringed shawls are colorful and flashy, often featuring embroidery or ribbon work. The fringe on the shawl have a movement that coincides with the dancer. The dancers usually wear beaded or appliqued designs, and beaded hairpieces. Chokers, earrings, bracelets, and eagle plumes are usually worn as well. Elaborate moccasins and leggings complete the regalia.\\"Women's Fancy Shawl.\\" Gathering of Nations. (retrieved 22 Sept 2009) The practice of women's fancy shawl dance is far more recent than that of Men's Fancy Dance. It wasn't until fancy dance had existed for several decades that women began to participate.  Competition  The men's fancy dance is one of the most popular contemporary powwow dances. Thus living up to its name, the fancy dance is a highly athletic dance with lots of tricks and movement. As the dancer dances, his regalia moves with the dancer to create the tone of the following of motion. The medium war, ruffle, crow hop, and fast beats are usually mixed together and are usually called mix-up songs or confusion songs. The Fancy Dancer must dance according to the beat and must strike a \\"pose\\" whenever the drum beat stops. Singers can try to trick the dances with unexpected final beats.\\"Men's Fancy Dance.\\" Gathering of Nations. (retrieved 22 Sept 2009) The popularity of fancy dance - sometimes as a competitive sport - has spread, and is now practiced by many Native American tribes (hence the name, \\"Pan-Indian dancing\\").

The latter river joins the Madeira River as a tributary of the Amazon. This city is the capital of the Madre de Dios Region. Nearby are the Man√∫ National Park, Tambopata National Reserve, and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park, which have been established to protect natural resources. These are some of the most pristine primary rain forests in the world. They include several oxbow lakes and clay licks, where hundreds of birds, including macaws, feed on clay. Among the indigenous peoples in this area are the Machiguenga. History Because it was less accessible by major rivers, the department of Madre de Dios was among later ones to be explored during the late-19th-century rubber boom in the Amazonian Basin. Rubber barons active in the department included Peruvian Carlos Ferm√≠n Fitzcarrald of Iquitos, as well as Brazilian and Bolivian interests.Beatriz Huertas Castillo, Indigenous Peoples in Isolation in the Peruvian Amazon: Their Struggle for Survival and Freedom, IWGIA, 2004, p. 92 The workers for tapping rubber brought in endemic European diseases, causing epidemics and high fatalities among the indigenous peoples along the Manu River from 1889 to 1892, as they had never been exposed to these diseases before. Another epidemic occurred in 1896. Fitzcarrald in his exploration found a short passage overland between the Mishagua, a tributary of the Urubamba River, and the Manu River, a tributary of the Madre de Dios River. This land was named as the Isthmus of Fitzcarrald after him. Transporting rubber across it enabled the product to be transferred to ships that could go down the Madre de Dios, connect to the Madeira River, a tributary of the Amazon, and thereby reach Atlantic ports and export markets. He also identified present-day Puerto Maldonado as a strategic location. He died in 1897 when his ship Contamana sank at this point in the river, where Puerto Maldonado was later founded. In 1901, the Peruvian Government created a committee to explore the nation's rainforest. Don Juan Villalta led an expedition along the Tambopata River, departing from Sandia.Sir Clements Markham \\"Exploration of Fluvial Highways in Peru\\", The Geographical Journal (p. 672). Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), 1903. Villata officially founded Puerto Maldonado on 10 July 1902, as a station at the confluence of the Tambopata and the Madre de Dios rivers. He named the port after Faustino Maldonado, of Tarapoto, who had explored the Madre de Dios in 1861 and drowned in the rapids of the Mamor√© River. The Department of Madre de Dios was created by law on 26 December 1912, with Puerto Maldonado as its capital.El departamento de Madre de Dios. History on website of former Congressman Eduardo Salhuana The city was formally recognized in 1985. Climate Puerto Maldonado is in the tropical Amazon Basin. The climate is hot and humid at all times. The average annual temperature is , with the months of August and September being the hottest. Annual rainfall exceeds . The wet season is from October to April. The main part of the town is located on a slightly elevated area that does not normally flood in the wet season. Road travel often becomes impossible during this time. A low water season occurs between June and August. A common phenomenon, known locally as a surazo or friaje, occurs when polar winds blow in from the mountainous south. The temperature drops to as low as for several days. Industry The chief industries in Puerto Maldonado are logging, artisanal small-scale gold mining, Brazil nut collecting, boat building, and eco-tourism. The area is virtually logged out; only one mill remains. The area was exploited for collection of latex (rubber) by tapping trees in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century rubber boom, but South American production was undercut after seeds were smuggled out and rubber plantations were developed in southeast Asia. Rubber collection has long since ended. At least 30,000 gold miners are active in the region around Puerto Maldonado. Tourism and related boat construction are the major sources of income in the early 21st-century economy. Several tourist eco-lodges are located around Puerto Maldonado and in the reserves. Infrastructure The dockside and ferry across the Madre de Dios River.A ferry used to cross the river, linking the main road from Cusco to the towns of San Lorenzo, Iberia and I√±apari. The river ferry has been supplanted by a new bridge (the 750-metre long Continental Bridge, formerly Billinghurst, see below) but it still serves many locals. As the cost of petrol is very high in this area, the main mode of transportation among locals is by motorcycle. Puerto Maldonado is served by the Padre Aldamiz International Airport. =Interoceanic Highway= The Interoceanic Highway or Rodovia do Pacifico highway was built to link the river ports of Brazil with the Pacific coast ports of Peru. The highway was planned to pass through Puerto Maldonado, crossing the Rio Madre de Dios on a viaduct, the Puente Continental or Continental Bridge (formerly the Billinghurst). The bridge suffered delays in construction, which affected its budget and structural deficiencies were reported.Billinghurst: el puente fantasma, Expreso But it was completed and opened by March 2012.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iH5VcfYgYg, (1:15) Peru: The Jungle video, 17 March 2012 In the greater area around Puerto Maldonado, the highway cuts through primary rain forest. Some groups, including the Peruvian NGO Asociaci√≥n Civil Labour, are worried that the road may encourage illegal logging, hunting and settlement in areas that had not been easily reached before. There is potential for conflict with indigenous people who had been quite isolated from the modern world.\\"The Brazil-Peru Inter-Oceanic Highway\\" , Building Informed Civic Engagement for the Conservation of the Andes Amazon (BICECA) ReferencesNotes=External links Puerto Maldonado Travel Info * Tambopata Reserve Society (TReeS) * Puerto Maldonado - 4.49 Gigapixels Category:Populated places in the Madre de Dios Region Category:Regional capital cities in Peru ","title":"Puerto Maldonado"},{"id":"1615549","text":"Simon Wright (born 19 June 1963) is an English drummer best known for his work with rock bands AC/DC and Dio. He started playing drums at the age of 13 and cites Cozy Powell, Tommy Aldridge and John Bonham as his greatest influences. He was also the drummer for Rhino Bucket and Operation: Mindcrime. Career Wright began his career with local band Tora Tora (not to be confused with the American glam metal group), before joining Manchester group A II Z, a new wave of British heavy metal band founded in 1979 in Manchester, England by guitarist Gary Owens. The full line-up consisted of David Owens (vocals), Gary Owens (guitar), Gam Campbell (bass), Karl Reti (drums). They acquired a local following in Manchester, and were signed by Polydor Records, eager to cash in on the exploding NWOBHM boom. A single live album, The Witch of Berkley, followed in 1980. Reti was subsequently replaced by Wright. The band disintegrated and Wright went on to perform in Tytan and recorded on their full-length debut album Rough Justice, however; that band also dissolved shortly before the release of the debut. Wright, just a month shy of turning twenty years old, joined AC/DC after their drummer, Phil Rudd, left in May 1983. AC/DC recorded three albums with Wright in the mid-late 80s; Fly on the Wall, Who Made Who and Blow Up Your Video. Wright left the group in November 1989 to join Dio, and was replaced by Chris Slade. Wright joined Rhino Bucket when he wasn't working with Dio to replace the departed Liam Jason for their third album, 1994's independently released Pain. In 2007, he reunited with the band and is featured on their latest album The Hardest Town. Wright has had two stints with Dio, 1990‚Äì91 and 1998‚Äì2010. With the band he has recorded four studio albums (Lock up the Wolves, Magica, Killing the Dragon and Master of the Moon) and two live albums (Evil or Divine - Live In New York City and Holy Diver - Live). His drumming can be heard on albums by UFO, Michael Schenker Group and John Norum. In 2005, Wright participated on a tribute album to Heavy metal icons Iron Maiden. It was his second of three times doing a tribute disc; the first experience being in 1998 on an AC/DC tribute album titled Thunderbolt, while in 2013 he took part in the DIO Tribute album \\"This Is Your Life\\". In 2006, Wright is credited in the song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" on the album Butchering the Beatles, a heavy metal tribute. In August 2009, Wright teamed up with Joe Lynn Turner, Phil Soussan and Carlos Cavazo as part of the Big Noize project, playing shows in Iraq and Kuwait. On 25 January 2013, it was announced that Wright had joined Geoff Tate's version of Queensr√øche, later known as Operation: Mindcrime, after Tate's dismissal from the band. In 2018, Wright was announced as the drummer of Frontiers Records project called Dream Child with Craig Goldy on guitar. EquipmentDrum kit= Wright is an endorser of DW drums.

They are considered to be a type of diatreme. Volcanic pipes are composed of a deep, narrow cone of solidified magma (described as \\"carrot- shaped\\"), and are usually largely composed of one of two characteristic rock types ‚Äî kimberlite or lamproite. These rocks reflect the composition of the volcanoes' deep magma sources, where the Earth is rich in magnesium. Volcanic pipes are relatively rare. They are well known as the primary source of diamonds, and are mined for this purpose.  Formation  Volcanic pipes form as the result of violent eruptions of deep-origin volcanoes. These volcanoes originate at least three times as deep as most other volcanoes, and the resulting magma that is pushed toward the surface is high in magnesium and volatile compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. As the body of magma rises toward the surface, the volatile compounds transform to gaseous phase as pressure is reduced with decreasing depth. This sudden expansion propels the magma upward at rapid speeds, resulting in a supersonic Plinian eruption. Mount Hypipamee Crater, Atherton Tableland, Queensland, Australia. This residue of a pipe is about across. = Kimberlite pipes = In kimberlite pipes, the eruption ejects a column of overlying material directly over the magma column, and does not form a large above-ground elevation as typical volcanoes do; instead, a low ring of ejecta known as a tuff ring forms around a bowl-shaped depression over the subterranean column of magma. Over time, the tuff ring may erode back into the bowl, leveling out the depression by filling it with washed-back ejecta. Kimberlite pipes are the source of most of the world's commercial diamond production, and also contain other precious gemstones and semi-precious stones, such as garnets, spinels, and peridot. = Lamproite pipes = Lamproite pipes operate similarly to kimberlite pipes, except that the boiling water and volatile compounds contained in the magma act corrosively on the overlying rock, resulting in a broader cone of eviscerated rock (the ejection of this rock also forms a tuff ring, like kimberlite eruptions). This broad cone is then filled with volcanic ash and materials. Finally, the degassed magma is pushed upward, filling the cone. The result is a funnel shaped deposit of volcanic material (both solidified magma, and ejecta) which appears mostly flat from the surface.

It is depicted most often as the home of the Silver Age version of the superhero Green Lantern, Hal Jordan. Ferris Aircraft is one of the largest employers in Coast City.  Fictional history  Coast City, which first appeared in Showcase #22 in September‚ÄìOctober 1959, was a city located in California. This made it one of the few fictional cities in the DC Universe to have a specifically given location from the start. Coast City was usually portrayed as an analogue of Los AngelesComic Vine and San Diego.A Guide to the Fictional Cities of the DC UniverseGreen Lantern: Rebirth identified it as being in Northern California, though recent issues of Green Lantern listed it as being twenty miles from Edwards Air Force Base. = Destruction = In the 1990s, Coast City was destroyed, with nearly all of its residents ‚Äì then numbered at seven million ‚Äì by Mongul. Mongul's gigantic ship appeared over Coast City and released thousands of spherical bombs which detonated simultaneously. It was then revealed that Mongul was doing the bidding of former astronaut Hank Henshaw, better known as the Cyborg Superman. Mongul and Henshaw built Engine City in Coast City's ashes, as part of a plot to turn Earth into the new Warworld, the two intending to strike a double blow against the recently deceased Superman by claiming his world for themselves and framing him as the agent responsible for his planet's destruction.Superman (vol. 2) #80 This plan was stopped by the real Superman after his resurrection, with the help of Superboy, Steel, and Hal Jordan, who had just returned from space to find his home destroyed.Superman (vol. 2) #82 Killed in the blast were numerous supporting characters of the Green Lantern comic books, including Kari Limbo and several Ferris Aircraft employees. Jordan attempted to resurrect the city using his ring and learned that his first girlfriend had also died in the blast, but his ring's power was revoked by the Guardians before he could make it last for more than a few moments. In the near-future, a government time-travel experiment attempted to take the first step to prove their worth by going back in time to prevent Henshaw becoming the Cyborg and destroying Coast City, but Booster Gold was forced to go back in time and stop the renegade time-traveler to preserve the timeline. During his time in the past, Booster saved a little girl who would go on to become his adopted daughter (after Skeets confirmed that history had no record of her death in the city's destruction), as well as his time-lost sister Michelle Carter, but they were unable to save her then-boyfriend as history recorded that he had died in the blast. The city's destruction drove Hal Jordan to become the villain Parallax, due to a mental breakdown from grief, though it was later revealed that he was also under the influence of the yellow emotional entity named Parallax. Jordan slaughtered nearly all the Green Lanterns, absorbed the energies of the Power Battery, and tried to rewrite history. This led to the appointment of a new Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner. A memorial to Coast City's victims was erected on the site of the city with the help of most of the major superheroes of the period. For a time, an alien city named Haven that had crashed on Earth resided on top of the ruins of Coast City. When Hal Jordan died saving the world, the heroes memorialized him. An eternal flame was constructed in the ruins of the city. Swamp Thing used his powers to fill the surrounding area with greenery.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #81 When Hal Jordan from early in his career was pulled into the future during an encounter with Kyle Rayner,Green Lantern Vol. 3 #100 a version of Parallax from when he attempted to restart historyGreen Lantern Vol. 3 #105 attempted to convince his younger self to go along with his plans by taking himself, his younger self and Kyle back to Coast City at the moment of its own destruction, freezing time in the second before the bombs struck. Despite his future self showing him the people who would die when the city was destroyed, the younger Hal refused to go along with Parallax's plan, the two fighting in the frozen city before Kyle convinced them that they both had to return to their own times.Green Lantern Vol. 3 #106 The villain Remnant attempted to depict Superman as a devil by blaming him for the deaths caused in Doomsday's rampage, particularly the fact that so few people acknowledged the others who had died in the rampage in favour of 'focusing' on Superman's resurrection. Superman confronted a reporter writing an article about the anniversary of the rampage, complimenting him on his ability to challenge Superman with hard questions, and asked him to consider one final question: if Superman weren't around, would there be fewer Doomsdays (monsters seeking to confront Superman), or more Coast Cities (disasters that occurred because Superman wasn't available to prevent them)? It was later revealed that Hank Henshaw chose to destroy Coast City to erase his former life on Earth; he and his wife, Terri Henshaw, were previous residents of Coast City.Green Lantern (vol. 4) # 13 = Reconstruction = Coast City was subsequently rebuilt in the wake of Jordan's resurrection. While the Spectre, Hal Jordan, and the Parallax parasite were wrestling for control of the Spectre's powers, all roads, street signs, and Jordan's apartment reappeared. 'Haven' also vanished from the site.Green Lantern Rebirth #3 (2004) Populating the rebuilt city became one of the latest initiatives of Jonathan Vincent Horne, President of the United States. Charities and industries around the world, including Wayne Enterprises, contributed to a fund for rebuilding the city. Despite all those efforts, Coast City remained a ghost town due to its reputation as the site of a mass murder. Among the exceptions was Hal Jordan, who lived in Coast City when he wasn't working at nearby Edwards Air Force Base as one of their test pilots. Hal's nephew attends a school with a student body of fewer than twenty.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #7 The U.S. Navy established a presence in the region, as both a domestic security and economic stimulus measure.Green Lantern (vol. 4) # 4-5 One year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Coast City finished reconstruction. During the Sinestro Corps War, it was targeted for destruction by Sinestro and the terrorist organization that bears his name. Hal Jordan used his ring to contact every citizen, urging them to evacuate the city. En masse, they decided to stay.

Breece Dexter Pancake, June 29, 1952 - April 8, 1979) was an American short story writer. Pancake was a native of West Virginia. Several of his short stories were published in The Atlantic Monthly and other periodicals during his lifetime. Pancake took his own life on Palm Sunday, 1979, at the age of 26. His motives for suicide are still somewhat unclear.  Biography  Breece Dexter Pancake was born in South Charleston, West Virginia, the youngest child of Clarence \\"Wicker\\" Pancake and Helen Frazier Pancake. He was raised in Milton, West Virginia, recognized as the home of handmade Blenko glass. Growing up in Milton, Pancake's best friend was Rick Blenko. Pancake briefly attended West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon before transferring to Marshall University in Huntington, where he completed a bachelor's degree in English education in 1974. After graduating from Marshall he spent time in the western United States, visiting his sister in Santa Fe, New Mexico. As a graduate student, he studied at the University of Virginia's creative writing program under John Casey and James Alan McPherson. Pancake also worked as an English teacher at two Virginia military academies, Fork Union and Staunton. As a student at the University of Virginia, appearances may have led to the belief that Pancake distanced himself from other students, in reality, his demeanor reflected his own complex inner feelings. As Ruel Foster notes in his book review of Douglas's biography of Pancake, A Room Forever: The Life, Work, and Letters of Breece D'J Pancake, \\"Pancake seemed to be trying to exorcise some secret psychic trauma through his writing, and it is clear that the ruins of the broken world portrayed in his fiction come from the broken world of his interior life. \\" He was an avid outdoorsman, who enjoyed hunting, fishing, and camping. Pancake was a devout fan of the music of folk singer Phil Ochs, who had attended Staunton Military Academy,Staunton Hall of Fame where Pancake later taught. The unusual middle name \\"D'J\\" originated when The Atlantic Monthly misprinted his middle initials (D.J., for Dexter John) in the byline of Trilobites, a short story the magazine published in 1977. Pancake decided not to correct it. West Virginia Wesleyan College Dexter was Pancake's middle name; he took the name John after converting to Catholicism in his mid-20s. Pancake died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was buried in Milton, West Virginia. According to Foster, \\"One cannot consider Pancake's work without probing his tragic death. Douglass points out that, in hindsight, there were many indications of Pancake's suicidal longings,\\" such as the act of giving away many personal items, including his guns, with the exception of the Savage over-under shotgun he used to commit suicide. Pancake's papers are held at the West Virginia & Regional History Center, the West Virginia University Libraries at West Virginia University and the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.  Writing  Pancake published six short stories in his lifetime, mostly in The Atlantic. These stories and six more that had not been published at the time of his death were collected in The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake (1983). The volume was reprinted in 2002 with a new afterword by Andre Dubus III. His vivid, compact style has been compared to that of Ernest Hemingway. Most of his stories are set in rural West Virginia and revolve around characters and naturalistic settings, often adapted from his own past. His stories received acclaim from readers and critics. The Atlantic's editor recalled receiving letters that \\"drifted in for months - asking for more stories - inquiring for collected stories, or simply expressing admiration and gratitude ... in 30-something years at The Atlantic, I cannot recall a response to a new author like the response to this one.\\"Transcripts of a Troubled Mind Murphy says, \\"Pancake has become a semi-mythical figure of American Literature, a hillbilly Hemingway for those few - heavy on writers and academicians - who do know him. Parts of the myth he created for himself through the way he lived his life and the foggy circumstances surrounding his death. The rest of the myth we've created ourselves around the legacy of his extraordinary writing.\\" According to Foster, \\"All of Pancake's stories have a dreamlike quality--they don't explain themselves and they are never unequivocal; readers must make their own interpretations. His canvas is littered with the old broken-down autos, the detritus of an industrial age-all symbols of blight and sterility.\\" Among the writers who claim Pancake as a strong influence are Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club and Andre Dubus III, author of House of Sand and Fog. After Pancake's death, author Kurt Vonnegut wrote in a letter to John Casey, \\"I give you my word of honor that he is merely the best writer, the most sincere writer I've ever read. What I suspect is that it hurt too much, was no fun at all to be that good. You and I will never know.\\" The song \\"River Towns\\", from Dire Straits' frontman Mark Knopfler's 2015 studio album Tracker, was inspired by Pancake's \\"A Room Forever\\", the story of a tugboat mate spending New Year's Eve in an eight-dollar-a-night hotel room where he drinks cheap whiskey out of the bottle and eventually ends up with a teen-aged prostitute.

The Great Seal of Scotland () allows the monarch to authorise official documents without having to sign each document individually. Wax is melted in a metal mould or matrix and impressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes to make official. The earliest seal impression, in the Treasury of Durham Cathedral, is believed to be the Great Seal of Duncan II and dates to 1094. History The chancellor had the custody of the King's Seal. See list for years AD1057-1794, pp. 78‚Äì82 in \\"A political index to the histories of Great Britain and Ireland\\" by Robert Beatson: https://archive.org/stream/apoliticalindex02beatgoog#page/n88/mode/2up Strictly, the continuation of the Great Seal of Scotland was guaranteed by the Treaty of Union which provided that \\"a Seal in Scotland after the Union be alwayes kept and made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually passed the Great Seal of Scotland, and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that Kingdom\\". Hence, the Scotland Act 1998 refers to the current seal as \\"the seal appointed by the Treaty of Union to be kept and made use of in place of the Great Seal of Scotland\\". Nevertheless, the seal is still commonly referred to as the Great Seal of Scotland. Section 12 of the Treason Act 1708, still in force today, makes it treason in Scotland to counterfeit the seal. The design of the Great Seal is a responsibility of the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The reverse of the seal shows the monarch on horseback, but is not changed from reign to reign‚Äîthe current version is that engraved in 1911 for the accession of King George V. The obverse is inscribed \\"ELIZABETH II D G BRITT REGNORVMQVE SVORVM CETER REGINA CONSORTIONIS POPULORUM PRINCEPS F D\\" and the figure on it is the same as on the Great Seal of the United Kingdom.The inscription is abbreviated Latin for \\"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the Britains and of Her Other Kingdoms Queen, Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, Defender of the Faith\\". See Great Seal of the Realm. The Great Seal is administered by the keeper of the Great Seal, one of the Great Officers of State. From 1885 this office was held by the secretary for Scotland, later the Secretary of State for Scotland. It transferred in 1999 to the first minister of Scotland,Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7) whose place in the order of precedence in Scotland is determined by his or her office as keeper of the Great Seal.

It is measured from . The station serves the localities of Lower Sydenham and Southend. Served and managed by Southeastern, it is on the Hayes Line as part of its Metro routes. HistoryEarly years (1857-1922)= The Mid Kent line was built by the Mid-Kent and North Kent Junction Railway (MK&NKJR;) and was opened on 1 January 1857 as far as Beckenham Junction (although it was not technically a junction as the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway‚Äôs line did not open until 3 May 1858). From opening the line was worked by the South Eastern Railway (SER). On opening Lower Sydenham was provided with a small goods yard. Seven years later the MK&NKJR; built an extension from a new junction station at New Beckenham to Croydon (Addiscombe Road) which again was operated by the SER. In 1878 a connection was added a quarter mile north of the station to serve the Crystal Palace District Gas Company (which had been established on the site in 1854). Almost all services from the station have terminated at Charing Cross or Cannon Street stations but between 1880 and 1884 a service worked between Croydon (Addiscombe Road) calling all stations to New Cross and then via a connection to the East London Line and terminating at Liverpool Street station. In the 1890s housing developed to the north and west of the station. In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and its bitter rivals the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and Lower Sydenham became an SECR station. In 1906 the station was moved half a mile south in an effort to develop a new area for housing. By 1912 the gasworks were now owned by the South Suburban Gas Company and had three steam locomotives operating on three miles of track. =Southern Railway (1923-1947)= Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), Lower Sydenham became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923. The Mid-Kent line was electrified with the (750 V DC third rail) system and electric services commenced on 28 February 1926. Early electric services were worked by early Southern Railway 3-car Electric Multiple Unit trains often built from old SECR carriages. Electrification saw more houses built in the Lower Sydenham area which also picked up some passengers from the large London County Council estate at Bellingham. =British Railways (1948-1994)= After World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of British Railways Southern Region. In the 1950s the line was still busy with freight traffic with four early morning seaborne coal trains routed from Erith to Brockley Lane (reverse) and then to the gas works. In addition there were trains from Bricklayers Arms that served the various goods yards (including Lower Sydenham) along the line. The goods yard closed to general traffic on 28 December 1964 and to coal on 25 March 1968. The change from coal generated gas to North Sea gas saw rail traffic to the gas works cease on 22 April 1969 with the connection being removed as part of the 1971 re- signalling. Colour light signalling was introduced between Ladywell and New Beckenham on 4 April 1971 with signalling being controlled by the signal box at New Beckenham. The original SER signal box closed as a result. In 1972 the timber structure was replaced by a modern ‚ÄúCLASP‚Äù type structure. On 28 September 1975 the control of the signalling was transferred to London Bridge signalling centre. Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; and London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area. The station building was burned down in 1989 and a newer structure was provided by Network South East in 1991. =The privatisation era (1994-Present Day)= Following privatisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure at Lower Sydenham station became the responsibility of Railtrack whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011. Following a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to Network Rail on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.Network Rail closer to Railtrack takeover BBC News, 1 April 2016 On 27 June 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself.Basher Bowker pulls the plug on Connex The Telegraph 29 June 2003 Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003 with the services transferring to the Strategic Rail Authority's South Eastern Trains subsidiary the following day. On 30 November 2005 the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006.  Services  The typical Monday to Saturday off-peak train service per hour is: * 2 northbound, calling at all stations to London Cannon Street * 2 northbound, calling at all stations to Ladywell then fast to Waterloo East and London Charing Cross * 4 southbound, calling at all stations to Hayes On Sundays this is reduced to: * 2 northbound, calling at all stations to London Cannon Street * 2 southbound, calling at all stations to Hayes Layout The station has step free access to both platforms with entrances on both sides however, the footbridges have no lifts. Lower Sydenham has two footbridges while platform 1 has a ticket office and a ticket machine. Both platform have brick built shelters and the platforms can fit 10 carriage trains. The station main building was rebuilt in the 1990s following an arson attack. Connections London Buses route 352 serves the station.

Scott and Joanne Woodward. Sometimes mistakenly described as a Broadway play, it never in fact opened in the United States. It was directed in London by Joan Littlewood in 1961, but Goldman believed he \\"never got the play right\\" and forbade further productions or publication of the script. To coincide with the film's release, he authorized an illustrated paperback tie-in edition of the screenplay, published by Lancer Books. The film's title was later adopted as the name of a popular music group. Plot summary Joanne Woodward and George C. Scott Justin Playfair (Scott) is a judge who retreats into fantasy after his wife's death, imagining himself to be Sherlock Holmes, the legendary fictional detective. Complete with deerstalker hat, pipe and violin, he spends his days in a homemade criminal laboratory obsessing over plots hatched by his (Holmes's) archenemy, Professor Moriarty. When his brother (Lester Rawlins) tries to place Justin under observation in a mental institution so he can get power of attorney, Justin attracts the attention of Dr. Mildred Watson (Woodward), a psychiatrist who becomes fascinated by his case. Justin demonstrates to her a knack for what Holmes describes as \\"deduction\\" (technically better categorized as abductive reasoning) and walks out of the institution during the ensuing confusion. Intrigued, Watson comes to his home to attempt treatment. Playfair is initially dismissive of Watson's attempts to psychoanalyze him and he analyzes her instead, but when he hears her name, he enthusiastically incorporates her into his life as Doctor Watson, the sidekick to his Holmes. The duo begin an enigmatic quest for Moriarty, with Playfair/Holmes following all manner of bizarre and (to Watson) unintelligible clues, and encountering a rich tapestry of individualistic persons in assorted urban situations, the two growing closer to each other in the process.

Scott as Justin * Joanne Woodward as Watson * Jack Gilford as Peabody * Lester Rawlins as Blevins * Al Lewis as Messenger * Rue McClanahan as Daisy * Ron Weyand as Dr. Strauss * Oliver Clark as Mr. Small * Kitty Winn as Grace Defining quote The title is an indirect reference to Don Quixote's famous exploit of tilting at windmills, believing them to be \\"monstrous giants\\". Despite the protest of his aide Sancho Panza and being soundly defeated at the hands of the \\"giants\\" (that is, being tossed away by a mill's sail after getting his lance caught in it), Quixote maintains his belief that the mills are not buildings but giants. In reference to this, Playfair argues: > Of course, he carried it a bit too far. He thought that every windmill was a > giant. That's insane. But, thinking that they might be... Well, all the best > minds used to think the world was flat. But, what if it isn't? It might be > round. And bread mold might be medicine. If we never looked at things and > thought of what they might be, why, we'd all still be out there in the tall > grass with the apes. Critical views The film opened to mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a mushy movie with occasional, isolated moments of legitimate comedy.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating 73% based on reviews from 11 critics.

It is the seat of the Municipality of Ljutomer. Traditionally it was part of the region of Styria. It is now included in the Mura Statistical Region.Ljutomer municipal site The economy of Ljutomer is largely based on grape farming and wine making. Name Ljutomer was attested in written records in 1211 as Lvtenwerde (and as L≈Øtenwerde in 1242, Lvtenberch in 1249, Lutenberg in 1269, Luetemberg in 1380, and Lutemberg in 1440). The names with -berg referred to the town itself, and those with -werd to the wider area. Until the early 19th century, the only Slovene name for the town was Lotmerk, borrowed from German.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 376. The modern Slovene name was first coined by Stanko Vraz in a letter from 1838, in which he wrote \\"do Ljutmera\\" ('to Ljutomer').Fran Ile≈°iƒá. 1922. \\"Matibor in Ljutomer.\\" ƒåasopis za zgodovino in narodopisje 17(2):76‚Äì89, p. 87. This and other variations were created by adherents of the Illyrian movement, with Ljutomer becoming established circa 1858, under the mistaken idea that the town's name was derived from that of a Slavic tribe known as the *L'utomƒõri≈•i. The German name Lut(t)enberg was the first attested, although it is not known whether this is based on a Slavic borrowing or is purely Germanic. Locally, the town is known as Lotmerg, or more recently Lotmerk as a secondary form.Ile≈°iƒá, Fran. 1922. Maribor in Ljutomer. ƒåasopis za zgodovino in narodopisje 71(2): 76‚Äì89, p. 86. History Ljutomer lies at the heart of the Prlekija region. It was first mentioned as a settlement in written documents dating back to 1242. In 1265 it was granted market rights. It was devastated by the plague and numerous fires, and it also had to defend itself against Ottoman and Hungarian raids. The first mass rally (tabor) in support of a United Slovenia took place in Ljutomer in 1868. Before 1918, the town had a substantial German-speaking minority: in 1910, 46% of the inhabitants of the town were German speakers.http://www.ff.uni- lj.si/oddelki/Zgodovin/Repertoriji/stajerska%201910.pdf The surroundings, on the other hand, were almost exclusively Slovene-speaking. Ljutomer was given town status in 1927. The tradition of the Slovenian national awakening of the 19th century is continued by the town library, town museum, and the art gallery. =Mass grave= After the Second World War, Yugoslav military police (KNOJ) and secret police (OZNA) murdered 9 to 12 wealthy citizens of Ljutomer and disposed of their bodies in the Babji Lo≈æiƒç Mass Grave ().

Biography His mother died in childbirth, so he was raised and educated by his grandparents and his father, , a politician who served two terms as Mayor of Limoges. He received his first drawing lessons from his grandfather, Jean-Jacques Maquart, and was enrolled at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Appliqu√©s √† l'Industrie in 1877. In 1884, he married his first cousin, Marie-France Rousseau and, for a time, studied at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts D√©coratifs, before transferring to the Acad√©mie Julian, where he studied with Tony Robert-Fleury from 1886 to 1891. In 1888, he became one of the five founding members of \\"Les Nabis\\", a group that played a large role in the transition from Impressionism to the various styles of Modern art. His fellow founders were Paul S√©rusier, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Pierre Bonnard, and Maurice Denis. In 1891, he participated in the Symbolist performances at the Th√©√¢tre d'Art, where the poet, Paul Fort, was organizing shows to benefit his fellow poet, Paul Verlaine, and Paul Gauguin. In 1892, he directed a performance of Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry at the Th√©√¢tre des Pantins. He also participated in group exhibitions organized by Le Barc de Boutteville, held from 1891 to 1895, as well as at the and the Salon de la Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels after 1894. That same year, he was able to indulge his life-long interest in puppetry by opening a theater, with puppets made by Georges Lacombe. He encountered some difficulties not long after, however, when the death of his stepfather, Charles Rousseau, forced him and Marie to support their own apartment. His interest in Theosophy, magic and occultism came to set him apart from his fellow Nabis. In 1898, Marie's pregnancy brought more difficulties, as he resented losing his favorite model and frequent collaborator to the duties of motherhood. After 1899, his health began to deteriorate and his paintings changed; coming to focus on mythology, witchcraft and anti-clerical subjects. In 1908, seeing him faced with serious physical and financial problems, his friends in Les Nabis created the Acad√©mie Ranson, and entrusted him with its management. Marie took over after his death and it survived, in various forms, until 1955. He died of typhoid fever in 1909 and was buried in Limoges.

It is named after the 17th-century Welsh privateer of the Caribbean, Sir Henry Morgan. Since 2017, the label has used the slogan \\"Live like the Captain\\". History In 1944, the Seagram Company, based in Canada, started producing rum under the name Captain Morgan Rum Company. Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman purchased a distillery named Long Pond from the Jamaican government. Among the buyers of raw rum from the Long Pond distillery was a Kingston pharmacy named Levy Brothers. The Levy family had been purchasing raw rum, adding medicinal herbs and spices, ageing, and bottling it. Bronfman liked the rum product and bought the rights to it. In the 1950s the governments of both the United States and its Puerto Rico commonwealth territory instituted a number of job creation programs in Puerto Rico. Taxes on rum entering the contiguous 48 states from Puerto Rico were made lower than those on rum coming from foreign countries. At this time both Seagram and the Bacardi family built large new plants near San Juan. In 1985, Seagram sold its rum distillery and manufacturing facilities in Camuy and Arecibo‚Äîand doing business as Puerto Rican Destillers‚Äîto Destiler√≠a Serrall√©s, a Puerto Rican concern that had been producing the Don Q brand in Puerto Rico since 1865. As part of the contract Seagram also licensed to Serralles the rights to produce and distribute the \\"Captain Morgan\\" brand in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean until 2012. In 2001, Seagram sold the \\"Captain Morgan\\" brand to Diageo. Diageo made an announcement on 24 June 2008, that it would build and operate a new rum distillery on St. Croix, Virgin Islands beginning in 2010 and source from it beginning at the end of their supply contract in 2012. An actor portraying Captain Morgan at the 2007 Scream Awards. The event was sponsored by Diageo. An Original Spiced Gold bottle In 1984, Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum was introduced to the United States. Captain Morgan was, by volume, the second largest brand of spirits in the United States, and the seventh largest worldwide in 2007. , 7.6 million 9-litre cases were sold. Most Captain Morgan rum is sold in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, South Africa, and Global Travel.\\"Captain Morgan\\" Diageo. 9 August 2008 In November 2009, the NFL banned a covert ad campaign allegedly put on by Diageo. It was understood that for each NFL player striking the \\"Captain Morgan\\" pose on camera during a regular season game, Diageo would donate $10,000 to the Gridiron Greats (a non-profit which helps retired NFL players with various hardships after leaving the game). The league made this announcement following such a celebration by Brent Celek of the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2010 two American territories, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands bickered over plans for Captain Morgan to move operations to the Virgin Islands for tax reasons. The matter came to a head during a debate in the United States Congress over the USVI's attempt to use tax benefits to lure the company to that territory. In 2011, to bring it into line with the international version, Morgan's Spiced in the UK was rebranded as Captain Morgan's Spiced. This was accompanied by a large media campaign and parties hosted around the UK in clubs and bars to advertise the new rum. The \\"Captain Morgan\\" mascot was introduced along with \\"Morganettes\\". In 2014, Diageo Canada filed a trade dress infringement lawsuit against Heaven Hill Distilleries Inc, claiming striking similarities between the Captain Morgan character and Admiral Nelson, and that the similarity would dilute the Captain Morgan trademark. Diageo Canada won the lawsuit in 2017. The likeness of the Captain Morgan character was created by award-winning artist Don Maitz. In 2020, the brand launch a new product called Captain Morgan Tiki. This new pineapple mango flavors rum is available in UK, Czech Republic and Germany. Distillation process Captain Morgan's Rum is distilled from sugar cane. The combination of the type of yeasts employed for fermentation, distillation method, ageing conditions, and blending determines the characteristic flavour of rum. Made with molasses, water, mash and yeast, Captain Morgan Original Spiced rum is distilled in a continuous still. Once distilled, the clear spirit is aged in oak barrels for up to a year, adding a golden colour and character to the rum before the flavours and spices are added. The brand's taste is achieved through a proprietary recipe, which is blended into the rum mixture at the final stages of production, making use of spices indigenous to the Caribbean Islands.

The term is commonly applied to a type of saw used in construction and demolition work. This type of saw, also known as a hognose or recip saw, has a large blade resembling that of a jigsaw and a handle oriented to allow the saw to be used comfortably on vertical surfaces. The typical design of this saw has a foot at the base of the blade, similar to that of a jigsaw. The user holds or rests this foot on the surface being cut so that the tendency of the blade to push away from or pull towards the cut as the blade travels through its movement can be countered.  Design  Designs range widely in power, speed, and features, from less powerful portable, handheld models that are usually shaped like a cordless drill, to high-power, high-speed, corded models designed for heavy construction and demolition work. Modern reciprocating saws almost all have variable speed, either through trigger sensitivity or through a dial. Another feature that has become important to the way these saws are used is the inclusion of an orbital action. This action consists of oscillating the traversed reciprocation in up and down fashion (perpendicular to the motion of cut) causing the tip of the blade to move in an oval pattern, up and down as well as back and forth. This feature is primarily for wood, allowing quick cuts. A reciprocating saw is a popular tool used by many window fitters, construction workers and emergency rescue services. Variants and accessories are available for specialized uses, such as clamps and long blades for cutting large pipe. Blades are available for a variety of materials and uses. Common types include metal cutting blades, wood cutting blades, blades for composites, for drywall, and other materials. Many of these blade types have a variety of tooth designs intended for special purposes, such as tree-limb cutting, demolition work, clean cutting, or contaminated materials. Abrasive coated blades are also available for hard materials like tile and stone. The term reciprocating saw (also oscillating saw) is also applied generically to any saw which cuts with a back and forth motion. These include: * Jigsaw * Scroll saw * Sabre saw * Rotary reciprocating saw Powered reciprocating tools are also found in surgery and dental surgery, where they are used in operations that require cutting or grinding of bone.  Mechanism  Operation of reciprocating saw swashplate mechanism The reciprocating action may be produced in several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, a swashplate type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants of all of these mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.

After a brief term as the Deputy Dean for Academic and Research Initiatives in the Division of the Humanities,https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/news/2012/06/06/dean-announces- two-new-deputy-dean-positions/ Brown was recruited to be the new Deputy Provost for the Arts in 2014. As Deputy Provost, Brown oversees the programming and future of UChicago Arts, serves on the Arts Steering Committee, and chairs the UChicago Art Institutions subcommittee. He also serves on a number of other committees across campus - including the Executive Committee of the Karla Scherer Center for the Study of American Culture - and is the principal investigator for the Object Cultures Project at The Chicago Center for Contemporary Theory (3CT). He has co-edited the University of Chicago's peer-reviewed literary journal, Critical Inquiry, since 1993. Professor Brown's work focuses on American literature, with his second book, A Sense of Things, looking at the representation of objects in 19th-century American literature. His interests have since progressed to modernism. He also has a long-standing interest in popular culture, and has written about Toy Story and Westerns, among other facets of American life. His major theoretical work, however, is on Thing theory, which borrows from Heidegger's object/thing distinction to look at the role of objects that have become manifest in a way that sets them apart from the world in which they exist. He edited a special issue of Critical Inquiry on this subject, which won the CELJ award for Best Special Issue of an academic journal in 2002. His essay, \\"The Dark Wood of Postmodernity: Space, Faith, Allegory,\\" which treats religious themes in the work of Marxian cultural theorist Frederic Jameson and in postmodern culture generally, was awarded the Modern Language Association's William Riley Parker Prize in 2005.

It borrows from Heidegger's distinction between objects and things, which posits that an object becomes a thing when it can no longer serve its common function. When an object breaks down or is misused, it sheds its socially encoded value and becomes present to us in new ways through the suspension of habit. The theory was largely created by Bill Brown, who edited a special issue of Critical Inquiry on it in 2001 and published a monograph on the subject entitled A Sense of Things.Brown, B.

The > story of objects asserting themselves as things, then, is the story of a > changed relationship to the human subject and thus the story of how the > thing really names less an object than a particular subject-object relation. > As they circulate through our lives, we look through objects (to see what > they disclose about history, society, nature, or culture - above all, what > they disclose about us), but we only catch a glimpse of things.  Applications of thing theory  Thing theory is particularly well suited to the study of modernism, due to the materialist preoccupations of modernist poets such as William Carlos Williams, who declared that there should be \\"No ideas but in things\\" or T. S. Eliot's idea of the objective correlative. Thing theory has also found a home in the study of contemporary Maker culture, which applies Brown's aesthetic theories to material practices of misuse.Malewitz, R. (2014) Recent critics have also applied Thing Theory to hoarding practices.Falkoff, R.  Criticism  Critics including Severin Fowles of Columbia University and architect Thom Moran at the University of Michigan have begun to organize classes on \\"Thing Theory\\" in relation to literature and culture. Fowles describes a blind spot in Thing Theory, which he attributes to a post-human, post-colonialist attention to physical presence. It fails to address the influence of \\"non-things, negative spaces, lost or forsaken objects, voids or gaps ‚Äì absences, in other words, that also stand before us as entity-like presences with which we must contend.\\" For example, Fowles explains how a human subject is required to understand the difference between a set of keys and a missing set of keys, yet this anthropocentric awareness is absent from Thing Theory.

He received his B.A. in English from the University of Chicago in 1959 and his Ph.D. in English and American Literature from Stanford University in 1963. He has taught at the University of New Mexico, Northwestern University, the University of California at Irvine and at Berkeley, as well as Ohio State University, Washington University, and the University of Chicago. He has been teaching at the University of Illinois at Chicago since 2000. Work Graff's earlier works emphasized literature's rational, discursive qualities, and in Literature Against Itself (1979) he took aim at what he saw as the anti-mimetic, irrationalist assumptions underlying both avant-garde writing and structuralist/poststructuralist critical theory. Graff's emphasis on literature as rational statement bears comparison with the theories of Yvor Winters, his professor at Stanford in the 1960s. Graff's later research has a heavy focus on pedagogy. He has discussed things like his own dislike of books at an early age and the way in which academic discourse is needlessly obscure. Graff is also the founder of Teachers for a Democratic Culture, an organization dedicated, in their words, to \\"combating conservative misrepresentations\\" of college pedagogy. Graff coined the term \\"teach the controversy\\" in his college courses in the 1980s and later set the idea in print in his 1993 book Beyond The Culture Wars. Graff's thesis was that college instructors should teach the conflicts around academic issues so that students may understand how knowledge becomes established and eventually accepted. The term \\"teach the controversy\\" has since become better known after having been appropriated in a different form as the \\"teach the controversy\\" movement by individuals seeking to legitimize the teaching of creationism and intelligent design in classrooms. A self- described liberal secularist, Graff has publicly lamented what he considers the misappropriation of his idea for unscholarly purposes.To Debate or Not to Debate Intelligent Design? :: Inside Higher Ed :: Higher Education's Source for News, and Views and Jobs Graff teaches both graduate courses on teaching undergraduate writing and undergraduate writing courses. He teaches writing courses with his wife, Cathy Birkenstein, who is a lecturer in English and received her Ph.D. in American literature and is currently working on a biography of Booker T. Washington. She created the templates that make up They Say/I Say, a composition textbook that gives students templates to use in their academic writing. Also, while at the University of Chicago, Graff co- founded the Master of Arts Program in the Humanities (MAPH), a one-year interdisciplinary program, allowing students to take courses in philosophy, English, art history, and other fields.

Reinhold Neibuhr and Stoicism\\" in The Journal of Religious Ethics. They appeared in an article by Fish in 1976 entitled \\"Interpreting the Variorum\\".Stanley Fish, Is There A Text in This Class, Harvard U. Press, (1980), 147‚Äì174 Fish's theory states that a text does not have meaning outside of a set of cultural assumptions regarding both what the characters mean and how they should be interpreted. This cultural context often includes authorial intent, though it is not limited to it. Fish claims that we as individuals interpret texts because each of us is part of an interpretive community that gives us a particular way of reading a text. Furthermore, he claims, we cannot know whether someone is a part of our interpretive community or not, because any act of communication that we could engage in to tell whether we are part of the same interpretive community would have to be interpreted. That is, because we cannot escape our interpretive community, we can never really know its limits. The idea has been very influential in reader-response criticism, though it has also been very controversial. It is often interpreted as a relativistic standpoint that \\"words have no meaning,\\" though this is not what Fish means. Quite the contrary, Fish is a staunch advocate of his own readings of various texts. Rather, he means to point out that readings of a text are culturally constructed.

The conversation about affect theory has been taken up in psychology, psychoanalysis, neuroscience, medicine, interpersonal communication, literary theory, critical theory, media studies, and gender studies, among other fields. Hence, affect theory is defined in different ways, depending on the discipline. Affect theory is originally attributed to the psychologist Silvan Tomkins, which he introduced in the first two volumes of his book Affect Imagery Consciousness (1962). Tomkins uses the concept of affect to refer to the \\"biological portion of emotion,\\" defined as the \\"hard- wired, preprogrammed, genetically transmitted mechanisms that exist in each of us,\\" which, when triggered, precipitate a \\"known pattern of biological events\\". However, it is also acknowledged that, in adults, the affective experience is a result of interactions between the innate mechanism and a \\"complex matrix of nested and interacting ideo-affective formations.\\" Affect theory in psychology Silvan Tomkins's nine affects = : See also: Affect (psychology) According to the psychologist Silvan Tomkins, there are nine primary affects. Tomkins characterized affects by low/high intensity labels and by their physiological expression: Positive: * Enjoyment/Joy (reaction to success/impulse to share) ‚Äì smiling, lips wide and out * Interest/Excitement (reaction to new situation/impulse to attend) ‚Äì eyebrows down, eyes tracking, eyes looking, closer listening Neutral: * Surprise/Startle (reaction to sudden change/resets impulses) ‚Äì eyebrows up, eyes blinking Negative: * Anger/Rage (reaction to threat/impulse to attack) ‚Äì frowning, a clenched jaw, a red face * Disgust (reaction to bad taste/impulse to discard) ‚Äì the lower lip raised and protruded, head forward and down * Dissmell (reaction to bad smell/impulse to avoid ‚Äì similar to distaste) ‚Äì upper lip raised, head pulled back * Distress/Anguish (reaction to loss/impulse to mourn) ‚Äì crying, rhythmic sobbing, arched eyebrows, mouth lowered * Fear/Terror (reaction to danger/impulse to run or hide) ‚Äì a frozen stare, a pale face, coldness, sweat, erect hair * Shame/Humiliation (reaction to failure/impulse to review behaviour) ‚Äì eyes lowered, the head down and averted, blushing =Prescriptive applications= According to Tomkins, optimal mental health involves maximizing positive affects and minimizing negative affects. Affect should also be properly expressed so to make the identification of affect possible to others. Affect theory is also used prescriptively in investigations about intimacy and intimate relationships. Kelly describes relationships as agreements to work collaboratively toward maximizing positive affect and minimizing negative affect. Like the \\"optimal mental health\\" blueprint, this blueprint requires that members of the relationship express affect to one another in order to identify progress. These blueprints can also describe natural and implicit goals. For example, Donald Nathanson uses the \\"affect\\" to create a narrative for one of his patients: > I suspect that the reason he refuses to watch movies is the sturdy fear of > enmeshment in the affect depicted on the screen; the affect mutualization > for which most of us frequent the movie theater is only another source of > discomfort for him. ... His refusal to risk the range of positive and > negative affect associated with sexuality robs any possible relationship of > one of its best opportunities to work on the first two rules of either the > Kelly or the Tomkins blueprint. Thus, his problems with intimacy may be > understood in one aspect as an overly substantial empathic wall, and in > another aspect as a purely internal problem with the expression and > management of his own affect. Tomkins claims that \\"Christianity became a powerful universal religion in part because of its more general solution to the problem of anger, violence, and suffering versus love, enjoyment, and peace.\\". Affect theory is also referenced heavily in Tomkins's script theory. =Attempts to typify affects in psychology= Humor is a subject of debate in affect theory. In studies of humor's physiological manifestations, humor provokes highly characteristic facial expressions. Some research has shown evidence that humor may be a response to a conflict between negative and positive affects, such as fear and enjoyment, which results in spasmodic contractions of parts of the body, mainly in the stomach and diaphragm area, as well as contractions in the upper cheek muscles. Further affects that seem to be missing for Tomkins's taxonomy include relief, resignation, and confusion, among many others. The affect joy is observed through the display of smiling. These affects can be identified through immediate facial reactions that people have to a stimulus, typically well before they could process any real response to the stimulus. The findings from a study on negative affect arousal and white noise by Stanley S. Seidner \\"support the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other Spanish ethnic origins\\". Critical theory :See also: Affect (philosophy) Affect theory is explored in philosophy, psychoanalytic theory, gender studies, and art theory. Eve Sedgwick and Lauren Berlant have been called \\"affect theorists\\" who write from critical theory perspectives. Many other critical theorists have relied heavily on affect theory, including Elizabeth Povinelli. Affect theory is drawn from by Marxist autonomists including Franco Berardi, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. And by Marxist feminists including Selma James and Silvia Federici, who consider the cognitive and material manifestations of particularized gendered, performed roles including caregiving. Critical theorist Sara Ahmed describes affect as \\"sticky\\" in her essay \\"Happy Objects\\" to explain the sustained connection between \\"ideas, values, and objects.\\"  Interpersonal communication  This nonverbal mode of conveying feelings and influence is held to play a central role in intimate relationships. The Emotional Safety model of couples therapy seeks to identify the affective messages that occur within the couple's emotional relationship (the partners' feelings about themselves, each other, and their relationship); most importantly, messages regarding (a) the security of the attachment and (b) how each individual is valued. One practical application of affect theory has been its incorporation into couples therapy.Catherall, Don R. (2007). Emotional Safety: Viewing Couples Through the Lens of Affect. New York: Routledge, Kelly, Vernon C. (2012). The Art of Intimacy and the Hidden Challenge of Shame. Rockland, Maine: Maine Authors Publishing. Two characteristics of affects have powerful implications for intimate relationships: #According to Tomkins, a central characteristic of affects is affective resonance, which refers to a person's tendency to resonate and experience the same affect in response to viewing a display of that affect by another person, sometimes thought to be \\"contagion\\". Affective resonance is considered to be the original basis for all human communication (before there were words, there was a smile and a nod). #Also according to Tomkins, affects provide a sense of urgency to the less powerful drives. Thus, affects are powerful sources of motivation. In Tomkins' words, affects make good things better and bad things worse.  Criticism  Some scholars have taken issue with the claims and methodologies of affect theorists. Ruth Leys has objected to affect theory's implications for artistic and literary criticism, as well as to its appropriation in some forms of trauma theory. Aubrey Anable has also criticised affect theory for its imprecision, claiming that its \\"language of intensity, becoming, and in-betweenness and its emphasis on the unpresentable give it a maddening incoherence, or shade too easily into purely subjective responses to the world\\".

It followed the Swedish-Norwegian War due to Norway's claim to sovereignty. It also became the de facto peace agreement and formed the basis for the personal union between Sweden and Norway that was established when the Norwegian Storting (Parliament) elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway on 4 November 1814. The Union lasted until Norway declared its dissolution in 1905.  Background  In 1814, Denmark‚ÄìNorway was on the losing side in the Napoleonic wars. Under the Treaty of Kiel, negotiated on 14 January 1814, Norway was ceded to the king of Sweden, of the new House of Bernadotte. In an attempt to take control of their destiny, the Norwegians convened a constitutional assembly at Eidsvoll and, on 17 May 1814, signed the Constitution of Norway. The viceroy and heir to the thrones of Denmark and Norway, Prince Christian Frederik, was elected by the assembly as king. The de facto Swedish ruler, Crown Prince Charles John, acting on behalf of King Charles XIII of Sweden, rejected the premise of an independent Norway and launched a military campaign on July 2, 1814 with an attack on the Hvaler islands and the city of Fredrikstad. The Swedish army was superior in numbers, better equipped and trained and was led by one of Napoleon's foremost generals, the newly-elected Swedish crown prince, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. The hostilities opened on 26 July with a swift Swedish naval attack against the Norwegian gunboats at Hvaler. The Norwegian vessels managed to escape, but they did not take part in the rest of the war. The main Swedish thrust came across the border at Halden, bypassing and surrounding the fortress of Fredriksten, and then continuing north, and a second force of 6,000 soldiers landed at Kr√•ker√∏y, outside of Fredrikstad. The town surrendered the next day. That was the start of a pincer movement around the main part of the Norwegian army at Rakkestad. The Norwegian army delivered several offensive blows to the Swedes, thus applying pressure on the Swedes to accept Norway as a sovereign nation and to open up negotiations. The tactic worked, and when talks began on 7 August, Charles John accepted the democratic Norwegian constitution. Armistice negotiations were concluded by Norway at Moss on 14 August 1814 and by Sweden in the city of Fredrikstad on 15 August 1814. Terms  The Treaty of Kiel was thus tacitly subdued and a new union on more equal terms negotiated. The convention comprised four documents with the following main points: *The agreement was entered into between the Swedish crown prince on behalf of the Swedish King and the Norwegian government. The Swedes did not recognise Christian Frederik's claim to the Norwegian throne and so he was not officially a party to the agreement, which was negotiated and signed by two of his ministers, Niels Aall and Jonas Collett. *The Norwegian parliament was to convene by the end of September or the beginning of October to ratify the convention. *The King of Sweden accepted the Norwegian constitution, with only such amendments as were necessary to accommodate the union with Sweden. All changes were to be accepted by the Norwegian parliament. *Christian Frederik was to abandon all claims to the Norwegian crown and to leave the country after he had convened the parliament. The Moss Ironworks main office, where the Convention of Moss was negotiated and signed. The greatest disagreement was in the question of Christian Frederick's unconditional renunciation of the throne, which he had to accept and to find a wording that meant that the Union should not be entered into as a result of the Kiel Treaty but by the treaty that became signed on Moss. At Norway's insistence, the parties agreed on a wording that avoided declaring the Swedish king to be the Norwegian king before he was elected by the Storting. The Norwegian Council of State (Det Norske Statsr√•dsalen) would, until further notice, take over the executive authority and sign its decisions with highest authority (paa allerh√∏ieste Befaling). That was one formulation that the Norwegians could accept since it did not mean that the King of Sweden had become King of Norway on January 14. Many Norwegians were shocked by their government's concessions, and when Swedish General Magnus Bj√∂rnstjerna, who had led the Swedish negotiations, arrived in Christiania, Norway, he got an unfriendly welcome. Norwegians also directed their resentment toward their own leaders and what they perceived as an ineffective military defence. Over time, public opinion shifted. The convention was a significant improvement over the terms dictated to Denmark‚ÄìNorway at the Treaty of Kiel. Notably, Norway was no longer to be treated as a Swedish conquest but as an equal party in a union of two independent states. Both the principle and the substance of the Norwegian Constitution were accepted. Christian Frederik's actions in 1814 greatly helped in allowing Norway to go into the union with Sweden as an equal and independent part in which Norway retained its own parliament and separate institutions except for the common king and foreign service. That was the last war between Sweden and Norway as well as Sweden's last war.

It consists of of forested canyonland around Ashland Creek, stretching from the downtown plaza up toward its headwaters near Mount Ashland. Its name originates from lithium oxide (Li2O) or \\"lithia,\\" which is found in the stream water pumped to the park. The park has two large greens, a bandshell for public musical performances, two duck ponds, a large playground, tennis courts, community buildings and, in winter, an ice skating rink. It also offers picnic areas and miles of hiking trails. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It features a Japanese garden.  History  The area which now comprises the entrance to Lithia Park was the site of Abel Helman and Eber Emery's flour mill, the first building in what is now the city of Ashland--established in 1852. By the time the town (then called Ashland Mills) had grown up around the area, the old mill had become an eyesore, dirty with livestock and the mill all but abandoned. The Chautauqua movement was very influential in Ashland, and many of the members of the Ladies Chautauqua Club formed the Women's Civic Improvement Club. Central to the focus of the club was the establishment of a park in Ashland. In 1908, after lobbying the city council, an amendment to the city charter was made establishing an elected park commission and setting aside all city-owned property bordering Ashland Creek for use as a park. Ashland Creek In 1907 a lithia water spring was discovered at Emigrant Creek several miles to the east. Upon analysis, the water was shown to have the second-highest concentration of (presumably beneficial) lithium in any natural spring (the highest being in the famous springs of Saratoga, New York). Bert Greer, a journalist, moved to Ashland in 1911 and purchased the Ashland Tidings newspaper. He agitated for the idea of establishing a mineral water resort at Ashland, and campaigned for a bond issue to fund mineral springs-related improvements to the park. In 1914, the bond issue was passed, and the park commission engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design improvements to the park. Additionally, Smith, Emery and Company were retained to do the necessary plumbing to pipe the \\"healthful\\" mineral waters into the park. During the ensuing period, much controversy arose over the spending of money and control of the park. The bond issue had placed authority in the hands of the Mineral Springs Commission (headed by Greer), and in 1916 Ashlanders voted to return control of the (now-named) Lithia Springs Park to the park commission. During this period, in 1915, the park commission opened a free auto camp along the margins of the park, which remained popular, with several rounds of improvements to campsites and facilities, until closed. Winburn Way in Lithia Park Interest in a mineral springs resort faded (though was briefly revived in the 1920s). Plantings by the WPA under Chet Corry (appointed superintendent in 1937) improved the landscaping of the park entrance. Corry also implemented a new approach, bringing many native plants and landscaping features into the park. During the next several years, the park commission expanded to establish many parks in Ashland; however, Lithia Park itself fell into disrepair. Financial and maintenance strains caused many features of the park to decay, and vandals destroyed several landmarks. In 1974, a huge blow was dealt to the park when a devastating flood scoured much of the parkland. Ashlanders again voted for additional funding for the park, which went into repairing the storm damage as well as improvements and repairs. A subsequent flood, in early 1997, again damaged much of the park and the downtown Ashland Plaza area. Significant structural work on Ashland Creek and the parks bridges in the years following this flood helped to prevent further disaster and turned Lithia Park it into the centerpiece of the town that it is today. The park was named by the American Planning Association as one of 10 Great Public Spaces in America in 2014.

Originally released in the arcade in 1995 on the CPS-2 arcade system, it was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in late 1997. The game, alongside Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, was also included in the Marvel vs. Capcom Origins collection, released digitally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012. Marvel Super Heroes is loosely based on \\"The Infinity Gauntlet\\" storyline of the Marvel Universe. It is the second Capcom fighting game based on characters from the Marvel Comics line, following X-Men: Children of the Atom, and was later succeeded by the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot of a fight between left Marvel Super Heroes is a fighting game in which superheroes and villains from the Marvel Universe fight against each other. The aim of the game is to use attacks and special abilities to knock out the opponent, or possess more life than him/her at the end of the round. Throughout the match, players build up a super meter which can be used to perform powerful Infinity Combo attacks. A unique mechanic in the game are the Infinity Gems; Power, Time, Space, Reality, Soul and Mind. These gems can be earned by obtaining them from opponents during arcade mode, or by fulfilling certain criteria during versus mode, such as getting the first hit. By using these gems in battle, fighters receive enhanced effects for a short amount of time, such as increased power or defense, health recovery or additional attacks. Certain fighters will receive extra benefits whilst using certain gems. For example, if Spider-Man uses the Power Gem, he can create a doppelganger on the opposite side of his opponent for extra damage during his attacks. Plot Loosely based on The Infinity Gauntlet storyline, the game focuses on heroes and villains battling each other for the Infinity Gems. The main antagonist is Thanos, who plots to use the Infinity Gems to take over the universe.

Development Capcom included the four characters from X-Men: Children of the Atom which their market research had determined to be the most popular: Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto and Psylocke. The home conversions of the game were unveiled on the first day of the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, with Stan Lee appearing at the booth. The Saturn version supports the 1 MB RAM expansion cartridge to include extra frames of animation and slightly quicker load times. In 2019, the game was announced to one of the titles to be includes in the Marvel Arcade1Up arcade cabinet. The game was dedicated to Marvel artist Jack Kirby, who had died on February 6, 1994. Reception The arcade version received positive reviews. In Japan, Game Machine listed Marvel Super Heroes on their December 15, 1995 issue as being the eleventh most- successful arcade game of the year. Computer and Video Games awarded it a full 5/5 rating. Despite scoring it only three out of five stars, Next Generation gave it a relentlessly positive review, saying it \\"blends loads of combo- powered attacks with liquid-smooth animation to contend with some of the best fighters out there.\\" They were also pleased with the selection of Marvel characters and the 2D graphics, saying they make a \\"refreshing\\" change from the polygon-based fighters that by this time were dominating the fighting games market. Wizard opined that \\"with great graphics, challenging gameplay and plenty of moves, throws and counters, Marvel Super Heroes has much to offer.\\" The Saturn version was widely praised as having the same large, detailed sprites as the arcade version, though some criticized the slowdown which occurs when the RAM expansion cart is used and/or larger characters are on screen. GamePro called it \\"an excellent port of the arcade game which was a quarter-burner last year.\\" Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine praised the Saturn conversion for retaining all the scenery effects of the arcade version, and commented that \\"Marvel Super Heroes makes 2D graphics cool again\\". By contrast, in text repeated in GameSpots reviews of both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, Jeff Gerstmann concluded, \\"While I found the arcade game a blast, this version just seemed dull and boring. Whether this can be attributed to the translation itself or the fact that several, mostly better, Capcom fighters have been released in arcades since Marvel, I don't know.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers were split, with Sushi-X and John Ricciardi hailing the Saturn conversion as impressive, while Kelly Rickards and Dan Hsu considered it passable but disappointing. In turn, Sushi-X and Rickards found the game itself flashy with little balance and technique, while Ricciardi and Hsu felt it had depth beneath its flash. Next Generation approved of the conversion but argued that the gameplay was not enough of an advancement over previous Capcom fighting games, ensuring that \\"Newcomers to the series should give a spin, but veterans might want to wait until the fabled X-Men vs. Street Fighter arrives at the end of the year.\\" Critics generally regarded the PlayStation version as inferior to the Saturn version, due to the Saturn version having less slowdown and more frames of animation. GamePro cited the game as evidence that the PlayStation could not handle 2D as well as the Saturn, rated the PlayStation version lower than the Saturn version in every category except graphics, and summarized that \\"Although it's identical to the Saturn version in features ... the PlayStation game loses serious points for its unplayability.\\" The same four EGM reviewers covered the Saturn and PlayStation versions, with each of the four rating the PlayStation version half a point lower than the Saturn version. Gerstmann said the speech samples have better quality in the PlayStation version, but still regarded the Saturn version as \\"slightly better\\". In 2013, Marvel Super Heroes ranked as the 16th best Marvel video game by Geek Magazine for its \\"chaotic, yet insanely fun, gameplay.\\" That same year, Rich Knight and Gus Turner of Complex included it on their list of 25 best 2D fighting games of all time, stating that the gem-collecting \\"mechanic was a big difference-maker for the title and, as a result, the game still feels fresh today.\\" See also *Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems - A side-scrolling action game produced by Capcom for the Super NES. *Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite - Another Capcom fighting game focusing on the Infinity Gems.

Burnim,, and Edward Langhans, Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers and Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800, 16 volumes, Carbondale, Illinois, Southern Illinois University Press, 1973-93. A Charles Hart was christened on 11 December 1625, in the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, in London. It is not absolutely certain that this was the actor, though the name was not common at the time.. He was most likely the son of William Hart, a minor actor with the King's Men.http://www.oxforddnb.com.proxy- um.researchport.umd.edu/view/article/12473?docPos=1 Hart began his career as a boy player with the King's Men; he was an apprentice of Richard Robinson, longtime member of that company. Hart established his reputation by playing the role of the Duchess in The Cardinal, the tragedy by James Shirley, in 1641.Alois M. Nagler, A Source Book in Theatrical History, Courier Dover, 1959; p. 160. Wright says in Historia histrionica that:\\"Hart and Clun, were bred up Boys at the Blackfriers; and Acted Womens Parts, Hart was [Richard] Robinson's Boy or Apprentice: He Acted the Dutchess in the Tragedy of the Cardinal, which was the first Part that gave him Reputation.\\"http://www.oxforddnb.com.proxy- um.researchport.umd.edu/view/article/12473?docPos=1 He served as a soldier in the English Civil War, and was an officer in Prince Rupert's regiment of cavalry, along with fellow actors Nicholas Burt and Robert Shatterell. Hart and the others most likely saw combat at the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well.John H. Astington, \\"Actors and the Court After 1642,\\" Early Modern Literary Studies, Special Issue 15 (August 2007), pp. 1-23. Hart then returned to acting; evidence suggests he was with other displaced English actors in Europe in 1646.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509. See pp. 488-90. In 1648, Hart, Walter Clun and eight other actors, were involved in an attempt to restart the King's Men company during the Puritan Commonwealth, which, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. On 5 February 1648, at the Cockpit Theatre, Hart and other King's Men were arrested for violating the ban against theatrical performance; they were caught in the midst of a performance of Rollo Duke of Normandy (in which Hart played the character Otto). Hart and the others were imprisoned for a short time, then released.Milhous and Hume, pp. 491-2. Just before the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, acting resumed on a larger scale, and Hart seems to have been then a member of a company performing at the Cockpit playhouse, led by Michael Mohun. As soon as the King's Company was formed in 1660, Hart became one of its leading men; he specialised in playing the male half of witty, bantering couples. This type of dialogue in Restoration comedy was largely influenced by the talents and personalities of Hart and Nell Gwyn, in plays like James Howard's The Mad Couple; Gwyn was his mistress before she became Charles II's. Hart's natural dignity in playing royal roles was also often commented on by contemporaries, and in the heroic play he \\"was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's Conquest of Granada.\\"Peter Dixon, ed., William Wycherley: The Country Wife and Other Plays, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1996. When Hart played in Euterpe Restored in 1672, Richard Flecknoe composed the following lines: :::Beauty to the eye, and music to the ear, :::Such even the nicest critics must allow :::Burbage was once and such Charles Hart is now.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company, 1594-1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 229.

It was recalled on the same day it was released, then rewritten and re-released some months later. The original version, with an orange cover, was written in 1980 by Jean Wells. When the orange version was recalled (and most copies destroyed), the module was rewritten by Tom Moldvay and released with a green cover. Writing credit on the second version was given to both Moldvay and Wells, although there was very little of Wells' original content in Moldvay's version. Palace of the Silver Princess contains a single D&D; adventure laid out in a format suitable for a single gaming session. The module includes game maps on the unattached outside cover. Plot summary of second (green) version The module has been described as a low- level scenario, which involves the legends surrounding a ruined palace, a white dragon, and a giant ruby. (preview) The player characters encounter evil creatures that have taken over the palace. The plot of Palace of the Silver Princess revolves around a country frozen in time by a strange red light. The only seemingly unaffected location and the apparent source of the glow is the royal palace. The adventurers must restore the flow of time and save the country. Publication history In 1980, Jean Wells, the only woman in TSR's design department, was assigned to write an adventure for the \\"B\\" (Basic) series that would teach new players how to play D&D; using rules for the D&D; Basic Set. This module would be unique as it was the first TSR adventure authored by a female designer. She consulted her editor, Ed Sollers, about every detail, and the result was B3 Palace of the Silver Princess. In keeping with the design of the first D&D; module of the \\"B\\" series, B1 In Search of the Unknown by Mike Carr, Wells left several rooms and areas of the module incomplete so that players could customize those areas themselves. As she related, \\"I was trying to show the players that there was more to a 'dungeon' than just the building. I didn't complete the palace, trying to show them this map could be a mini base map for their game. The players could discover the part of the dungeon that had been caved in wasn't any longer and the DM could expand it. I was assuming that they were trying to learn to set up their own world and I was trying to help.\\" During the editorial process, Wells wanted to replace artwork by Erol Otus that had transformed her new three-headed monsters called \\"ubues\\" into hermaphrodites with the heads of TSR staffers and management. However, she was told that it was too late, since replacing the artwork would cause unreasonable printing delays. Original \\"orange version\\"On the eve of publication, when the cartons of printed modules arrived at TSR headquarters ready for shipping, someone in TSR's upper management objected strongly to the module. Some sources state that the objectionable content was four pieces of artwork by Erol Otus and Laura Roslof that were too overtly sexual. These included \\"The Illusion of the Decapus\\" by Laura Roslof, wife of Jim Roslof, in which a woman tied up by her own hair was being tortured by demonic-looking figures. Author Jim McLauchlin points out that at the time, some people were claiming that D&D; promoted devil worship, and during this 'Satanic Panic', \\"the image posed a very real threat to the company's bottom line.\\" However, Frank Mentzer later claimed that the objectionable art was rather tame compared to that released in some other products of the time, and that the real reason was the Erol Otus caricatures of TSR executives in the illustration of the ubues. Other people employed at TSR at the time agree that management found this particular illustration objectionable, but disagree as to who was being caricatured. Lawrence Schick, then the head of the creative department, believes that Otus was portraying fellow creative staff members. Editor/game developer Kevin Hendryx states that it was recently terminated employees that were illustrated, and that \\"upper management was very sensitive about mutiny in the ranks at the time and took all these perceived slurs or snoot-cockings as an insult and a challenge.\\" Wells herself related that another member of the design department complained to senior executive Kevin Blume, and that subsequently she and her editor, Ed Sollers, were called into a meeting and asked to explain why a module designed for a younger audience contained S&M.; The end result was that the entire print run of 5,000‚Äì10,000 copies of what became known as the \\"orange version\\" ‚Äî because of its orange cover design ‚Äî was destroyed. The copies already sent out to stores were ordered to be recalled, and that night the personal copies handed out earlier that day were removed from the employees' desks; the few copies employees had taken home that night were not confiscated, but the rest ended up in a Lake Geneva landfill, along with all the copies TSR could reclaim from those already shipped out. The entire module was subsequently rewritten by Tom Moldvay, who changed the plot, replaced all of Wells' new monsters with standard monsters from the 1981 Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, and removed the empty areas. In addition, the four contentious pieces of artwork, as well as many others, were replaced. The new version was then released with a green cover, with writing credit given to both Moldvay and Wells, although the new version contained little of Wells' original content other than the setting. Reception Jim Bambra reviewed the green version of Palace of the Silver Princess for White Dwarf magazine, giving it a 10/10 and calling it \\"an excellent introduction to the game for new DMs and players, being fairly simple to complete and play.\\" He made note of the glossary of unfamiliar terms for the Dungeon Master to reference and helpful hints on play, and concluded with the suggestion that Palace of the Silver Princess should replace The Keep on the Borderlands in the D&D; Basic Set. Legacy Only a few copies of the orange cover version survived, making it a very collectible item. Four years after the orange version was destroyed, a copy sold for $300 at the 1984 Gen Con game fair auction. Twenty-four years later, in 2008, a copy in VF/SW (very fine/slight warp) condition sold at auction for $3050, at the time the highest confirmed sale price for any single non-unique TSR D&D; module. One copy, signed by Jean Wells, sold for $5,860. In 2011, a few copies were still available from out-of-print resellers; in shrink-wrapped, near mint condition these were priced at $1300‚Äì$1500. In retrospect, Lawrence Schick believes that \\"the actual content of it is only mildly eccentric by current standards\\" and that the entire imbroglio was caused by an over-reaction on the part of TSR's management team. \\"It‚Äôs more a matter of what a light it shines on the management reaction at the time, and the 'Satanic Panic.'\\" After Wizards of the Coast took over TSR, they posted an article on their official website that recounted the history of Palace of the Silver Princess, and included a downloadable PDF copy of the original module.

It has a barrel diameter of making it one of the largest cannons in the world by calibre. Mons Meg was built in 1449 on the orders of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy and sent by him as a gift to James II, King of Scots, in 1454. The bombard was employed in sieges until the middle of the 16th century, after which it was only fired on ceremonial occasions. On one such occasion in 1680 the barrel burst, rendering Mons Meg unusable. The gun remained in Edinburgh Castle until 1754 when, along with other unused weapons in Scotland, it was taken to the Tower of London. Sir Walter Scott and others campaigned for its return, which was effected in 1829. Mons Meg has since been restored, and is now on display within the castle.  Construction  The cannon is wide enough to contain a child. The bombard was manufactured from longitudinal bars of iron, hooped with rings fused into one mass.Chambers, Robert (1885). Domestic Annals of Scotland. Edinburgh : W & R Chambers. p. 330 The barrel is attached to the powder chamber by means of a groove on the powder chamber into which lugs on the end of the barrel staves fit, and then bound permanently together by the hoops. The powder chamber itself is made from small pieces of iron hammer-welded together to make a solid wrought-iron forging. Mons Meg has a diameter of , one of the highest ever built, weighs and is in length. The final cost of the gun was ¬£1,536.  History  Sideview Burst iron ring which put the cannon out of use Mons Meg was constructed by Jehan Cambier, artillery maker to the Duke of Burgundy, and it was successfully tested at Mons in the County of Hainault in what is now Belgium, in June 1449; however, the Duke did not take delivery of the Mons Meg until 1453. Desiring to \\"interfere in English affairs\\", the Duke decided to help the Scots against the English. It was given to James II in 1454. Additionally, an alternative legend about its manufacture is that it was built by a local blacksmith for the siege of Threave Castle in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. According to this tale, which was lent credence by Sir Walter Scott, when King James arrived at Threave to besiege the Earl of Douglas, the Clan MacLellan presented him with this bombard. The first shot fired is said to have passed clean through the castle, severing the hand of Margaret, Countess of Douglas, on the way. The gun was subsequently named after \\"Mollance\\", the lands gifted to the blacksmith for his service, and \\"Meg\\", the name of his wife. Later historians have not taken this legend particularly seriously, not least because of the improbability that such a weapon could be forged by a village smith. The diameter cannon accepted stone balls that weighed . In early years the gun, like the other royal cannon, was painted with red lead to keep it from rusting. This cost 30 shillings in June 1539.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 222. From the 1540s Meg was retired from active service and was fired only on ceremonial occasions from Edinburgh Castle. When it was fired on 3 July 1558, soldiers were paid to find and retrieve the shot from Wardie Muir, near the Firth of Forth, a distance of two miles. The salute marked the solemnisation of the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French Dauphin.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 1 (1877), ccxxiii footnote; vol. 10, (1913), lxxv‚Äìlxxvi, 367. The gun was fired on 30 October 1680 to celebrate a visit by James, Duke of Albany and York, later King James VII, but the barrel burst. An English cannoneer had loaded the charge and many Scots believed that the damage was done on purpose out of jealousy, because the English had no cannon as big as this. The incident was also seen as a bad omen for the future King.Chambers, Robert (1885). Domestic Annals of Scotland. Edinburgh : W & R Chambers. p. 329. The cannon was left outside Foog's Gate at Edinburgh Castle. It was next taken, with other disused ordnance, to the Tower of London in 1754, as a result of the disarming acts against Jacobites aimed at removing weapons or spare cannon from the reach of rebellious folk. It was returned to the Castle in 1829 by order of George IV after a series of campaigns by Sir Walter Scott and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Following a restoration, it now sits outside St Margaret's Chapel. During the Edinburgh's annual Hogmanay celebrations Mons Meg is fired at the start of the firework display, although the effect is largely theatrical and the gun is not discharged. > \\"Mons Meg was a large old-fashioned piece of ordnance, a great favourite > with the Scottish common people; she was fabricated at Mons in Flanders, in > the reign of James IV. or V. of Scotland.

In 1489, she first appears in record as \\"Monss\\",Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 1, Edinburgh (1877), ccxx‚Äìccxxiii, 115. and in the painter's account of 1539 she is called; \\"Monce in the castell,\\" the only piece with an individual name. In 1650 she was noted as \\"Muckle Meg.\\" \\"Meg\\" may either be a reference to Margaret of Denmark, Queen of James III of Scotland, or simply an alliteration, while Mons was one of the locations where the cannon was originally tested. McKenzie records that this class of artillery was known as a murderer and Mons Meg was certainly described as such.McKenzie, Page 319 Mons Meg was made in the town of Mons (now the Walloon French-speaking part of Belgium) or Bergen (in Flemish Dutch as in those days it was part of Flanders). Three cannons were founded: one resides now in Edinburgh, one in the Flemish town of Ghent at the Friday Market and one was in France but disappeared ages ago. The one in Ghent can be visited today, undamaged. The cannon is named \\"Dulle Griet\\" which translates into \\"Mad Meg\\". =Evolution of the carriage= Mons Meg at Edinburgh Castle in the 1680s, showing details of the carriage construction For a while in its early days the Mons sat on a plain box without any wheels. Evidently, when Mons Meg was removed from Edinburgh Castle in 1754, her carriage had long since rotted away. A contemporary account describes her as lying \\"on the ground\\" near the innermost gate to the castle.Blair, Claude (1967) \\"A New Carriage for Mons Meg\\" Journal of the Arms and Armour Society London V(12) pages 431‚Äì452 Presumably the Ordnance Board fabricated a new carriage after her arrival at the Tower. In 1835, after the return of Mons Meg to Edinburgh Castle, the London-made carriage rotted away, too, and fabrication of a cast-iron replacement was undertaken. Mons Meg is now mounted on a reproduction of the carriage depicted in a carving of circa 1500 on a wall of Edinburgh Castle, built in 1934 at a cost of ¬£178 and paid for by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh.

Brechin Castle is a castle in Brechin, Angus, Scotland. The castle was constructed in stone during the 13th century. Most of the current building dates to the early 18th century, when extensive reconstruction was carried out by architect Alexander Edward for James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure, between approximately 1696 and 1709.Colvin, Howard (1978) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, James Murray, pp.282-3 The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. A garden gate at Brechin Castle History The grounds have been in the Maule-Ramsay family since the 12th century. The castle has been the seat of the Clan Maule since medieval times. The Maule and Ramsay clans were joined under a single chieftain in the 18th century. The seat of the Ramsay clan was moved from Dalhousie Castle in Midlothian to Brechin Castle in the early 20th century. The castle is the home of the Earl of Dalhousie, the clan chieftain of Clan Maule of Panmure in Angus, and Clan Ramsay of Dalhousie.

He is also a well-known figure in Finnish science fiction fandom and a regular panelist and guest of honour at conventions, such as Finncon. His own comic albums include the horror/fantasy tale Laulu y√∂n lapsista (\\"Song of the children of the night\\"), exploring the vampire folklore of 1562 Russia during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, and a graphic novel version of Macbeth. The fantasy world of Jaconia, created for his Praedor comics, has been adapted into a role-playing game of the same name. His work has also been featured in the science fiction magazine T√§htivaeltaja, the Finnish Conan magazine and twice in the war comics magazine Korkeaj√§nnitys: a western story and one story set in the Finnish War.

Nothing certain is known of Haines' early life. He joined a troupe of strolling players in Cambridge in 1667, joined a company of young performers at the Hatton Garden \\"nursery\\" in London in 1668, and there caught the eye of Thomas Killigrew and was invited to join Killigrew's patent company, the King's Company.

It is derived from the Norwegian word skikj√∏ring, meaning \\"ski driving\\". Although skijoring is said to have originated as a mode of winter travel, it is currently primarily a competitive sport. History Demonstration skijoring competition at the 1928 Winter Olympics, horses are seen in the distance, coming around the bend of the track. For hundreds of years, Sami people harnessed reindeer and strapped on Nordic skis as a way to travel across vast snowy expanses. Skijoring behind reindeer made its official debut in Stockholm at the Nordic Games of 1901, 1905 and 1909. The beginning of the Winter Olympics Skijoring is still popular in all Scandinavian countries. Reindeer races are still held in Tromso, Norway; Inari, Finland; and Nadym, Russia.Skij√∏r: Driven to Ski By 1912, skijoring behind horses was a popular activity in Switzerland and France. Equine skijoring found its way from Europe to North America. In 1915, it appeared as a recreational activity in Lake Placid, New York and beginning in 1916 was a regular pastime at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 1924, equine skijoring made an appearance at the Chamonix International Winter Sports Week, which set the stage for its inclusion as an exhibition sport at the 1928 Winter Olympic Games two years later in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Skijoring with motorcycles, Augustusburg, Germany, 1963 It is speculated that when World War II ended, men from the 10th Mountain Division returned home to the American west after seeing skijoring in countries such as France and Switzerland. To simplify the equipment, cowboys on horseback simply attached a long rope to the saddle horn of a western saddle, added a water skiing tow handle, and the skier held on as the horse was ridden at a gallop down a long straightaway‚Äîusually an open field or a snow-covered roadway. Mountain towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming and Steamboat Springs, Colorado took up the sport. Originally these matches ran multiple teams of horse, rider and skier side by side against one another rather than single teams against the clock. This is possibly how modern American races were born. The city of Leadville, Colorado first organized an equestrian competition in 1949, which today is still in operation.The Leadville version is normally spelled as two words: \\"Ski Joring\\". In 1976, Denver, Colorado listed skijoring as an exhibition sport in their bid for the Winter Olympics. Although Denver won the bid, the city ultimately turned it down, and skijoring was likewise not held. By the 1950s, skiers were sometimes towed by motorcycles or automobiles in races. In modern-day Latvia, skiers are towed in a motocross-style event called Twitch'n'Ride. At the Arctic Man competition in Alaska, skiers are towed behind snowmobiles that travel up to . Currently, in the United Kingdom, athletes are skijoring on turf or in arenas.Global History In some coastal regions in France and on Caribbean islands, skijoring occurs on beaches. Dog skijoring Skijoring with dogs Another theory is that Skijoring may have originated in China, using dogs. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties (1271‚Äì1644) historian John B. Allen wrote, ‚Äútens of dogs pull a person on a pair of wooden boards...galloping on the snow and ice faster than a horse.‚Äú His sources included an account from the Tang dynasty, written by the Persian historian, Raschid ed-Din, published in the west in 1878. and published numerous times in Western Languages. Modern dog skijoring assists a cross-country skier. One to three dogs are commonly used. The cross-country skier provides power with skis and poles, and the dog adds additional power by running and pulling. The skier wears a skijoring harness, the dog wears a sled dog harness, and the two are connected by a length of rope. There are no reins or other signaling devices to control the dog; the dog must be motivated by its own desire to run, and respond to the owner's voice for direction. Many breeds of dog participate in skijoring. The only prerequisite is a desire to run down a trail and pull, which is innate in many dogs. Small dogs (less than 40 pounds) are rarely seen skijoring, because they do not greatly assist the skier; however, since the skier can provide as much power as is required to travel, any enthusiastic dog can participate. Athletic dogs such as pointers, setters and herding breeds take to skijoring with glee, as do most sled dog breeds; however, many other large, energetic dog breeds are utilized in this sport. The sport is practiced recreationally and competitively, both for long distance travel and for short (sprint) distances. =Competitions= Since many leashed dogs naturally tend to pull a skier with no training, the sport cannot claim a single country of origin. As a competitive sport, however, it is believed that the first races were held in Scandinavia as an offshoot of the older sport of Pulka. Competitive racing has been taken up in North America while its older cousin Pulka racing has not yet become popular. Skijor races are held in many countries where there is snow in winter. Most races are between 5 kilometers and 20 kilometers in length. The longest race is the Kalevala, held in Kalevala, Karelia, Russia, with a distance of . Next is the River Runner 120 held in Whitehorse, Yukon, with a distance of . In the United States and Canada, skijoring races are often held in conjunction with sled dog races. In Scandinavia, skijor racing is tightly associated with the older Scandinavian sport of Pulka. Although some races are unsanctioned, held under the sole guidance of a local club, many races fall under one of three international organizations. In the United States and Canada, ISDRA (International Sled Dog Racing Association) sanctions many races. In Europe, ESDRA (European Sled Dog Racing Association) provides sanctioning, and the IFSS (International Federation of Sleddog Sports) sanctions World Cup races all over the world, as well as a world championship race every two years. At the IFSS World championship event, skijoring races are separated into men's and women's, and one-dog and two-dog categories. The USA held the world's largest skijoring event in February 2011 at the City of Lakes Loppet in Minneapolis. Two hundred skijoring teams raced in this event, which included the first-ever National Skijoring Championship. =Equipment= The skijoring belt worn by the skier is a wide waistband which is clipped around the skier's waist, and which may include leg loops to keep it in position. Rock climbing harnesses are also commonly used as skijoring belts. The sled dog harness can be any of the several types of dog harness commonly used for dogsled racing. The skijoring line is usually at least 2.5 metres (8 feet) long. A longer line is used for a three-dog team. A section of bungee cord is often incorporated into the line to absorb the impact of the dog's forward motion or a quick stop by the skier. Special quick-release hitches or hooks are available, used so that the skijorer may unhook the dog's lead rapidly. =Techniques and training= The skier uses either a classic diagonal stride cross-country technique, or the faster skate skiing technique. In races, the skate-skiing technique is almost exclusively used. The skis are hot waxed from tip to tail, to avoid slowing the dog team down. Classic skis with grip wax are not used for races but are occasionally used for extended back-country travel. Skijoring dogs are taught the classic dog sledding commands to start running (hike), turn (gee and haw‚Äîright and left respectively in the US), to stop (whoa) and to pass distractions (on by). Training is best done on foot, before the person straps on their skis, to avoid being pulled into objects, like trees or half-frozen creeks. To participate in races, skijoring dogs must be taught to pass, or be passed by, other teams without interfering with them. An overly friendly attempt by one dog to stop and greet another team passing at high speed can be as problematic as a dog that attempts to nip other dogs in passing. A top skijor racing team can pass other teams head-on, without even turning to look at them. Equestrian skijoring Equestrian skijoring Equestrian skijoring usually consists of a team of a horse and two people: a rider for the horse, and a skier. A rider controls the horse, and the person on skis carries no poles and holds a tow rope in a manner akin to water skiing. In some places in Europe, competitions involve a riderless horse who is guided by the skier. Open snowpacked fields and community streets are sometimes used, although horse racetracks are also used in some places. The horses gallop down a track roughly in length. Skiers must navigate a series of jumps and gates. At some events, to add difficulty, the skier is also required to grab one or more rings as they ski past a station on the course. On a straight track, the horse runs down the middle of the course with the skier navigating slalom gates and jumps on either side of the track. Some places use a horseshoe-shaped track that allows the horse to run on the inside of the track and the ski jumps are set on the outside of the track for the skier. Jumps are in height, lower on curved tracks or in places where snowboarders wish to compete. Venues may also offer novelty events, such as a long jump competition where the horse pulls a skier who jumps for maximum distance, similar to gelandesprung, but landing on the flat. Some teams emphasize a speed-acceleration \\"crack-the-whip\\" effect by either having the horse veer to the side immediately before the jump, or the skier will carve his or her own crack-the-whip before attempting the jump. Competitors have reached . =Equipment= Competitors often use short skis and modified water skiing towing equipment, though often this is as simple as a single tow rope attached to the saddle horn or behind the cantle of a western saddle. Some variants in equipment attach two towing lines to either the back of a saddle or a breastplate on the horse. Timing is typically electronic, with top competitions decided by hundredths of seconds. There are typically three classes of teams: Pro/Open, Sport, and Novice. There may be age divisions, as well as separate events for Women or people with and Snowboards. At times, 100 teams compete each day over a racing weekend, prize pots can reach upwards of $20,000. The horses are trained to accept the presence of ropes and a skier behind them, and to remain calm in racing conditions. The skier is timed through the course, and penalties are assessed by missing gates or jumps, and by missing or dropping any of the rings. The competitors often race for cash prizes. =Competition venues= Competitive equine skijoring races take place in eight states in the US, most in the Rocky Mountain West, as well as in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and Alberta, Canada. There are different variations of the sport across numerous countries worldwide: France, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Ukraine and Russia. Today, in Europe, equine skijoring gets the most exposure during White Turf in St. Moritz, Switzerland. White Turf, an event which features horse racing on snow as well as chariot racing and skijoring, began in 1907 and draws over 35,000 spectators a day. In the United States, Leadville, Colorado has been hosting a competition down its main street since 1949. Leadville hosted their 71st race in 2019. Steamboat Springs, Colorado claims skijoring has been a tradition at the Steamboat Springs Winter Carnival for over 100 years. Other major events include the Whitefish Winter Carnival, which has hosted the World Skijoring Championships. In 2011, this event awarded $19,580 in purse money and hosted 91 teams.http://www.whitefishskijoring.com Other US venues include Helena, Butte, Wisdom, Bozeman, Red Lodge, Whitefish, Kalispell, Big Sky and West Yellowstone Montana (National Championship Finals venue); Hailey and Driggs, Idaho; Jackson Hole, Saratoga, Pinedale, Sundance and Sheridan, Wyoming; Soldier Hollow, Utah; and Silverton, Leadville, Kremmling, Pagosa Springs and Ridgway, Colorado. In 2019, Steamboat Springs, Colorado hosted its first competitive race in addition to and separate from the town's annual Winter Carnival. Canterbury Park, Minnesota and Skowhegan, Maine also hosted races in 2019. =Organizations= Skijor International was founded in 2012 to promote the sport of equine skijoring Skijor USA, an affiliate, sponsors a circuit of about 12 races. Skijor International, LLC and Skijor USA, both non-profit organizations, hope to bring equine skijoring back to the Winter Olympic Games in some capacity in 2026 or 2030, marking 100 years of skijoring history. Skijoring America, a similar organization, was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in Montana. Motorized skijoring Motorized skijoring. Skijoring can also take place behind a snowmobile or other small motorized vehicle. The vehicle and driver pull a skier in a manner more akin to the equestrian style, which is more suited for higher speeds than is the dog skijoring style. Another variant can tow skiers behind an all-terrain carrier such as the Bandvagn 206. In this case, several skiers or soldiers can be towed on the same rope. The rope is passed around the skier's ski poles and continues to the next person in line. Skiers then preferably hang on to their ski poles, supported by their arms. In the media Skijoring features in the 1998 film Silver Wolf, starring Michael Biehn and Roy Scheider. Skijoring is also mentioned in the Castle Films short Snow Thrills, which was later included in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In the episode, the sport is pronounced by host Joel Robinson as \\"she-horring.\\" Another character, Tom Servo, describes skijoring as \\"A safe and fun way to blow a Saturday... or a knee!\\" Variations of skijoring include snowboarding while hitched to a dog, and \\"grassjoring,\\" skijoring on grassy fields rather than snow. Related summer sports include bikejoring and canicross.

Nelfinavir belongs to the class of drugs known as protease inhibitors (PIs) and like other PIs is almost always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Nelfinavir has been shown to treat SARS-coronavirus, and is being tested to treat COVID-19. Nelfinavir is an orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 protease inhibitor (Ki=2nM) and is widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. It was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 1997.  Toxicity  Common (>1%) side effects include insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and lipodystrophy. Nelfinavir can produce a range of adverse side effects. Flatulence, diarrhea or abdominal pain are common (i.e. experienced by more than one in one hundred patients). Fatigue, urination, rash, mouth ulcers or hepatitis are less frequent effects (experienced by one in one thousand to one in one hundred patients). Nephrolithiasis, arthralgia, leukopenia, pancreatitis or allergic reactions may occur, but are rare (less than one in one thousand patients) .  Other bioactivity Antiviral= Nelfinavir inhibits maturation and export of the Herpes Simplex 1 virus and the Kaposi's Sarcoma virus. = Potential anti-cancer activity = Since 2009, nelfinavir has been under investigation for potential use as an anti-cancer agent. When applied to cancer cells in culture (in vitro), it can inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer types and can trigger cell death (apoptosis). When Nelfinavir was given to laboratory mice with tumors of the prostate or of the brain, it could suppress tumor growth in these animals. At the cellular level, nelfinavir exerts multiple effects to inhibit cancer growth; the two main ones appear to be inhibition of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress with subsequent unfolded protein response. In the United States, about three dozen clinical trials are being conducted (or have been completed) in order to determine whether nelfinavir is effective as a cancer therapeutic agent in humans. In some of these trials, nelfinavir is used alone in monotherapy fashion, whereas in others it is combined with other modes of cancer therapy, such as well-established chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy. , no phase 3 cancer trials are registered. =Anti- virulence activity= Nelfinavir and simple derivatives have been found to inhibit the production of the virulence factor streptolysin S, a cytolysin produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Nelfinavir and these related molecules did not exhibit detectable antibiotic activity, but did also inhibit the production of other biologically active molecules, including plantazolicin (antibiotic), listeriolysin S (cytolysin), and clostridiolysin S (cytolysin), by other bacteria.  Interactions  Nelfinavir's interaction profile is similar to that of other protease inhibitors. Most interactions occur at the level of the Cytochrome P450 isozymes 3A4 and CYP2C19, by which nelfinavir is metabolised.  Pharmacology  Nelfinavir should be taken with food. Taking the drug with food decreases the risk of diarrhea as a side effect.  Mechanism of action  Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor: it inhibits HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. HIV protease is an aspartate protease which splits viral protein molecules into smaller fragments, and it is vital to both the replication of the virus within the cell, and also to the release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor (2 nM) which is designed to bind tightly and is not cleaved due to the presence of a hydroxyl group as opposed to a keto group in the middle amino acid residue mimic, which would be otherwise S-phenylcysteine. All protease inhibitors bind to the protease, the precise mode of binding determines how the molecule inhibits the protease. The way Nelfinavir binds the enzyme may be sufficiently unique to reduce cross-resistance between it and other PIs. Also, not all PIs inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases.  History  Nelfinavir was developed by Agouron Pharmaceuticals as part of a joint venture with Eli Lilly and Company. Agouron Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Warner Lambert in 1999 and is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. It is marketed in Europe by Hoffman-La Roche and elsewhere by ViiV Healthcare. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for therapeutic use on March 14, 1997, making it the twelfth approved antiretroviral. The initial product launched proved to be the largest \\"biotech launch\\" in the history of the pharmaceutical industry, achieving first full year sales exceeding $US335M. Agouron's patent on the drug expired in 2014. On the 6 June 2007, both the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the European Medicines AgencyPress release from the European Medicines Agency regarding possible genotoxic ethyl mesylate contamination put out an alert requesting the recall of any of the drug in circulation, because some batches may have been contaminated with potentially cancer-causing chemicals.

It is only known from one incomplete copy discovered in 1890 at al-Hibah, Egypt and subsequently purchased in 1891 in Cairo by the Russian Egyptologist Vladimir Goleni≈°ƒçev.(Caminos 1977:1). It was found in a jar together with the Onomasticon of Amenope and the Tale of Woe. The papyrus is now in the collection of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, and officially designated as Papyrus Pushkin 120. The hieratic text is published by Korostovcev 1960, and the hieroglyphic text is published by Gardiner 1932 (as well as on-line). Discovery The two-page papyrus is unprovenanced. It was reported to have been discovered in an illicit excavation at al-Hibah, Egypt and was bought by Vladimir Golenishchev in 1891-92. Golenishchev published the manuscript in 1897-99. The text Second (final) page of the papyrus The story is set in an anonymous \\"Year 5\\", generally taken to be year 5 of the so- called Renaissance of Pharaoh Ramesses XI, the tenth and last ruler of the Twentieth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt (1190 - 1077 BCE). However, since Karl Jansen-Winkeln has proposed to reverse the order of the High Priests of Amun Herihor and Piankh, this ascription has become disputed.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Das Ende des Neuen Reiches, ZAS 119 (1992), pp.22-37 With the pontificate of Herihor falling later than that of Piankh, who is attested in year 7 of the Renaissance,Nims, JNES 7 (1948), 157-162 the date in the heading of Wenamun should rather refer to the direct (or indirect) successor of Ramesses XI. Following Jansen-Winkeln, Arno Egberts (1991) therefore argues that the story is set in the fifth regnal year of Smendes I, the Delta-based founder of the Twenty-first Dynasty. Recently, yet another solution has been suggested by Ad ThijsAd Thijs, The Burial of Psusennes I and ‚ÄúThe Bad Times‚Äù of P. Brooklyn 16.205, Z√ÑS 96 (2014), 209‚Äì223 who ascribes the text to year 5 of \\"king\\" Pinedjem I, who is the successor of Ramesses XI in his radically alternative chronology, which is based on the reversal of High Priests put forward by Jansen-Winkeln. As the story begins, the principal character, Wenamun, a priest of Amun at Karnak, is sent by the High Priest of Amun Herihor to the Phoenician city of Byblos to acquire lumber (probably cedar wood) to build a new ship to transport the cult image of Amun. After visiting Smendes (Nesbanebded in Egyptian) at Tanis, Wenamun stopped at the port of Dor ruled by the Tjeker prince Beder, where he was robbed. Upon reaching Byblos, he was shocked by the hostile reception he received there. When he finally gained an audience with Zakar-Baal, the local king, the latter refused to give the requested goods for free, as had been the traditional custom, instead demanding payment. Wenamun had to send to Smendes for payment, a humiliating move that demonstrates the waning of Egyptian power over the Eastern Mediterranean; a causative factor of a new nature can be seen in this ebbing of Egyptian power ‚Äî the rise of Assyria and its intrusion into Phoenicia around the year 1100 BCE.A. Malamat, The Egyptian Decline in Canaan and the Sea-Peoples, included in 'The World History of the Jewish People', vol. III: Judges, Rutgers University Press (1971), page 36 After a wait of almost a year at Byblos, Wenamun attempted to leave for Egypt, only to be blown off course to Alashiya (Cyprus), where he was almost killed by an angry mob before placing himself under the protection of the local queen, whom he called Hatbi. At this point the story breaks off. Analysis German) It was once widely believed that the Story of Wenamun was an actual historical account, written by Wenamun as a report regarding his travels. However, literary analysis conducted by Egyptologists since the 1980s (Helck 1986) indicates that it is a work of historical fiction, a view now generally accepted by most professionals working on the text. As Sass (2002) summarized the situation, \\"In recent years most Egyptologists have come to regard Wenamun as a work of fiction, composed after the events it relates, its value as a historical source rather limited (see also end of Section 4). On the other hand students of the Ancient Near East and of Egypto-Levantine connections, thirsting as they are after every scrap of written information, often still treat Wenamun practically as a primary historical source of the late 20th dynasty.\\" As examples of the latter approach, Sass cites Mazar (1992), Kitchen (1996), Millard (1998), Yurco (1999), Ward (1999), Markoe (2000), Leahy (2001), and Weinstein (2001). For details on the former approach, see Baines 1999; Scheepers 1992; Egberts 2001; Sass 2002; Schipper 2005. Jaroslav ƒåern√Ω found that the text had no corrections, and was apparently written without any interruptions, such as would have been caused by simultaneously composing the document. In general, the literary character of the text is summed up by Egberts (2001:495) as being apparent from the sophisticated plot, the rhetoric and irony of the dialogues, the imagery, and the underlying reflection on political, theological, and cultural issues. Specific grammatical features also point to the literary nature of the text. Moreover, the palaeography of the text points to a Twenty-second Dynasty date for its composition (Caminos 1977:3; Helck 1986:1215), as well as a number of anachronisms more reflective of a post-Twentieth or Twenty-first Dynasty time frame (Sass 2002; Sass specifically states it was written during the reign of Shoshenq I). The text ends quite abruptly, possibly showing that the person writing the text down was only interested in the first part of the narrative, and stopped when he realized that he had continued too far into the return journey. However, it has also been suggested that the text as it stands is complete and nothing has been lost at the end, with the last words (And she said to me: \\"Be at rest\\") as a fitting, but hitherto unrecognized closing formula.Friedrich Haller, GM 173 (1999), 9 Finally, at the end of the text, in a slightly larger hand, the syllable (copy) is written, showing that it is not the original, which of course limits the value of paleography as a means to date the content of the story. It would be na√Øve to assume that there have only been two copies of this narrative: a 20th Dynasty original and a 22nd Dynasty copy. The literary elements in the surviving text (such as the 'too good to be true timeframe' which was pointed out by Arno Egberts)Egberts, \\"Hard Times: The Chronology of 'The Report of Wenamun' Revised\\", Zeitschrift fur √Ñgyptischen Sprache 125 (1998), pp. 93‚Äì108. suggest that in-between the events described and the apparent date of our surviving copy the story was somehow reworked to entertain a broader audience. From the fact that many of the main protagonists are not properly introduced, it seems clear that the 'report' became 'literature' at a time when most of the names and situations were still recognizable for an educated audience. A case in point is the ambiguous reference to \\"the messengers of Khaemwase who spent 17 years in this country and died in their positions \\" in lines 2, 51-53. Since this could theoretically refer to either Ramesses IX, Ramesses XI or the son of Ramses II, it seems that the editor of the text could expect his readers to know who was meant. It is quite possible that the copy we have may date as much as one- hundred and fifty years later than the original. The first reason for this assumption is that the post-script is used. This is otherwise only used in the twenty-second dynasty (945-715 BCE). The other reason is the locale where the document was discovered--the Upper Egyptian town of al-Hibah. This town only gained any degree of importance under the reigns of Shoshenq I and Osorkon I. There was also apparently a renewed interest in the affairs of the Levant during the twenty-second dynasty. The author of Wenamun possibly wrote the original manuscript as an administrative document, a report of his journeys. However, the man who had the document copied over a century later most likely had a different reason. When theorizing about the purposes of the copyist, it seems to be all-too-common to forget about the reverse side of the papyrus. This concerns, as near as we can tell, the \\"sending of commodities by Ni-ki.. through the agency of Ne-pz-K-r-t for unspecified payment.\\" It could be that this is a summarization of an attempt to perform a mission similar to that of Wenamun in this later time. The Journey of Wenamun to Phoenicia, then, may have been copied as a preparation for this later trip. Importance of the document The Story of Wenamun is an unparalleled source for learning of conditions in Egypt, as well as in Phoenicia. One can also see from this document, as from no other of the period, common attitudes toward religion (especially the cult of Amon), the state of Mediterranean shipping practises, and even the attitudes of foreign princes to Egyptian claims of supremacy in the region. Even the supremacy of the pharaoh in Egypt is placed under our scrutiny. The current pharaoh, Ramesses XI, is never even mentioned during Wenamun's journey. Thebes, Wenamun's hometown, is under the control of Herihor --the High Priest of Amon. The authority Wenamun goes to see in the delta is Smendes, who resides at Tanis, and bears the never-before-seen title \\"organizer-of-the-country\\". It is worthy of note that neither Smendes nor Herihor bear any royal title whatsoever. Overall, the Story of Wenamun presents to us what could possibly be the most vivid and descriptive narrative of pre-classical times. Because the text is based on a historical framework, it remains particularly useful to historians for the study of the late New Kingdom and early Third Intermediate Period. They often treat the text as a primary source of the late 20th Dynasty. The Story of Wenamun was discovered with another historical fiction, the so-called Tale of Woe [Papyrus Pushkin 127], which takes the form of an imaginative letter as a vehicle to convey a narrative; see Caminos 1977 for discussion of both works.  The geography of Wenamun questioned  One scholar, Alessandra Nibbi, has written a great number of articles in which she tried to show that many modern interpretations of geographical references in Ancient Egyptian texts are incorrect. On the basis of her analysis of the source texts, she concluded that the Egyptians were not a seafaring nation.A. Nibbi, Wenamun without Cyprus, Discussions in Egyptology 53 (2002), 71-74 Egyptian words normally connected to the Mediterranean (such as ‚Äúthe great ym of Kharu‚Äù) and the connected geographical names were reinterpreted.A. Nibbi, The City of Dor and Wenamun, Discussions in Egyptology 35 (1996), 76-95 As a result of her investigations, she had to ‚Äòrelocate‚Äô the locations mentioned in ‚ÄòWenamun‚Äô, assuming that Wenamun journeyed through the wadi Tumilat to lake Timsah. Although, so far, her conclusions have not been accepted by any major scholars, her work has led to a renewed study of certain terms.Florence Friedman, On the Meaning of W3·∏è-Wr in Selected Literary Texts, GM 17 (1975), 15-21  References  Further reading  *Baines, John R. 1999. \\"On Wenamun as a Literary Text\\".

The earliest theatrical reference to Knepp is from 1664, as being intended by Thomas Killigrew to play the part of Lusetta in his play Thomaso. This means that she was probably in his troupe, the King's Company, by that time. From 1666 onwards she is recorded as playing many parts, both tragic and comic, including Lady Fidget in William Wycherley's The Country Wife. In 1664, she became the first woman to perform the title role in Jonson's Epicoene. She also occasionally spoke prologues and epilogues, and often danced and sang in or between acts. Knepp's husband was reputedly \\"ill-natured\\" and treated her badly. Samuel Pepys was fascinated by Knepp, and his diary for 1666‚Äî68 is full of references to her, including mentions of amorous encounters, and descriptions of how much he enjoyed her flirtatiousness and especially her singing. In the late 1670s she became mistress to the actor Joseph Haines, and died in 1681 giving birth to his stillborn child.

It's Resnais' first feature-length work. It is the documentation of an intensely personal conversation between a French-Japanese couple about memory. It was a major catalyst for the Left Bank Cinema, making use of miniature flashbacks to create a nonlinear storyline. It brought international attention to the new movement in French cinema, along with films like Breathless and The 400 Blows. The film features Resnais' innovative use of brief flashbacks sequences to suggest a flash of memories. The movie is widely considered to be one of the most influential movies of the French New Wave. In 2012, Swedish director Roy Andersson chose it as one of the greatest movies of all time. Plot An extended prologue shows a man and a woman embracing each other amidst falling ash. A female voice recounts seeing the devastation caused by the Hiroshima bomb on August 6, 1945 while a male voice refutes her claims, saying she saw nothing. They continue to disagree with each other as news footage of the attack is intercut with footage of the victims, new war memorials, and buildings in Hiroshima. Elle stands on a hotel balcony in Hiroshima, overlooking the city. She comes back inside to see her lover, Lui, naked and asleep on the bed. He wakes up, and the two begin their day. Elle goes to work on the film set of an anti-war film while Lui goes to a World War II museum before visiting the set. Throughout the film, the two converse about memory and forgetfulness as Elle prepares to go back to France, putting an end to their brief relationship. That evening, Elle and Lui go to a restaurant and discuss their murky pasts. Elle grew up in the French town of Nevers under German occupation during the war. She fell in love with a young German soldier and the two made plans to elope, only for him to be shot and killed on the day of Nevers's liberation by the Allies. Traumatized, Elle was publicly ostracized for her relationship with the soldier and imprisoned in the basement of her parents' home. Her health eventually recuperated to the point where she could travel, and she arrived in Paris on the day of the Hiroshima bombing. Lui, a Hiroshima native, was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army during the war but was away on duty when the bomb dropped and wiped out his family. He returned to Hiroshima after the war and became an architect, during which time he also married. The pair continue to compare their past relationships with the bombing of Hiroshima and the perspectives of anonymity shared by the people inside and outside the incident. Eventually, Lui asks Elle to stay with him but she turns him down as she has family in France and he has a wife. Reaching the conclusion that her love for Lui is doomed to fail, similar to her love for the German soldier, Elle goes back to the hotel and Lui follows. She lashes out at him, claiming that she is already starting to forget who he is. Exasperated, she begins calling him \\"Hiroshima\\"; Lui affirms that he is Hiroshima and that she is \\"Nevers.\\" Cast *Emmanuelle Riva as Elle *Eiji Okada as Lui *Bernard Fresson as L'Allemand *Stella Dassas as La M√®re *Pierre Barbaud as Le P√®re Production According to James Monaco, Resnais was originally commissioned to make a short documentary about the atomic bomb, but spent several months confused about how to proceed because he did not want to recreate his 1956 Holocaust documentary Night and Fog. He later went to his producer and joked that the film could not be done unless Marguerite Duras was involved in writing the screenplay. The film was a co-production by companies from both Japan and France. The producers stipulated that one main character must be French and the other Japanese, and also required that the film be shot in both countries employing film crews comprising technicians from each. Reception Hiroshima mon amour earned an Oscar nomination for screenwriter Marguerite Duras as well as the Fipresci International Critics' Prize at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, where the film was excluded from the official selection because of its sensitive subject matter of nuclear bombs as well as to avoid upsetting the U.S. government.Lanzoni, Remi Fournier French Cinema: From Its Beginnings to the Present, London: Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., 2004, p229 It won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association in 1960. In 2002, it was voted by the international contributors of the French film magazine Positif to be one of the top 10 films since 1952, the first issue of the magazine. Hiroshima mon amour has been described as \\"The Birth of a Nation of the French New Wave\\" by American critic Leonard Maltin. New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard described the film's inventiveness as \\"Faulkner plus Stravinsky\\" and celebrated its originality, calling it \\"the first film without any cinematic references\\". Filmmaker Eric Rohmer said, \\"I think that in a few years, in ten, twenty, or thirty years, we will know whether Hiroshima mon amour was the most important film since the war, the first modern film of sound cinema\\".Kent Jones, \\"Time Indefinite\\", essay for the Criterion Collection DVD release. Accessed 23 May 2007 Among the film's innovations is Resnais' experiments with very brief flashback sequences intercut into scenes to suggest the idea of a brief flash of memory. Resnais later used similar effects in The War Is Over and Last Year at Marienbad. It was shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, as well as having nine screenings at the Harvard Film Archive between 28 November and 13 December 2014. Film references In his book on Resnais, James Monaco ends his chapter on Hiroshima mon amour by claiming that the film contains a reference to the classic 1942 film Casablanca: Cultural errors In Japan Journals: 1947-2004, film historian Donald Richie tells in an entry for 25 January 1960 of seeing the film in Tokyo and remarks on various distracting (for the Japanese) cultural errors which Resnais made. He notes, for example, that the Japanese-language arrival and departure time announcements in the train scenes bear no relation to the time of day in which the scenes are set. Also, people pass through noren curtains into shops which are supposedly closed. The noren is a traditional sign that a shop is open for business and is invariably taken down at closing time.Richie, Donald Japan Journals: 1947-2004, Berkeley: Stone Bridge Press, 2004, p126 In popular cultureMusic= The film has inspired several songs. *The English band Ultravox recorded a song called \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" for their 1977 album Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. The song was later covered by the Australian band The Church on their all- covers album A Box of Birds in 1999. Another notable version was recorded by Jan Linton on his King Records Japan-only album Planet Japan in 2004. The song is still performed live by former Ultravox! singer John Foxx, with his current group John Foxx and the Maths. *In 1983, the rock band Alcatrazz recorded a song called \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" for their debut album No Parole from Rock 'n' Roll. The song was written by English singer Graham Bonnet (ex-Rainbow) with Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen. Bonnet‚Äôs lyrics and song title were inspired by the film which he had seen in school. The song became one of the band‚Äôs most popular and is still being performed live (2017) by the Graham Bonnet Band. *In 2004, the Peruvian band El Hombre Misterioso released the album Pez Raro, which included the song \\"Mon Amour\\". The lyrics and song title were inspired by the film. The line \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" is heard in the chorus. *In 2008, The (International) Noise Conspiracy released the album The Cross of My Calling, which included the song \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\". =Film= *In 2001, Japanese film director Nobuhiro Suwa directed a remake, titled H Story. *In 2003, Iranian film director Bahman Pour-Azar released Where Or When. The 85-minute film places Pour-Azar's characters in the same circumstances as Resnais' nearly a half century later. However, the current global tension of today's world is the backdrop instead of post-war Hiroshima. When screening the film, Stuart Alson, who founded the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, said that the piece was \\"a parallel line of work with the French masterpiece Hiroshima mon amour\\".

The village was once home to a sizable population but now consists of less than 30 households. On the banks of the river Kaveri, this village is the site of one of the oldest temples of Varadaraja, a form of Vishnu.  Legend  Centuries back, sages Ruchika Muni and Mrigashinga Muni did Tapasya (penance). The Ruchika Muni's ashrama was on the left bank of Cauvery and Mrigashinga Muni's ashram was on the right bank that is now Hemmige (also called Gajaranya Kshetram also known as Siddha Ashrama Kshetram). Mrigashinga did severe penance to Goddess Bhramrambhika. Appeased with sage's penance, Bhramrambhika (Goddess)appeared before him and asked what he wanted. Sage Mrigashinga asked for Moksha (divine salvation), but the Devi told that her brother Sriman Narayana (Lord Vishnu) alone can give her Moksha. But she also indicated that Her brother Lord Varadharaja is residing in an anthill on the bank of Cauvery and he should do the Prathistapana (establish) and do Pooja (worship) him and then only through him he could attain Moksha. Thereafter, Sage Mrigashinga dug the Ant hill and found a beautiful Moorthy (stone Idol) of Lord Varadharaja with Shanku, Chakra and Gada and with Abhaya Hastha pose with his Consorts Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi seated on Garuda Peetam. Bhramrambhika also gave the sage a golden Vigraham of Hemambika with Shanku, Chakra, and Abhaya Hastha in left hand held Hemadri Hills, because of which the place was known as Hemambika Agrahara and in later days it became Hemmige.https://web.archive.org/web/20060708064019/http://www.karnatakavaishnavatemples.net/Mysore/Hemmige.htm Hemmige There is another interesting story of how the Perun Devi Thayar came to Hemmige. There lived a lady named Modesinghamma, in whose dream Perundevi thayar appeared and told that she could be found in a small place in Mysore Devaraja Market. Then, Modesinghamma traveled to Mysore and met the Maharaja of Mysore and explained her dream. The Maharaja told her that if the moorthy was found then she could take it to Hemmige. Thus idol of Perun devi Thayar in Padma Peetam was found and taken to Hemmige.  Srivaishanva saints  Hemmige is also connected with many of the Vishistadvaita saints starting with Ramanuja who stayed here for ten days on his way to Talakad. Vedantha Desika also stayed here for many days before he proceeded to Sathyagala. Andavan Ashram (Mutt) has a connection with Hemmige from the days of Periya Andavan, Chinna Andavan, KaTAndethi Andavan (Srinivasa Ramanuja Maha Desikan), Nam Andavan, Thembarai Andavan, Akkur Andavan, ThiruKudanthai Andavan who all visited Hemmige for some time and did the Mangala Sasnam of Varadharajar at Sri Varadharaja Swamy Temple.  Hemmige Iyengar  Hemmige Iyengar is one sub sect among the several subdivisions or subcastes of the Shrivaishnavas; the other subcastes, in alphabetical order, are, Bhattacharya, Embar, Hebbar, Hemmigeyar, Kadambiyar, Kandade, Kilnatar, Mandyattar, Maradurar, Metukunteyar, Morasanad, Muncholi, Nallanchakravarti, Prativadibhayankarattar, Someshandal and Thirumaleyar. The Hemmige iyengars are all Vadakalai and Vaidikas who migrated from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu and settled at Hemmige near Talakadu in Mysore District.

Shows often featured former Olympic and US National Champion figure skaters who had retired from formal competition. Started in 1940, the Ice Capades grew rapidly and prospered for 50 years. A decline in popularity ensued in the 1980s, and the show went out of business around 1995. There have been several attempts to revive the show and its name. Similar traditional ice-skating entertainment shows included the Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice. History Ice Capades was founded in February 1940 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, by nine men who called themselves the Arena Managers Association. They met to discuss forming an ice show to play in their arenas during the 1940-1941 entertainment season. The arenas represented were all well-known venues of the day: * Boston Garden (Massachusetts) - represented by Walter A. Brown * Buffalo Memorial Auditorium (New York) - Louis Jacobs * Cleveland Arena (Ohio) ‚Äì Al Sutphin * Hershey Sports Arena (Pennsylvania) ‚Äì John B. Sollenberger * New Haven Arena (Connecticut) ‚Äì Nathan Podoloff, brother of Maurice Podoloff * Philadelphia Arena, Pennsylvania ‚Äì Peter A. Tyrrell * Pittsburgh's Duquesne Gardens, Pennsylvania ‚Äì John H. Harris * Rhode Island Auditorium, Rhode Island ‚Äì Louis Pieri * Springfield Coliseum, Massachusetts ‚Äì Eddie Shore In 1936, Harris had hired the legendary skater Sonja Henie to perform between periods of ice hockey games. She created a sensation among Pittsburghers, confirming his faith in ice skating's potential as a spectator amusement. The other arena managers agreed with this assessment, chose the name \\"Ice Capades\\", and formed a group of skaters. =Early years= Crowd came to the show of the Ice Capades at Montreal Forum, 1944. Ice Capades program from 1945, showing the many production numbers, and the large size of the cast. Single-themed shows had not yet been developed. The group's first performance was four months after its founding, on June 16, 1940, at New Orleans Municipal Auditorium. The show closed there on June 29 and moved to Atlantic City Convention Hall, where it played nightly from July 19 through September 2. Famous skaters in the large cast included Belita, Vera Hruba, and Robin Lee. The group's first touring season under the Ice Capades name covered 24 cities between November 1940 and May 1941. The show's success spawned two films from Republic Pictures, Ice-Capades (1941), and Ice-Capades Revue (1942). The films featured actors and entertainers such as James Ellison, Ellen Drew, Jerry Colonna, and Phil Silvers, as well as the Ice Capades skaters. They were not considered to be films of quality, and the first one was panned by The New York Times. In 1942, the show featured world champion skater Megan Taylor, new talent Donna Atwood, and an acrobatic team from Boston called the Hub Trio featuring Leonard Mullen, Kenneth Mullen and Eddie Raiche. They were the first in the world to perform a back flip without the use of hands. The next year, U.S. figure skating champion Bobby Specht joined the show; he would be actively involved with Ice Capades for the next 31 years. 1943 also introduced the \\"Old Smoothies\\", Orrin Markhus, 51, and his partner Irma Thomas, 44, plus Trixie, the skating juggler. The production number \\"Toys for Sale\\" was the first story on ice with original words and music. =Later years= Ice Capades shows were extremely popular for several decades and became a household name, although they were criticized by some as kitsch. From 1941 through 1981, the Ice Capades show was a summertime fixture at what was then known as Atlantic City Convention Hall. In 1946 Ice Cycles, a co-production, was formed with Ice Follies. In 1949, Ice Follies left the Ice Cycles show leaving it under Ice Capades' ownership. Starting in 1949, Ice Capades started adding Disney's character segment to their performances. Costumes from those shows were used at the opening of Disneyland in 1955, and some performers were hired away by Disney. Harris sold the company circa 1964 to Metromedia. By the mid 1970s, Ice Capades had grown to three different touring companies under one Ice Capades umbrella: The East Company (the original 1940 company), the West Company, and the Continental Company (formed in 1974). In this period, they owned several railroad baggage cars that were used to transport the show. In 1986, then-owner Metromedia sold Ice Capades, 15 Ice Chalet skating rinks, and the Harlem Globetrotters as a package to International Broadcasting Corporation for $30 million. =Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades= A decline in popularity began in the 1980s, and the parent company went bankrupt in 1991. Olympic champion Scott Hamilton joined the show in 1984 but later left to start his own show, Stars on Ice. On June 24, 1993, Dorothy Hamill, who headlined the East Company from 1977 to 1984, bought Ice Capades' assets in a bankruptcy sale via Dorothy Hamill International company. Hamill International developed Frozen in Time: Cinderella on Ice, a theatrical style show billed as Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades. The new company took on millions in loans to stay afloat, but attendance figures remained stagnant. In May 1994, the Shriners dropped its sponsorship of the Christmas show in favor of Disney On Ice. In February 1995, Hamill sold the company for $10 million to television evangelist Pat Robertson's company, International Family Entertainment (IFE). Hamill and her husband, Dr. Ken Forsythe, were retained as president and CEO, respectively. Ice Capades planned a tour of arenas as well as a TV special in China's Tiananmen Square but went out of business a short time later. The tour had a lackluster season which led Hamill to leave the company. IFE then searched for a management firm to handle the touring company for an equity stake. Instead, however, IFE sold Ice Capades in late 1995, to Del Wilber & Associates, while retaining the option to reacquire a majority ownership stake for 10 years. In 1996, Ice Capades and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer developed The Magic of MGM, which included Dairy Queen among its sponsors. On August 15, 1997, Del Wilber shut down operations and laid off the performers. IFE had apparently continued to fund the Ice Capades as a secured creditor. IFE was acquired by Fox Kids Worldwide, funding was halted, and two scheduled tours were canceled. Analysis Analysts believe the increasing popularity of the sport of figure skating meant that more sophisticated audiences came to prefer straightforward Olympic-style ice-skating competitions, or skating shows for adults (i.e., without cartoon characters), such as Stars on Ice. At the same time, shows such as Disney on Ice (featuring Disney cartoon characters) successfully competed for the child audience. =Revivals and reunions= In the fall of 2000, Ice Capades was resurrected by Garden Entertainment in its original format, with a large cast of skaters. The new show was conceived, directed, and choreographed by the former German pair skating champion Almut Lehmann Peyper. The show was not a financial success and closed in November 2000, canceling the remaining tour dates. Another attempt to revive Ice Capades was made in the spring of 2008, with plans for a tent show production called \\"Mystika\\", billed as \\"Cirque Meets Ice\\". In mid-August 2008, auditions were held in Lake Placid, New York for the all new Ice Capades. Developed by Entertainment Holdings and Red Brick Entertainment, Ice Capades was announced for production as live skating shows, television specials, episodic series, and web content. Three-time U.S. pairs champion and two-time Olympian JoJo Starbuck was named as Artistic Director. However, in April 2009, the tour was canceled by its organizers, Garden Family Shows, stranding many of the performers without pay and leaving suppliers unpaid. Reunions Former Ice Capades skaters have organized reunions, typically held every five years. The 2010 reunion, held in Las Vegas, commemorated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Ice Capades, and was attended by more than 500 people. The 75th Diamond Jubilee Celebration was held in June 2015. Productions Licensed characters and properties used in productions included \\"A Flintstone Fantasy\\" (1967), \\"Hey Kids, Meet The Snorks!\\" (1985) and \\"The Ewoks\\" (1986). From 1989 to 1990, as part of the show's 50th anniversary, the Ice Capades had a tour that featured a variety of segments, including appearances from Olympic medalist Elizabeth Manley, Super Mario Bros., and Barbie. On December 28, 1989, ABC aired the Ice Capades in a special hosted by Jason Bateman and Alyssa Milano. The special was written by Bruce Vilanch. Ice Capades theatrical shows * Frozen in Time: Cinderella on Ice (1993) * Hansel, Gretel, the Witch and the Cat (1994) an adaptation of Hansel and Gretel * The Magic of MGM (September 1996) =Ice Cycles= In 1946, Ice Cycles was started as a co- production with Ice Follies and was designed to tour in smaller cities. They used skaters and production numbers from both tours. In 1949, Ice Follies left the Ice Cycles show, leaving it under Ice Capades' ownership. Ice Cycles continued as a second tier touring company. In 1956, the Ice Cycles name was dropped in favor of the name Ice Capades. Notable skaters These are some of the many notable skaters who appeared in Ice Capades shows or were involved in other aspects of the company: Year-by-year rosters of skaters and other personnel have been published on a website by former skaters. Portable ice rinks In the early 1950s, the group started using portable ice rinks, called \\"tanks\\". This made it possible for them to perform in arenas that did not have their own ice surface, greatly expanding the number of venues where the show could operate. It took several days and 30-40 workers to install the tanks. In the late 1960s, Ice Capades designed and patented a new portable ice rink system that could be installed in less than 10 hours on most arena basketball floors or other surfaces. Chalet skating rinks In 1966, Ice Capades bought an ice skating rink in Topanga Plaza shopping center, Canoga Park, California. The success of this venture led to the establishment of the Ice Capades Chalet Division, which owned and operated about 13 rinks, ran ice skating schools, and developed a curriculum that could develop a skater from beginner to competitive skater. Most of the Chalets were in California and Texas; others were in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. The chalets were started by Michael Kirby, former voice of Ice Capades shows, and eventually expanded to over two dozen facilities under the management of ISI Hall of Famer and Ice Capades VP, Michael R. Booker. In popular culture *In the Ramones song \\"Judy is a Punk\\", the two main characters of the song Jackie and Judy travel to Berlin to join the Ice Capades. *Sitcom episodes and movies with a plot involving tickets to the Ice Capades were still being written years after the demise of the company in the movie While You Were Sleeping with Sandra Bullock and also including episodes of The Drew Carey Show, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, Gossip Girl, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. * The show has been widely parodied, for example by cartoonist Gary Larson's comic strip The Far Side with good-natured comics captioned \\"Ice Crusades\\" and \\"Dirt Capades\\". *Whoopi Goldberg in the film Sister Act 2 reveals that her character wanted to join the Ice Capades when she was a little girl, and that they were \\"very cool\\". * Woody Allen in his film Hannah and Her Sisters: \\"And Nietzsche, with his theory of eternal recurrence. He said that the life we lived we're gonna live over again the exact same way for eternity. Great.

He entered El Mundo during high school years as a typesetter, and went on to become the owner of the newspaper. He also founded Radio El Mundo and WKAQ-TV Telemundo. Early years Ramos was born into a poor family in the northern town of Manat√≠, Puerto Rico. He was the only son born to Juan Ram√≥n Ramos V√©lez and Braulia Torres Giliberty, and only 3 years old when his father died. He was raised by his mother and an aunt, He finished his primary education, however in 1917, when he was 15 years old, he felt that in Manati he didn't have a future and left his home; he then moved to San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico.Angel Ramos While living in San Juan, he went to school at the Central High School and found a job in El Mundo, a then-recently founded newspaper. He started as a typesetter. In 1924, when he was 22 years old, he was promoted to the position of administrator. El Mundo newspaper In 1944, Ramos purchased the newspaper's holding company and thus, became the sole owner and publisher of the newspaper. He met his future wife, an Italian girl by the name of Argentina Schifano while on a business trip to New York City. After they were married, the couple continued to live in Puerto Rico where Ramos's company was based. Ramos founded WEMB-Radio El Mundo and within a period of two years he purchased another radio station, WKAQ, thus establishing \\"Radio El Mundo\\" as the number 1 radio station in Puerto Rico which controlled 80% of the total air time.History of Puerto Rican television Telemundo In 1954, Ramos founded the first Puerto Rican television station, WKAQ-TV that was transmitted through Channel 2 and which he named \\"Telemundo\\". Ramos wanted to maintain a consistent branding between his properties using the \\"mundo\\" theme (\\"mundo\\" is the Spanish word for \\"world\\"). Telemundo's first television signal was transmitted on January 28, 1954. Argentina Ramos was active in her husband's newspaper, radio and television companies. They later set up a network in the former British colony of Guyana, though it was not particularly successful it was an indication of his ambition being carried over into those who followed in his footsteps. Sadly, they failed in their attempt because Spanish was not a common language in that country. Awards and recognitions In 1950, Ramos was the recipient of the Mar√≠a Moors Cabot Award, bestowed upon him by Columbia University.Puerto Rico: Figuras, apuntes hist√≥ricos, s√≠mbolos nacionales, por Esther M.

He was the President of the Executive Committee of the Interamerican Press Society. Death and Legacy On September 1, 1960, Angel Ramos died in New York City of a cerebral hemorrhage. His wife Argentina became the head of El Mundo Enterprises. She established the Angel Ramos Foundation, which is now the largest private philanthropic foundation in Puerto Rico.Angel Ramos Foundation In 1963, Argentina remarried and moved to Miami, Florida.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, attended and served on the faculty of Massachusetts Normal Art School, and died in nearby Brookline. As a painter, he was noted for seascapes and portraits. Munsell is famous for inventing the Munsell color system, an early attempt at creating an accurate system for numerically describing colors. He wrote three books about it: A Color Notation (1905), Atlas of the Munsell Color System (1915) and one published posthumously, A Grammar of Color: Arrangements of Strathmore Papers in a Variety of Printed Color Combinations According to The Munsell Color System (1921). The Munsell color order system has gained international acceptance and has served as the foundation for many color order systems, including CIELAB. In 1917, he founded the Munsell Color Company. Biography Albert Henry Munsell is best known for his contributions in Color Science and his Color Theory, which led to one of the first Color Order Systems, the Munsell color system. He was born on January 6, 1858, in Boston. He went on to graduate from the Massachusetts Normal Art School, which is now known as the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. He was later hired by the Normal Art School as an instructor, where he lectured about Color Composition and Artistic Anatomy. In 1905, Munsell published his book, A Color Notation which described his new Color Theory. Later, he published his book Atlas of the Color Solid which preceded the Munsell Book of Color. The Munsell Book of Color described his color order system and was the first to include actual samples of the colors in the system. Munsell spent most of his later life traveling around Europe to present his work to painters and scientists. Munsell's work created an important bridge between art and science. Munsell established the Munsell Color Company in 1917. He died shortly after on June 28, 1918. Munsell color theory During his study of color, Munsell realized the need for an organized way of defining colors. He wanted to create a system that had a meaningful notation of color, rather than just color names that he found were \\"foolish\\" and \\"misleading\\". He set out to create his color space in 1898. To do this, he used his unique inventions to help make measurements to organize his system. One of these inventions was the photometer. This device measured the luminance of an object, and Munsell used this to make measurements of different colors and to help define how color changes. This information would later become his three dimensions of color. He also patented an invention called the \\"Spinning Top\\". This device was similar to the rotating color wheel developed by James Maxwell, where several colors were placed on the top and the top was spun, mixing the colors together. Munsell used this device to measure the relationship between chroma and value, which helped him create templates for each step in chroma and value for every hue. With these tools, Munsell was able to define three dimensions that define color. He also paid close attention to the sensitivity of the human visual system, and considered this when creating the steps between colors in his system, particularly his value scale. He called these dimensions Hue, Value, and Chroma. This wheel shows the principal hues of Munsell Hue. Inside the wheel, the notation for Munsell Hue can also be seen. Munsell Hue is the attribute of color by which we distinguish red from green, blue from yellow, and other colors. Munsell chose several colors to be the principal hues. These are Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple. These hues were arranged in a circle. Each hue can be mixed with the same amount of the neighboring hues to create intermediate hues: yellow- red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and red-purple. Each color can be defined by how much of each principal hue it contains. A color that is composed of just a principal hue would be given a number 5. So, the red primary would be given the number 5R. If you move to the left of the red hue, the number increases, with the color exactly in between red and yellow-red defined as 10R. Continuing around the circle, the number of the color goes back down to 1YR right after 10 red, until the color is composed of just the yellow-red primary, in which case the color would be 10YR. So, the number represents how much of the primary hue the color contains. Munsell Value defines the lightness of a color, or how much black or white the color contains. The neutral color scale, from black to white with neutral greys in between, all have a hue of 0, which means they do not contain any hue. Instead these colors only change in value. Black would have a value of 0N, with N designating value. White would have a value of 10N, and middle grey would have a value of 5N. A grey in between middle grey and black would have a value of 2.5N. This value scale is based upon visual experiments. The middle grey is visual perceived to have equal amounts of black and white, and so on for other greys. It was very important for Munsell to create a system that was based on the human visual response to color. The final dimension created was chroma. Before the Munsell color theory, chroma was not a term used in the art or scientific community. Instead, the intensity of color was defined as saturation. However, Munsell felt it appropriate to break up saturation into two different dimensions, namely value and chroma. Chroma defines the difference between a pure hue and a pure grey. So, a color with a chroma of 1 would be very close to a grey. It is important to note that the maximum chroma of a color is defined by the hue of the color. For example, a color with a yellow hue will have less chroma values than a color with purple hue. This is because of the human visual sensitivity to different hues. Again, this shows how the human visual system is modeled through the Munsell color theory. With each of the dimensions defined, it is now possible to distinguish a color based on its Munsell Notation. Take for example the color 2.5YR 3/4. This color is between red and yellow-red, but closer to yellow-red, has a value of 3 which is closer to black, and has a chroma of 4. Munsell also wanted to create a standard way of measuring and viewing color. To do this, he investigated the relationship between the color and the light source used for illumination. In short, he found that the light source used drastically effected the color perceived. To help in this investigation, Munsell visited the Edison Light Company. He eventually developed the standard for daylight viewing of colors for accurate color evaluation. Munsell color order system To help display and organize his color theory, Munsell created the Munsell color system. It is set up to organize each color by the color's hue, value, and chroma. Each dimension of a color can be changed independently of the other dimensions. This helped Munsell organize the colors in a three- dimensional space, known as the Munsell Color Space. To create this space, Munsell first took the neutral colors, and aligned them vertically, with black on the bottom and white on the top. In between, the neutral greys were spaced out in equal visual intervals. So, as one moves up in the space, the value of each row increases. Next, Munsell organized the chroma as increasing away from the center. So as one gets farther away from the center, the chroma increases. The hue is positioned at different angles protruding away from the center neutral colors. The distance between each color was visually uniform, because the system was derived from vigorous testing of the human visual response to color. This arrangement turned out to be known as the Munsell color tree. This image shows the Munsell Color space and the orientation of the hue, value, and chroma dimensions. By organizing the Munsell color system in this way, the Munsell tree has many advantages. One advantage is that the system is designed for new colors to be added. If the spacing between two colors is too large, an intermediate color can be placed in between those two colors. What is important is that adding new colors this way will not disturb the order of the other colors. In other words, the other colors' dimension values will not change. Another advantage of this system is that it made it very easy to communicate color. Each color is given its own values, which can be thought of as coordinates in the space. Therefore, to communicate color, the coordinates of the color can stated, and the exact color will be known. So, the Munsell color system created a standard system of color specification. It also proved to be the groundwork for many other color spaces, such as CIELab. This is because Munsell did much of the pioneering work in Color Science, and other systems expanded on what he already discovered. However, there are some limitations to the Munsell color system. While it is handy to have a system with visual uniformly spaced colors, the space is not continuous, meaning that it has a discrete number of samples. Also, the spacing between the colors are very large, and because of this it is difficult to measure thresholds using the system, such as the just noticeable difference. These limitations inspired the CIE to develop a uniform, continuous color space for characterizing color differences. This turned out to be the CIELab color space, which was heavily influenced by the Munsell color system. A few changes were made to the System since it was first developed. in 1943, the OSA recommended a change in the notation of the system, and these changes became known as the Munsell re- notations. In 1950, the number of hues in the Munsell Book of Color doubled from 20 to 40. Then in 1958, a glossy version of the Book of Color was produced in addition to the matte version already in print. Color education One of Albert Munsell's goals in life was to standardize the way color was taught to children. Primarily, he wanted to focus on Grades 4 through 9. During September and October 1904, Munsell met with Miss Peterson, the Superintendent of Drawing for Boston, and Mr. Pritchard, Master of the Everett School in Boston, and worked with them to create the Color Education Primer. The Color Education Primer was created around the principles of Color Theory. It established the education of where colors come from, how they can be measured, and how they can be compared and organized. Munsell described the goals of the primer as to teach children to, \\"...describe a color (locates), relate the color to others, writes by a notation, names, harmonize and find them.\\" Later, these objectives became the ground work for creating the Munsell Book of Color. Munsell, Peterson, and Pritchard agreed on the primer to help demonstrate the \\"rules\\" of the Munsell Color Theory. Today, the Munsell Color Theory still stands as the basis of color education. It provides a simple, meaningful way to describe colors and organize them. Many companies, such as X-Rite, have color education services that are based on the Munsell Color Theory. These services help describe where color comes from, the basics behind how the Munsell Color Order System is designed, and how it can be implemented. Different resources such as books, posters, and learning kits can be found on X-Rite's website. Bridge between art and science With his work in creating a systematic way of defining color, Albert Munsell created a necessary bridge between art and science. His color order system has enough structure to allow scientists to expand upon and use it, while being simple enough for artists with no scientific background to use it for selecting and comparing colors. Munsell's System essentially created a way of communicating color. Munsell wanted the study of color to be similar to the study of music. In music, one can simply hear a note and how it relates to other notes based on the position of the note on the staff. Munsell wanted it to be possible to see a color based on three dimensions. This would describe a color and relate that color to other colors. These dimensions were also designed so that they could be understood by artists and scientists alike. It should be observed that in creating these dimensions, Munsell used many different fields of science, such as physiology, psychology, and physics. This relates the idea to color to not only science and art, but to different fields within science as well. Several different editions and page selections from the Munsell Book of Color. Along with his scientific intuition, Munsell's artistic background influenced his choice of the three different dimensions to describe color. This particularly applies to chroma. Before the Munsell color system existed, the term chroma also did not exist. However, the term saturation did exist among the art community. The saturation of a color described how pure and how bright a color was. Munsell saw this as being two different dimensions, and decided to break it up into two different dimensions, chroma and value. To support his new idea of chroma, Munsell consulted several scientists on how it should be properly defined. They all agreed that chroma was a new term. One of these scientists was Dr. House from Johns Hopkins University. Munsell met with him, and described how each dimension would define color. After explaining these dimensions, Dr. House noted that Munsell's three dimensional color theory would encompass all sensations of color, and is consistent with Herring's Opponent process theory. He also noted that \\"the physicist is busy with spectral hues, but the physiologist, like the painter, is busy with the sensation.\\" This again shows how art and science rely on each other in the world of color. Munsell continued to gain support from other scientists for his new color space. He visited Harvard and MIT, and met with scientists such as Edward Charles Pickering. One collaborator, Professor Dolbear, exclaimed \\"(Munsell) may furnish a track across what is now a desert between practical and scientific color work.\\" Munsell Color Company The Munsell Color Company was established in 1917. The purpose of the company was to continue the lifelong passion of Munsell in establishing color standards using his color theory. After his death in June 1918, Munsell's son, Alexander Ector Orr Munsell, took over the company. Under Alexander's management, the company continued to improve the Munsell color system by improving the color scales in the Munsell Book of Color. However, in 1942, Alexander was forced to sell the company assets, and the Munsell Color Foundation was created. In 1983, the Foundation donated funds to Rochester Institute of Technology. This resulted in the creation of the Munsell Color Science Laboratory, which still exists today. In the laboratory, research and advances in the field of Color Science continue to be made. The Munsell Color Company is now owned by X-Rite, a company that works with color calibration. The main goals of the company reflect the ideals that Munsell adopted for his life, such as improving color communication, education, and service. X-RIte was purchased by Danaher Corporation in 2012.

Description Ipomoea aquatica grows in water or on moist soil. Its stems are or longer, rooting at the nodes, and they are hollow and can float. The leaves vary from typically sagittate (arrow head-shaped) to lanceolate, long and broad. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, in diameter, and usually white in colour with a mauve centre. Propagation is either by planting cuttings of the stem shoots, which will root along nodes, or by planting the seeds from flowers that produce seed pods.

It flourishes naturally in waterways, and requires little if any care. It is used extensively in Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Lao, Cambodian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Chinese cuisine, especially in rural or kampung (village) areas. The vegetable is also extremely popular in Taiwan, where it grows well. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II, the vegetable grew remarkably easily in many areas, and became a popular wartime crop. Water spinach has been found to be cultivated in the following countries:Austin, Daniel F.

B√∂hme. \\"Selection of water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica Forssk.)-genotypes for protected cultivation in temperate regions.\\" I International Conference on Indigenous Vegetables and Legumes. Prospectus for Fighting Poverty, Hunger and Malnutrition 752. 2006. In non-tropical areas, it is easily grown in containers given enough water in a bright sunny location. It readily roots from cuttings. = Requirements for climate and soil = Water spinach is ideal for sub-tropical and tropical climate, as it does not grow well below 23.9 ¬∞C and is sensitive to frost. High soil moisture is beneficial for the growth. Clay soils and marshy soils rich in organic matter are suitable for water spinach. The ideal pH range for the growth is from 5 to 7. The provision of shade has been shown to have a positive influence on the yield of water spinach.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print. = Traditional way of cultivation = Water spinach is cultivated in a variety of systems. In Hong Kong, two methods are traditionally used: The dryland method and the wetland method. In the dryland method, water spinach is grown on raised beds which are separated by irrigation ditches. The seeds can be sown directly onto the beds. Alternatively, a nursery may be used and the seedlings are transplanted when they reach a sufficient size. In either case, the distance between the plants should be about 12 cm by the time they are 15 cm tall. Regular irrigation is crucial in the dryland system and so is a sufficient fertilization. Water spinach cultivated with the dryland method is ready for harvest 50 to 60 days after sowing. Harvesting is being done by pulling up the whole plant.Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \\"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web. The wetland method is the traditionally more common and important method for cultivation in Hong Kong: In the wetland method, water spinach is cultivated on flat fields surrounded by raised banks, which have oftentimes been used as rice paddies in the past. These former rice paddies have a heavy clay soil with an iron-pan. This helps to retain water for the water spinach. The seedlings to be used in this methods are usually grown in a nursery on a dry field, as the germination under water is quite poor. Six weeks after sowing the seedlings, cuttings for transplation can be taken from them. One cutting is an approximately 30 cm long cut from the stem containing seven or eight nodes. This is then planted in the field with a spacing of about 40 cm. The field is beforehand prepared by flooding it to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. The soil itself is tramped into a liquid mud so that the cuttings can root easily. Once the plants are established, the depth of the flooding is increased to 15 to 20 cm. The first harvest in the wetland method can usually be done at around 30 days after the transplantation. Also, the harvesting differs from the dryland system: In the wetland, the upper part of the main shoot is cut at about water level. This stimulates lateral growth and produces horizontal shoots carrying vertical branches. After the first harvests, every seven to ten days throughout the summer, these vertical branches can be harvested. After the planting period, the fields are drained and once the fruit of the water spinach is ripe, it is harvested, dried, then trodden to release the seeds which are to be used for the following season.Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \\"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web. = Use of fertilizer = How much fertilizer is used for the cultivation strongly depends on the region. Most research is from the '80s and '90s. Generally, it has been shown that a dose of 60 kg N/ha is sufficient and that the application of K can be beneficial on the yield. Also, the application of plant growth regulators, for example Adenine and Zetanine, has been found to be an effective means to promote water spinach growth. One study has determined, that the highest yields are produced with the application of 60 kg/ha of N, 90 kg/ha of P2O5 and 50 kg/ha of K2O for the first harvest. For the second harvest the optimal fertilization was determined as 120 kg/ha of N, 45 kg/ha of P2O5 and 100 kg/ha of K2O.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print. Taiwan: In Taiwan the usual fertilization includes the basic application of about 10 t/ha of cowdung followed by 50 kg/ha of Ammonium Sulphate after each harvest.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print. Bangkok: In Bangkok it is common to apply about 300 kg/ha of NPK fertilizer twice a month.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print. Indonesia: In Indonesia, usually 150 kg to 300 kg of NPK are being applied per hectare.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.  Pathogens and pests  There are several pathogens and pests reported, affecting I. aquatica. Pythium causes problems like damping-off, Cercospora leaf spot and root nematodes. Also, aphids may be problems in fields. Additionally, there are several polyphagous insects feeding on I. aquatica. Lepidoptera species include Diacrisia strigatula Walker and Spodoptera litura. The ‚Äúwoolly-bear‚Äù caterpillars (D. virginica [Fabricius]) of the eastern United States and Diacrisia strigatula (Chinese tiger moth) are other species with wide food preferences. A specialist pathogen on I. aquatica is the oomycete Albugo ipomoeae-aquaticae, though its range is restricted to southern and southeast Asia. Invasiveness Ipomoea aquatica is listed by the USDA as a noxious weed, especially in the states of Florida, California, and Hawaii, where it can be observed growing in the wild. In the US, water spinach has mainly become a problem in Florida; why is unclear although the fast growth rate has been cited as a threat to native plants in certain areas of Florida. It could be owing to the time since introduction, or owing to climatic factors.Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \\"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web. I. aquatica has been extensively cultivated in Texas for over 30 years, having been originally brought there by Asian immigrants. Because no evidence indicates the plant has escaped into the wild, Texas lifted its ban on cultivation for personal use with no restrictions or requirements, noting its importance as a vegetable in many cultures, and also began permitting cultivation for commercial sales with the requirement of an exotic species permit. Possession of I. aquatica has been prohibited in Florida since 1973, but it is still being grown and sold illegally. Some of the infestations in Florida public lakes have been eradicated, or at least attempts have been made.Langeland, K.A. & K.C. Burks. 1998. Editors of Identification & Biology of Non-Native Plants in Florida's Natural Areas. University of Florida, Gainesville In Sri Lanka it invades wetlands, where its long, floating stems form dense mats which can block the flow of water and prevent the passage of boats.Gunasekera Lalith. Invasive Plants, A Guide to the Identification of the Most Invasive Plants in Sri Lanka, Colombo 2009. Culinary uses The vegetable is a common ingredient in East, South and Southeast Asian dishes, such as in stir-fried water spinach. In Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the tender shoots along with the leaves are usually stir-fried with chili pepper, garlic, ginger, dried shrimp paste (belacan/terasi) and other spices. In Penang and Ipoh, it is cooked with cuttlefish and a sweet and spicy sauce. Also known as eng chhai in the Hokkien dialect, it can also be boiled with preserved cuttlefish, then rinsed and mixed with spicy rojak paste to become jiu hu eng chhai. Boiled eng chhai also can be served with fermented krill noodle belacan bihun and prawn mi. In Indonesian cuisine it is called kangkung, boiled or blanched together with other vegetables it forms the ingredient of gado-gado or pecel salads in peanut sauce. Some recipes that use kangkung is plecing kangkung from Lombok, and mie kangkung (kangkong noodle) from Jakarta. In Thailand, where it is called phak bung (), it is eaten raw, often along with green papaya salad or nam phrik, in stir-fries and in curries such as kaeng som. In the Philippines, where it is called kangk√≥ng, the tender shoots are cut into segments and cooked, together with the leaves, in fish and meat stews, such as sinigang. The vegetable is also commonly eaten alone. In adobong kangk√≥ng (also called apan-apan), it is saut√©ed in cooking oil, onions, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce. In ensaladang kangk√≥ng (or kinilaw na kangk√≥ng), it is blanched and served in vinegar or calamansi juice and fresh tomatoes and onions with salt and pepper to taste. In binagoongang kangk√≥ng (or ginisang kangk√≥ng), it is saut√©ed with garlic and topped with bagoong alamang (shrimp paste) or bagoong isda (fermented fish) and sliced fresh tomatoes and onions, commonly also with cubed crispy liempo (pork belly) or pork adobo. It can also be spiced with siling haba or siling labuyo peppers, soy sauce, black pepper, and sugar. It differs from adobong kangk√≥ng in that it does not use vinegar. A local appetiser called crispy kangk√≥ng has the leaves coated in a flour-based batter and fried until crisp, similar to Japanese vegetable tempura.

Various plants, including I. aquatica, have been tested for this use. Owing to its being edible and thus marketable, it could be an attractive option for this use.Li, M., Wu, Y. J., Yu, Z. L., Sheng, G. P., & Yu, H. Q. (2007). Nitrogen removal from eutrophic water by floating-bed-grown water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica Forsk.) with ion implantation. Water research, 41(14), 3152-3158. =Animal feed= Water spinach is fed to livestock as green fodder with high nutritive value‚Äîespecially the leaves, for they are a good source of carotene. It is fed to cattle, pigs, fish, ducks and chicken.Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print. Moreover it is mentioned that in limited quantities, I. aquatica can have a somewhat laxative effect. Health effectsMedicinal use= I. aquatica is used in the traditional medicine of southeast Asia and in the traditional medicine of some countries in Africa. In southeast Asian medicine it is used against piles, and nosebleeds, as an anthelmintic, and to treat high blood pressure. In Ayurveda, leaf extracts are used against jaundice and nervous debility. In indigenous medicine in Sri Lanka, water spinach is supposed to have insulin-like properties. Water extracts of I. aquatica showed a blood sugar-lowering effect in Wistar rats. An aqueous juice of 100g plant material was given 30 minutes before eating glucose to diabetes 2 patients. After 2 hours it could be observed that blood glucose peak level was reduced by around 30%. Also antioxidant bioactive compounds and anti-microbial substances could be detected in water spinach. Furthermore, plant extracts of water spinach inhibit cancer cell growth of Vero, Hep-2 and A-549 cells, though have moderate anti-cancer activity. =Health risk= Many of the waters where water spinach grows are fed by domestic or other waste. Pigs in south east Asia are a natural reservoir for the parasite Fasciolopsis buski. Infections in the Mekong regions resulted from feeding water spinach. Infections of F. buski in humans through water spinach can be anticipated. The infection can be prevented by proper preparation such as frying or boiling.Yoshihara, S., Hung, N. P., Hung, N.

It is an efficient accumulator of cadmium, lead and mercury. This characteristic can be dangerous if water spinach is planted for human or animal feed in polluted aquatic systems. Mercury in water spinach is composed mostly as methylmercury and has the highest potential of becoming a threat to human health. The edible parts of the plant have a lower heavy metal concentration.

The great seal is in the possession of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Great Seal was created by the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 on the creation of Northern Ireland for possession by the Governor of Northern Ireland to \\"be used for all matters in Northern Ireland for which the Great Seal of Ireland was theretofore used\\".Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922, Schedule, paragraph 2(4). This remained until the imposition of direct rule in 1972, followed by the abolition of the post of Governor in 1973, when it was presented to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Design The seal was designed by Nevile Wilkinson, the Ulster King of Arms, based on the Great Seal of the Realm but with the royal coat of arms bearing an escutcheon with a red cross on a gold field, the basis of the historical coat of arms of Ulster and the sinister banner on the coat of arms of Northern Ireland, also designed by Wilkinson. The first Great Seal of Northern Ireland was provided in time for the state opening of the 1924 session of the Northern Ireland Parliament. Prior to this, the Governor of Northern Ireland (James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn) used his private seal instead, as permitted by the 1922 act.e.g. The 1924 seal had an image of the reigning monarch, George V. The British practice is to strike a new seal for a new monarch, but Edward VIII abdicated before his Northern Ireland seal had been struck, and the 1924 seal was not replaced until 1938 with one for George VI. The new seal for Elizabeth II was delivered to the Governor, John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst, on 5 November 1953 at a meeting of Privy Council of Northern Ireland, whereupon the obsolete seal was ceremonially defaced with a hammer by the Clerk of the Council and gifted to the Governor. In 1985 the 1924 great seal was acquired by the National Heritage Memorial Fund for the Ulster Museum. Uses Letters patent by the monarch under the Great Seal of Northern Ireland are used for the following: * Senior judicial appointments to the courts of Northern Ireland, including the Lord Chief Justice, Lords Justice of Appeal, and High Court judges.Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978, section 12, as substituted by the Northern Ireland Act 2009 * Royal assent to bills of the Northern Ireland Assembly.Northern Ireland Act 1998, section 5(3). All justices of the peace for Northern Ireland are appointed under a single commission of the peace; the commission was issued under the Great Seal of Northern Ireland, whereas the instrument appointing a justice is issued by the Department of Justice without the seal. Wafer seals The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1945 authorised the preparation and use of a die bearing the same device as the obverse of the seal, and the impression embossed by means of the die on, or on a wafer or other material attached to, a document confers on the document the same validity in all respects as if it had been authenticated by, or passed under, the Great Seal itself.Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1945, section 3. Section 49 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 makes similar provision for the creation of wafer versions of the Great Seal of Northern Ireland, which is valid for use on letters patent signifying royal assent to bills of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The wafer seals are used by the First Minister and Deputy-First Minister acting jointly. List of Keepers of the Great Seal of Northern Ireland The following are Keepers of the Great Seal, who served as Governor of Northern Ireland (1922‚Äì1973) *1922 James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn *1945 William Leveson-Gower, 4th Earl Granville *1952 John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst *1964 John Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine of Rerrick *1968 Ralph Grey, Baron Grey of Naunton The following are Keepers of the Great Seal, who served as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1973‚Äìpresent). *1973: William Whitelaw *1973: Francis Pym *1974: Merlyn Rees *1976: Roy Mason *1979: Humphrey Atkins *1981: Jim Prior *1984: Douglas Hurd *1985: Tom King *1989: Peter Brooke *1992: Sir Patrick Mayhew *1997: Mo Mowlam *1999: Peter Mandelson *2001: John Reid *2002: Paul Murphy *2005: Peter Hain also Welsh Secretary *2007: Shaun Woodward *2010: Owen Paterson *2012: Theresa Villiers *2016: James Brokenshire *2018: Karen Bradley *2019: Julian Smith *2020: Brandon Lewis See also * Great Seal of the Irish Free State * Great Seal of the Realm References Ireland, Northern Category:Government of Northern Ireland Category:Law in Northern Ireland Category:Symbols introduced in 1924 Category:1924 establishments in Northern Ireland ","title":"Great Seal of Northern Ireland"},{"id":"1615808","text":"The Amazon Trail is an educational computer game created by MECC. It was inspired by the popularity of The Oregon Trail, featuring the areas surrounding the Amazon River and some of its tributaries. In this 2-D adventure, the player is asked to set out on a journey up the Amazon, hoping to make it to the lost Inca village of Vilcabamba. Along the way, the player learns about the people who live on and use the river for their survival. The Amazon Trail is known for being significantly more difficult than its predecessors in the franchise, such as The Oregon Trail. There are two sequels, Amazon Trail II and Amazon Trail 3rd Edition. It was released in 1993 for MS-DOS, 1994 for Windows 3.x and 1996 for Windows and Macintosh. Plot During the opening sequence, a short animation displays a person asleep in bed, coincidentally, in Peru, Indiana. He/she is visited during a dream by a jaguar who calls himself the jaguar of the Inca King. The jaguar explains that the Inca people are endangered by malaria and European explorers, and the player will be taken back in time in order to search for cinchona and deliver it to the king. The jaguar from the dream appears throughout the game as a hazy vision, running off a checklist of items desired by the Inca King, and offering various gloomy sentiments about the rainforest in general. Gameplay Bel√©m in the game.alt=A screenshot from The Amazon Trail showing the city of Bel√©m, Brazil. At the start of the game, the player has been transported to Bel√©m, Brazil, and is given the option of choosing one of two native guides (Isabel or Antonio), who offer advice over the course of the game pertinent to navigating the river and maintaining ample supplies & good health. Each guide comes equipped with a slightly different spread of supplies (Antonio has more tents, while Isabel has more food). Players may come across various people along the river, taking photographs of the flora and fauna of the area, fishing, and canoeing. Players must navigate the treacherous waters of the Amazon to avoid hitting other boats, logs, and whirlpools or paddling up the wrong tributary, travel through the forest in search of exotic plants and animals to photograph and identify, use harpoons to fish in the river and then identify whether the catch is edible, and trade with the individuals encountered at the various stops along the river. In order to aid in identification, each time a picture is taken or fish caught, the player has the option of checking the guide, which lists all of the species in the game except for the \\"new species\\". There are multiple dangers. Capsizing could lead to loss of supplies and injury, or even cause the player to drown resulting in an instant game over. When fishing one has to be wary of spearing an electric eel or stingray as this may lead to a loss of health (though the latter is regarded as edible). The player can contract a variety of diseases (including malaria and yellow fever), requiring multiple days of rest to recover. Paddling up the wrong tributary for too long will result in being captured by headhunters or western explorers. A unique aspect of the game is the element of traveling back in time, which allows the user to learn historical information in addition to science. Before arriving at a new town or tributary, players pass through a \\"blue mist\\" over the river (a line of fog across the screen). Upon arriving at a landmark, the option is given of talking to two people, typically one native and one Westerner. Often, the duo offer conflicting information and advice. The timeframe spans from the then- present (1993) back to the Middle Ages. Historical figures appear, such as Henry Ford, Theodore Roosevelt, and Claude L√©vi-Strauss. The player is given a good feel for the differing attitudes and clashing roles portrayed by the encountered individuals, pertaining to the history of the Amazon. Many of these figures have interesting items which can be acquired in trade for food, clothing, etc. Upon reaching the hidden city in which the Inca are living, players are graded on various aspects of the game, including the amount of personal activity on the journey, the number of plants and animals correctly identified in the rainforest, whether or not they acquired additional gifts for the Inca King, and, depending on the version of the game, the amount of time taken, the health of the player, and the completion of mini-quests. Based on these factors, the player is awarded a shield covered in designs. Each task completed translates to an additional gem on the shield. Educational Goals Amazon Trail incorporates realism including photographs and audio recordings taken at the corresponding locations. Facts on 30 different famous people of the Amazon basin are covered as well as South American history, culture and ecosystems. The game helps players develop comprehension, survival and navigation skills, without any complicated tasks required and quest clues to follow. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1993 warned of The Amazon Trails \\"severe\\" hardware requirements, but approved of the \\"entertaining adventure's ... splendid animation and authentic native music\\", and its teaching of planning, research skills, and history.

It is a term common to synthesizer programming, and is a typical waveform available on many synthesizers. The exact shape of the wave is determined by the duty cycle of the oscillator. In many synthesizers, the duty cycle can be modulated (sometimes called pulse-width modulation) for a more dynamic timbre.Reid, Gordon (February 2000). \\" Synth Secrets: Modulation\\", SoundOnSound.com. Retrieved May 4, 2018. The pulse wave is also known as the rectangular wave, the periodic version of the rectangular function. The average level of a rectangular wave is also given by the duty cycle, therefore by varying the on and off periods and then averaging these said periods, it is possible to represent any value between the two limiting levels. This is the basis of pulse width modulation. The Fourier series expansion for a rectangular pulse wave with period and pulse time is :f(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\tau}{T} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{2}{n\\\\pi} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi n\\\\tau}{T}\\\\right) \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi n}{T} t\\\\right) Note that, for symmetry, the starting time () in this expansion is halfway through the first pulse. The phase can be offset to match the accompanying graph by replacing with . A pulse wave can be created by subtracting a sawtooth wave from a phase-shifted version of itself. If the sawtooth waves are bandlimited, the resulting pulse wave is bandlimited, too. Another way to create one is with a single ramp wave (sawtooth or triangle) and a comparator, with the ramp wave on one input, and a variable DC threshold on the other. The result will be a precisely controlled pulse width, but it will not be bandlimited.

A Add- a-ball :Allows the player to add additional balls by achieving a specific task e.g. during an active multiball. A feature especially popular on the latest generations of Stern machines. Earlier in pinball history, add-a-ball was actually used to describe that a player can earn extra balls. Apron :The large attachment at the very bottom of the playfield, which usually holds a score and/or instruction card and which covers the ball trough. The front edges of the apron lead the ball to the drain. Autosave :For a limited time, every ball that goes down the drain will be returned to the plunger. Usually only available when starting with a new ball (to compensate for \\"unfair\\" very fast drains), it will also be available during the start of multiballs on later machines. Also known as Ball Saver. B Backbox :The vertical \\"head\\" of the pinball machine, where the score is displayed. Backglass :The upright glass panel in the backbox, displaying the game's title and a game-themed illustration. Usually has several unprinted areas through which the score and credit/match displays are viewed. Ball Lock :On some machines, a progression of \\"ball locks\\" leads to a multiball. On older machines this referred to the physical mechanism that would store the balls on the playfield. Ball Saver :See autosave. Ball Search :On most solid state games, if no scoring activity is detected for a certain period of time, all moving components of the game will cycle in sequence in an effort to free any ball or balls that may have become stuck. Banana Flippers :Curved flipper bats found on Williams' Disco Fever and Time Warp games, shaped much like a banana. Bank :See drop target. Bonus (End-of-Ball Bonus) :One of the universal paradigms of pinball games is the end-of-ball bonus. During play, certain shots and events can increase a bonus score or a multiplier, which is then applied to the player's score when the ball drains. The rules for the ball bonus vary from game to game - some games simply increase the bonus during play, and some add scores from various in-game modes and counters (e.g. the number of door panels and hitchhikers collected in Twilight Zone). Bumper :An upright, typically cylindrical or rectangular area, that applies force to the ball when hit. The cylindrical variety is referred to as a mushroom bumper, when capped with a circular top, which usually lights up to show the points scored when the bumper is hit. :When flippers were introduced on Humpty Dumpty, they were referred to as \\"flipper bumpers\\"; this use is no longer live and \\"bumpers\\" never refers to \\"flippers\\". :Active bumpers are referred to as \\"jet bumpers\\" by WMS Industries and Midway Games (after the 1988 Williams-Midway merger), \\"pop bumpers\\" by Gottlieb, \\"thumper bumpers\\" by Bally Technologies (before the 1988 Williams- Midway merger) and \\"turbo bumpers\\" by Data East. Buy-In :Many modern pinball machines give the player the option to continue their game after the last standard ball has drained, usually at a cost of one credit. Some games also keep a separate high-score table for games completed in this manner, so that \\"true\\" high scores are separated from ones that might be artificially increased through the use of extra credits. These scores are usually displayed as \\"Buy-In High Scores\\". Continuing the game sometimes also provides extra benefits, such as an extended ball-saver period or starting a mode automatically, to give the player an incentive to spend the extra credit(s). C Captive ball :A pinball trapped within a small area of the playfield. The captive ball never leaves this area, and the free ball can never enter it. However, the free ball can knock into the captive ball, which in turn can knock into targets in its area. Some tables even feature multiple stacked captive balls (e.g. Judge Dredd, Big Bang Bar), and some provide fixed balls as targets to trigger a moving captive ball (Theatre of Magic). Combo :Combo (or combo shot) refers to an immediate combination of different moves, often continuous ramp and/or orbit shots. Some machines, like Taxi, Theatre of Magic, and Demolition Man, reward combo shots by an increasing number of points, depending on the number of successful consecutive shots made. Conversion kit :Special equipment that can be used to transform one pinball table into another. D Dead bumper :See Passive bumper. DMD :A dot-matrix display is a pixel-addressable display used to display the score and other status during the game. Almost always placed in the backbox (exception: Cirqus Voltaire). Most machines released from 1992 onwards, starting with Data East's Checkpoint, released in 1991, feature this display. Some exceptions are the two VGA-driven \\"Pinball 2000\\" series machines, pinball games that uses a LCD- display such as the machines from Jersey Jack Pinball and Heighway Pinball or retro style machines such as Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons. Drop target :An upright, pressure-sensitive rectangle that drops below the playfield when hit by the ball. Drop targets are often arranged in so-called banks, and may require being hit in combination or in sequence to score or light special features. Drain :The common term used to refer to the area beneath the flippers. If the ball rolls into the drain area via an outlane or between the flippers, it will be lost. Also refers to the act of losing a ball in this manner. E Electro-mechanical (EM) :A pinball machine design that relies on relays, motors and switches to run. This design was phased out in the late 1970s. EM machines are easily recognized by their scoring displays that have mechanical score reels that spin to show the score. Newer machines are referred to as solid state (SS). Extra ball :An additional bonus ball that can be earned by achieving a specific task. F Flipper :A tapered bat, typically found in pairs at the bottom of the table, that is the player's primary means of controlling the ball. Normally a downward slope extending the bottom structure of the table, one end is moved upward in an arc when the player taps the appropriate button. G GI :An acronym of general illumination, this refers to the lights on the playfield used simply to make the playfield visible in a dark room. Also known as street lighting Gobble hole :A hole in a pinball table that ends the game or the current ball if the ball falls in it. On most games with this feature, the gobble hole will be lit for a special and/or a large number of points once some other in-game objective has been completed. One game with this feature is Slick Chick. H Habitrail :A wireform path for the ball to travel in a straight line. May consist of either two wires on the bottom, or four wires to fully enclose the ball. Hurry-up mode :An optional side mode in which the player is challenged to complete a task within a brief time limit to earn bonus points. Traditionally, hurry-ups start with a large point value, which rapidly decreases over several seconds; completing the task stops the countdown and awards its value. Another common variant is to use a hurry-up to determine the shot value of a mode that starts immediately afterward, where it can be collected multiple times. I Inlane : The inside lane of the pinball machine. See \\"lane\\" for more information. J Jackpot :A specially designated point bonus; typically among the highest amounts that can be scored with one shot. In earlier games (mid-late 80s), scoring the Jackpot was the ultimate goal of the game, requiring the player to complete a precise and difficult set of tasks to score it. The Jackpot would continue to build slowly over many games until it was scored. More modern games simply call any multiball shot award a \\"jackpot\\" and the values are more downplayed. K Kickback :A launching mechanism located inside an outlane that saves the ball from being drained if it falls in there. Kickbacks are usually disabled at the start of a session and can be activated as a reward during play, although there are some exceptions, like the virtual table 3D Pinball Space Cadet. Most tables tend to utilize only one kickback and leave one outlane unprotected for increased difficulty and revenue. Kickout hole :A depression in the pinball table that the ball can fall into. This is usually just large enough for the ball to fit into it. After gaining some points, and/or adjusting the game state, the ball is kicked back into play in a predictable direction and speed. L Lane :A lane is in general any area of the table just wide enough to let the ball pass through. Special kinds of lanes are inlanes and outlanes; both types are situated at the bottom of the playing field. The outlanes are at the far ends and connect to the bottom (causing loss of the ball), the inlanes are next to them and connect to the flipper area. M Magic post :A post that can rise up between the flipper fingers and completely block the middle drain. Sometimes also called Recovery Post or Up post. Magna-save :A feature that allows the player to activate a magnet located just below the entrance to an outlane. A ball headed for the outlane will be held by the magnet and diverted to the corresponding inlane instead. Williams Electronics pioneered this feature on the Black Knight game. Match :The chance to win a free game after the last ball has drained. On most machines the free game is received when the last two digits of the score match a pseudo randomly picked two digit number. The winning chance can be altered by the operator. Most modern games incorporate a short animated skit that culminates in the match number selection. Mode :A configuration of the table where specific goals must be met in a limited time to score points, hitting specific lanes or dropping specific targets, sometimes combined with multiball. Some tables have multiple modes that must be activated in order, usually building up to an \\"ultimate\\" last mode or the wizard mode where the most points can be scored. Multiball (multi- ball) :A situation where a series of balls are shot onto the playfield. Multiballs are either a mode that can be selected by the gamer, or can be triggered in the pinball machine that forces the other balls to roll on the playfield. O Outlane :See lane. The outlanes are generally the outside lanes at the sides of the playfield that lead the ball to the drain (sometimes with a possibility of striking a peg and re-entering the adjacent inlane). Orbit :A path for the ball that hugs the outer rim of the game. Orbits generally have a slingshot effect; sending the ball into an orbit generally means it returns immediately from another. Orbits are generally named for the side of the playfield on which the ball enters (e.g. the \\"left orbit\\" means the ball enters the orbit on the left side and travels to the right). P Passive bumper :A bumper which does not kick the ball when hit, although it may register a score or play a sound effect. Also known as a dead bumper. PCB :Abbreviation for the printed circuit board. Circuit boards are used in solid state machines. Most are located in the back box. Others circuit boards can be located under the playfield or in the main cabinet. Plunger :A player- controlled, spring-loaded rod that allows the player to send the ball into the game. The plunger is usually located at the bottom right corner of the pinball machine. Popper :A device that launches the ball vertically, often to a raised playfield. Peg :A small, stationary vertical post with a rubber ring, designed to deflect the ball away from sensitive parts and to reject poorly-aimed shots. Some games place a peg between the flippers, giving the ball a chance to bounce away from the drain and back onto the flippers (see also \\"Magic Post\\" and \\"Stopper\\"). Playfield :The main flat surface of the game, on which targets, ramps, orbits, flippers and bumpers are arranged. \\"Playfield\\" refers both to the surface itself and to the overall play area (to distinguish it from other parts of the machine such as the backbox). The ball rolls along this surface. Many games refer to the \\"lower\\" playfield (nearest the player) and the \\"upper\\" playfield (nearest the backbox). In some cases, this distinction is more literal, as in the separate, vertically-arranged playfield levels in Black Knight 2000. R Ramp :A section of the playfield with a raised gradient. Ramps generally lead either to raised playfields or to inlanes. Replay :A free game received after a certain score is reached. Rollover :A flat switch residing in the playfield itself. A rollover is activated when the ball rolls over it. S Scoop :A hole that catches the ball. Score motor :A motor in an EM pinball cabinet used primarily to ensure that score reels are updated correctly. It activates relays repeatedly until a specific task is completed. Also known as a \\"cam timer\\". Slam tilt :This particular form of tilt is given if the machine is nudged with such violence that it risks damaging the hardware. Such an action generally sounds an alarm and causes the machine to reset (hence voiding the credit). A slam tilt is sometimes also given if force is applied to the coin box. Sling shot :The triangular objects on either side of the flippers that propel the ball toward the middle. Solid state :A pinball machine design that relies on computers and printed circuit boards to run. This design was introduced in the late 1970s. SS machines are easily recognizable by their scoring displays, which are powered by electricity. Older machines are referred to as electro-mechanical (EM) and have mechanical score reels that spin to display the score. Special :Some machines allow the player to earn a free game (called a special in that context) by achieving a specific task (e.g. lighting all monsters and their instruments in Monster Bash). Spinner :A target that is on the playfield and when hit by the ball, rotates. Standup targets (stand-up targets, spot targets) :A standing target on a playfield, similar to a drop target, but which does not drop into the playfield when struck. Stopper :A small metal post, often with a rubber ring, typically found between and slightly below the bottom flippers. If the ball hits the post, it will bounce up and away, saving it from draining. Skilled players can use the stopper to make trick shots. On some tables, the stopper is made available only as a reward. (See also: \\"Peg\\", \\"Magic Post\\") Subway :A track underneath the playfield that moves the ball from one spot on the playfield to another. Usually the ball drops into a hole, and is then ejected from the subway back onto the playfield by a solenoid. Skill Shot :A bonus awarded to the player for completing a specific task when releasing the ball. Most games that include skill shots require the player to either plunge the ball with just the right amount of force to hit a specific target, or to make a specific shot with the flippers as the first shot once the ball is on the playfield. (Not to be confused with \\"combo shot\\".) T Tilt :The tilt mechanism detects when the machine is being lifted, tilted or shaken beyond an acceptable level. Originally designed to prevent players from lifting the front of the machine to cause balls to roll backwards, it also helps prevent damage to the machine's hardware, body and legs by discouraging players from shaking the machine too hard. When the mechanism is triggered, the machine \\"tilts\\", ending play for the current ball and usually forfeiting any bonuses earned. Most modern games provide a configurable number of warnings per ball before tilting. Some older games would void the entire game upon tilt. Toy :Many pinball machines have unique objects on or above the playfield to enhance the theme of the game. They are called \\"toys\\" mainly because they often resemble children's toys and are specific to the machine in question. Some directly impact gameplay, while others are non-interactive or purely cosmetic. For example, Twilight Zone features two significant toys: The Gumball Machine (which stores and releases balls), and a working analog clock (which is used to show the time remaining in various game modes). Another example of a gameplay-affecting toy is the spinning soccer ball in World Cup Soccer. Translight :The plastic or glass sheet in the backbox, generally displaying the game's main illustration on a translucent piece of printed plastic, allowing light to pass through. Also called the \\"backglass\\". The term \\"translight\\" (or \\"translite\\") usually refers more specifically to the printed plastic in modern pinball games using dot-matrix displays, since those displays are mounted underneath the glass, not behind it, allowing the artwork to be one single unmodified sheet. U Up post :See magic post. Up-Kicker :An electro-mechanical feature that physically propels the ball upwards onto a second-tier playfield, as used in Gottlieb's Haunted House. V Vari-target :A target that can be moved by the ball by a varying amount. Normally this directly corresponds to the number of points received, as it is usually risky trying to shoot the narrow target with full force. Vitrigraph :Gottlieb's patented photo-realistic mylar overlay for pinball playfields rather than the industry standard silk screen on the wood. VUK :Short for vertical up-kicker. Synonym for popper. W Wedge Head :Trapezoidal shaped cabinet backboxes when viewed from the front. Widebody :Widebody pinball machines offer more playfield space and more to be packed in but are more expensive Wizard :An exceptionally skilled player. This term comes from the 1969 rock opera Tommy, where the likewise nicknamed protagonist becomes famous, when he masters pinball. The title of the song \\"Pinball Wizard\\" quickly gained acceptance among pinball enthusiasts as an honorific. Wizard mode (wizard bonus) :A special mode or bonus, started only after completing a long and difficult series of tasks in a pinball machine. The first wizard bonus was the \\"King's Ransom\\" in 1989's Black Knight 2000. Woodrail :Pinball machines manufactured prior to appr. 1961 that used wood to frame the playfield glass.

The fraternity has 28 active chapters and 4 colonies throughout Canada and the United States. The fraternity was founded by undergraduate Freemasons, and was originally open only to men who had taken the Masonic obligations, but in 1933 the International Conclave elected to dispense with the Masonic prerequisite. In 1988, at the 45th Conclave, the fraternity elected to use \\"International\\" rather than \\"National\\" when referring to the fraternity. General history The founding members of the Acacia fraternity Acacia fraternity was founded on 12 May 1904, by a group of 14 Freemasons attending the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. From the time of its founding, members of other fraternities were eligible for membership in Acacia. However, the fraternity's rapid growth allowed it to stand on its own as a separate and co-equal fraternity, and in 1921 it dropped the provision that allowed men of other fraternities to join. During the first two decades of the 20th century, Acacia was evolving from its roots as a successful Masonic club into the more standardized model of the other collegiate fraternities of the day. While maintaining its history and the symbolism derived from the Masonic fraternity, because of what Baird's cites (pIII-1) as a decline in the number of student Masons in undergraduate schools, Acacia opted in 1931 to relax the requirement that members must be Masons, removing the provision entirely in 1933. Early chapters were named alphabetically using Hebrew letters; these first 26 chapters at their option continue to use their historical designations today, while younger chapters are named after the institution at which they are located. The fraternity officially became International in 1988 at the 45th Conclave after the addition of the University of Western Ontario Chapter and the petition of the Carleton University Chapter. =Founders= The founders of Acacia fraternity were: * James M. Cooper * Benjamin E. DeRoy * Edward E. Gallup * Jared W. Hawkins * Clarence G. Hill * Harvey J. Howard * George A. Malcolm * Ernest R. Ringo * William J. Marshall * Harlan P. Rowe * Ralph B. Scatterday * Charles A. Sink * Harry B. Washburn * Walter S. Wheeler Acacia is the only general fraternity to be founded at Michigan. =Symbolism= The Sprig of Acacia represents immortality and is one of many Acacia symbols with roots in the Masonic Brotherhood. It is used by that organization during or after a funeral service, to honor a brother who has died. According to tradition, the symbol also reminds participants of the obligation that Masons must provide for the widow and children of their fallen brother. The Acacia fraternity has adopted this and other Masonic symbols, retaining them in linkage to its heritage. The Acacia flag was adopted in 1950. It consists of a vertical triband of gold- black-gold with the fraternity coat of arms on the center (or on a fess cotised sable three right triangles of the field) and the name in gold Old English lettering in an arc at the top. The main symbol and representation of Acacia occurs within a 3-4-5 (base-altitude-hypotenuse) right triangle of the first quadrant. This triangle holds very special significance to the fraternity and its members, symbolizing the imperfect nature of man as well as the struggle to approach an ideal, which symbolically is occasionally represented as a circle. Unless specified otherwise, whenever a triangle is mentioned in this article, a 3-4-5 right triangle of the first quadrant is what is meant. The present Acacia badge is a right triangle of the first quadrant whose sides are of the proportions 3, 4, 5, with the shortest side being the base. The sides are set with twelve pearls--three on the base, four on the altitude, and five on the hypotenuse. The corners are set with garnets. Within the triangle are three small right triangles of the same proportion, outlined in gold on a black enamel background. The badge of Acacia as it appears today was adopted at the second Grand Council of Acacia, which was held on December 6, 1913. The crest of Acacia depicts a three taper candelabrum surrounded by a wreath of Acacia. Below a shield of old gold, on fess cottised sable three 3-4-5 right triangles. Below the shield is a blue ribbon holding the motto of the fraternity in Greek: Œ©Œ¶ŒïŒõŒüŒ•ŒùŒ§ŒïŒ£ ŒëŒùŒòŒ°Œ©Œ†ŒüŒ•Œ£ (\\"Human Service\\" or \\"In Service of Humanity\\"). International operations Acacia fraternity's International Council serves as the organization's supreme executive and judicial body. It is composed of eight officers: six alumni and two undergraduates. Alumni officers' terms run four years, while undergraduate counselors' terms are two years. The Acacia Fraternity Foundation (AFF)The Acacia Fraternity Foundation founded in 1989, is Acacia fraternity's non- profit educational foundation. A 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, the AFF exists to provide scholarships to student Acacians and to support the worthy educational and leadership activities of the fraternity. Chapter operations The leadership of each chapter of Acacia is composed of at least five major officers: the Venerable Dean, Senior Dean, Junior Dean, Treasurer, and Secretary. Most chapters also include in some capacity a Director of Service and Philanthropy, Director(s) of Recruitment, and Risk Manager. The Venerable Dean is often referred to out of the house as the president of the chapter and performs such duties as running meetings and overseeing general house operations. The Senior Dean acts as the vice president of the chapter, stepping in for the Venerable Dean in his absence. In most cases, the Senior Dean is also the pledge educator. The Junior Dean is in charge of all socials including brotherhood events, formals, and mixers. The other two officers perform such functions as are normal for their positions. Some chapters assign additional responsibilities to various officers, so there may be slight variations from chapter to chapter. International events In even-numbered years, the Acacia Fraternity hosts the biennial Conclave, forming the legislative body of the fraternity. Each chapter in good standing is allowed two votes (usually the Venerable Dean and Chapter Advisor). In odd-numbered years, Acacia's Indiana Chapter hosts the Acacia Leadership Academy (ALA) which provides leadership training to undergraduate members of the fraternity.  Controversies  In 1993, the Kansas University chapter of Acacia had its charter revoked after a raucous party that caused $50,000 worth of damage to the fraternity's house. In 2012, the Indiana University Bloomington chapter of Acacia was suspended at least two years for hazing violations. The fraternity has since rechartered. In 2013, two Acacia brothers at Penn State were charged with ethnic intimidation and criminal mischief after spray-painting anti- Semitic language, swastikas, and sexual references at Jewish fraternity Beta Sigma Beta. In 2015, the Purdue University chapter of Acacia was suspended due to underage drinking violations and the rape of an Iowa college student that occurred at the same party. In 2015, the Louisiana State University chapter of Acacia was suspended until 2018 due to hazing violations. In 2015, the Miami University chapter of Acacia closed for failure to comply with Miami's Community Advancement Program (programming and membership development standards), and has no plans to return. In 2016, the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign chapter of Acacia held a controversial party with the Alpha Phi sorority where members dressed in various stereotypical ethnic costumes, triggering a backlash from Black, Latino, Muslim and LGBT student groups on campus. In 2017, Acacia and Millersville University of Pennsylvania were sued for the death of Karlie Hall, who was murdered in her dorm room by her boyfriend Greg Orrostieta after leaving an Acacia party. In 2020, the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign chapter of Acacia was suspended until 2024 for conduct violations.

She sank with the loss of her entire crew in 1925. The vessels were originally intended as \\"submarine monitors\\", but their purpose had been changed before detailed design began. M1 was fitted with a 12-inch (305mm) gun which was intended for use against surface ships in preference to torpedoes, the argument being that, \\"No case is known of a ship-of-war being torpedoed when under way at a range outside of 1000 yards [915 meters].\\" Science Museum, showing the turret Although the gun had an effective range of , it was normally fired using a simple bead sight at periscope depth with only the barrel above the water. It was important for the submarine's gun to sink or disable the target with the first shot, because the gun could only be loaded on the surface. She was long, displaced submerged and operated out of Portsmouth. She was launched on 9 July 1917, but was not involved in active service in the First World War. In 1923, water leaking into the barrel of the gun resulted in extensive damage to the muzzle when it was fired. She sank with all 69 hands in of water on 12 November 1925 while on an exercise in the English Channel when a Swedish ship, , struck her while she was submerged.

Background The original Japanese arcade game and its Famicom counterpart (Hitler's Resurrection) are called . They were \\"wire action\\" games created by Tokuro Fujiwara, based on his earlier 1983 arcade game Roc'n Rope. He originally intended Bionic Commando to be an expanded version of its predecessor Roc'n Rope.The Man Who Made Ghosts‚Äôn Goblins: Tokuro Fujiwara Interview , Continue, Vol. 12, 2003 Plot * In all versions of the game, the protagonist is Nathan \\"Rad\\" Spencer. The below summarizes the plot of Hitler no Fukkatsu on Japanese FC release. Due to anti-Nazi censorship in the West, the international version Bionic Commando omitted all Nazi references like swastikas, and changed the name \\"Hitler\\" to \\"Mr. Badd\\" and \\"Weitzmann\\" to \\"Killt\\"; the main storyline is otherwise unchanged.) The game is set in an alternate timeline, in which Nazism is not completely eradicated following the defeat of the Third Reich in WWII. Nazist ideology was carried on by a nation called \\"the Imperial state\\". The story begins with a solo narrative: somewhere in the 1980s, a top-secret WWII-era Nazi document called \\"Plan Albatross\\" was discovered by the Imperialists. Generalissimo Weitzmann, leader of the Imperial army, decided to realize the plan himself. Another superpower, \\"the Republic\\" (ostensibly modeled after the real-life United States), then at war with the Imperial State, sent a commando named Super Joe to retrieve the plan and to stop Weitzmann. However, Joe lost contact with Republican HQ not long after he entered Imperialist territories. In response, the republicans dispatched another agent, Rad Spencer the Bionic Commando, to rescue Super Joe. Rad singlehandedly infiltrated the Imperialist-controlled areas. Soon he found Joe was indeed captured as a POW. As Joe was freed, he told Rad his discoveries: the \\"Albatross\\" was a wonderweapon that the Nazis did not manage to finish in WWII, and the Imperialists were trying to restore it. However, he was captured before he could learn more. Rad promised him to carry on to sabotage the weapon and the plan for good. Eventually, Rad reached the heart of the Imperialist's secret base. He came just in time to witness the Albatross plan at its final stage: In order to command the \\"albatross\\", an almost-invincible flying gunship, Adolf Hitler must be revived as well. Weitzmann also had his own plan: he wanted to terminate Hitler's revival process and keep the ship to himself. Weitzmann's plan backfired as he got killed by an \\"awakened\\" Hitler, who vowed to conquer the world with \\"Albatross\\". In the ensuing battle, Rad destroyed the airborne Albatross by shooting at its reactors. Hitler managed to jettison to safety, and attempted to escape the base in a helicopter. Rad took his only chance by firing a bazooka shot mid-air at the helicopter's cockpit, blowing Hitler and his plane apart. Hitler's second death also triggered the base's self-destruction sequence. Rad narrowly escaped, and reunited with Super Joe and his other comrade-in-arms. In the ending scene, it was revealed that the narrator at the beginning was Super Joe, who was still alive as of 2010. He hoped the legend of Bionic Commando would be passed on to future generations with his stories. Gameplay The series is notable for being one of few instances of a platform game in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, the hero must use his bionic arm. This was the first game to feature a grappling gun/hook, which later appeared in games such as Earthworm Jim and Tomb Raider.Playing With Power , 1UP Development The music for the original arcade game was developed by Harumi Fujita, a member of the then all- female Capcom Sound Team. Fellow female video game composer Junko Tamiya adapted two of the original arcade tracks (The \\"Bionic Commando Theme\\" and \\"The Powerplant\\") and expanded the soundtrack by adding several new songs in the console versions for the Japanese Famicom and the NES ports of the game. Versions The original arcade game was advertised in the United States as a sequel to Commando, going as far to refer to the game's main character as Super Joe (the protagonist of Commando) in the promotional brochure, who was originally an unnamed member of a \\"special commando unit\\" in the Japanese and World versions. In 1988, Capcom produced a home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, also titled Bionic Commando, that was drastically different from the original arcade game. A version much truer to the coin-op original was released for the Amiga (OCS) in 1988. An adaptation of Bionic Commando for the Game Boy was released in 1992. There was also an MSdos/386 version of the game available circa 1991. Legacy A sequel, Bionic Commando: Elite Forces, was released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color. Though it borrows some elements from its predecessors, Elite Forces has a different plot from the rest of the series. Also, the characters (an unnamed male or female commando) have a few more moves, such as the ability to climb down from platforms, and can also utilize a sniper rifle in some segments to eliminate distant enemies. An enhanced remake of the 1988 NES version was developed by Grin and published by Capcom for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade and was released on August 13, 2008, under the name, Bionic Commando Rearmed („Éê„Ç§„Ç™„Éã„ÉÉ„ÇØ „Ç≥„Éû„É≥„Éâ„Éº „Éû„Çπ„Çø„ÉºDÂæ©Ê¥ªË®àÁîª, Bionic Commando: Master D Resurrection Project in Japan).

Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The game's setup is highly reminiscent of the Mega Man series.Little Samson instruction manual (Nintendo Entertainment System, US) The player jumps with the A button and attacks, usually in the form of a projectile, with the B button. The character's health is shown by a series of bars, stacked vertically, to the left side of the screen. Throughout the stages the characters must defeat enemies and avoid pits, all the while collecting standard power-ups including one ups, energy-replenishing hearts, and spheres which increase the capacity of the character's health meter. The two choices of gameplay the player may choose (Easy, Normal) dictates the level of difficulty. If the player chooses Normal mode, several changes will occur in comparison to if the player chooses Easy. Characters have a limit to how much their health meter may extend (about half of their maximum in Easy mode). Levels will also sport more enemies in Normal mode, and should the player die playing with either the dragon, golem, or mouse, that character will no longer be selectable until the player either uses a potion on them or beats the level. Little Samson on the other hand is always playable, and because of which, he alone can complete almost all the levels alone (exceptions being the introductory levels and the very last level). An uncommon feature of the game is that the player may switch characters at any point during the level. Each character has their own health gauge, but they all share the same ‚Äúlives‚Äù (if the character which the player is using dies, then they lose a life and all heroes' health gauges are restored). When confronted the boss's health is displayed in a similar fashion to the player's but on the right side of the screen. There are two kinds of boss battles; regular bosses, and the dark prince's 4 henchmen. Normal boss battles consist of one fight against a creature Samson and company encounter along the way. A henchman boss battle, however, consists of two phases; their cloaked form, and the boss's true form (typically a large monster). After defeating the boss the player is shown their password.  Synopsis  Plot = A dark prince is freed from his seal by a thunderstorm, and begins to try to take over the world. The kingdom is in peril, and the King orders that the four heroes receive a summon. Four pigeons fly off to meet these heroes, and each reads the summon. From here, the player must navigate all four of these heroes through an introductory course. From here, the strengths of individual characters must be utilized to get through a variety of courses. Several bosses await the heroes, and it is up to the player's strategy to choose which hero(es) will fight the boss. A few levels have branching exits, taking the player to different levels, although each one ends up taking the player to stages marked by skulls on the map. Here, the player fights one of the four wizards that serve as the dark prince's right-hand men, each of which shapeshifts into a larger boss when defeated (Green shapeshifts into a Cyclops, Blue shapeshifts into a magic-wielding knight, Red shapeshifts into a giant dragon, and Yellow shapeshifts into what appears to be the Grim Reaper). Eventually, the player reaches what appears to be the dark prince's castle, and faces a golden wizard-knight at the end (which shapeshifts into a demonic skull). If the game is played on Easy, this is the final level. If played on Normal, the dark prince's true stronghold ‚Äî a castle resting on a giant, green skull ‚Äî arises, and the game continues for a few more levels, ending with a confrontation with the dark prince himself. In the end, through the utilization of all four characters, the kingdom is saved. All story development is shown through pantomimed animated cutscenes. = Characters = Throughout the game the player operates one of four characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The first four stages are each dedicated to a specific character, but upon their completion the player can swap characters at any time for the remainder of the game, and often must do so in order to complete the level. The four characters are as follows: ;Little Samson: Known as in Japan. Samson, for whom the game is named, is the young human protagonist. He is a small, quick character who attacks enemies by throwing bells. He is able to jump higher and further than most characters and has the ability to climb on the walls and ceilings. ;: Kikira is the second hero. As a dragoness, she has the ability to fly for brief periods of time, making her a valuable character in many jumping-oriented stages. She attacks by spitting fire, which travels in a J-shaped arc. The player can increase the strength of her flame by holding down the B button for longer periods of time (if Kikira is green, then the fireball will be small; if purple it will be medium-sized; if pink, it will be large). She is initially hostile to the idea of Samson being the leader and fights him for dominance, but upon her defeat she relinquishes. ;: Gamm is the third hero. Big and bulky, he is the slowest of all the characters but his punch is stronger than any of the other characters' attacks. His size is both a benefit (he takes the least damage from enemy attacks, no damage from spikes, and starts with more health than the other characters) and a hindrance (his jumping ability is severely stunted). He is also the only character who can attack in all four cardinal directions. ;: K.O. is the fourth hero. He has the least health of any character, but is very quick and a great jumper, and is small enough to traverse some narrow passages that are otherwise inaccessible. Just like Samson he has the ability to climb on the walls and ceiling. He is unique in that he attacks by placing bombs.  Development and release  The game is directed by Shinichi Yoshimoto, who had previously worked on Strider and Ghouls 'n Ghosts. One of the artist for the game was Takashi \\"Utata Kiyoshi\\" Kogure. It was released in North America in November 1992 and at the time went virtually unknown with little promotion and sold very poorly. According to PriceCharting.com which tracks sales of classic video games, loose copies of the game have been known to sell for over $1,000 with boxed copies going for more than $3,000.  Reception  Famimaga readers voted to give it a 21.2 out of 30 score. AllGame editor Skyler Miller described Little Samson as one of the best platformers on the NES, touting it as a \\"tour de force of excellent game design, attractive graphics, and pure entertainment value\\". He also described the game's stages as \\"challenging and creatively designed\\".

It is the prequel to Solomon's Key, and is known as Fire 'n Ice in North America and Solomon no Kagi 2: Coolmintou Kyuushutsu Sakusen (Solomon's Key 2: Coolmint Rescue Mission) in Japan. The aim of the game involves players extinguishing all fires in a level in order to proceed. They do this by creating and melting ice or kicking ice onto the fires. This game also has a level editor (which may expose some bugs that substantially affect the game mechanicsFire 'n Ice level editor information at Bespin.org), but only the Japanese version permits saving the levels one creates. An unofficial conversion for Russian ZX Spectrum clones was made in 2003.Unofficial Russian conversion at WorldofSpectrum.org It uses the plot and levels from the original game, but with remade graphics that adhere to platform limitations and music taken from the game Kuru Kuru Kururin. In 2015, another unofficial conversion was released, for the Commodore Amiga.Unofficial Amiga conversion, details on Hall Of Light Gameplay In this game, players control Dana. The goal of each stage is to put out all the fires. The fires are extinguished by either kicking an ice block into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb on top of a solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the ice block is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another ice block, it will freeze to the adjacent surface. There are also other elements that are introduced as the player progresses, including pipes (which Dana can travel through) and jars. Dana can walk across normal jars, but once a jar comes in contact with a flame, it begins to burn. Dana cannot walk across the top of burning jars, and any ice that is created in, or enters the square above a burning jar is destroyed. As players progress, the puzzles get more complicated and difficult. The simple gameplay must be used in new ways by players who wish to complete the game. Plot The following is taken from the video game's instruction booklet: :The Rescue of Coolmint Island :This is a story from long ago, when the powerful wizard Dana was just a beginner. In the sea to the far north, there was a small island made of ice. This island was called \\"Coolmint Island\\". On this beautiful little island of ice, there were many Winter Fairies all living in peace. :But one day... :The wicked wizard Druidle appeared, and let flames loose on Coolmint Island! The flames scattered all over the island, and little by little, they began to melt the ice. The little island was in terrible danger!! The Winter Fairies were determined to do something to save their island, but they were not strong enough to face the flames by themselves. The Queen of the Fairies knew about the danger the Winter Fairies were facing, so she called forth a wizard to fight against the flames let loose by Druidle. :The one chosen by the Queen of the Fairies to defend the island was Dana. This was a tremendous surprise to everybody. Dana was still just an apprentice and had very little magic power of his own. But the Queen knew that Dana had intelligence and possessed more courage than anyone else. Then the Queen gave Dana some special magic that could be used to put out the wicked flames. :\\"And what happened after that, Grandmother?\\" :\\"Well... that's where Dana's adventure begins.\\" Characters *Dana is the protagonist of the game. He is a novice wizard with ice magic which was given to him from the Queen of the Fairies. He is also the main character in the first game, but in Solomon's Key 2 he has different abilities and has been given a graphical make-over. Dana's attire includes a green hat and shirt, an orange cape and boots, and blue pants. He also carries with him the ice wand. *The Queen of the Fairies is the beautiful monarch of Coolmint Island. She gives Dana the ice magic, but does not play a prominent role in the in-game story. *Druidle, the evil wizard, is the antagonist. He is the one who created the flames that must be put out through the game's puzzles. He is also the game's final boss. *The elderly lady serves as the storyteller, and her green-haired grandchildren are the audience.

Resettling of entire populations by ethnicity was a method of political repression in the Soviet Union, although separate from the Gulag system of penal labor. Involuntary settlement played a role in the colonization of remote areas of the Soviet Union. This role was specifically mentioned in the first Soviet decrees about involuntary labor camps. Compared to the Gulag labor camps, the involuntary settlements had the appearance of \\"normal\\" settlements: people lived in families, and there was slightly more freedom of movement; however, that was only permitted within a small specified area. All settlers were overseen by the NKVD; once a month a person had to register at a local law enforcement office at a Selsoviet in rural areas or at a militsiya department in urban settlements. As second-class citizens, deported peoples designated as \\"special settlers\\" were prohibited from holding a variety of jobs, returning to their region of origin, attending prestigious schools, and even joining the cosmonaut program. After the special settlement system was officially abolished in the 1950s, most deported indigenous peoples were allowed to return to their homelands, except for the Crimean Tatars and Meskhetian Turks, who were denied the right of return in the Khrushchev and Brezhnev era and largely remained in areas they were deported to because of the residence permit system.  Exile settlements  Exile settlements (—Å—Å—ã–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, ssylnoye poselenie) were a kind of internal exile. The system of political and administrative exile existed in Imperial Russia as well. The most notable category of exile settlers in the Soviet Union (—Å—Å—ã–ª—å–Ω–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Ü—ã, ssylnoposelentsy) were the whole nationalities resettled during Joseph Stalin's rule (1928‚Äì1953). At various times, a number of other terms were used for this category: special settlement (—Å–ø–µ—Ü–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ), special resettlement (—Å–ø–µ—Ü–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ), and administrative exile (–∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –≤—ã—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞, a term which refers to an extrajudicial way of deciding the fates of people \\"by administrative means\\"). Exiles were sent to remote areas of the Soviet Union: Siberia, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Russian Far East. The major source of the population in exile settlements were victims of what is now called ethnic cleansing. The Soviet government feared that people of certain nationalities would act as \\"fifth column\\" subversives during the expected war, and took drastic measures to prevent this perceived threat. The deported were sent to prisons, labor camps, exile settlements, and \\"supervised residence\\" (residence in usual settlements, but under the monitoring of the NKVD). =Deportations from border territories in 1939‚Äì1941= Several waves of forced resettlement occurred from the territories on the Western borders. These territories included Murmansk Oblast and the recently annexed lands invaded and occupied by the Soviets under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany; parts of Poland and Romania and the Baltic States. In territories annexed from Poland (the Kresy territories and the Bia≈Çystok Voivodeship), the initial wave of repression of 1939 was rationalized as removal of \\"social enemies\\", or \\"enemies of the people\\": military, police and administrative personnel, large landowners, industrialists, and merchants. They were usually sentenced to 8‚Äì20 years of labor camps. In addition, settlers, or osadniks, as well as foresters and railroad workers were forcibly removed. Massive deportations of the Polish population into remote areas of the Soviet Union took place in 1940‚Äì1941. Estimates of the total number of deported Poles vary between 400,000 and 1.7 million people, including prisoners of war. On 23 June 1940, Lavrenty Beria, head of the NKVD, ordered the Murmansk Oblast to be cleansed of \\"foreign nationals\\", both Scandinavians and all other nationalities. People of Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian (see also \\"Kola Norwegians\\") ethnicities were moved to the Karelo-Finnish SSR. Germans, Koreans, Chinese, and others were moved to Altay. Deportations of \\"exiled settlers\\" from the Baltic States (Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians) and the annexed part of Romania (Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina) were carried out in May‚ÄìJune 1941. After the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin sought a rapprochement with the West, which included establishing diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile. As the result, Polish citizens were \\"amnestied\\" and freed from \\"special settlement\\". Deportations of Polish citizens are commemorated by the Monument to the Fallen and Murdered in the East in Warsaw. =\\"Preventive\\" deportations of nationalities in 1941‚Äì1942= These deportations concerned Soviet citizens of \\"enemy nationality\\". The affected were Volga Germans, Finns, Romanians, Italians, and Greeks. At the end of this period, Crimean Tatars were included in this wave of deportation. =\\"Punitive\\" deportations of nationalities in 1943‚Äì1944= These deportations concerned ethnicities declared guilty of cooperation with Nazi occupants: a number of peoples of North Caucasus and Crimea: Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Karachays, Meskhetian Turks, Crimean Tatars, and Crimean Bolgars, as well as Kalmyks. =Post-war deportations= Deportations after the end of World War II were not particularly differentiated or classified by \\"NKVD operations\\". The affected were people from the territories that were under the administration of the Axis Powers: family members of persons accused of loyalty to the Axis administration and of persons who continued resistance to Soviet power, which was classified as \\"banditism\\". Some former Ostarbeiters were \\"filtered\\" into exile as well. \\"Cleansing\\" of the annexed territories continued until the early 1950s. In July 1949, a further 35,000 were deported from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, accused of being kulaks or collaborating with the wartime Romanian administration. =Ukazniks= The term ukaznik derives from the Russian term \\"ukaz\\" that means \\"decree\\". It applies to those convicted according to various Soviet ukazes, but the most common usage refers to a series of decrees related to what was later formalized in Soviet law as parasitism, or evasion from socially-useful work. Among the first of these was the decree of 2 June 1942 \\"On criminal culpability for evasion from socially useful work and for social parasitism in the agricultural sector\\" (–û–± –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∑–∞ —É–∫–ª–æ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –ø–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞ –∏ –∑–∞ –≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –≤ —Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–º —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ). It was usually applied to kolkhozniks who failed to carry out their corv√©e (trudodni, \\"labour-days\\"). The term of exile was 8 years. During 1948‚Äì1952 33,266 special settlers (\\"ukazniks\\") were registered. Unlike other exile settler categories, children of these exiles were not subject to the Decree. =Religious persecution= A number of religious groups, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses (—Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –∏–µ–≥–æ–≤—ã), True Orthodox Church (–∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–Ω–æ-–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∞–Ω–µ), Inochentism (–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–∫–µ–Ω—Ç—å–µ–≤—Ü—ã) and True and Free Seventh-day Adventists (–∞–¥–≤–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Å—Ç—ã-—Ä–µ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Å—Ç—ã) were persecuted by the Soviet Union. In particular, members of these groups refused to join the Young Pioneers, the Komsomol, or to serve in the Soviet Army. Usually members of these groups and especially influential members were subject to criminal law and treated on a case-by-case basis. However, on 3 March 1951, the USSR Council of Ministers issued a decree, \\"On Expulsion of Active Participants of the anti-Soviet Illegal Sect of Jehovists and their Family Members\\" (–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –°–°–°–† –æ –≤—ã—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–µ–ª–µ–≥–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å–µ–∫—Ç—ã –∏–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ —á–ª–µ–Ω–æ–≤ –∏—Ö —Å–µ–º–µ–π ‚Ññ1290-467 –æ—Ç 3 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 1951 –≥–æ–¥–∞). According to this decree, about 9,400 Jehovah's Witnesses, including about 4,000 children , were resettled from the Baltic States, Moldavia, and western parts of Byelorussia and Ukraine to Siberia in 1951, an event known as \\"Operation North\\". Only in September 1965, a decree of the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers canceled the \\"special settlement\\" restriction for members of these religious groups.\\"Christian Believers Were Persecuted by All Totalitarian Regimes\\" Prava Lyudini (\\"Rights of a Person\\"), the newspaper of a Ukrainian human rights organization, Kharkiv, December 2001 =Iranians and Assyrians= The above are the major, most populous categories of exile settlers. There were a number of smaller categories. They were small in the scale of the whole Soviet Union, but rather significant in terms of the affected categories of population. For example, in 1950 all Iranians, with the exception of persons of Armenian ethnicity, were resettled from Georgia, a population of some 4,776 persons, and in the same year thousands of Christian ethnic Assyrians were deported from Armenia and Georgia to Kazakhstan.http://astanatimes.com/2014/12/assyrian-community-kazakhstan- survived-dark-times-now-focuses-education/ Labor settlements Labor settlements (—Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, trudoposelenie) were a method of internal exile that used settlers for obligatory labor. The main category of \\"labor settlers\\" (—Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Ü—ã, trudoposelentsy) were kulaks and members of their families deported in 1930s before the Great Purge. Labor settlements were under the management of the Gulag, but they must not be confused with labor camps. The first official document that decreed wide-scale \\"dekulakization\\" was a joint decree of Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom on 1 February 1930. Initially families of kulaks were deported into remote areas \\"for special settlement\\" without particular care about their occupation. In 1931‚Äì1932 the problems of dekulakization and territorial planning of the exile settlement were handled by a special Politburo commission known as the Andreev-Rudzutak Commission (–∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤–∞-–†—É–¥–∑—É—Ç–∞–∫–∞), named after Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev and Yan Rudzutak. The plan to achieve goals like exploitation of natural resources and the colonization of remote areas with \\"special settlements\\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revelation of the Nazino affair in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded. The notions of \\"labor settlement\\"/\\"labor settlers\\" were introduced in 1934 and were in official use until 1945. Since 1945, the terminology was unified, and exiled kulaks were documented as \\"special resettlers ‚Äì kulaks\\".  \\"Free settlements\\"  Free settlements (–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, volnoye poselenie) were for persons released from the confines of labor camps \\"for free settlement\\" before their term expiration, as well as for those who served the full term, but remained restricted in their choice of place of residence. These people were known as free settlers (–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Ü—ã, volnoposelentsy). The term was in use earlier, in Imperial Russia, in two meanings: free settlement of peasants or cossacks (in the sense of being free from serfdom) and non-confined exile settlement (e.g., after serving a katorga term). In the Soviet Union, a decree of Sovnarkom of 1929 about labor camps said, in part: :\\"For gradual colonization of the regions where concentration camps are to be established, suggest the OGPU and Narkomat of Justice to urgently plan activities based on the following principles: (1) (2) (3) \\". The \\"free settlers\\" of the first category were often required to do the work assigned to the corresponding labor camp or some other obligatory work. Later, people could be assigned for \\"free settlement\\" in other places as well, even in towns, with obligatory work wherever a workforce was required. Population statistics After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the researchers gained access to the archives of the NKVD. Data on 1 January 1953 show 2,753,356 \\"deported and special settlers\\". Dmitri Volkogonov, in his book about Stalin, quoted an MVD document that reports 2,572,829 on 1 January 1950.

A Game Boy version was released in 1993. A sequel, DoReMi Fantasy, was released in 1996 for the Super Famicom. Plot The protagonist, Milon, lives in the land of Hudson where people use music to communicate with each other. However, Milon does not have the ability to communicate. He always asked himself why he is the only one who lacks the ability to understand people and music. One day he decides to travel throughout the land of Hudson to search for other people like himself. Before leaving for his trip, Milon decides to visit Queen Eliza who lives in Castle Garland (known as \\"Hudson's Secret Castle\\" in Japan). When Milon arrives at Castle Garland, the people were being attacked by the Evil Warlord Maharito from the north region. Maharito robs the innocent people, by stealing all their musical instruments and occupies the Castle Garland. Queen Eliza is held captive deep inside Castle Garland by Maharito and his demon-monsters. Milon volunteers to fight the Maharito and his demons and to rescue Queen Eliza and the musical instruments for the people of Hudson. This will not be an easy task. Castle Garland has many different rooms and each room is a maze filled with demons, secret passages and doors. However, the Castle's Magician tells Milon that Queen Eliza has hidden many tools, instruments and money to help him. The Magician also gives Milon a magic \\"Bubble\\" to assist him in finding the places where the helpful items are hidden and where they may be bought. Gameplay The player controls Milon by running, jumping and shooting bubbles. The player starts out at the bottom floor of a four-story castle, named Castle Garland, and he must work his way upward, searching the three main stories, the well, two side towers and the very top. If the player stays too long outside of the castle, lightning bolts fall off from the sky. Each room of the castle contains many enemies and hidden items. Milon's bubbles are both a weapon as well as a tool; throwing bubbles at soft blocks causes them to break apart and either create additional routes, reveal hidden shops, or expose specific items. The bubbles can also destroy the demons that inhabit the given rooms, although they will come back to life after several seconds. Each story can only be reached by defeating the first boss. Although seemingly basic, the only way the bosses can even be reached is by discovering a host of secrets, some of which require sheer luck or a helpful manual. This is because there is no visual difference between these \\"soft blocks\\" hiding the secrets and the \\"hard blocks\\" which are just walls. When a demon-monster dies, it stays dead and releases a crystal ball and, at times, make Milon's bubbles larger and make them fly out farther. The demon-monster's room can then be used to get to the next story of the castle. Throughout the entire game the player is only given one life. When one life is lost, the game is over and the player must start over. However, if the player holds left on the control pad while pressing the Start button at the title screen, they can start where they left off. This command does not work before collecting the first crystal, and was only featured in the instruction booklet of the Famicom version. Along the way, Milon will come across various items found in shops; some shops are in plain sight, some are hidden in the differing rooms or outside the castle, and some can be found after Milon defeats a certain demon-monster boss. All of the items augment Milon in one specific way or another, although not all of them are found in shops. Screenshot of the NES/Famicom version of Milon's Secret Castle. The game has generally been considered by several gamers to be extremely difficult and frustrating. There are no save points, and once a player runs out of life, the game is over; however, it is possible to continue after obtaining the first crystal. Unlike in most platform games of the era, Milon does not \\"blink\\" to become briefly invincible when he is attacked by an enemy, which means his energy can be sapped very quickly if he does not move away. This is offset by the fact that each room in the castle has a \\"honeycomb\\" which restores the player's life bar entirely and extends it by one unit. The game has a rather unorthodox approach when compared to other 2D platformers; the rooms can be accessed in any order, and the rooms themselves do not flow like traditional platformer stages. In each room, there is only one single exit, which is in a fixed spot within the room. Navigating a castle's room does not always require simply running from left to right, which gives each room a free-flowing feel. Each room of the castle contains secrets similar to those of the Super Mario Bros. series; the secrets are uncovered by shooting bubbles into invisible trigger objects and breaking soft blocks. A cumulative side-quest involves finding music boxes. By touching a music box, Milon is transported to a mini-game where he attempts to pick up as many musical notes as possible, with extra points given for sharps and negative points given for accidentally picking up flats. The first time the player reaches the mini-game, only one elf with a drum appears to play the music. Each time the player collects a music box and is transported to the mini-game, a new elf with a new instrument appears, and the song gets more elaborate.  Release  It was released for the Famicom (Japan) on November 13, 1986. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (North America) in September 1988. While the Game Boy port kept the same title as the NES version's in the US, the game was released in Japan on March 26, 1993 under the name and later in North America. The Game Boy port includes a password feature, but is otherwise mostly the same as the NES version. Besides that, there are other differences between the Game Boy and NES versions. First, the room sizes are smaller, likely due in part to the smaller available screen size. As a result, many hidden items and platforms are not in the same absolute position, but can be found in roughly the same relative position. Second, every item costs a little less money than in the NES version. Third, the boss fights are substantially easier. Bosses send only one projectile out at a time, and the projectiles are much smaller. Finally, the ending has new illustrations added to it. The NES version was re-released in 2005 as part of a compilation on the Game Boy Advance known as Hudson Best Collection Vol. 3. The same version of the game was also released to mobile phones, the Japan- exclusive Hudson Channel for the PS2 and the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan and North America in 2007 and in the PAL region as an import release in 2010.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/vc_mkk/https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/8JpDQVhA5ZbYxbc80VPozQr65rQ1fSBThttps://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Milon- s-Secret-Castle-812431.html#Overview It was also released on October 31, 2013 on the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console service.https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/8ZXWfEuxYIWme82h6t4DyFaZ1Icm5MKU Reception GameSpot's Frank Provo described the game as easily one of the worst games ever made. Provo criticized the control scheme, saying Milon \\"runs like his feet are greased, and his jumps are easily interrupted by nearby blocks that are adjacent or directly above him\\". Provo awarded Milon's Secret Castle a \\"terrible\\" score of 2.0/10. Legacy In 1996, a Super Famicom sequel to the game was released only in Japan, known as DoReMi Fantasy: Milon no Dokidoki Daibouken. There are some references to Milon's Secret Castle in a few Hudson Soft games. Milon made a cameo appearance in the Sega Saturn game Saturn Bomberman, and in Star Soldier there are hidden Milon tiles that can only be uncovered and destroyed for a 40,000-point bonus when certain score conditions are met. In 2006, a Nintendo DS puzzle game was released only in Japan under the title Milon no Hoshizora Shabon: Puzzle Kumikyoku.

The name is today used for both the main library itself as well as the municipal library system of Stockholm. Architecture Discussed by a committee of which Asplund himself was a member from 1918, a design scheme was proposed in 1922, and construction began in 1924. Partly inspired by the Barri√®re Saint-Martin (Rotonde de la Villette) by Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Asplund abandoned earlier ideas for a dome in favour of a rotunda whose tall cylinder gives the exterior some monumentality. In the course of its planning, he reduced elements of the classical order to their most abstract geometrical forms, for the most part eliminating architectural decor. Stockholm Public Library was Sweden's first public library to apply the principle of open shelves where visitors could access books without the need to ask library staff for assistance, a concept Asplund studied in the United States during the construction of the library. All the furnishings in all the rooms were designed for their specific positions and purposes. Ledoux: Rotonde de la Villette, Paris Officially opened on 31 March 1928 in the presence of Prince Eugen, due to financial constraints the library was still missing its west wing which was only added in 1932 to complete the approximately square base around the rotunda of the main reading room. Stockholm Public Library is one of Asplund's most important works and illustrates his gradual shift from classicism to functionalism. Also designed by Asplund and completed in 1931 is the parkland to the south with its large pond and the shops along Sveav√§gen. The three simple annex buildings to the west, too, formed part of Asplund's original concept but were designed by other architects, i.e. Erik Lallerstedt (two blocks furthest west, 1929‚Äì30 and 1932) and Paul Hedqvist (1952‚Äì53).Dates according to ICOMOS International Scientific Committee on 20th Century Heritage, HERITAGE ALERT September 2009 . Charles Holden's design of Arnos Grove tube station in North London is said to be based on the Stockholm Public Library. Holdings The inside of the rotunda Stockholm Public Library includes more than 2 million volumes and 2.4 million audio tapes, CDs and audio books. The \\"international library\\" is the section for foreign languages, housed in two floors of an annex behind the main building, close to Odenplan. Its holdings comprise more than 100 languages with 17,000 volumes in Persian, 15,800 in Arabic, and 14,500 in Spanish. In 2007 the most borrowed languages were Russian (19,300 loans), Thai, Spanish, Arabic, Persian, Chinese, Polish and Japanese.Unpublished library statistics, available on request at the desk. For some of these languages, Stockholm serves public libraries in the rest of Sweden through interlibrary loans. =Proposed future expansion= In 2006, the announcement of an international architectural competition for a library extension attracted 1,170 entries, though few leading international architects participated.Eleonore Harmel, Ad acta , in: Bauwelt 17-18.2010 (accessed 15 December 2011). The new structure was to be built next to Asplund's main building, using the site occupied by the three annex buildings, whose fate (i.e. demolition or integration) was deliberately left open in the brief. On 16 November 2007, little-known German architect Heike Hanada was declared the winner with her proposal Delphinium. Her project includes a high-rise glass building, spatially removed from Asplund's main library but connected to it by a low, podium-like structure with a semi-circular courtyard into which the slope of the Observatorielunden seems to flow.German firm wins Stockholm contest in Building Design. 23 November 2007. The winning design and the other finalists are presented in detail on the Swedish Association of Architects website (accessed 15 December 2011). Although Hanada was instructed to produce preliminary plans for the project's realisation, the extension was put on hold in late 2009. This was due to a change in city government with different prioritiesHarmel, as above . The official reason given, i.e. escalating costs, is by some considered to be no more than a smokescreen. as well as a local campaign turned international about what critics saw as an unacceptable impact on the original, Asplund approved complex.The arguments are summarised here on the ICOMOS website (accessed 15 December 2011).

He was instrumental in the founding of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, and was one of the first artists to embrace Pointillism. Early life and military service Flowers in Three Vases, c. 1879 Louis-Auguste-Albert Dubois was born on 28 October 1846 in Paris. Shortly thereafter, his family moved to Toulouse, where he was raised. In 1867, he graduated from l'Ecole Imp√©riale Militaire in Saint-Cyr and began his career as a military officer. He remained in the army for the rest of his life. From 1870 to 1871, he served in the Franco-Prussian War, during which the Germans captured him and held him in Westphalia, Prussia as a prisoner of war. After his release, he resumed a post in the Versailles army. Throughout the 1870s he was stationed at several different provincial posts. He received an appointment in 1879 or 1880 to la L√©gion de la Garde R√©publicaine (the Republican Guard) in Paris. Early art career Detail from Enfant Mort, 1881 Although self-taught, with no formal art education, he proved to be a talented artist. The official Paris Salon accepted one of his still lifes in 1877, and another one in 1879. However, after his arrival in Paris, he created paintings which were somewhat more experimental, and his submissions were rejected by The Salons from 1880 to 1883. Beginning in 1884, he attempted to hide his art-related activities from the military by disguising his name ‚Äì he added \\"Pillet\\", his mother's maiden name, to his name, signing his artworks \\"Dubois-Pillet\\". Charlands Sur La-Seine His painting Enfant Mort (Dead Child), completed in 1881, was displayed at the May 1884 Tuileries Exhibition, where it caught the attention of √âmile Zola, who used it as his inspiration for a scene in his 1886 novel L'≈íuvre. In the book, artist Claude Lantier, distraught over his son's death, finds himself compelled to create a painting of his dead child. The Tuileries Exhibition was a one-time event with a goal similar to that of 1863's Salon des Refus√©s which showed works that had been rejected by the Salon. Dubois-Pillet envisioned a permanent alternative to the official Salon. He met with some of the other exhibitors, and he, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Odilon Redon became the \\"founding fathers\\" of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. Dubois-Pillet structured the organization and, within less than a week, wrote and published its statutes, which are largely still in effect. The society was officially formed on 29 July 1884, and their first exhibition, which opened on 1 December 1884, included work by Dubois-Pillet. He used his connections to secure desirable venues and terms for their exhibitions, was the primary organizer of the group until 1888, and was a regular exhibitor with them until 1889. Neo- impressionism The Towers, Saint-Sulpice, 1887 Around 1885, probably influenced by his friendships with Seurat and others, he began experimenting with Divisionist techniques, and he embraced Pointillism ‚Äì one of the first artists to do so. By the next year, his works were fully Neo-impressionist. With Signac, he used pen and ink to create pointillist drawings. Dubois- Pillet's studio-apartment served as the unofficial Neo-impressionist headquarters during the movement's early years. Some of his pointillist work is composed with \\"photographic precision\\". In 1886, he was ordered by the army to discontinue his participation in exhibiting his art, and to dissociate himself from Les Ind√©pendants. Dubois-Pillet paid little attention to these orders. He remained active with Les Ind√©pendants and continued to show his work, including regular Les Ind√©pendants exhibits, an 1886 Nantes show, and participation in the 1888 and 1889 Les XX exhibitions in Brussels. His only solo exhibition during his lifetime was in 1888, at the offices of French symbolist journal Revue Ind√©pendante. Some of his pointillist drawings were published in La Vie moderne in 1887. The Banks of the Marne at Dawn, c. 1888 Dubois-Pillet and Louis Hayet were the two Neo-impressionists who were most focused on the theoretical aspects and scientific basis of their art. Starting around 1887, Dubois-Pillet explored the science of color perception as it related to Pointillism by investigating the work of English polymath Thomas Young (1773‚Äì1829), who concluded that the eye has three color receptors, each sensitive to one of the primary colors of light (green, red, and violet). Dubois-Pillet applied Young's findings into a triad color theory which he referred to as passage, whereby a touch of pigment corresponding to each of the primary light colors is included in the passage from one hue to the next. Colors are scientifically decomposed by the artist, then they are recomposed in the viewer's eye, but with a greater luminosity than would have been possible if the colors had simply been mixed on the palette. How to apply his theory in practice wasn't entirely clear, and his fellow Neo-impressionists were not convinced. La Dame √† la Robe Blanche, c. 1886 Neo-impressionism was often focused on depicting brilliant colors in natural light, and perhaps because of this, the subject matter most commonly consisted of outdoor scenes such as landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, or river scenes. While Dubois- Pillet painted all of these, as well as still lifes, he also created the first portrait of the Neo-impressionist movement ‚Äì La Dame √† la Robe Blanche, a painting which depicts a woman, wearing a white dress, seated in an upholstered chair. The model's identity is unknown; exhibition curators tended to, at best, identify subjects by the initial of their last name. The Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Saint-Etienne refers to her as Madame P., but art critic F√©lix F√©n√©on called her Mademoiselle B. Le Puy in the Snow, 1889 In late 1889, Dubois-Pillet was transferred by the army to a post as commander of the gendarmerie in Le Puy-en-Velay, a south central French commune. His transfer may have been in response to his defying the orders to curtail his artistic activities. The churches and landscapes of the surrounding Auvergne region are the subject matter of his final paintings. He died in Le Puy-en-Velay on 18 August 1890 at the age of 43 during an outbreak of smallpox. The following year, a memorial exhibition, organized by Signac and consisting of sixty-four of Dubois-Pillet's paintings, was mounted by Les Ind√©pendants. Because of a fire which destroyed the majority of his work, as well as his rather early death, his extant oeuvre is relatively small. Little Circus Camp Collections *Indianapolis Museum of Art *J.

Goya started her career as a y√©-y√© girl, singing a catchy mid-1960s hybrid of girl-group pop and French chanson. She also enjoyed a career as a French New Wave actress; she had a starring role as Madeleine in the 1966 Jean-Luc Godard film ' and in Jean-Daniel Pollet's ' (Love is joy, love is sad). Since 1975, she has become mostly known as a singer for children. Together with her husband, songwriter and composer Jean-Jacques Debout, and with a talented team of designers and costume people, she does shows for and with children. The main themes are dreams and traveling. Her usual character is Marie-Rose, a mix between a maid and an older sister (reminiscent of Julie Andrews in both The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins). Personal life Chantal was born in French Indochina in 1942 to French parents. During the Indochina war she moved to France with her family in 1954 and lived in the Vosges mountains, and at the beginning of the 1960s, she moved to Paris with her family. She met singer/composer Jean Jacques Debout when she was 18. The couple remain married. After having received her baccalaureat, Chantal started studying journalism in England. During this period in Paris, one of her friends took her to the reception of Eddie Barclay's wedding. Jean-Jacques Debout was one of the artists invited to this reception. At that time, he had been recording 45 rpm records since 1957, and had received some success, like \\"Les boutons dor√©s\\" (The golden buttons). He was a friend of the ye-ye girl Sylvie Vartan for whom he wrote and composed the hit \\"Tous mes copains\\" (All my friends). In 1963, Vartan was in a relationship with the ye-ye and rock-n-roll singer Johnny Hallyday and she would marry him in 1965. Debout, who was in love with Vartan, remained single in his personal life. At this reception, he saw Chantal who was sitting at the back of the living room, and he fell in love at first sight with her. He went to tell her that she would be famous by the age of 30, have two children, and singing at the Opera. Chantal didn't believe him and went to London to finish her studies. Upon her return in France, Debout was waiting for her at the station and sang to her a song he had written and composed when she was in England, called \\"Nos doigts se sont crois√©s\\" (Our fingers had been crossed), and Chantal fell in love with him. With this song, Debout participated in and won the Festival de la Rose d'Or d'Antibes (Music Festival of Antibes's golden rose). In 1964, Chantal first became a model for fashion photographers in the teenage girls' magazine \\"Mademoiselle √Çge Tendre\\" (Little Miss Tender Age). That year, Debout decided to rename her Chantal Goya because he thought that she looked like a little boy painted by the Spanish painter Francisco Goya. Daniel Filipacchi was the owner of the magazine and also the record producer of the French division of RCA Records. He suggested that Debout write and compose songs in return for a record contract for her. The first 45 EP record of Chantal Goya released at the end of 1964 and it includes the song \\"C'est bien Bernard\\" (It's Bernard himself) which became her first hit success. In the fall of 1964, Chantal was invited to the TV show Rendez-vous sur le Rhin, presented by Albert Raisner, to sing her first song \\"C'est bien Bernard,\\" which the influential film director Jean-Luc Godard was watching. At that time, he was writing the storyline of his movie \\"Masculin, f√©minin\\" (Masculine, feminine) and directly saw that she fit well with the role of Madeleine Zimmer in his movie. He offered the role to her, and though she was surprised by this proposition, she accepted the role alongside Jean-Pierre L√©aud in the role of Paul, and Marl√®ne Jobert in the role of Elisabeth. Although the movie was deemed unsuitable for audiences under the age of 18 upon its release on 22 March 1966, it sold 427,430 tickets at the box office in France. She had another success in France with the song \\"Une √©charpe, une rose\\" (A scarf, a rose) which was also a success in Japan. But, afterwards, the records that she recorded had less success in France. She also played in less movies. But her husband Jean-Jacques Debout still wrote and composed songs for the TV-Shows produced by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier. Also, in 1973, Chantal Goya sang the duet Les petites filles mod√®les with Sylvie Vartan, song written and composed by Jean-Jacques Debout in the TV-show Top √† produced by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier and devoted to Sylvie Vartan. In 1975, Jean-Jacques Debout had his proper TV-show Numero Un produced by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier, in which he sang songs that he has written and composed but was also the host. He had first invited the French actress Brigitte Bardot to participate at this show-TV. But, the day of the recording show, Brigitte Bardot fall ill. So, he wrote and composed as far as possible a song to finish the show. The song, called Adieu les jolis foulards is recorded by Chantal Goya with children, only for the TV-show. This song, in which she plays the role of a French teacher who made a stage in a school of Martinique and have to come back in France, is the first song of Chantal Goya especially devoted for the children's public. The Monday following the TV-show's diffusion, the channel's direction of TF 1, channel in which the TV-show was diffused, received a lot of letters and telephone calls from persons who watched the TV-show and wanted to find the record of Adieu les jolis foulards, which was impossible, because it didn't exist yet ! Maritie Carpentier told to Chantal Goya that she must make a record of this song, which it would have for sure a big success. So, Chantal Goya and Jean-Jacques Debout go and visit a lot of record labels in Paris to make a record of that song. But, all the record labels refused to publish the record ! After many months, Chantal Goya and Jean-Jacques Debout met Fran√ßois Dacla, the director of French direction of RCA Records, at a spectacle of Jos√© F√©liciano. The next day, they came to French direction of RCA records in Paris, to presente the song Adieu les jolis foulards to Fran√ßois Dacla. Moved by the song, Fran√ßois Dacla decides to release and produce the disc. And, from there, Chantal Goya became a children's singer.

It consists of the villages Kranenburg and Brobergen and is part of the Samtgemeinde Oldendorf-Himmelpforten. It has a population of 772 as at December 31, 2003, of which 546 in Kranenburg and 226 in Brobergen. Both villages lie on the right side of the Oste river, but part of the municipality lies on the left side, called \\"Hollander H√∂fe\\", which was the old ancestral seat of the gentry family \\"von Brobergen\\". There is a ferry in Brobergen crossing the Oste, connecting the \\"Hollander H√∂fe\\" with the village of Brobergen. It is a station of the \\"Deutsche F√§hrstra√üe\\". The place lies on the border of the marshland near the Oste. The river Mehe, a tributary of the Oste, has its estuary near Brobergen. The village Brobergen was an own municipality, but then got part of Kranenburg in the course of a reformation of municipality borders in Lower Saxony in 1972. History Kranenburg, first mentioned in 1375 as Kronesborg (literally cranes castle), belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, established in 1180. While Brobergen was first the name of the landscape, which referred to a larger area along the Oste between Gr√§pel and Burweg. In a charter from 1141 it is said, that the Rudolf of Freckleben, as Rudolf II Count of Stade (from 1135 to his death in 1144), gave Brobergen as a fief to one of the three brothers Dudo, Adiko and Ricbert, after they founded the Benedictine in Stade. In 1286 it was first mentioned, that there was a village by the castle, which was the seat of the von Brobergen family. In 1380 the family von Mandelsloh and other Bremian and Verdian creditors tried to gain by violence the estates, which the bankrupt Prince-Archbishop Albert II pledged in return for credits. The creditors ravaged the city of Bremen and the entire Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The city of Bremen concluded a pact with the other cities, the Chapter, the Landsgemeinden of the free peasants of the marshlands, and indigenous families of nobility and ministerialis to fight the exfrediation by the von Mandelslohs. In 1381 the troops of the city of Bremen captured the castle in Kranenburg. The family of von Brobergen, owning the castle, lasted until 1618, when it became extinct. At this time the manor was sold to merchants from Hamburg. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric, including Kranenburg, was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown ‚Äì interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) ‚Äì and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which ‚Äì after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 ‚Äì incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Kranenburg, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823. In 1837, after many changes of owner, the castle and the pertaining domain were purchased by the farmers of Brobergen, who pooled together to become free of the ownership of their land by other persons.

History By 1111 the Saxon Duke Lothair of Supplinburg, later king of the Holy Roman Empire, erected castrum vorde, the V√∂rde Castle at an Oste ford, important for the Oxen Way, an ancient trackway connecting Jutland with Westphalia. Because of the strategically advantageous location between the rivers Elbe and Weser it was a matter of conflicts in the following centuries. Later it came under the control of Henry the Lion and then, in 1219, it fell under the control of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, providing functions as capital with the prince-archiepiscopal residence and seat of government. The parliament, the Bremian Estates, convened at other places (usually in Basdahl), the Bremian cathedral chapter had its seat in the city of Bremen.

Administrator John Frederick extended the fortified castle by a Vorwerk, including stables and the prince- archiepiscopal Chancery (built in 1608), since 1960 housing a museum, called Bachmann-Museum for regional archeology, geology and history since 1985. The capital function caused the town to be named Bremerv√∂rde since the mid-17th century. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown. The Swedes relocated the capital to Stade. Dano-Swedish War. During the Swedish reign the Danish King Frederick III (as of 1648, deposed by the Swedes as Bremian Administrator Frederick II in 1645) invaded the Duchy and bombed his former residence in 1657. In 1682 the damaged castle and the castle church, burial place of many prince-archbishops, were demolished, the rubble bricks moved to Stade for the construction of the Swedish Warehouse (Schwedenspeicher) there. After another Danish occupation between 1712 and 1715 during the Great Northern War the Duchy of Bremen was handed over to the House of Hanover, ruling the area until 1866. In 1823 the Duchy was abolished and its territory became part of the Stade Region.

Background Wanting to push the Confederates out of their winter headquarters and having received reports of good forage south of the French Broad River, Union forces under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke advanced on Dandridge, near the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad, on January 14, with orders to cross the river and occupy the area for the Federals. This movement forced Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, who had been operating around Dandridge, to fall back beyond Kimbrough's Crossroads. Longstreet brought up reinforcements from Morristown on January 15 to meet the Federals and threaten the Union base at New Market. On January 16, Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis, commanding the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Ohio, rode forward from Dandridge along the Morristown Road (now Valley Home Rd., State Hwy 66) to occupy Kimbrough's Crossroads. As the Union cavalry neared the crossroads, they discovered and engaged one of Longstreet's infantry brigades with artillery that had arrived the day before. The brigade was composed of Alabama troops, as well as others, and was under the command of Brigadier General Micah Jenkins, a South Carolinian. At the same time Union cavalry under the command of Col. Frank Wolford engaged Confederate forces south and east of Dandridge on the bend of Chucky Road. The Union cavalry could not dislodge the Confederate troops and were compelled to retire to Dandridge. Battle Map of Dandridge Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Around noon on January 17, Sturgis received information that the Confederates were preparing for an attack, so he formed his men into lines of battle. About 4:00 p.m., the Confederates advanced towards Dandridge and the battle quickly turned to general fighting. The battle continued until after dark with the Union forces occupying roughly the same battle line as when the fighting started. Having failed to cross the river to the opposite bank, and fearing that Longstreet's entire force was in front of them, General Parke ordered the Federals to retreat to New Market and Strawberry Plains during the night. The Confederates pursued, but due to the lack of cannons, ammunition, and shoes, broke off and fell back to Dandridge. For the time being, the Union forces left the area.

He is the Joseph Pellegrino University Professor in history of science and physics at Harvard University. Biography Galison received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in both physics and in the history of science in 1983. His publications include Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics (1997) and Einstein's Clocks, Poincar√©'s Maps: Empires of Time. His most recent book (2007), co-authored with Lorraine Daston, is titled Objectivity. Before moving to Harvard, Galison taught for several years at Stanford University, where he was professor of history, philosophy, and physics. He is considered a member of the Stanford School of philosophy of science, a group that also includes Ian Hacking, John Dupr√©, and Nancy Cartwright. Galison developed a film for the History Channel on the development of the hydrogen bomb, and has done work on the intersection of science with other disciplines, in particular art (along with his wife, Caroline A. Jones) and architecture. He is on the editorial board of Critical Inquiry and was a MacArthur Fellow in 1996. Philosophical work In Image and Logic, Galison explored the fundamental rift rising in the physical sciences: whether singular, visual accounts of scientific phenomena would be accepted as the dominant language of proof, or whether statistically significant, frequently repeated results would dominate the field. This division, Galison claims, can be seen in the conflicts amongst high-energy physicists investigating new particles, some of whom offer up statistically significant and frequently replicated analysis of the new particle passing through electric fields, others of whom offer up a single picture of a particle behaving‚Äîin a single instance‚Äîin a way that cannot be explained by the characteristics of existing known particles. This image/logic distinction has been applied to explore the development of other disciplines, for example, archaeology. His work with Lorraine Daston developed the concept of mechanical objectivity which is often used in scholarly literature, and he has done pioneering work on applying the anthropological notion of trading zones to scientific practice.  Documentary films  Galison has been involved in the production of three documentary films. The first, The Ultimate Weapon: The H-Bomb Dilemma, was about the political and scientific decisions behind the creation of the first hydrogen bomb in the United States, and premiered on the History Channel in 2000. The second, Secrecy, which Galison directed with Harvard filmmaker Robb Moss, is about the costs and benefits of government secrecy, and premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Also from Harvard, Ruth Lingford worked on the animation for Secrecy. Galison completed his third documentary film Containment, also directed with Robb Moss, in 2015. It premiered at the 2015 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, and has been shown at film festivals around the world including in Brazil, Switzerland, and Australia. This documentary investigates governments' attempts to contain a hundred million gallons of deadly radioactive sludge for 10,000 years: how can people warn future generations across this immense time span during which languages, cultures and the environment will continually transform? Galison's fourth documentary, The Edge of Knowledge, about the Event Horizon Telescope is currently in production.

Halton was an English football club that played in Runcorn, Widnes and Prescot at various points during its existence. History The club was founded in 1918 as Highfield and Camden Tanneries Recreation Club. They became members of the Lancashire Combination in the same year, winning a cup. As Runcorn F.C., they were founder members of the Cheshire County League in 1919, and were its first champions. They won the league and Cheshire League Cup double in 1937. Runcorn were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968 and won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1973. The pinnacle of the club's history was the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) title success of 1982, but they were denied the chance of taking part in the Football League elections because the club did not meet league requirements. This re-election system was replaced by automatic promotion from 1987 onwards, but it came too late to help Runcorn who by then were no longer a top team in the Football Conference. In 1986, for the first time ever, Runcorn reached the final of the FA Trophy, but lost 1‚Äì0 to Altrincham. That season the team had beaten Boston 4‚Äì1 to reach the second round of the FA Cup.The Times, Football: Robson Has No Argument With World Cup Choice 26 November 1985 In 1993‚Äì94, their stadium nearly fell apart. A perimeter wall collapsed during a cup game against Hull City, the roof blew off one stand, and the main stand was destroyed by a fire. This crippled the club, which was relegated in 1996 for the first time ever. In 2000, they sold the Canal Street ground where they had played since 1918, and moved to the 11,000-seat Halton Stadium in Widnes, which was also used by the town's rugby team and Everton reserves. The club renamed itself Runcorn FC Halton to reflect its new location. In 2004, they finished in 13th place in the Northern Premier League, and were promoted to the new Conference North. Their spell at this level lasted just one season before they were relegated back to the NPL. During this season, the club's precarious financial state caused them to move out of the Halton Stadium permanently, having finished the previous season at Southport's Haig Avenue, and to share Valerie Park, home of local rivals Prescot Cables, who also played in the Northern Premier League. Demise During its final season the club went into severe financial crisis and was unable to pay its players' wages, forcing it to offload many of its key playing staff and replace them with amateur players used to playing at a much lower standard. This made for an embarrassing end to the season, with Runcorn finishing bottom and frequently suffering defeats by five or more goals, though their record defeat of 9‚Äì0 remained intact. After a second successive relegation, the club's future was in doubt, and the decision was made to officially confirm its resignation from the league and cease activity. By this time, disgruntled supporters had already formed the breakaway club Runcorn Linnets F.C., which was granted membership of the North West Counties League Division Two for the 2006‚Äì07 season.

Originally a major port of call for the Spanish treasure fleet, Nombre de Dios was the most significant port for shipping in the Americas between 1540 and 1580.

In June 1572 the English privateer Francis Drake sacked the colony and in April of the following year he ambushed the Spanish Silver Train, a mule convoy carrying a fortune in precious metals. Drake captured the town again in 1595 but found little treasure, thereby missing 5 million pesos waiting off the Pacific side. After that date the Spanish preferred to use Portobelo as their Caribbean port.Timothy R Walton,\\"The Spanish Treasure Fleets\\", 1974, page 103 By 1580, Veracruz in present-day Mexico became a more important port.

The battle on November 3 was intended to be a Confederate cavalry raid to break up the Memphis and Charleston Railroad behind Sherman's Fifteenth Army Corps, then in the process of marching to the relief of Chattanooga. But, when Confederate Brig. Gen. James Chalmers, leading a cavalry division riding up from Mississippi, learned that only one Union regiment was left to defend Collierville, he decided to attack. Chalmers supposed Union Colonel Edward Hatch possessed fewer men stationed at Collierville and at Germantown, to the west, than he actually did. Hatch's scouts warned him of Chalmers's approach from the south, so he ordered Collierville's defenders to be prepared and rode from Germantown with cavalry reinforcements. General Chalmers, as he had done only three weeks earlier, attacked from the south with McCulloch's and Slemon's brigades. The Union garrison was defended by eight companies of the 7th Illinois Cavalry Regiment and two howitzers. Colonel Hatch quickly arrived with the 6th Illinois Cavalry and 2nd Iowa Cavalry Regiments.

Prelude In early November 1863, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, with two divisions and about 5,000 cavalry, was detached from the Confederate Army of Tennessee near Chattanooga, Tennessee, to attack Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's Union Department of the Ohio troops at Knoxville. Following parallel routes, Longstreet and Burnside raced for Campbell's Station, a hamlet where the Concord Road, from the south, intersected the Kingston Road (now called Kingston Pike) to Knoxville. Burnside hoped to reach the crossroads first and continue on to safety in Knoxville; Longstreet planned to reach the crossroads and hold it, which would prevent Burnside from gaining Knoxville and force him to fight outside his earthworks. Battle Map of Campbell's Station Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. By forced marching, on a rainy November 16, Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's advance reached the vital intersection and deployed first. The main column arrived at noon with the baggage train just behind. Scarcely 15 minutes later, Longstreet's Confederates approached. Longstreet attempted a double envelopment: attacks timed to strike both Union flanks simultaneously. Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's Confederate division struck with such force that the Union right had to redeploy, but held. Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins's Confederate division maneuvered ineffectively as it advanced and was unable to turn the Union left. Burnside ordered his two divisions astride the Kingston Road to withdraw three-quarters of a mile to a ridge in their rear. This was accomplished without confusion. The Confederates suspended their attack while Burnside continued his retrograde movement to Knoxville. Estimated casualties for the battle were 400 for the U.S. and 570 for the Confederates. Had Longstreet reached Campbell's Station first, the Knoxville Campaign's results might have been different. Preservation Campbell's Station was incorporated as Farragut in 1982. The Old Campbell's Station Inn was built by Judge David Campbell in 1835 and later became a private residence. The inn was a favorite of President Andrew Jackson, who stayed there whenever he passed through the area. In 2014 the Town of Farragut purchased the Inn and setup capital funding for the master planning and reconstruction.

Peithon was of Illyrian origin. He was famous for being one of the bodyguards of Alexander the Great, becoming the later satrap of Media, and claiming to be one of the diadochi. Peithon (Peithon Krateau) was named one of the seven (later eight) Somatophylakes \\"bodyguards\\" of Alexander in 335 BC. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Peithon was made the satrap of Media, the strategically important region that controlled all roads between east and west. Actually, the satrapy was too large for one man; Peithon would be very powerful, and could destabilize the entire empire. Therefore, he had to give up the northern part, which was given to Atropates, from then on the region was known as Media Atropatene. The soldiers who remained in the eastern part of Alexander's realm after his death grew agitated by their lengthy stay abroad, and began spontaneous revolts. The regent Perdiccas sent Peithon to subdue the revolts. He was given a contingent of Macedonians. Peithon easily defeated his opponents and accepted their capitulation. His men, however, having hoped to plunder, massacred their opponents. After Peithon returned to Media, Perdiccas began to distrust him. During the First War of the Diadochi, Perdiccas ordered Peithon to reinforce him and help him invade Ptolemaic Egypt and fight against Ptolemy. In the summer of 320 BC, Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes murdered Perdiccas and started negotiating with their opponents. Ptolemy suggested that Peithon be made the new Regent, but the other diadochi would not accept this. Therefore, Antipater was chosen to be the new Regent. After the death of Antipater (the Regent of the Empire), Peithon tried to expand his power over the eastern satrapies. He invaded the satrapy of Parthia, killed its Satrap Philippos, and made his brother Eudemus the new satrap. The other satraps in inner Asia were quick to perceive their danger and united all their forces under Peucestas (also a former Somatophylax), the satrap of Persia, who defeated Peithon, and drove him from Parthia.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 14,1-2. Peihton returned to Media, and then went on to Babylon to try and persuade Seleucus to back him in an attempt to reassert his authority. While in Babylon Eumenes and his army arrived from the west, Eumenes was gathering forces for a showdown with Antigonus Monopthalmus, the Strategos of Asia. Peithon and Seleucus rejected Eumenes request to join his cause (he claimed to be fighting for the kings Alexander IV and Philip III). Eumenes, then, went on to Susiana where he found the forces of the upper satrapies under Peucestas.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 14,4-8. Peithon joined the army of Antigonus who had come east in pursuit of Eumenes. During the battles of Paraitakene and Gabiene Peithon command the left flank of Antigonus's army. At Paraitakene he almost lost the battle by charging the enemy without orders, but he redeemed himself at Gabiene by winning the battle on the left flank. After the Second War of the Diadochi, Peithon was among the most powerful diadochi in the eastern part of the Empire and he started to build his power again. Antigonus felt threatened by Peithon's growing power so he tricked him into coming to his court, where he had him executed.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 46,5-6; Polyainos, Strategemata 6,14.

It concluded the movement of Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood's Confederate Army of Tennessee from the Tennessee River in northern Alabama to Columbia, Tennessee, and across the Duck River. A Union force under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield skirmished with Hood's cavalry, commanded by Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, and fortified a defensive line south of Columbia, but soon withdrew north across the Duck River, abandoning the town. Hood's invasion of Tennessee continued as he attempted to intercept Schofield's retreating army at Spring Hill. Background Following his defeat in the Atlanta Campaign, Hood had hoped to lure Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman into battle by disrupting his supply lines from Chattanooga to Atlanta. After a brief period in which he pursued Hood, Sherman elected instead to conduct his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, Georgia. He left forces under the command of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, the commander of the Army of the Cumberland, to defend Tennessee and defeat Hood: principally the IV Corps from the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley, and the XXIII Corps from the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Schofield.Jacobson, p. 41; McPherson, p. 179. Hood moved through northern Alabama and his corps under Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee crossed the Tennessee River at Florence from October 30 to November 2, with the remainder of his army encamped south of the river at Tuscumbia. He waited there for almost three weeks while his commissary officers attempted to provide 20 days' supply of rations for the upcoming campaign. This was a difficult assignment because the supply line was tenuous, requiring transport on two railroads, followed by 15 miles on poor roads to Tuscumbia, using wagons pulled by undernourished horses and oxen. Hood also wanted to wait for the arrival of Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was engaged in a cavalry raid against Thomas's supply lines, highlighted by his victory at the Battle of Johnsonville on November 4‚Äì5.Sword, p. 68; McPherson, p. 180. During the first week of November, raids by the 2nd Michigan Cavalry under Brig. Gen. John T. Croxton damaged the pontoon bridge that Hood had erected across the Tennessee River. After repairs were effected, Hood transferred his headquarters to Florence on the morning of November 13 and Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham's corps marched across the river that day with the army's supply trains and cattle following on November 14. The final corps, under Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart, crossed the Tennessee on November 20.Sword, pp. 69, 70, 74. On November 16, Hood received word that Sherman was about to depart Atlanta for his March to the Sea. There was no realistic possibility that Hood could return to Georgia from his current location to challenge Sherman's advance, so he focused his strategy on an alternative plan: move north into Tennessee, defeat Thomas's army before it could concentrate, seize the important manufacturing center of Nashville, and continue north into Kentucky, possibly as far as the Ohio River. From this point, he could travel east to Virginia to join up with Gen. Robert E. Lee at Petersburg. His theater commander, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, urged Hood to take immediate action in an attempt to distract Sherman's advance, emphasizing the importance of moving before Thomas could consolidate his forces.Jacobson, pp. 44‚Äì47; Sword, pp. 72‚Äì73; Nevin, p. 82. Both Sherman and Thomas considered it likely that Hood would follow Sherman through Georgia. Although Thomas received intelligence that Hood was amassing supplies for a movement north, he discounted most of it‚Äîheavy rains during November made the roads almost impassable. As he received reports of Confederate movements 14 miles north of Florence, he was unsure what was going on. Schofield assumed it was merely a raid by Forrest's cavalry against the railroad between Pulaski and Columbia. By November 21, Thomas had evidence that all three of Hood's corps were in motion and he directed Schofield to withdraw gradually to the north to protect Columbia before Hood could seize it. Schofield arrived at Pulaski on the night of November 13 and assumed command of all forces there, including the IV Corps. Thomas remained concerned that 10,000 troops from the XVI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith, had not arrived as promised reinforcements from Missouri.Sword, pp. 81‚Äì82, 85; Jacobson, pp. 51, 58; Nevin, p. 84. Movement to Columbia thumb400pxHood's advance from Florence to Columbia Hood's headquarters departed Florence at 10 a.m. on November 21, accompanied by Cheatham's corps toward Waynesboro, which they reached on November 23. The army marched in three columns, with Cheatham on the left, Lee in the center, and Stewart on the right, all screened by Forrest's cavalry. Hood's plan was to consolidate his army at Mount Pleasant and from there move to the east to cut off Schofield before he could reach Columbia and the Duck River. The rapid forced march 70 miles north was under miserable conditions, with freezing winds and sleet, which made progress difficult for the underfed and underclothed army. Nevertheless, Hood's men were in good spirits as they returned to Tennessee.Sword, pp. 84, 89, 91; Nevin, pp. 82‚Äì83; Jacobson, pp. 53, 55; Welcher, p. 586; McPherson, p. 180. Because of Forrest's relentless screening, Schofield had no idea where the Confederate Army was headed. The aggressive Forrest had a considerable advantage over his Union cavalry opponents, commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. Wilson had arrived from the Eastern Theater in late October to reorganize and command Thomas's cavalry, but he possessed only 4,300 horsemen, scattered around the theater in numerous small units, compared to 10,000 men unified under Forrest. The Confederate cavalry advanced to Mount Pleasant by November 23. Croxton's brigade was hopelessly outnumbered against Forrest, so Thomas reinforced him with a division under Brig. Gen. Edward Hatch and a brigade under Col. Horace Capron.Jacobson, pp. 56‚Äì59; Sword, p. 91; McPherson, p. 180. Forrest kept up the pressure and on November 23 heavy skirmishing occurred from Henryville to the outskirts of Mount Pleasant. At Fouche Springs (near present-day Summertown) that evening, the Confederate cavalrymen raided one of Capron's encampments, throwing them into chaos and capturing over 50 prisoners. Forrest came close to becoming a casualty as he mistakenly rode into a small group of Federals. One of his staff officers, Maj. John P. Strange, deflected the arm of a Union soldier who was aiming his pistol directly at Forrest's chest at close range and the bullet narrowly missed. The survivors from Capron's brigade fled toward Columbia. To the east, Forrest's divisions under Brig. Gens. Abraham Buford and William H. Jackson forced Hatch's division out of the Lawrenceburg area and drove them back toward Pulaski.Jacobson, pp. 59‚Äì61; Sword, p. 91. Early on November 24, Schofield began marching his two infantry corps north to Columbia. Forrest pursued aggressively with the division of Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers, who occupied Mount Pleasant and hit Capron's men repeatedly as he forced them north. Capron's brigade was reduced from 1,200 to 800 men during the retreat to Columbia. Buford and Jackson drove Hatch north toward Lynnville and captured a number of prisoners, but the Confederate cavalry was unable to prevent the Northern infantry from reaching Columbia. The 5,000-man division of Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox reached Columbia only a few hours before Forrest's men could seize the river crossings and Stanley's corps completed a 30-mile march from Pulaski to reinforce him. Together they began constructing an arc of trenches just south of the town.Jacobson, pp. 64‚Äì65; Sword, pp. 93‚Äì95; Nevin, p. 85; McPherson, p. 180; Welcher, pp. 586‚Äì87; Kennedy, p. 392. Columbia On the morning of November 24, Forrest's cavalry drove Capron's men through Cox's line south of Columbia and began probing attacks in an attempt to break through. The line straddled the Mount Pleasant Pike (present day U.S. Route 43) just north of Bigby Creek and then continued eastward across the Pulaski Pike into the town, curving northward toward the river. By November 25, this line was supplemented with an interior line that roughly encompassed the entire residential area of Columbia. The Confederates bombarded the lines with artillery and a number of skirmishes occurred, but it became apparent to the Union defenders that only a single infantry division with some dismounted cavalry were participating in the attacks and that Hood was merely demonstrating, intending to cross the Duck River either upstream or downstream and cut off the Union force from Thomas, who was assembling the remainder of his force in Nashville.Sword, pp. 93‚Äì95; McPherson, pp. 181‚Äì82; Eicher, p. 770. On the morning of November 26, Schofield received an order from Thomas to hold the north bank of the Duck River until reinforcements under A. J. Smith could arrive from Nashville. Schofield planned to move his trains during the day and his infantry overnight, using a railroad bridge and a recently installed pontoon bridge, but heavy rains that day made approaches to the bridge impassable. That evening, the bulk of the Army of Tennessee reached the fortifications south of Columbia.McPherson, p. 182; Welcher, p. 588; Nevin, p. 88. On November 28, Forrest crossed the river east of town against little resistance from the Union cavalry; the Southern cavalrymen had deceived Wilson and drawn his force to the northeast and away from the action. At the same time, Hood assigned the bulk of Lee's corps and almost all of his artillery to remain at Columbia and led Schofield to believe that he was planning a major attack against the town. Instead, he marched Cheatham's and Stewart's corps across the Duck River on a pontoon bridge assembled at Davis's Ford.Jacobson, pp. 72‚Äì75; Eicher, p. 770; McPherson, p. 182; Welcher, p. 588; Nevin, p. 88. Aftermath No casualties were officially recorded at the \\"Battle of Columbia\\", which consisted primarily of demonstrations, artillery fire, and almost-unopposed maneuvers. Hood's army successfully turned Schofield at Columbia and proceeded north toward Spring Hill in an attempt to isolate the Union force and destroy it.None of the references to this article list any casualty figures for the Battle of Columbia.

Despite the small size of the battle, both side incurred considerable casualties. Background Following the Battle of Dandridge on January 16‚Äì17, Union cavalry moved to the south side of the French Broad River, where they disrupted Confederate foraging parties and captured numerous loaded supply wagons in that area. On January 25, 1864, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, commander of the Department of East Tennessee, instructed his subordinates to curtail Union operations south of the French Broad. On January 26, Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis, having had previous brushes with Confederate cavalry, deployed his troopers to watch the fords in the area. Two Confederate cavalry brigades and artillery advanced from Fair Garden in the afternoon but were checked about four miles from Sevierville. Other Confederates attacked a Union cavalry brigade, though, at Fowler's on Flat Creek, and drove it about two miles. No further fighting occurred that day. =Fair Garden Road= Union scouts observed that the Confederates had concentrated on the Fair Garden Road, so Sturgis ordered an attack there in the morning of January 27. In a heavy fog, Col. Edward M. McCook's Union division attacked and drove back Maj. Gen. William T. Martin's Confederates. At about 4:00 p.m., McCook's men charged with sabers and routed the Confederates. Sturgis set out in pursuit the next day, capturing and killing more of the routed and disorganized Rebels. As the Union force reached the French Broad River near Dandridge, they saw three of Longstreet‚Äôs infantry brigades crossing the river. Realizing that he was outgunned, Sturgis prudently decided to evacuate the area. Sturgis then tried to attack Brig. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong‚Äôs Confederate cavalry division encamped about three or four miles away by the river. Unaware that Armstrong had been reinforced, Sturgis suffered severe casualties in the assault. The battle continued until dark, when the Federals retired from the area. The Federals had initially won the tactical battle, but then lost the foraging grounds when forced to withdraw. There were about 100 Union casualties, and the Confederates lost about 165 men. =Misjudged= Sturgis set out in pursuit on January 28, and captured and killed more of the routed Rebels. The Union forces, however, observed three of Longstreet's infantry brigades crossing the river. Realizing his weariness from fighting, lack of supplies, ammunition, and weapons, and the overwhelming strength of the enemy, Sturgis decided to evacuate the area. But, before leaving, he determined to attack Brig. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong's Confederate cavalry division, which he had learned was about three or four miles away, on the river. Unbeknownst to the attacking Federals, Armstrong had strongly fortified his position and three infantry regiments had arrived to reinforce him. Thus, the Union troops suffered severe casualties in the attack. The battle continued until dark, when the Federals retired from the area.

The experienced Colonel Franz Sigel commanded 1,100 Federal soldiers intent on keeping Missouri within the Union. The Missouri State Guard was commanded by Governor Claiborne F. Jackson himself and numbered over 4,000 soldiers led by a hero of Mexico, Sterling Price, along with 2,000 unarmed troops who did not participate in the battle. Background Political views in Missouri were divided before the American Civil War. St. Louis and its surrounding counties generally sympathized with the Northern states because that region was connected economically with the North. The area also had few slaves and contained a large German immigrant population, most of whom opposed slavery. Missouri Governor Claiborne F. Jackson was pro-Southern, and the rest of the state was very heavily divided. Publicly Jackson tried to stay neutral, but he was suspected by the Union men of secretly preparing the state militia to seize the Federal Arsenal in St. Louis. In April 1861, after the firing on Fort Sumter, President Abraham Lincoln called for troops from all of the states to defeat the Confederacy. Missouri was asked to send four regiments. Governor Jackson refused the request. Instead, he called up the Missouri State Militia, possibly to seize the St. Louis Arsenal. If this was his intention, it was thwarted by the newly appointed commander of the arsenal, Captain Nathaniel Lyon of the 2d U. S. Infantry. Lyon had previously been stationed in Kansas Territory and had developed well-known abolitionist views. Arriving in February 1861, Lyon quickly became associated with the \\"Unconditional Unionist\\" faction in St. Louis. Lyon, like many St. Louis Unionists, feared that Governor Jackson would employ the city's secessionist Minutemen paramilitary organization and the local Missouri Volunteer Militia to capture the Arsenal. Beginning on April 22, 1861, on the orders of President Lincoln, Lyon mustered in four regiments of Federal Missouri Volunteers (mostly former members of Republican Wide Awake marching clubs), issuing them weapons drawn from the Arsenal stocks. Lincoln followed up with orders to remove most of the Arsenal's remaining weapons to Illinois, a transfer which was carried out in secret on the night of April 24‚Äì25, 1861. The crisis grew worse when a shipment of Confederate siege artillery arrived at the state Militia encampment, Camp Jackson, on May 8‚Äì9, 1861. Confronted with (what he considered) clear proof of treasonous plotting at Camp Jackson, Lyon marched a force of Federal regulars and his new Missouri Volunteers to the Camp to arrest the militia. He then surrounded the state militia's camp; forced the troops to surrender; and unwisely, starting from there, marched them as prisoners through St. Louis, inadvertently inciting a deadly riot (the Camp Jackson Affair). The action drew great protests from Missourians, and even representatives of the City of St. Louis petitioned Lincoln for Lyon's dismissal. However, Lyon's action was supported by most of St. Louis' Unconditional Unionists, including Congressman Francis P. Blair, Jr., brother to Lincoln's Postmaster General Montgomery Blair. The Blair brothers arranged for Lyon's promotion to brigadier general. Continued Unconditional Unionist concerns over the accommodation of state authorities by Gen. William S. Harney, commander of the Department of the West, led to Harney's removal on May 31, 1861. Prelude Jackson, the Missouri State Guard fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the Union advance at Carthage. On June 10, 1861, Lyon met with Governor Jackson and Missouri State Guard Major-General Sterling Price at St. Louis' Planter's House hotel in a last attempt to solve conflicting claims for state and federal sovereignty. The conference proved futile, with both parties making mutually unacceptable demands. After four hours, Lyon abruptly ended the meeting, and Jackson and Price retreated to Jefferson City, ordering railroad bridges burned behind them. Lyon moved elements of his St. Louis garrison up the Missouri River by steamer to capture the state capital at Jefferson City. Colonel Franz Sigel took command of a second element of Federal troops moving from St. Louis into southwest Missouri to cut off Missouri State Guard forces who might retreat south in the face of Lyon's advance. On June 12 he started to move his First and Second Battalions, along with five infantry companies, two rifle companies, and an artillery battery towards Springfield. The Missouri State Guard in Jefferson City retreated to Boonville, where a pivotal skirmish took place on June 17. Lyon quickly took the town and chased the Missouri State Guard south. Due to logistical difficulties, Lyon could not keep up with the retreating Guardsmen. Another group of State Guardsmen in Lexington also moved south under Sterling Price, after learning of the defeat at Boonsville. Sigel‚Äôs troops arrived in Springfield and quickly took the town. They prepared to march to Carthage, hoping to catch up with the retreating State Guardsmen. Jackson‚Äôs and Prices‚Äôs units met in Lamar on July 3 and started to organize. Jackson‚Äôs army grew to 6,000 men, a large number of whom joined along the march south. However, the force in Lamar was, for the most part, armed only with hunting rifles, shotguns, knives or, in some cases, no weapons at all. The next day, July 4, Sigel arrived at Carthage with 1,100 men. By July 4, Sigel had intelligence that the Missouri State Guard was camped near Lamar, about 18 miles north of Carthage. On the night of July 4, State Guard skirmishers collided with Sigel‚Äôs pickets outside of Carthage. So both sides were aware of each other‚Äôs presence. Battle The battle as depicted in Harper's Weekly Learning that Sigel had encamped at Carthage, Governor Jackson took command and made plans to attack the smaller but better armed Union force. On the morning of July 5, Jackson marched his green soldiers south. The rival armies met 10 miles north of Carthage, and the State Guard raised two Confederate stars and bars flags on either side of their line, which stretched over half a mile. Sigel‚Äôs men provided an impressive display as they formed a line of battle and moved within 800 yards of the State Guard troops. Opening the action with his artillery, Sigel closed to the attack. Jackson replied with his own artillery. Jackson and the State Guard then chased after Sigel's brigade, engaging them in battle as they pushed them 10 miles southward until they reached the outskirts of Carthage. Jackson had his men divide up and attempt to surround Sigel's force; the battle went on steadily through the day until both forces faced off in the Carthage town square. Both sides then engaged in some skirmishing. At this point, Sigel learned of a large body of Guardsmen-- actually all unarmed recruits--moving into the woods on his left outside of town. Fearing this force would turn his flank, he ordered a retreat. The State Guard pursued, but Sigel conducted a successful rearguard action. By evening, Sigel was back in Carthage. Under cover of darkness, he retreated further to Sarcoxie. Aftermath The battle was a strategic victory by the Missouri State Guard in large part owing to new tactics introduced on the battlefield by independent partisan rangers serving with Captain Jo Shelby.Flaherty and Sutherland. General Jo Shelby, Undefeated Rebel. Pgs. 63-72: Boonville and Carthage Carthage played a part in determining Missouri's course during the war, as it helped spark recruitment for the Southern regiments. A founder of the county who fought in the battle and was then elected Lieutenant Colonel of the 13th Missouri Cavalry Regiment and 5th Missouri Infantry, attorney Robert Wells Crawford, served as a recruiter for the Confederate States Army in Missouri, a post he was nominated for by Waldo P. Johnson, formerly a United States Senator from Missouri in a letter to Missouri governor-in-exile Jackson dated October 24, 1862.Waldo P. Johnson letter (October 24, 1862), Miscellaneous Correspondence, Peter W. Alexander Collection, Columbia University: C. F. Jackson letter, October 24, 1862, Miscellaneous Correspondence, Peter W.

Significance Chronologically the first major battle after Lincoln invoked \\"the war power\\" in lieu of a Declaration of War in his Message to Congress on July 4, 1861,Lincoln, Abraham. July 4th (1861) Message to Congress the Battle of Carthage was strategically and tactically significant. The battle marks the only time a sitting U.S. State governor has led troops in the field, and then, against the Union to which his state belonged. Serving at the vanguard of Governor Jackson's army, a band of 150 independent partisan rangers were under the command of Captain Jo Shelby, a Missouri farmer. From tactical battlefield maneuvers under fire by Sigel's batteries to pressing his retreat to Sarcoxie, Shelby's rangers \\"snatched the victory at Carthage from Sigel's grasp,\\" and pro-Confederate elements in Missouri celebrated their first victory. The depopulation of mineral-rich Jasper County and the destruction of Carthage by sustained hostilities throughout the war paved the way for Victorian-era resettlement.

After his victory at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, Sterling Price and the Missouri State Guard moved further north into Missouri. A force of Union troops under James H. Lane moved from Fort Scott, Kansas to attempt an interception of Price's army, and set an ambush along Dry Wood Creek. Price's Missouri State Guard troops outnumbered Lane's Kansas troops, and after a two hour skirmish forced Lane to retreat to Fort Scott. In their retreat, Lane's troops abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missourians. Price followed up his victory by continuing his northward march, culminating in another victory at the Siege of Lexington, September 13 to 20, before returning south shortly afterwards. Background After the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, Missouri was considered to be a border state, as slavery was legal within the state, but it did not vote to secede. Governor of Missouri Claiborne F. Jackson supported the Confederate States of America, and began to use militia to support the Confederate cause in Missouri by marching towards the arsenal in St. Louis. Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, commander of the Union forces in St. Louis, acted quickly and forced Jackson's militia to surrender in the Camp Jackson affair. After the debacle at Camp Jackson, Jackson formed a new organization named the Missouri State Guard and appointed Sterling Price to command it. Lyon moved to confront Price's new force, defeating it at the Battle of Boonville. Price and the Missouri State Guard retreated to the vicinity of Springfield in southwestern Missouri, where it was joined by a Confederate States Army force commanded by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch. On August 10, Lyon decided to attack the combined forces of Price and McCulloch while they were encamped along Wilsons Creek, despite being outnumbered by the Confederates and Missourians by a factor of over two-to-one. In the ensuing Battle of Wilson's Creek, the Union forces were defeated and Lyon was killed. After Wilson's Creek, the Union army retreated to Rolla, Missouri. McCulloch and his forces withdrew to Arkansas, and Price's Missouri State Guard occupied Springfield. John C. Fremont arrived to take control of Union forces in the state, and James H. Lane took command of several Kansas regiments stationed at Fort Scott. Meanwhile, Price began to advance north with a force estimated to number at either 6,000 or 10,000 men. In response to Price's incursion, Fremont declared Missouri to be subject to martial law. Battle Modern map of the Dry Wood Creek battlefield Lane sent his forces, estimated to number either 600 or 1,200 men, out to intercept Price's army, and set an ambush along Dry Wood Creek in Vernon County, Missouri on September 2. The area around Dry Wood Creek was wooded, giving Lane the element of surprise. The leading portions of the Missouri State Guard fell into Lane's trap. Price then brought up more troops, and the Missourians' numerical advantage was a deciding factor in the engagement. Lane's skirmishers were driven back from an advanced position, and the main Union force used the covers of the woods to hold of Price for about two hours. However, Price's men eventually overwhelmed the Kansans, and Lane's troops retreated to Fort Scott. During the retreat, Lane's men abandoned their supplies and mules to the Missouri State Guard. Price stated that an important factor in the victory was the fighting experience the Missouri State Guard had gained at Wilson's Creek. The capture of the mules led the battle to be sometimes known as the \\"Battle of the Mules\\". The victory at Dry Wood Creek had allowed Price to be able to continue his northward expedition. and his army then headed to Johnson County, Missouri. In a report filed after the battle, Lane stated that his forces lost five men killed and six wounded. In his post-action report, Price estimated his loss to be two men killed and twenty-three wounded, although he noted that most of the wounds were not serious. Aftermath and legacy After reaching Johnson County, Price continued to Lexington, Missouri, where a Union garrison was defending the town. Price's men surrounded the garrison, initiating the Siege of Lexington. The Missouri State Guard subdued the Union garrison, at one point using hemp bales as cover while attacking uphill. After forcing the Union garrison to surrender, the Missouri State Guard remained in the Lexington area for two weeks before Price ordered the unit to return south. Today, the site of the battle is commemorated with a series of markers near Deerfield, Missouri. A museum in nearby Nevada, Missouri provides coverage of both the Battle of Dry Wood Creek and the American Civil War in Missouri as a whole.

The crater from the powder magazine blast is visible on the far right. Pilot Knob is the hill at the back. The Battle of Fort Davidson, also known as the Battle of Pilot Knob, was the opening engagement of Price's Missouri Raid during the American Civil War. This engagement occurred on September 27, 1864, just outside Pilot Knob in Iron County, Missouri. The Union defenders managed to repulse repeated Confederate assaults on their works, and were able to slip away during the night by exploiting a gap in the Southern siege lines. The attacking Rebels took possession of the fort the next day, but Price's profligate expenditure of men and ammunition ended his goal of seizing St. Louis for the Confederacy. Prelude In April 1864, the Confederacy found itself in an increasingly desperate military situation. Unable to win any decisive victories or to obtain foreign recognition, its main strategy by this point was merely to hold on and hope that enormous Union casualties might result in a war-weary Northern public voting Abraham Lincoln out of office in November. The Democratic nominee, General George B. McClellan, had seen his party adopt a plank to make peace with the South if the party were successful--a plank McClellan was forced to repudiate after the Union met with military successes that summer. However, despite the many recent Union triumphs, just one significant military disaster in that shaky autumn of 1864 could still politically embarrass Lincoln and potentially doom his reelection. As the election approached, things began to look even bleaker for the South. General Ulysses S. Grant had pinned down Robert E. Lee in Virginia, while Gen. William Sherman was locked in combat with Gen. Joseph Johnston north of Atlanta. Gen. George Crook's army held the Shenandoah Valley. The only realm that seemed to offer possibilities for a Confederate army embarrassing the Union was in the West. Accordingly, Major General Sterling Price was chosen for this task. He raised a mixed force of 12,000 cavalry and mounted infantry plus fourteen cannon, which he named the Army of Missouri, and set out to \\"liberate\\" his home state. In September 1864, Price left Camden, Arkansas and marched north into Missouri. His initial objective was St. Louis, the state's largest city. Though Sherman had captured Atlanta, which provided a tremendous boost to Lincoln's reelection campaign, the seizure of St. Louis by Price-together with the huge quantities of arms in the St. Louis arsenal-could still prove catastrophic for the Republicans. As they moved north toward Ironton, near the terminus of the Iron Mountain Railroad from St. Louis, Price's army came upon Fort Davidson with a garrison of 1,500 men and seven guns, a tempting target. Price had a total of 12,000 mounted infantry under his command, 3,000 of whom were unarmed. Capturing the fort and its garrison would certainly prove beneficial to Southern morale. As Price prepared to seize the garrison, he received word that Federal troops were moving south to intercept him. Ordering detachments to destroy the railroad to the north at once, he slowly moved his three main brigades into the Arcadia valley, where he invested the fort with his three divisions on the evening of September 26. Union Brig. General Thomas Ewing, deputy commander of the District of St. Louis and a brother-in-law to William T. Sherman, had arrived at Fort Davidson with 200 Iowa infantry to augment the small Federal force already there. He was scouting the route Price might take towards St. Louis when he got word that the Ironton-St. Louis railroad behind him had been cut by Confederate cavalry. Despite being outnumbered ten-to-one, he decided to stand and fight. The fort occupied a strong defensive position, with hexagonal walls nine feet high and ten feet thick, surrounded by a dry moat nine feet deep. Two long rifle pits ran out from the walls, while a reinforced board fence topped the earthworks. Access could only be had through a drawbridge on the structure's southeastern corner. A cleared field of fire extended in every direction beyond the walls; any enemy approach would prove extremely hazardous. Battle Map of Fort Davidson Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Battle of Fort Davidson began on September 26, when the leading elements of Price's army encountered Union pickets south of Ironton, south of Fort Davidson. The Federal troops were driven back into the town, and the two sides exchanged fire on the Iron County Courthouse lawn. That building still stands, and damage from stray bullets can still be seen in the structure's bricks. As more Rebels arrived, the diminutive Union forces withdrew to the fort. On September 27, Ewing rejected several demands by Confederate leaders for the fort's surrender. Ewing later wrote that he considered capitulating, except that he had African American civilians in his camp and the slaughter of black soldiers earlier that year at Fort Pillow, Tennessee concerned him. Furthermore, Ewing was uncertain of his own fate if captured. He had issued General Order ‚Ññ 11 after William C. Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas in 1863, and had used Union cavalry to force thousands of Missouri civilians into Arkansas for alleged collaboration with Confederate bushwackers. Thus, Ewing decided to fight on, and Price determined to take his fort that same day. Price's attack came as one massive assault from several directions: one brigade went over the top of Pilot Knob, engulfing a small Union force there, while another attacked over the summit of Shepherd Mountain. A third brigade skirted Shepherd Mountain to attack the northwestern sides of the fort, and the fourth attacked through a valley between the two mountains. As Union troops were driven back by superior numbers, the Rebels took control of Shepherd Mountain, southwest of the fort. A two-gun Confederate battery was subsequently deployed there, and its murderous fire caused the smaller of the two rifle pits within the fort to be abandoned. These assaults were not made simultaneously, however, allowing the guns of Fort Davidson to be directed at each Confederate unit in turn. Just one brigade actually reached the fort itself, under a withering hail of cannon and musket fire, only to find the earthworks too steep to climb. During the assault, Union defenders were given hand grenades from the fort's magazines; these wood-finned impact devices were tossed over the walls, forcing the Rebels to break off their attack. The disorganized Southerners fell back and prepared to assault the fort again the following day. As Price now set his troops to building scaling ladders for a new assault the next morning, Ewing held a Council of War inside the fort. Ewing had received belated orders from St. Louis to abandon the post; he now agreed that his position was untenable and planned to escape. Union soldiers put all equipment they could not take with them inside their powder magazine, draped the drawbridge in canvas to muffle the sounds of their movement, and began stealthily to exit the fort after midnight. Though the Confederates had lit a large charcoal pile to illuminate the valley, Union survivors withdrew undetected to the northwest directly between exhausted Confederates in two encampments. They left a slow- burning fuse to their powder magazine, which detonated with a huge blast well after the Union troops had gone. Despite the enormous explosion, Price did not have his men investigate the fort's condition until daybreak. Aftermath Price's subordinates were furious at this deception, and demanded that their commander pursue the escaping Union troops. But Price demurred. He had lost 6% of his army and three precious days in this fruitless exercise, and his dreams of taking St. Louis were now clearly dashed. During Ewing's defense of the fort and escape his losses were high, by the 29th only around 6-700 survivors of the original 1500 limped into Leasburg, and eventually Ewing received the personal thanks of a grateful President, Abraham Lincoln.Price's campaign and Ewing's defense at Fort Davidson is one focus of Ronald D. Smith's book on Thomas Ewing Jr., infra. Although the exact numbers of Confederate casualties are unknown, historians estimate that total Southern losses at the Battle of Fort Davidson were approximately 500. Earlier accounts included a higher number. This compares to 200 Union casualties, 28 of which were killed. Price's troopers mounted up and resumed their advance northward, eventually turning west toward Jefferson City, the state capital. Finding that city too heavily fortified, they continued even further westward, fighting their way toward Kansas City and Fort Leavenworth. Ultimately, at Westport, Price would suffer a crushing defeat, and was forced to end his Missouri campaign. At the subsequent Battle of Mine Creek, the largest cavalry action of the Civil War and the only pitched battle between Union and Confederate armies fought in Kansas, Price's army was virtually destroyed as an effective unit. It limped back into Arkansas, having lost over 50% of the men who began the campaign in September. Fort Davidson State Historic Site Granite monument behind which stand the earthworks of the fort Today, the battle area and a museum is operated by the Missouri State Parks system as \\"Fort Davidson State Historic Site\\". The earthworks of the fort are still generally intact, surrounding the huge hole that was caused by the powder explosion. Following the battle, the Confederates retained the field and were therefore responsible for burying the dead. One of the rifle pits was accordingly selected for use as a mass grave. The mass grave is now marked by a granite monument. The site is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Although the battle resulted in a Confederate victory and the capture of significant war material, it had little long-term benefit as Price was ultimately defeated at Westport a week later, bringing his campaign in Missouri to an end. Background The battle of Glasgow was a part of Price's Missouri Expedition, a raid by Confederates under the command of Major General Sterling Price into Missouri which began on 19 September 1864. Price's primary aims were to recruit men from pro-Confederate areas of northern Missouri, capture the Federal arsenal at St Louis, and seize animals and supplies for Confederate use. He hoped that his raid might relieve the pressure on Confederate forces in Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia by diverting Union troops to fight him; he also hoped his raid would influence the November presidential election, by reducing support for Abraham Lincoln. After sustaining heavy casualties during the Battle of Fort Davidson, Price turned away from St. Louis, and headed towards Jefferson City, the state capital. Nearing his objective, Price concluded that it was too heavily defended, and ordered his troops to move further west towards Lexington and Kansas City. At this point, Price detached troops from his army to capture the city of Glasgow, on the Missouri River, having been informed of a storehouse there containing weapons and supplies. A Union garrison of 800 men was located in Glasgow, under the command of Colonel Chester Harding. The size of the Confederate forces engaged against them was reported as being between 1,500 and 1,800 troops including infantry, cavalry, and artillery.Report of Cpt. George Holloway, U.S. Army, Asst. Adjutant General, pp. 430‚Äì31. These were commanded by Brigadier Generals John Bullock Clark, Jr., and Joe Shelby. Battle Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, commander of the Confederate forces engaged in Price's Missouri Expedition. Brig. Gen. John Bullock Clark, Jr. was a commander of Confederate forces engaged in the Battle of Glasgow. Map of Glasgow Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. When the Confederates reached Glasgow, they laid siege to the town. Four pieces of Rebel artillery commenced shelling the city at 5 AM on October 15, 1864, and continued firing until 1 PM. Additional cannon were deployed to support the infantry assault, which began at 7 AM as Rebel soldiers advanced into Glasgow from multiple directions.Holloway, pg. 430. Hereford Hill, a nearby promontory which the Union soldiers had fortified, was also brought under attack. After fierce resistance, the Federals were compelled to fall back from the town to their breastworks on the hill, but not before blowing up the Glasgow city hall, which they had been using to store their munitions. The ensuing explosion destroyed a half-block of downtown Glasgow. Once atop the hill, the Union troops formed a line of defense. However, as the Confederates continued their steady advance, Harding became convinced that his forces could not win and accordingly surrendered his command at 1:30 PM, upon receipt of generous terms from his foes. The Confederates occupied Glasgow for three days, taking 1,200 muskets, 1,200 overcoats, and 150 horses before leaving to rejoin Price's command. A Federal steamboat captured at the Glasgow wharf was burned.Report of Brig. Gen. John Clark, CSA, pp. 681‚Äì82. Captain G.A. Holloway, U.S. Adjutant General, testified to the \\"uniform, kind and gentlemanly treatment\\" the Federals received at the hands of Clark and Shelby.Holloway, pg. 431. The paroled Union troops were permitted to retain their personal property, and officers were allowed to keep their sidearms after the surrender. Clark equally permitted his defeated foes to proceed by any route they might select to Union lines at Boonville, and promised not to disturb private property or citizens remaining in the town. Aftermath The Confederate victory at Glasgow and the captured supplies proved a boost to the Confederates' morale, especially after their failures to take St. Louis or Jefferson City. Price's army would continue to advance through Missouri, but the high losses in men and material at the Battle of Westport on 23 October 1864 finally convinced Price to withdraw his forces from the state. During the retreat, Price's men were attacked repeatedly by Union troops as they made their way through eastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri into Arkansas. Price had not been able to gain enough recruits to replace his losses, and the large number of troops deployed against him in Missouri had solidified the already-formidable Union hold over that state. Hence, Price's raid would ultimately be described as being \\"barren of results\\". Although a bright spot in an otherwise rather dismal campaign, the Battle of Glasgow is considered to have been at best a \\"token\\" victory, though it did provide Price's forces with much-needed supplies.

The Union victory consolidated control of southeastern Missouri. Background In October 1861, Missouri State Guard Brigadier-General M. Jeff Thompson led a 1500-man force into southeastern Missouri. On October 15, he burned the Iron Mountain Railroad bridge over the Big River in Jefferson County, capturing many of the bridge guards. Two Union columns, one under Col. Joseph B. Plummer with 1,500 men and another under Col. William P. Carlin with 3,000 men, were sent in pursuit. By October 20, Thompson had learned of the Union pursuit and withdrew south of Fredericktown. That evening, however, he decided to attack the Federal advance with his infantrymen. Battle Thompson spent the early morning hours trying to determine the enemy's numbers and disposition. Unable to do so, he placed his troops and artillery in ambush along the road and awaited the Union forces. The bulk of the Missouri State Guard force was hidden from view on wooded high ground that formed a U overlooking the road. Forward of the main body, Col. Aden Lowe's infantry regiment waited in a cornfield as bait. Close behind was a supporting 12-pounder cannon as well as three 6-pounders farther to the rear and flank. About noon Plummer arrived with his column and a detachment of Col. William P. Carlin's troops. Capt. Stewart's Illinois cavalry company made the initial contact. Col. Ross's 17th Illinois Infantry engaged Lowe's troops first with skirmishers, then the main line of the regiment. A section of Union artillery was brought into service against the Missourians' 12-pounder, which responded. The 20th Illinois and 11th Missouri (Union) applied pressure to both flanks of Lowe's force as more Union artillery joined the battle. Lowe, having waited too long to disengage, was killed by a shot to the head, and his regiment retreated taking heavy casualties. The 1st Indiana Cavalry attempted to pursue and to capture the exposed 12-pounder, but were stopped with heavy casualties by the fire of Thompson's forces on both ridges. They called for infantry support and the 17th Illinois surged forward to claim the now abandoned piece. As more Union infantry poured onto the field, Thompson began an orderly withdrawal of the guardsmen. In this he mostly succeeded, except for some routing cavalry. Casualties Thompson's Missouri State Guardsmen suffered a total of 145 casualties during the battle, including 25 dead, 40 wounded, and 80 captured. They also lost one artillery piece, an old iron 12-pounder. Union casualties were reported as 7 killed and about 60 wounded. There were a number of other casualties (primarily Union) in skirmishes before and after the battle. Aftermath Some of the Union soldiers believed that locals had assisted Thompson in the engagement. They were also angered by perceived mistreatment of Unionist citizens along the line of march. This resentment led to retaliation against the town by the rank and file. At least seven homes in Fredericktown were burned and other buildings damaged before the officers regained control of their men.

Marmaduke's first expedition into Missouri, during the American Civil War. Background Map of Hartville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Marmaduke led a Confederate raid into Missouri in early January 1863. This movement was two-pronged. Col. Joseph C. Porter led one column, comprising his Missouri Cavalry Brigade, out of Pocahontas, Arkansas, to assault Union posts around Hartville, Missouri. When he neared Hartville on January 9, he sent a detachment forward to reconnoiter. It succeeded in capturing the small militia garrison. The same day, Porter moved toward Marshfield. On January 10, some of Porter's men raided other Union installations in the area before making contact with Marmaduke's column east of Marshfield. Marmaduke had received reports of Union troops approaching to surround him and prepared for a confrontation. On January 10, Col. Samuel Merrill commanded an approaching Union relief column from Houston, Missouri. He and his command arrived in Hartville that morning, discovered that the small garrison had already surrendered, and set out toward Springfield. His force went into camp on Wood's Fork of the Gasconade River. Early on the morning of January 11 the approaching Confederates under Porter made contact with Merrill's scouts and skirmishing commenced.

Meanwhile, observing this movement, Merrill marched his force directly to Hartville where it took a strong defensive position on covered, high ground west of the courthouse. Shelby and Porter's brigades attempted to dislodge Merrill's force, but it was too strongly positioned. Over a four-hour period several Confederate assaults were made, each being repulsed in turn. Eventually Merrill withdrew most of his force, although a third of the men under Lt. Col Dunlap never received the order and remained on the field until nightfall. Aftermath Major George R Kirtley Grave Marker in the Springfield National Cemetery Elements of both sides observed the other withdrawing from the field as night approached, and both claimed victory as a result. The real results were mixed. From the Union command's perspective they had repulsed Marmaduke's assaults inflicting heavy casualties, but the Federals had been forced to leave the field. From the Confederate perspective Marmaduke had united his force and secured his line of withdrawal. He set up a field hospital in town and could claim to control the field briefly. However, he was compelled to make a rapid retreat into Arkansas and then an arduous trek to winter camp. Additionally, the frontal assaults had resulted in the death or mortal wounding of several senior CSA officers including: brigade commander Col. Joseph C. Porter, Col. Emmett MacDonald, Lt. Col. John Wimer, and Major George R. Kirtley.‚ÄúMarmaduke‚Äôs Expedition into Missouri‚Äù. Index to the Miscellaneous Documents of the House of Representatives. Congressional edition, Volume 2580.

The raid itself caused great disruption of Federal forces in the region and a number of small outposts had been overrun, destroyed, or abandoned. However, the other major objective, the depot at Springfield, remained in Union hands. The successful escape of the raiding party did foreshadow the vulnerability of Federal Missouri to fast-moving expeditions.

Its result was a Confederate victory, continuing the Southern domination of the Jackson County area for a few days while the recruiters completed their work. This battle should not be confused with the Second Battle of Independence, which was fought in 1864. That battle also resulted in a Confederate victory. Background During the summer of 1862, many Confederate and Missouri State Guard recruiters were dispatched northward from Arkansas into Missouri to replenish the depleted ranks of Trans- Mississippi forces. Among these were Captain Jo Shelby, Colonel Vard Cockrell, Colonel John T. Coffee, Upton Hays, John Charles Tracy, John T. Hughes, Gideon W. Thompson and DeWitt C. Hunter. Various guerrillas and bushwhackers, most notably those under William Quantrill, had gathered in Missouri and assisted these recruiters as they worked in the region. For example, Upton Hays was aided by thirty men from Quantrill's command under the brutal George Todd.Eakin, Joanne Chiles, Battle of Independence, August 11, 1862, Two Trails Publishing, 2000, page 4 By August 1, Hays was camped near Lee's Summit with 150 men. Additional Confederates continued to infiltrate the area throughout the days that followed. Union forces, meanwhile, were bivouacked in Independence, the county seat of Jackson County. These were led by Lt. Col. James T. Buel. Like many towns in that part of Missouri, Independence had a number of sympathizers from both sides residing in it. Colonel Hughes intended to cross the Missouri River, to recruit around his hometown of Clinton County, Missouri. He and Gideon Thompson rode to Hays's camp with 75 men; 25 additional men with Quantrill soon arrived. The officers conferred. Desperate for ammunition, and needing a victory to stir their recruiting efforts, they determined to make a surprise attack against Buel before he could attack them. Cole Younger and another man conducted a successful reconnaissance of the town on the day prior to the Confederate attack. Lt. Col. Buel for his part had sent one of his officers, a Captain Breckenridge, scouting for eleven days, but Breckenridge found nothing. Buel became aware of Hays's camp, however, and prepared to attack it. On the evening of August 10, several citizens warned Buel of an impending assault on the city; many Union residents had already fled. Buel ignored these warnings, but another of his officers, a Captain Rodewald, did not. The Federals were positioned in three main concentrations: their camp near a rock wall, the bank serving as Buel's headquarters, and the county jail. Opposing forcesUnion= Lt. Col. James T.

They drove through the town to the Union Army camp, delivering a deadly volley to the sleeping men. Captain Breckenridge suggested surrender, but Captain Jacob Axline formed the Federal troops behind a rock wall and a nearby ditch while the Confederates rifled through their camp, looking for ammunition. The Rebels made several attacks against Axline's wall, but never succeeded in taking it. Here Colonel Hughes was killed, while Thompson and Hays were wounded. Lt. Col. Buel attempted to hold out with part of his force in the bank building he used as his headquarters. He was forced to surrender after an adjacent building was set afire. Through a flag of truce, Buel arranged a meeting with the new Confederate commander, Col. Gideon W. Thompson, who had replaced Colonel Hughes, killed earlier. Buel surrendered, and about 150 of his men were paroled; the remainder had escaped, hidden, or been killed. Murders committed by George Todd 1859 Independence Jail. George Todd murdered one of the jail prisoners, together with a captured Federal officer, during the First Battle of Independence Realizing that they would be quickly overwhelmed, the Federal troops defending the jail fired a volley and fled. Confederate guerilla leader George Todd freed the prisoners at the jail, among them City Marshal James Knowles, jailed for the killing of a rowdy citizen. Todd also captured Captain Aaron Thomas of the 2nd Battalion Missouri State Militia Cavalry. Knowles had guided Thomas' force in a successful ambush of Todd's command in an earlier engagement, killing several of them. Todd and his men summarily executed Knowles and Thomas. Ironically, George Todd was later killed at the Second Battle of Independence, in 1864. Casualties and aftermath The First Battle of Independence resulted in approximately 344 known Union casualties; total losses for the Confederate side are unknown. Most of the Union command in Independence was captured, with only a few groups of men making good their escape. The Confederate victory was costly, however, resulting in the death of ten experienced officers, among them Colonel John T. Hughes, and the wounding of Colonels Hays and Thompson. The victors left town late that afternoon, but remained in the area for several days. Hays led them in a cooperative attack with other Confederate commands against a Federal force arriving at Lone Jack. Although the Southerners had won a victory at Independence, they were unable to follow it up in any significant fashion. Confederate dominance in the Jackson County area would continue‚Äîbut not for long. Lt. Col. Buel's performance and his failure to heed warnings of impending attack by prominent citizens were widely condemned. Captain Breckenridge's inability to find any guerrillas in the preceding eleven days, together with his eagerness to surrender, were also considered disgraceful. Both men were court-martialled and the soldiers who had been captured were mustered out of service. Since the two officers had been dismissed with their men, nothing ultimately came of the court martial proceedings. On June 3, 1864 the former Capt. Axline was murdered by guerrillas (probably of George Todd's command) while on his way home to Hickman Mills.Nichols, Bruce, Guerrilla Warfare in Civil War Missouri, Volume III, January - August 1864, McFarland, 2014, p. 283 Independence would later become the site of a second Civil War battle, in October 1864, as part of General Sterling Price's Missouri Campaign that culminated in his defeat at the Battle of Westport.

Sterling Price's 1864 Missouri Campaign, and culminated in his defeat at the Battle of Westport the next day, and the Battle of Mine Creek on the 25th. It was the most dramatic American Civil War action involving Jackson County, MissouriChapter 13: The Second Battle of Independence (includes eyewitness report written October 23, 1864) The Centennial History of Independence, Mo. by W.L.

That earlier battle resulted in a Confederate victory. Background Map of Independence II Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Second Battle of Independence was part of a series of battles, fought within 7 days near the Kansas-Missouri Border. These battles include battles at Lexington (Oct 19), Little Blue (Oct 21), Independence (Oct 21-22), Westport (Oct 23), Marais des Cygnes (Oct 25, also called the Battle of Osage, and the Battle of Trading Post), Mine Creek (Oct 25), and Marmiton River (Oct 25, also called Battle of Shiloh Creek or Battle of Charlot's Farm). Most of these battles were fought without adequate forage for horses, or rations for the men. In the fall of 1864, Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price was dispatched by his superior, Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, to attempt to seize Missouri for the Confederacy. Unable to attack his primary objective, St. Louis, Price decided to execute Smith's backup plan for a westward raid through Missouri and into Kansas and the Indian Territory. Their ultimate goal was to destroy or capture Union supplies and outposts, which might negatively affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in 1864. After victories at Glasgow and Lexington, Price continued his march westward, in the direction of Kansas City and Fort Leavenworth, headquarters of the Federal Department of Kansas. His army, which he termed the Army of Missouri, was organized with Brig. Gen. Joseph Shelby's division in the lead, followed by Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke's division, with Brig. Gen. James Fagan's division bringing up the rear. Union forces opposing Price consisted of militia units and the XVI Corps of Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith, augmented by the cavalry division of Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, detached from William S. Rosecrans's Department of Missouri. In addition, the newly activated Army of the Border under Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis would engage Price's force. Curtis commanded the divisions of Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt (cavalry), Maj. Gen. George W. Dietzler (Kansas Militia Division), Pleasonton's cavalry, and two infantry divisions detached from Smith's Corps under Colonels Joseph J. Woods and David Moore‚Äîabout 22,000 men in all. Prelude Following their defeat at Lexington, the small detachment of Union troops engaged in this battle under General Blunt retreated west toward Independence. They set up camp on October 20 behind strong defensive positions on the west bank of the Little Blue River, about five miles east of town, and awaited the main Confederate force. However Blunt's superior, General Curtis, ordered him to abandon these positions save for a small blocking force under Colonel Thomas Moonlight, and return to Independence. October 21 The Second Battle of Independence actually commenced as a connected engagement at the Little Blue River, in the rural easternmost boundaries of the city, and involved different Union troops on each day. It began on October 21, when General Blunt was ordered to return to the Little Blue and reoccupy the same defensive positions he had been directed to abandon only the day before. Upon his arrival, he found that Colonel Moonlight had burnt the bridge over the river as previously instructed, after being attacked by Price's advance guard. Railroad cut in Independence, Missouri where Confederate forces encamped overnight October 21‚Äì22, 1864. This view is a few hundred yards due west of the \\"Harry Truman\\" Railroad Depot on Pacific Street in central Independence. About 7 AM, General Shelby's troops arrived on the scene, and fiercely engaged the Union forces, Colonel Moonlight's troops, about 600 men and four twelve-pound mountain howitzers. Witnesses reported that the Federals entrenched themselves behind rock walls, and forced attacking Confederates to fight for nearly every inch of ground. At this time, General Blunt's 1st Division, along with Colonel James Ford's Fourth Brigade were brought in as reinforcements. The Fourth Brigade consisted of the 2nd Colorado and 16th Kansas cavalries, and the Colorado Battery, about 900 men with six guns. At 10 AM, the Union troops were compelled to give way, retreating west through Independence toward Westport. The 1st and 4th Brigades leaving the fight at Independence, joining the fight at the Big Blue, eight miles away. Union rearguard units attempted to impede Price's progress throughout the afternoon of the 21st, as brisk fighting raged through the streets of the city, but all were ultimately compelled to withdraw. Price's troops halted their advance at an unfinished railroad cut on the western side of town's center, and made camp there for the evening.ibid. Retrieved on 11 July 2008. At some later point in time, General Blunt arrived, and had the troops form a new line of battle. At this time, the 11th, 15th and 16th Kansas, McLain's Battery, the 2nd Colorado, the 3rd Wisconsin and the 1st Brigade were involved., dismounted, totalling less than 2,500. The 11th Kansas ran out of ammunition during the battle, but remained on the field.. One casualty of the first day's fighting was Confederate raider George M. Todd, who had participated in the First Battle of Independence in 1862, where he was guilty of summarily executing two captured Union officers. Periodic gunfire continued throughout the night, as each side probed the other. Union infantry troops continued their withdrawal to the Big Blue River, west of Independence. October 22 On the 22nd, Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's advance force ran into the rear guard of Price's troops (Fagan, with 4500, and Marmaduke with 2500) at the Little Blue River. At 5 AM, the division moved to the crossing of the Little Blue, where the bridge was found to have been destroyed. A temporary bridge was constructed, and at dawn, Brig. Gen. John McNeil's 2nd brigade, followed by Brig. Gen. John Sanborn's 3rd brigade, of Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's Union force of 7,000 cavalry crossed the Little Blue River, and engaged Price's rear guard. Around 2 PM, McNeil's troops began pushing nearer the town. McNeil ordered the 5th Missouri State Militia out as skirmishers, and then dismounted two of his brigades, the 17th Illinois. and 13th Missouri. The Confederates were supported by artillery until about 3 PM. Fagan's battle line, on grounds of the modern Independence Temple At about 3 PM, Pleasonton arrived, and recognized that Cabell's Confederate troops were in a difficult situation due to the number of streets entering Independence, providing possible avenues of attack. Sanborn's troops attacked the town from the north and northeast (and thus, from the rear of Price's force), his cavalry on foot. McNeil's troops then attacked from the east, forming about one quarter mile from town, and charging the town on horseback, Seven companies of Catherton's 13th Missouri regiment formed into a column of fours, and attacked with sabers,. Other troops in these Brigades included the 7th Kansas, the 17th Illinois, and the 2nd Arkansas cavalry regiments, the 2nd leading the attack by Sanborn's troops. Two of Fagan's Confederate brigades (Arkansans) were roughly handled by the attacking Federals, being pushed back through the city toward the west, where the main Union force lay. The Confederates were supported at this time by Parrott guns. An additional Confederate brigade attempted to stem the onslaught on the grounds of what is now the Community of Christ's Independence Temple, but was practically annihilated by Pleasonton's force with only a few Rebels escaping. During the battle, the Union captured two rifled cannon, formerly used by the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery (US), 40 dead, also capturing 300 Confederates from Cabell's and Slemon's Brigades. Union casualties were 14 killed, 58 wounded and 11 missing, for a total of 83. Confederate officers captured during the attack included officers from the following regiments; 45th Arkansas, the 10th Missouri State Guard, Coffey's, Lowther's, Crabtree's, Freeman's, Gordon's, Slayback's, Elliott's, Jeff Thompson's and Goodwin's. Marmaduke's division engaged Pleasonton about two miles west of Independence, managing to push the Federals back and hold them until the morning of October 23. The focus of combat then shifted westward from Independence to Westport, in modern Kansas City. Aftermath Although Price claimed a victory due to the bravery of Marmaduke and his men, Pleasonton's bold actions greatly worried him. Concerned for the safety of his supplies, Price sent his wagon trains to Little Santa Fe on the Fort Scott Road, once he had crossed the Big Blue River. The following day, the 30,000 troops of both armies joined combat at the Battle of Westport, resulting in a decisive Union victory and the end of major Confederate military efforts in Missouri.

The victory won by the Missouri Guard bolstered the considerable Southern sentiment in the area, and briefly consolidated Missouri State Guard control of the Missouri River Valley in the western part of the state. Background Prior to the American Civil War, Lexington was an agricultural town of over 4,000 residentsGifford, Douglas L., Lexington Battlefield Guide, Instantpublisher (self-published), 2004, page 8. that served as the county seat of Lafayette County and enjoyed a position of considerable local importance on the Missouri River in west-central Missouri. Hemp (used for rope production), tobacco, coal and cattle all contributed to the town's wealth, as did the river trade. Though Missouri remained in the Union during the war, many of Lexington's residents were slaveowners, and several openly sympathized with the Southern cause. Lafayette County had a high ratio of slaves to free persons, with slaves comprising 31.7% of its population.1860 United States Census Following the Battle of Boonville in June 1861, Federal Brigadier Gen. Nathaniel Lyon ordered the 5th Regiment of the United States Reserve Corps to occupy Lexington. This regiment was composed primarily of Germans from St. Louis, and it had participated in the Camp Jackson Affair. Arriving on the steamer White Cloud on July 9, the Northerners were commanded by Colonel Charles G. Stifel. Stifel's second in command was Lt. Col. Robert White, who became a primary point of contact with the local civilians. Stifel selected the defunct Masonic College in Lexington as his headquarters, and the soldiers began entrenching and fortifying that position.Wood, p. 18-21. Stifel's scouts began securing or destroying boats that could be used to cross the river, and also confiscated about 200 kegs of gunpowder, 33 muskets, and two 6-pounder cannons from the area. The cannons were placed under the command of Charles M. Pirner. Several local pro-Union home guard companies were raised and placed under the command of Major Frederick W. Becker.Wood, p. 21-22. In mid-August the 90-day enlistments of Stifel's regiment were expiring, and they were ordered to return to St. Louis. Lt. Col. White had been organizing a new regiment locally, but he suddenly left for several weeks during which time Major Becker had command of the post. Meanwhile, on the Southern side, self-styled Colonel Henry L. Routt of Clay County had collected around a thousand men for a regiment that he was raising. Routt had led the force that had seized the Liberty Arsenal in April.Wood, p. 25-26. Routt now arrested several prominent Union men, including former Missouri governor Austin A. King, then surrounded the Federal outpost at Lexington. He demanded Becker's surrender but this was refused. One night two of Becker's men, Charles and Gustave Pirner, tested some rounds they had fabricated for two mortars that had come into their possession. They lobbed three shells into Routt's encampment with one of the mortars, causing a panic but no real damage. Later, learning of the approach of Col. Thomas A. Marshall's 1st Illinois cavalry, Routt withdrew from the area. Lt. Col. Robert White returned at the end of August and briefly assumed command of the post from Becker until the Illinois cavalry arrived a few days later. White resumed organization of the 14th Home Guard Regiment.Wood, p. 26-27. Following their victory at Wilson's Creek on August 10, the main body of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard under Maj. Gen. Sterling Price marched toward the Missouri-Kansas border with around 7,000 men to repel incursions by Lane's pro-Union Kansas Brigade. On September 2, the Guard drove away Lane's Kansans in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek, sending them back beyond Fort Scott. Price then turned north along the border and toward Lexington, intending to break Federal control of the Missouri River and gather recruits from both sides of the river. Price collected recruits as he went along, including Col. Routt and several hundred of his men then at the town of Index in Cass County.Wood, pp 30‚Äì34 Federal reinforcements arrived in Lexington on September 4: the 13th Missouri Infantry commanded by Col. Everett Peabody and a battalion of the United States Reserve Corps under Maj. Robert T. Van Horn. To prevent rebel Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson from obtaining any funds from local banks, General John C. Fr√©mont gave orders to impound their funds. On September 7, Col. Marshall removed approximately $1,000,000 from the Farmers' Bank in Lexington while Col. Peabody was dispatched to Warrensburg to do the same there. On arriving in Warrensburg, Peabody's detachment found itself in Price's path and made a hasty retreat back to Lexington.Wood, pp. 27‚Äì28, 35‚Äì36 Finally, on September 10, Colonel James A. Mulligan arrived to take command with his 23rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment‚Äîknown as the \\"Irish Brigade\\"‚Äîand a detachment of the 27th Missouri Mounted Infantry under Lt. Col. Benjamin W. Grover.MHR Vol. 8, Iss 1, p. 20 On September 11, the 13th Missouri Infantry and Van Horn's battalion returned to Lexington. Mulligan now commanded 3,500 men, and quickly commenced to constructing extensive fortifications around the town's Masonic College where it soon developed a fatal shortage of drinking water.The Army of Tennessee p. 31. Trees were felled to make lines of fire, and earthworks were erected around the dormitory and classroom buildings. His superiors dispatched further reinforcements under Samuel D. Sturgis, with which Mulligan hoped to hold his enlarged position, but they were ambushed by pro-Confederate militia (alerted by a secessionist telegraph tapper) and compelled to retreat.http://cw- chronicles.com/anecdotes/?p=77 .

Skirmishing began the morning of September 12, when two Federal companies posted behind hemp shocks along a hill opposed Price's cavalry advance. Price pulled back several miles to Garrison creek to await his artillery and infantry. With their arrival in the afternoon, he resumed the advance along a more westerly course, eventually intercepting the Independence Road.Wood, pp. 38‚Äì40 Mulligan dispatched four companies of the 13th Missouri Infantry (USA) and the two companies of Van Horn's United States Reserve Battalion to oppose this movement. They battled Price's advance elements among the tombstones in Machpelah Cemetery south of town, hoping to buy time for the rest of Mulligan's men to complete their defensive preparations. Price's artillery deployed and together with his growing infantry contingent, dislodged the defenders and forced them back to their fortifications.Wood, pp. 40‚Äì42 Pursuing the fleeing Federals, Price deployed Guibor and Bledsoe's batteries to shell the Federal fortifications at the college. Three Federal artillery pieces replied, destroying one of Guibor's caissons near the end of the exchange. The two-and-a-half hour artillery duel badly diminished the State Guard's ammunition, and much of Price's ordnance supply train had been left at Osceola.Wood, pp. 43‚Äì45 This development combined with the redoubtable nature of the Union fortifications to render any further assault impractical. The Federals remained trapped in their fortress, however, surrounded by an army nearly five times their size. Having bottled up his enemy, Price decided to await his own ammunition wagons, other supplies and reinforcements before renewing the assault. \\"It is unnecessary to kill off the boys here,\\" said he; \\"patience will give us what we want.\\" Accordingly, he ordered his infantry to fall back to the county fairgrounds. On September 18, Price had determined the time had come. The State Guard advanced under heavy Union artillery fire, pushing the enemy back into their inner works. Price's cannon responded to Mulligan's with nine hours of bombardment, utilizing heated shot in an attempt to set fire to the Masonic College and other Federal positions.Missouri State Parks .

Sometime around July 1861 the Anderson family was evicted from their home, which lay adjacent to Col. Mulligan's fortifications, and a Union hospital was established there. (includes 16 photographs from 1991) At the start of the battle over a hundred sick or wounded Union soldiers occupied this structure, with their medical care entrusted to a surgeon named Dr. Cooley, while Father Butler, Chaplain of the 23rd Illinois, provided for their spiritual needs. Because of its tactical significance‚Äîlying as only a few yards from State Guard positions‚ÄîGeneral Thomas Harris ordered soldiers from his 2nd Division (MSG) to capture the house on September 18. Shocked at what he considered a violation of the Laws of War, Col. Mulligan ordered the structure to be retaken. Company B, 23rd Illinois, Company B, 13th Missouri, and volunteers from the 1st Illinois Cavalry charged from the Union lines and recaptured the house, suffering heavy casualties in the process. Harris's troops recaptured the hospital later that day, and it remained in State Guard hands thereafter. During the Federal assault on the Anderson house, Union troops summarily executed three State Guard soldiers at the base of the grand staircase in the main hall. The Southerners claimed the men had already surrendered, and should have been treated as prisoners of war. The Federal troops, who had sustained numerous casualties in retaking the residence, considered the prisoners to have been in violation of the Laws of War for having attacked a hospital in the first place. The Anderson home was heavily damaged by cannon and rifle projectiles, with many of the holes still visible both inside and outside the house (which is now a museum) today. The Anderson House and Lexington Battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.. =Preparing for the final assault= On September 19 the State Guard consolidated its positions, kept the Federals under heavy artillery fire, and prepared for their final attack. One problem faced by the defenders was a chronic lack of water; wells within the Union lines had gone dry, and State Guard sharpshooters were able to cover a nearby spring, picking off any man who tried to approach it. Surmising that a woman might succeed where his men had failed, Mulligan sent a female to the spring. Price's troops held their fire, and even permitted her to take a few canteens of water back to the beleaguered Federals.Missouri in the Civil War, Vol. 9, Ch. 7. Retrieved on July 29, 2008.

Decades after the battle, the then-elderly gentleman signed an affidavit with his story, then gave the cannonball to County Commissioners. They in turn had the ball screwed onto a two-foot iron rod embedded in the column for the purpose, where it remains visible to tourists today.Slusher, p. 25\\"A Cannonball, a Calaboose, and Counte Basie\\", tour brochure, 2013Lexington Advertiser-News, June 3, 1970 On the evening of September 19, soldiers of Brigadier General Thomas A. Harris's 2nd Division (State Guard) began using hemp bales seized from nearby warehouses to construct a moveable breastwork facing the Union entrenchment. These bales were soaked in river water overnight, to render them impervious to any heated rounds fired from the Federal guns. Harris's plan was for his troops to roll the bales up the hill the following day, using them for cover as they advanced close enough to the Union garrison for a final charge. The hemp bale line started in the vicinity of the Anderson house, extending north along the hillside for about 200 yards. In many places the hemp bales were stacked two high to provide additional protection. =Deployment of the hemp bales= Confederates fighting behind hemp bales Early on the morning of September 20, Harris's men advanced behind his mobile breastworks. As the fighting progressed, State Guardsmen from other divisions joined Harris's men behind them, increasing the amount of fire directed toward the Union garrison. Although the defenders poured red-hot shot into the advancing bales, their soaking in the Missouri River the previous night had given the hemp the desired immunity to the Federal shells. By early afternoon, the rolling fortification had advanced close enough for the Southerners to take the Union works in a final rush. Mulligan requested surrender terms after noon, and at 2:00 p.m. his men vacated their trenches and stacked their arms. Many years later, in his book The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Southern president Jefferson Davis opined that \\"The expedient of the bales of hemp was a brilliant conception, not unlike that which made Tarik, the Saracen warrior, immortal, and gave his name to the northern pillar of Hercules.\\"Davis, Jefferson, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.

The main battlefield where Confederates climbed the bluffs of the Missouri River pushing hemp bales up the bluff to defeat the Union positions. Casualties at Lexington were relatively low because the battle was largely fought from protective positions. Price claimed a loss of only 25 men killed and 72 wounded in his official report. However, a study of his subordinates' after- action reports reveals a total of at least 30 killed and 120 wounded. This would not include any civilians or recruits who had not yet enrolled but who had joined the fighting. The Federals lost 39 killed and 120 wounded. The relatively light casualties may be attributed to Mulligan's excellent entrenchments and Harris's hemp-bale inspiration; nevertheless, the entire Union garrison was taken prisoner. Among the casualties at the First Battle of Lexington was Lt. Col. Benjamin W. Grover, commanding the 27th Missouri Mounted Infantry, who was wounded by a musket ball in the thigh.

The Federals were then paroled by General Price, with the notable exception of Colonel Mulligan, who refused parole. Price was reportedly so impressed by the Federal commander's demeanor and conduct during and after the battle that he offered Mulligan his own horse and buggy, and ordered him safely escorted to Union lines. Mulligan was mortally wounded at the Second Battle of Kernstown near Winchester, Virginia on July 24, 1864, while Price would go on to command Confederate forces at numerous battles throughout the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters. Following the surrender at Lexington, Fremont and Price negotiated an exchange cartel. The Camp Jackson parolees were exchanged for a portion of Mulligan's command. This worked smoothly for the officers who were specifically named, but not for all of the Federal enlisted men. Some enlisted men were ordered back into Federal service without having been properly exchanged, then moved to different theaters. Several were captured at Shiloh, where they were recognized and executed for violating their parole.Wood, p. 123.

Hoping to draw Union Army forces away from more important theaters of combat and potentially affect the outcome of the 1864 United States presidential election, Sterling Price, a Major General in the Confederate States Army, led an offensive into the state of Missouri on September 19, 1864. After a botched attack at the Battle of Pilot Knob, the strength of the Union defenses at Jefferson City led Price to abandon the main goals of his campaign. Additional Union troops were recalled from a campaign against the Cheyenne and the Kansas State Militia was mobilized, but political authorities in Kansas would not allow the militiamen to serve east of the Big Blue River. As a result, Major General James G. Blunt was only able to take 2,000 men east to confront Price. By October 19, Blunt had occupied a position near the city of Lexington, which was soon attacked by lead elements of Price's army. Blunt's men resisted strongly, despite being outnumbered, and forced Price to deploy the rest of his army and his heaviest artillery. After gaining information about Price's strength and position that the Union high command had been previously lacking, Blunt withdrew from the field. Four days later, Price was decisively defeated at the Battle of Westport, and the Confederates were pursued, suffering several more defeats in the process. By December, only 3,500 men of Price's initially 13,000-strong army remained. Context Map of Price's Raid As the American Civil War began in 1861, the state of Missouri was a slave state, but did not secede. However, the state was politically divided: Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and the Missouri State Guard (MSG) supported secession and the Confederate States of America, while Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon and the Union Army supported the United States and opposed secession. Under Major General Sterling Price, the MSG defeated Union armies at the battles of Wilson's Creek and Lexington in 1861, but by the end of the year, the Price and the MSG were restricted to the southwestern portion of the state. Meanwhile, Jackson and a portion of the state legislature voted to secede and join the Confederate States of America, while another element of the legislature voted to reject secession, essentially giving the state two governments. In March 1862, a Confederate defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas gave the Union control of Missouri, and Confederate activity in the state was largely restricted to guerrilla warfare and raids throughout 1862 and 1863. By the beginning of September 1864, events in the eastern United States, especially the Confederate defeat in the Atlanta campaign, gave Abraham Lincoln, who supported continuing the war, an edge in the 1864 United States presidential election over George B. McClellan, who favored ending the war. At this point, the Confederacy had very little chance of winning the war. Meanwhile, in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Confederates had defeated Union attackers in the Red River campaign in Louisiana in March through May. As events east of the Mississippi River turned against the Confederates, General Edmund Kirby Smith, Confederate commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to transfer the infantry under his command to the fighting in the Eastern and Western Theaters. However, this proved to be impossible, as the Union Navy controlled the Mississippi River, preventing a large scale crossing. Despite having limited resources for an offensive, Smith decided that an attack designed to divert Union troops from the principal theaters of combat would have an equivalent effect as the proposed transfer of troops, through decreasing the Confederates' numerical disparity east of the Mississippi. Price and the Confederate Governor of Missouri Thomas Caute Reynolds suggested that an invasion of Missouri would be an effective offensive; Smith approved the plan and appointed Price to command the offensive. Price expected that the offensive would create a popular uprising against Union control of Missouri, divert Union troops away from principal theaters of combat (many of the Union troops previously defending Missouri had been transferred out of the state, leaving the Missouri State Militia to be the state's primary defensive force), and aid McClellan's chance of defeating Lincoln in the election. On September 19, Price's column entered the state. Prelude When it entered the state, Price's force, the Army of Missouri, was composed of about 13,000 cavalrymen. However, several thousand of these men were poorly armed; all 14 of the army's cannons were underpowered. Countering Price was the Union Department of Missouri, under the command of Major General William S. Rosecrans, who had fewer than 10,000 men on hand, many of whom were militiamen. In late September, the Confederates encountered a small Union force holding Fort Davidson near the town of Pilot Knob; attacks against the post on September 27 failed; although the Union garrison abandoned the fort that night. Price had suffered hundreds of casualties in the battle, and decided to divert the aim of his advance from St. Louis to Jefferson City. Price's army was accompanied by a sizable wagon train, which significantly slowed its movement. The delays caused by this slow progress enabled Union forces to reinforce Jefferson City, whose garrison was increased from 1,000 men to 7,000 between October 1 and October 6. In turn, Price determined that Jefferson City was too strong to attack, and began moving westwards along the course of the Missouri River. The Confederates gathered recruits and supplies during the movement; a side raid against the town of Glasgow on October 15 was successful, as was another raid against Sedalia. Meanwhile, Union troops commanded by Major Generals Samuel R. Curtis and James G. Blunt were withdrawn from their role in fights against the Cheyenne; the Kansas State Militia was also mobilized. On October 15, Blunt moved a three-brigade unit under his command to Hickman Mills, Missouri; the third brigade was composed of militia. At this time, Price was at Marshall, east of Blunt's column. The next day, Curtis moved the Kansas militiamen to Kansas City, but was prohibited by the governor of Kansas from taking them east of the Big Blue River. On the 17th, Blunt detached his militia unit to Kansas City, and then sent his other two brigades to Holden. On October 18, Blunt's advance guard, commanded by Colonel Thomas Moonlight occupied the town of Lexington, hoping to cooperate with a force commanded by Brigadier General John B. Sanborn and catch and trap Price. However, Sanborn's force was too far south of Lexington to move in concert with Blunt. Additionally, he learned that Price was only away at Waverly; he also received word from Curtis that the political authorities in Kansas would not allow him to send militiamen to Curtis. Blunt then made the decision to reinforce his outer positions and resist the inevitable Confederate advance. Battle Map of Lexington II Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Price's army was split into three columns; Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby commanded the advance guard; the overall force still numbered about 13,000 men. Blunt's force consisted of about 2,000 men and two batteries of four 12-pounder mountain howitzers. Contact between the two forces occurred south of the town. Shelby's cavalrymen made contact with Blunt's forward scouts around 14:00, and drove them back towards the main Union position. Blunt's main force made a stand against Shelby; leading Price to commit the forces of Major General James F. Fagan and Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke to the fray. For a time, Blunt's howitzers held the line. Price was also forced to deploy his heaviest artillery, and Blunt withdrew his men from near Lexington. In his after-action report, Blunt provided the significant amount his force was outnumbered by, as well as the fact that his mountian howitzers were unable to effectively respond to Price's artillery. The 11th Kansas Cavalry Regiment served as a rear guard for Blunt until nightfall. Four of the mountain howitzers supported the Kansans during the rear guard action. While the action was a Confederate victory, Blunt had gained concreate evidence about Price's strengths and exact movements, which the Union high command had been lacking since the time that Price was still in Arkansas. Aftermath Casualties suffered by either side in the fighting are unknown. The Confederates spent the night near Fire Prairie Creek, while Blunt retreated to the Little Blue River. Price continued moving westward, fighting several smaller actions along the way, before being decisively defeated by Curtis at the Battle of Westport on October 23, near Kansas City. The Army of Missouri fell back through Kansas, suffering two defeats at the battles of Marais des Cygnes and Mine Creek on October 25; the latter defeat was particularly devastating, as Marmaduke and many other soldiers were captured. Returning to Missouri, Price was further defeated at the Battle of Marmiton River on October 25 and again at the Second Battle of Newtonia on October 28. Curtis pursued the Confederates all the way to the Arkansas River; the Confederates did not stop retreating until they reached Texas. By December, only 3,500 men remained of the Army of Missouri. A 2011 study by the American Battlefield Protection Program found that while the site of the battle is threatened by the development of Missouri Route 13, and is otherwise fragmented by development, opportunities for preservation remain at the site. The same report noted that while none of the battlefield is on the National Register of Historic Places, of the site are likely eligible for listing. Battle of Lexington State Historic Site is concerned with the preservation of the 1861 First Battle of Lexington.

Union forces unsuccessfully attempted to prevent pro- Confederate Missouri State Guards from northern Missouri from crossing the Missouri River near the confluence with the Blue River to reinforce Sterling Price at Lexington.  Background  After his victory at Wilson's Creek in August, Price began a campaign to gain control of Missouri. Union troops had been guarding the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad and its terminus in St. Joseph, Missouri. When these Union forces were pulled away to meet Price's army, Confederate sympathizers from northwestern Missouri seized St. Joseph and sacked the town. On 15 September, about 3,500 men of the Missouri State Guard plus a number of irregulars from St. Joseph set out for Lexington. In the evening, Price sent Brigadier-General David R. Atchison from Lexington to help these men, mostly new recruits, cross the river near Liberty. Union troops of the 16th Illinois Infantry and the 39th Ohio Infantry were guarding the Platte River railroad bridge in Buchanan County, which had earlier been sabotaged in the Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy. These troops started moving to Liberty. At the same time, Union Lieutenant-Colonel John Scott led a small force (500 men of the 3rd Iowa Infantry, about 70 Missouri Home Guards, and one 6-pound smoothbore cannon) from guarding the railroad at Cameron towards Liberty. Heavy rain and bad roads limited his progress to only seven miles that day. On 16 September, Scott camped in Centreville (ten miles north of Liberty), where he heard artillery fire in the distance.  Battle  Lieutenant-Colonel Scott broke camp at 2:00 A.M. on 17 September. He arrived in Liberty at 7:00 A.M., and sent scouts out to find the enemy. Skirmishing began about 11:00 A.M. At noon, Scott marched five miles in the direction of the firing, and approached Blue Mills Landing on the Missouri River. General Atchison, who had lived in Liberty, deployed his men in the brush on either side of the Missouri River bottom land road leading to the landing. At about 3:00 P.M., Scott's troops encountered the State Guard pickets and were attacked from both sides. Scott's artillerymen fired two rounds of canister, inflicting heavy damage. However, a fresh volley from the State Guards scattered or killed most of the gunners. Scott ordered his outnumbered force to fall back to the bluffs in Liberty, hauling off the gun by hand. Atchison attempted a flanking movement on the Federal right, which resulted in a sharp fight. The Union force continued to withdraw, firing as they retreated, taking with them nearly all their wounded, but abandoning their ammunition wagon and a caisson. The State Guard pursued for some distance, but Atchison did not press the attack. Just before nightfall, Scott's force retired to Liberty, entering the town about an hour after sunset. Atchison and the State Guards from northern Missouri crossed the river to reinforce Price in his successful attack on Lexington. After sunset the Union troops returned to retrieve their dead from the field. Union troops set up a hospital on the campus of William Jewell College in Liberty and buried their dead on the campus. Casualties The fighting at Blue Mills Landing lasted for an hour and resulted in a total of 126 casualties. The Union forces suffered 56 casualties and the Missouri State Guard lost 70. Among the latter was the Missouri State Guard's Theodore Duncan, who died on the same day that he had been promoted from captain to colonel. Ten of the sixteen Union field officers fell dead or wounded. ReferencesSources * U. S.

It became the opening round of the Second Battle of Independence, which began on this same day and was essentially a continuation of this engagement. This led in turn to the Battle of Westport on October 23, resulting in Price's defeat and the ending of major Confederate military operations in Missouri. Background In the fall of 1864, Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price was dispatched by his superior, Lt. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, to attempt to seize Missouri for the Confederacy. Unable to attack his primary objective, St. Louis, Price decided to execute Smith's backup plan for a westward raid through Missouri and into Kansas and the Indian Territory. Their ultimate goal was to destroy or capture Union supplies and outposts, which might negatively affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in 1864. After his victory at the Battle of Glasgow, Missouri, Price continued his march westward, in the direction of Kansas City and Fort Leavenworth, headquarters of the Federal Department of Kansas. But his progress was slow, giving the Union Army a chance to concentrate their forces. Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, commanding the Department of the Missouri, proposed a pincer movement to trap Price and his army, but he was unable to communicate with Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Department of Kansas, to formalize the plan. Curtis was experiencing difficulty because many of his soldiers were Kansas militia (under George Dietzler), and they refused to enter Missouri. However, a force of about 2,000 men under the command of Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt did set out for Lexington. He met the Confederate troops there on October 19 and slowed their progress, but was ultimately forced to withdraw. On the 20th, Blunt‚Äôs retreating column arrived on the Little Blue River, a minor stream five miles east of Independence. Battle Map of Little Blue River Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Union force turned at the Little Blue to engage the Confederates again, using strong defensive positions on the west bank. Curtis, however, ordered Blunt back to Independence, leaving only a token force, under Col. Thomas Moonlight, on the river itself. The following day, however, Curtis ordered Blunt to take all of his volunteers and return to the Little Blue. As Blunt neared the stream, he discovered that Moonlight‚Äôs small force had engaged Price's advance guard just after sunup, burning the bridge as previously ordered. Price's main force had arrived by this time and was fiercely engaging Moonlight's brigade, which was stubbornly guarding every available ford in the area. Blunt quickly entered the fray, attempting to drive Price back beyond the defensive positions that he wished to reoccupy. A five-hour battle ensued, as Union troops forced the Confederates to fall back at first, entrenching themselves behind several rock walls as they awaited an inevitable Southern counterattack. Although witnesses reported that the hopelessly-outnumbered Federals compelled their enemy to fight for every inch of ground, Confederate numerical superiority slowly took its toll. Gradually, the Northerners were forced to retreat, and the focus of the battle shifted to Independence itself.Little Blue River (Westport). Retrieved on 2009-11-26. Aftermath Although Union rearguard units attempted throughout the afternoon of the 21st to retard Price's advance through the streets and byways of Independence (the Second Battle of Independence), they ultimately proved unsuccessful and were forced to retreat to the Big Blue River west of town. The following day, Union forces attacked the Confederates in Independence and initially routed them, only to be compelled to retreat later in the day by units under Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke. Although Price could claim victories at the Little Blue and Independence, both ultimately proved hollow. Once again, his army had been slowed, and more Union reinforcements were arriving. On the 23rd of October, the full Union and Confederate forces collided at the Battle of Westport, often called \\"the Gettysburg of Missouri,\\" resulting in a final, decisive defeat for Price and the end of his campaign‚Äîand all major Confederate operations‚Äîin the state.

The battle was part of the Confederate guerrilla and recruiting campaign in Missouri in 1862.  Background  During the summer of 1862 many Confederate and Missouri State Guard recruiters were dispatched north from Arkansas into Missouri to replenish the depleted ranks of the Trans-Mississippi Confederacy. In Western/West-Central Missouri these included then Captain Jo Shelby, Colonel Vard Cockrell, Colonel John T. Coffee, Upton Hays, John Charles Tracy, John T. Hughes, and DeWitt C. Hunter. Most of these commands were working independently and there was no clear sense of seniority yet established. On August 11 the Federal commander General John Schofield was stunned to learn that Independence, Missouri had fallen to a combined force of Colonel John T. Hughes, William Quantrill, Gideon W. Thompson and Upton Hays. Schofield ordered General James Totten to concentrate his forces to deal with the threat.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 59‚Äì60  Skirmish  On August 15, 1862 Union Major Emory S. Foster, under orders from Totten, led a 740-man combined force from Lexington to Lone Jack. Other forces were dispatched from Kansas under General James G. Blunt (2,500 men) and Missouri under General Fitz Henry Warren (600 men), but they would not arrive in time for the engagement. Upon reaching the Lone Jack area, Foster received intelligence that 1,600 rebels under Col. Coffee and Lt. Col. Tracy were camped near town and prepared to attack them. The estimate of the rebel command was revised down to only 800 and at about 11:00 p.m., Foster and his men attacked the Confederate camp and dispersed the enemy. The firing of his cannon during this brief skirmish proved to be Foster's undoing, for it alerted Colonel Vard Cockrell and other rebel commands in the area of Foster's position and intent to fight. Foster's men returned to town to rest along the main street, having spent several days in the saddle. Colonel Cockrell conferred with Upton Hays, Lt. Col. Sidney D. Jackman, and DeWitt C. Hunter and determined to give battle the next morning with the intent of overwhelming the much smaller Union force.  Battle  Cockrell's plan was to clandestinely deploy Hunter, Jackman and Tracy's forces in a field to the west of town well before sunrise on August 16 and await the opening of the fight. Hays was to initiate the battle with a mounted attack from the north as daylight approached, whereupon the others would launch a surprise flank attack.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, page 60 Hays did not attack as early as planned, instead reconnoitering the other commands before advancing. As daylight appeared Foster's pickets became aware of Hays' advance. This gave Foster's men a brief opportunity to deploy, spoiling the element of surprise.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 61‚Äì62 With sunrise exposing them while awaiting Hays' tardy advance, Jackman, Hunter, and Tracy attacked but were held in check. Hays then performed a dismounted attack from the north. Together his force and Tracy's crumpled the Union right flank, forcing the 7th Missouri Cavalry (commanded by Captain Milton H. Brawner) back onto the artillery. The cannoneers now began a desperate fight. Union Captain Long's 2nd Battalion Missouri State Militia Cavalry concealed behind a hedge row of Osage orange trees poured a crossfire on the Confederates, temporarily repulsing them.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 61‚Äì63 On the other side of the field Hunter's force was stalled by three companies of Captain Plumb's 6th Missouri State Militia Cavalry. A mounted force (possibly Coffee's) approached on Hunter's flank and he mistook them for Federals. The mounted men attacked but were surprised and repulsed by fire from Capt. Slocum's company of the 7th Missouri State Militia Cavalry behind another Osage orange hedge. Hunter, now short of ammunition, abandoned the field for the ammunition train, exposing Jackman's flank. Jackman was also short of ammunition and retired as well.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 64‚Äì65 Tracy's and Hays' commands renewed their attack to the north, eventually displacing the Indiana artillerists. With no remaining Confederate threat to the south, Captain Plumb now counterattacked to the north, reclaiming the artillery. Jackman and Hunter's resupplied men then returned to the field. Hays attempted to counterattack but a counter-charge by Plumb forced him to retreat. Much of the fighting then devolved into a war of attrition between Confederates on the western side of the street, Union men on the right with their artillery in the middle. The artillerists were soon routed and the guns changed hands several times. Foster recaptured the guns a final time, being severely wounded himself in the process.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, pages 64‚Äì70 After five hours of fighting and the loss ‚Äì by wounding ‚Äì of Foster, rebel Col. Coffee and his 800 men reappeared north of town causing Foster's successor, Capt. Milton H. Brawner, to order a retreat. The men left the field in good order and returned to Lexington. The cannon were hastily spiked or disabled and hidden before the Federals departed. The Confederates secured a victory, but the approach of Union forces including Blunt and Fitz Henry Warren forced the Rebels to withdraw on August 17. General Fitz Warren occupied the town that day.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, page 71 Foster was later criticized for attacking on the first day while being outnumbered and for not awaiting reinforcement. However, Fitz Warren's command did not arrive until two days later, and Blunt's three days after Foster arrived. The Federals fought more vigorously because many believed Quantrill's raiders were present and would be brutal to prisoners.  Casualties & aftermath  Federal Capt. Brawner reported Union losses as 43 killed, 154 wounded, and 75 missing/captured, a casualty rate of 34 percent and this was almost certainly too low. Rebel Colonel Hunter reported burying 119 Federals and 47 Rebels, but the true losses are unknown. Excluded from Hunter's total were an unknown number of dead Confederates claimed by their friends and families for burial elsewhere. A recent roll call list of Federals killed at the action as compiled in service records by Wayne Schnetzer reveals 65 killed and at least 29 who later died from wounds received at Lone Jack.Eakin, Joanne Chiles, Battle of Lone Jack, August 16, 1862, Two Trails Publishing, 2001, pages 228-236 The list of known Confederate participation and deaths is less complete, but at least 55 names are listed as killed, with at least 4 others later succumbing to their wounds.Eakin, Joanne Chiles, Battle of Lone Jack, August 16, 1862, Two Trails Publishing, 2001, Wayne Schnetzer's compilation, pages 147-152 Colonel Cockrell succeeded in locating the two cannon and removed them from the field and back to Arkansas. One was later credited with firing the shot that disabled the Queen City on the White River.Eakin, Joanne Chiles, Battle of Lone Jack, August 16, 1862, Two Trails Publishing, 2001, Wayne Schnetzer's compilation, page 27 Because they were in possession of the field, the Confederate recruits gained a substantial quantity of needed firearms. As many as half of the recruits were initially unarmed. This was the only Civil War battle fought by future Secretary of War and U.S. Senator Stephen B. Elkins. Elkins was to say that he disgusted of war after what he witnessed in the battle: :I saw one battle while in the service, that of Lone Jack, and a most awful battle it was. Col. Emory S. Foster had a Union regiment which was attacked by the brother of Senator Cockrell, but Foster thought the Confederates were the guerrilla hands who raised the black flag, and never gave any quarter. So he refused to surrender, and every one of his officers was picked off. The guerrillas were victorious. I went over the battlefield afterward, the blood, the cries for water and death, the naked bodies stripped of their clothing, the dead horses which served for ramparts, gave me a disgust for war, which makes it seem strange that I am here at the head of the war department of this great government.  Cole Younger  Confederate guerrilla and later outlaw leader Thomas Coleman Younger was notable for his actions at Lone Jack. Though most of Quantrill's Raiders were still in Independence, Missouri looting after victory in the First Battle of Independence, 18-year-old Cole Younger was present at Lone Jack riding along the front lines to supply the troops. When the wounded Foster was briefly held by the Confederates in a cabin and was threatened with execution, Younger physically pushed Foster's would-be executioner out of the cabin. When Younger was captured in the James-Younger Gang robbery of the Northfield, Minnesota First National Bank, Foster (who was then editor of the St. Louis Evening Journal) argued for clemency for Younger.Matthews, Matt and Lindberg, Kip, \\"Shot All to Pieces, the Battle of Lone Jack, Missouri, August 16, 1862\\", North and South, Vol. 7, No. 1, January, 2004, page 66  Popular culture  In the 1969 movie True Grit, character Rooster Cogburn (played by John Wayne) tells Mattie Ross that he lost an eye at the Battle of Lone Jack, calling it \\"a scrap outside of Kansas City.\\"True Grit script  Order of battle  Union: Major Emory S.

Major General Sterling Price of the Confederate States Army commenced an expedition into Missouri in September 1864, with hopes of challenging Union control of the state. After a defeat at the Battle of Westport on October 23, Price began to retreat south, and suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Mine Creek early on October 25. The afternoon of the 25th, Price's wagon train became stalled at the crossing of the Marmaton River in western Missouri. A delaying force led by Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby attempted to hold off Union cavalry commanded by Brigadier General John McNeil and Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen. Shelby was unable to drive off the Union force, although fatigue of the Union cavalry's horses prevented close-quarters action. At nightfall, the Confederates disengaged and destroyed much of their wagon train. Price was again defeated on October 28 at the Second Battle of Newtonia, and the Confederate retreat continued until the survivors reached Texas in early December. Background In early September 1864, during the American Civil War, Major General Sterling Price of the Confederate States Army began an invasion of Missouri with hopes of capturing St. Louis and regaining control of Missouri for the Confederacy. After being repulsed at the Battle of Pilot Knob in late September, Price's army changed course to aim for the Missouri River. The Union Army of the Border began pursuing Price's column, and defeated the Confederates at the Battle of Westport near Kansas City on October 23. Price's defeated army retreated southward, and suffered defeats at the battles of Marais des Cygnes and Mine Creek early on October 25. The loss at Mine Creek was particularly devastating, as a pile-up at the ford of Mine Creek led to the capture of many of Price's cannons and soldiers, including Brigadier Generals John S. Marmaduke and William L. Cabell. Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby's division arrived in time to provide Price's column with a rear guard after Mine Creek. Shelby's men fought a delaying action against the pursuing Union soldiers at the crossing of the Little Osage River. Union cavalry would eventually brush aside the Confederates at the Little Osage River, but the defense had bought time for Price's retreat. Battle Map of Marmiton River Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program After crossing into western Missouri on the afternoon of the 25th, Price's wagon train became stalled at the crossing of the Marmaton River, much as it had at the Mine Creek crossing. Price formed a line to protect his wagon train from the Union soldiers. The front of the line consisted of militia officer M. Jeff Thompson's brigade of Shelby's division, some of the remains of Major General James F. Fagan and Marmaduke's (commanded by Brigadier General John B. Clark Jr. after Marmaduke's capture) divisions, which had been shattered at Mine Creek, and a portion of Colonel Charles H. Tyler's brigade. Some of the men in Tyler's brigade were unarmed. The rest of Fagan and Clark's divisions and Tyler's brigade were aligned in a second line. Colonel Sidney D. Jackman's brigade was held in reserve. While Price's men were estimated to number around 8,000, many of these men were either too demoralized or fatigued to fight, or were unarmed. Estimates of how many Confederates were in true fighting condition range from 1,000 to 4,000. Union cavalry commanded by Brigadier General John McNeil and Lieutenant Colonel Frederick W. Benteen caught up to Price's makeshift line. After the arrival of the Union forces, Shelby ordered the portion of Tyler's brigade on the front line to charge, but this attack was quickly repulsed by McNeil's men. The Union forces then brought up artillery in the form of two sections of cannons. Shelby used several feints to try to hold off the Union forces, but these assaults were also driven off. A Union attempt to charge the Confederate line was delayed when it was discovered that the cavalry charge would block the line of fire of the Union artillery, requiring the Union artillery to change positions. Once the Union attack was restarted, the Union troopers discovered that their horses were too tired to move at a gallop. The Confederates still had three serviceable cannons remaining, but did not engage them in the fight, possibly due to a fear of the cannons being captured (most of the Confederate cannons had been captured at Mine Creek). While the Union cavalrymen were unable to reach the Confederate line because of the fatigue of their horses, some of the demoralized Confederates, especially in Thompson's brigade, began to retreat. Near dusk, Jackman's brigade was released from reserve, and charged the Union line. Jackman's charge was able to force the 4th Iowa Cavalry to withdraw. At nightfall, the Confederates withdrew, and the fighting ended. Aftermath Exact Union losses are not known, but are reported to have been light. The Confederates lost about 75 men, with about a third of that total having been killed. That night, Price decided to destroy any wagons that were not essential. At this point, the Confederate army was so shattered that historian Albert E. Castel described the force as essentially an armed mob. By the end of October 26, Price's force had fallen back to Carthage, Missouri, where rations were handed out. Some of the Confederate soldiers had not received rations for six days. On October 28, Price was again defeated, this time at the Second Battle of Newtonia. The Confederates withdrew into Arkansas, and were pursued to the Arkansas River. Price continued to retreat, and what was left of his army reached Texas in early December. Preservation The landscape at the battlefield is considered to be in good condition, although the landscape faces some threats from changes in land use. The Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) noted that the current land use at the site is similar to what it was in 1864. None of the site is currently protected, although the CWSAC determined that of the site could potentially be added to the National Register of Historic Places. The site is part of the Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area. Public interpretation features, but no visitor's center, exist at the site.

On December 28 at about 2 a.m., Prentiss set out with his entire force to meet Dorsey's force. While the State Guardsmen numbered around 900, most appear to have been local volunteers, many of whom were not armed with military weapons (although many had personal civilian firearms of various types). A detachment of Prentiss's force routed one company of Guardsmen on the road from Hallsville around 100 yards east of Mount Zion Church and learned that the rest of the force was in the churchyard, situated on a high hill. The main campground was actually in a thicketted hollow immediately east of the church. Prentiss advanced on the State Guard positions, making three charges. At the third, the Confederates exhausted their ammunition, fell back to their wagons, and were overrun. The battle ended around 11 a.m.Battle of Mount Zion Church, Missouri . Bobby D. Bedsworth. Mid-Missouri Civil War Round Table (2000). Retrieved 2008-12-11 Aftermath The Confederate memorial near the church building The Missouri State Guard was effectively routed from northern Boone county to Columbia. Dorsey's forces lost 25 dead, 150 wounded, and an additional 60 captured, including an officer. Additionally, the Guardsmen lost wagons, 90 horses, and 105 arms. The remainder dispersed, with Dorsey heading westward into Perche township, the northwest section of Boone County towards the Missouri River. After negotiation and exchange of prisoners, Dorsey made camp near Everett, Missouri. Within days Dorsey received orders from State Guard commander, Maj. Gen. Sterling Price to scatter his forces. Mount Zion and the associated battle of Roan's Tan Yard effectively ended attempts at formal State Guard organization in Central Missouri. Remaining elements of Dorsey's command crossed the Missouri and joined General Pierce in February 1862. While guerrilla warfare reappeared to the south and west of Columbia, Confederates did not thereafter face Union forces in conventional battle in the area until Price's Raid in the autumn of 1864. Battlefield today Today, the church and associated cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The cemetery grounds contain the remains of soldiers who perished and a memorial marker for the Missouri State Guard.

The conflict was part of the pursuit of US Brigadier General John McNeil through Southeast Missouri by Confederate Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke. Though the conflict to this day is known as a battle, it was a relatively small engagement whose primary importance was as the turning point that brought General Marmaduke's second Missouri raid to an end. Background General Marmaduke began his second raid into Missouri from Northeast Arkansas on April 18, 1863.Ponder 1994, p.30. During the raid, he intended to obtain much-needed supplies for his troops, several hundred of whom were unarmed and un- mounted.Bartels 1992, p.132; Maple 1913; Oates 1963; Ponder 1994, p.47; Snider 1956, p.50. The General feared that if left behind his unarmed troops might desert, but if taken along they may be supplied with arms and horses as captured during the raid.Bartels 1992, p.132; Snider 1956, p.50. Marmaduke organized his division of about 5,000 men into two columns, each made up of two brigades. Colonel George W. Carter led one of the columns, which consisted of a brigade led by Colonel Colton Greene and the other by Carter himself. The second column was led by Colonel Joseph O. Shelby and consisted of Shelby's famous \\"Iron Brigade,\\" commanded by Colonel George W. Thompson, and another brigade commanded by Colonel John Q. Burbridge.Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.24-26. In all, the division had between eight and ten pieces of artillery.Bartels 1992, p.132; Oates 1963; Snider 1956, p.50. General Marmaduke ordered Colonel Carter's column to advance toward Bloomfield, Missouri and attempt to capture the Federal garrison there under the command of US Brigadier General John McNeil.\\"Anniversary\\" 1939; \\"April 26th\\" 1930; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.47. If McNeil had been able to escape, the Confederates thought that he would head north to Pilot Knob, the Union headquarters of the region. Thus Marmaduke accompanied Colonel Shelby's column north to Fredericktown to intercept such an attempt.\\"Anniversary\\" 1939; Ponder 1994, p.47. Shelby's column arrived at Fredericktown on April 22, 1863, but Carter's column did not reach Bloomfield until April 23 because of difficulty crossing the Mingo swamps. Carter arrived at Bloomfield to find that McNeil had left it in ruins two days earlier.Oates 1963; Ponder 1994, p.50. Having learned of Marmaduke's position on the road to Pilot Knob, McNeil disobeyed his orders to retreat to Pilot Knob and instead fled northeast to heavily fortified Cape Girardeau, arriving on the evening of April 24.Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.48; Webb 1900, p.182. Carter had been instructed not to pursue McNeil if he fled in any direction other than the road to Fredericktown and Pilot Knob.Ponder 1994, p.48. However, Carter also disobeyed orders and indeed pursued McNeil to within four miles of Cape Girardeau, arriving mid-day on April 25.Dittlinger 1976; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.55; Snider 1956, p.50. Carter then sent a letter to McNeil demanding the garrison's surrender and a reply within 30 minutes. The letter was signed by Confederate Major General Sterling Price with the hope that his name would instill fear in McNeil that General Price was nearby.Bartels 1992, p.133; Guilbert 1863; Ponder 1994, p.56-58. However, McNeil was confident in the strength of his defense and refused to surrender.Murdoch, p.158. Fearing an attack, Carter sent word of the situation to General Marmaduke, who then proceeded with Colonel Shelby's column to reinforce Carter's troops in any possible actions at Cape Girardeau.Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.56. =Fortifications= In 1861 General Ulysses S. Grant approved the construction of four forts at strategic locations around the city of Cape Girardeau. They were named Forts A, B, C, and D.Dittlinger 1976. Fort A was positioned on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at the north edge of town and was meant to defend the city against Confederate gunboats on the river. Fort B was located on a hill now occupied by Southeast Missouri State University and was built to protect the city from enemy approaches on the Perryville Road and Jackson Road (now Broadway Avenue).\\"Historical Points\\" 1951; Ponder 1994, p.59. Fort C was near the present intersection of South Ellis Street and Good Hope Street and guarded approaches on the Bloomfield Road, Gordonville Road (now Independence Street), and Commerce Road (now Sprigg Street). Fort D was located on a river bluff south of the city, and like Fort A, it was primarily a river defense. It was the largest and most important garrison in the region and is the only fort remaining in Cape Girardeau today.Hill 1975; Phillips 1956. However, Fort D did not play an important role in the Battle of Cape Girardeau.Ponder 1994, p.60. Action Map of Cape Girardeau Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program On the night of April 25, in anticipation of the attack, General McNeil ordered the evacuation of women and children via steamboat to a safe location upriver.Dittlinger 1976; McNeil \\"Women to Leave\\" 1863; Ponder 1994, p.60. Also during the night two gunboats and a steamer arrived with additional troops to support McNeil's forces.Phillips 1956. With the gunboats in place McNeil did not foresee any threat from the Mississippi River side of the city, so he had cannons moved from Forts A and D along the river to Forts B and C on the western side of the city. In all, McNeil's forces totaled about 4,000 men, including supporting regiments from Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Illinois,Dickerson 1961; Maple 1913; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.62. though some of these regiments may have arrived after the action had ended. Shelby's column arrived at Cape Girardeau early on April 26.Guilbert 1863; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.56; Snider 1956, p.50; Webb 1900, p.182. With General Marmaduke's full division then on the western edge of the city, it assumed a formation that consisted of Colonel Burbridge's brigade in the center, Shelby's on the left, and Carter's on the right. The line extended from just east of St. Mary's Cemetery on the north (near the present intersection of Missouri Ave and Mississippi St) to Gordonville Road on the south. Its center was on the Jackson Road. The attack began around 10:00 am on April 26.Dickerson 1961; Guilbert 1863; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.61; Snider 1956, p.50. Unsuccessful charges were made by cavalry units from both sides, the Federal troops being driven back by Colonel Shelby's superior cavalry forces and the Confederates being met with heavy fire from field artillery and the guns of Forts B and C.\\"April 26th\\" 1930; Hinchey 1932; Phillips 1956. The artillery fire between the forts and Shelby's Brigade made up the bulk of the action.\\"April 26th\\" 1930; Phillips 1956. The fighting lasted approximately four to five hours, ceasing sometime after 2:00 pm when General Marmaduke ordered his forces to withdraw.\\"Civil War\\" 1952; Dickerson 1961; Guilbert 1863; \\"Old Letters\\" 1950; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.64; Snider 1956, p.50. Aftermath No reliable reports were made of the numbers killed and wounded during the action, as \\"official\\" figures tended to be exaggerated and unfounded.Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.64. The number of confirmed dead was no more than ten on either side, though some reports claim that the total number killed was close to a hundred, plus over three hundred wounded.\\"Old Letters\\" 1950; Phillips 1956; Ponder 1994, p.64. Following the conflict, General Marmaduke retreated to Jackson and then led his troops back to Arkansas, bringing to an end his second Missouri raid. Marmaduke was followed by Federal forces, but no contact was made before crossing the Arkansas border.\\"Anniversary\\" 1939; Snider 1956, p.52; Webb 1900, p.183. Possibly as punishment for disobeying orders and instigating the needless conflict at Cape Girardeau, Colonel Carter was demoted to commanding a brigade rather than his entire column.Ponder 1994, p.69. Though neither side had a clear victory at the closing of the day's fighting, the battle was a strategic Union victory that forced the Confederate forces to retreat to Arkansas. Historian Henry Phillips concluded, \\"while it was not of sufficient magnitude to be termed a battle in technical military parlance, all of the potentials were present for a sanguinary battle, and the reason a battle did not occur was because the commanders of the two hostile forces each had reasons that he deemed sufficient for not forcing the issue.\\" NotesReferences *\\"Anniversary Observed of Battle of Cape Girardeau in Civil War.\\" Source unknown.

It formed a part of the larger Battle of Westport, which ultimately resulted in a Union victory and the end of all major Confederate operations in Missouri. Background Confederate Major-General Sterling Price's Army of Missouri was headed westward towards Kansas City and Fort Leavenworth, hoping to capture Missouri for the South and negatively influence Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in 1864. Union Major-General Samuel R. Curtis's Army of the Border, in and around Westport, was blocking the Confederates' way west, while Major- General Alfred Pleasonton's provisional cavalry division was pressing Price's rear. Price had nearly 500 wagons with him, and required a good ford over the Blue River to facilitate passage of his supplies. Byram's Ford was the best crossing in the area, and would clearly be a point of great strategic significance during the impending Battle of Westport. First engagement, October 22 Map of Byram's Ford Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Byram's Ford On October 22, Major- General James G. Blunt's division held a defensive position on the west bank of the Big Blue River. Around 10 a.m., part of Brigadier-General Joseph O. Shelby's Confederate division conducted a frontal attack on Blunt's men. This attack was a ruse, because the rest of Shelby's men flanked Blunt's hasty defenses, forcing the Federals to retire to Westport. Price's wagon train then crossed the Big Blue River at Byram's Ford and headed south to the village of Little Santa Fe and safety. Second engagement, October 23 The Battle of Westport began in earnest on the morning of the October 23. Pleasonton's cavalry was hot on the tail of Price's army, having engaged his rear guard in nearby Independence the previous day. Brigadier-General John S. Marmaduke's Confederate division had stopped Pleasonton just west of Independence, and now held the west bank of the Big Blue at Byram's Ford to protect Price's rear from an expected Union attack. Pleasonton began his assault on Byram's Ford around 8 a.m. Initially the Confederates held their own. One of the Union brigade commanders, Brigadier-General Egbert B. Brown, stalled his attack and was placed under arrest by Pleasonton for disobeying orders. Another of Pleasonton's brigade commanders, Col. Edward F. Winslow, was wounded and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Benteen, who later rode to fame at the Little Bighorn. Despite these setbacks, Federal troopers gained the west bank by 11 a.m. and Marmaduke retired. As Brown's brigade (now led by Cololonel John F. Philips) forded the river, they came under heavy fire from Confederate artillery. Once they had crossed, they charged Marmaduke across an open field; during this charge, Union troops from Missouri and Arkansas battled Confederates from these same two states. As Marmaduke rejoined Shelby and Fagan, Blunt pounded the consolidated Confederate forces with his own cannon, completing Pleasonton's victory at Byram's Ford and contributing significantly to Curtis's larger triumph at Westport. Aftermath With Pleasonton now across the river he was now an additional threat to Price, who was heavily engaged with Curtis's main force at Westport. Defeated by Curtis there and menaced by Pleasonton and an additional Federal brigade under John McNeil, Price had to abandon his Missouri campaign and retreat southward. This brought to a close the last major Confederate military operation west of the Mississippi River, and ended the last major Southern threat to any Northern state.U.S. National Park Service CWSAC Battle Summary Battlefield preservation The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Byram's Ford battlefield.

Although casualties were extremely light, the battle's strategic impact was far greater than one might assume from its limited nature. The Union victory established what would become an unbroken Federal control of the Missouri River, and helped to thwart efforts to bring Missouri into the Confederacy. Four battles were fought at Boonville during the Civil War: the first battle forms the main subject of this article, while the others are described below under other battles at Boonville. Background At the onset of the Civil War, Missouri, like many border states in the Union, was deeply divided over whether to support the United States under Abraham Lincoln, or join the nascent Confederacy under Jefferson Davis. Claiborne F. Jackson, the pro- Confederate governor, wanted his state to secede, but Missouri's overall sentiment was initially neutral. An elected State convention did not pass a secession ordinance, as Jackson had hoped it might. However, pro-secession elements did not let this setback dissuade them. They seized the small Federal armory in Liberty, Missouri, planning to subsequently confiscate a much more sizable stock of weapons located at the St. Louis Arsenal. This plot was temporarily thwarted by an energetic young officer, Captain Nathaniel Lyon. Lyon allied himself with Missouri Congressman Frank Blair and anti-slavery German immigrants in St. Louis to secure the arsenal for the Union. In the process, Lyon used a mixed force of U.S. Army Regulars and Federally enrolled Missouri Volunteers (mostly ethnic Germans) to capture the Missouri Volunteer Militia (MVM) which had assembled (purportedly for an innocuous annual drill) at Camp Jackson on the outskirts of St. Louis on May 10, 1861. When Lyon unwisely attempted to march his prisoners through the streets of St. Louis, a deadly riot erupted. The Missouri General Assembly, convened an emergency session that night, and passed a series of emergency bills creating the secessionist Missouri State Guard and granting Governor Jackson near- dictatorial powers to take any actions necessary to \\"repel invasion\\" (by Federal forces) and \\"suppress insurrection\\" (by Missouri Unionists enlisted in Federal forces).Snead, Thomas Lowndes, The Fight for Missouri, (New York, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888) pp 172-173 The new State Guard began organizing statewide in nine decentralized military districts, initially structured around the independent militia companies of the pre-Camp Jackson MVM. State Guard authorities also worked to manage the large numbers of volunteers who flooded into Jefferson City to protect the state capital from a Federal attack that Jackson's supporters believed was imminent.Snead, Thomas Lowndes, The Fight for Missouri, (New York, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888) p 185 A failed truce Attempts were made to reconcile the two sides. A semi-formal truce was negotiated between General William S. Harney, Commander of the Western Department of the U.S. Army, and Missouri State Guard Major General Sterling Price. They agreed to maintain order in the parts of the state under the control of their various forces, protect the persons and property of all persons, and avoid actions which might excite conflict. Harney unofficially agreed to (generally) restrict Federal forces to metropolitan St. Louis. Price ordered that the mustering of Missouri State Guard volunteers in Jefferson City be halted. Instead, potential guardsmen were directed to muster with regional commanders in nine new Military Districts, the organizational course of action initially envisioned under the post-May 10 Military Bill.Snead, Thomas Lowndes, The Fight for Missouri, (New York, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888) p 188 General Harney understood that Price would hold the state for the Union and, in fact, Price promised him that, should Confederate forces enter Missouri, the MSG would fight alongside the U.S. Army to drive the Confederates out. At the same time, however, representatives from Governor Jackson and Missouri's Lt Governor, Thomas C. Reynolds were meeting with Confederate authorities asking them to send an army into Missouri.Reynolds, Thomas C. General Sterling Price and the Confederacy, (Missouri History Museum Press, St Louis, 2009) They promised Confederate President Jefferson Davis that the Missouri State Guard would cooperate with the Confederate Army to drive Federal forces from Missouri and \\"liberate\\" the state. Missouri Unionists felt that Harney's confidence in Governor Jackson and General Price was dangerously misplaced, and that Harney's unilateral adherence to the \\"truce\\" was endangering the state. In a stream of letters and cables to the Lincoln government, they demanded Harney's removal, and eventually on May 30, General Harney was superseded by (recently promoted) Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. Lyon, Jackson, and Price met one last time, on June 11, at the Planter's House hotel in St. Louis. Jackson demanded that Federal forces remain isolated in St. Louis and that pro-Unionist Home Guard companies of Missouri Unionists around the state be disbanded. Jackson made a wide variety of promises, but all his positions came down to the following: Federal abandonment of the state (outside St. Louis); disarmament of all Missouri Unionists (except those officially enlisted in the four regiments called for under Lincoln's April militia call); and no meaningful verification. (Federal authorities would rely on Jackson's and Price's good will and assurances that they would hold the state for the Union.) In the face of Jackson's inflexible position, Lyon (according to Governor Jackson's secretary) eventually stated that rather than allow Jackson to dictate to the federal Government, he (Lyon) would \\"see you, and you, and you, and you, and every man, woman, and child in the state dead and buried.\\" Lyon concluded by turning to the Governor and stating \\"This means war. In an hour one of my officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines.\\"Snead, Thomas Lowndes, The Fight for Missouri, (New York, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1888) p 200 Governor Jackson and General Price fled toward the capital at Jefferson City, arriving there on June 12. They ordered the bridges on the main rail lines burned. After quickly concluding that Jefferson City could not be held, Jackson and the State Guard departed for Boonville, the next day. General Lyon promptly set out after them by steamboat, with two Federal volunteer regiments, a company of U.S. regulars and a battery of artillery ‚Äî about 1,700 men in all. His goal was to seize the capital and disperse the State Guard. Price hoped to buy enough time to consolidate State Guard units from Lexington and Boonville, though he planned to withdraw from Boonville if Lyon approached. State Guard Colonel John S. Marmaduke's unit began organizing at Boonville, while Brig. Gen. Mosby M. Parsons was instructed to take up a position to the south in Tipton. At this juncture, Price left Boonville due to illness and joined the forces assembling at Lexington. This was unfortunate, as it left the governor--a politician--in charge. Instead of retreating, Jackson decided to make a stand, because he feared political fallout if he made another withdrawal. Many of his men were eager to face the enemy, but they were armed only with shotguns and hunting rifles, and lacked sufficient training to fight effectively at the time. Colonel Marmaduke was opposed to giving battle, but he reluctantly assumed command of the waiting state forces. Lyon, meanwhile, had reached Jefferson City on June 15, learning that Jackson and Price had retreated towards Boonville. Leaving behind 300 troops of the 2nd Missouri Volunteers to secure the capital, Lyon resumed his pursuit of Price on June 16, landing about below Boonville on June 17. Informed of Lyon's approach, Jackson attempted to call up Parsons' command at Tipton, but it was unable to arrive in time. The battle Map of Boonville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The battle itself was actually little more than a skirmish, but it was one of the first significant land actions of the war, and had grave consequences for Confederate hopes in Missouri. After disembarking, Lyon's troops marched along the Rocheport Road toward Boonville at around 7 am. Part of Marmaduke's eager but ill-equipped State Guard force waited on a ridge behind the bluff, totaling about 500 men. They had no artillery support, since it was all with Parsons at Tipton. Inexplicably, Governor Jackson, observing from a mile or so away, held his only reasonably disciplined and organized command - the long established (St. Louis) Washington Blues militia company (usually known as \\"Captain Kelly's Company\\") - in reserve; it would take no part in the battle.The \\"Washington Blues\\" would eventually become Company F (\\"The Fighting Irish\\"), Fifth Missouri Infantry, CSA. Company F would be recognized as one of the premier skirmishing companies in the western Confederate armies. Lyon's command encountered State Guard pickets as they approached the bluffs, but Lyon deployed skirmishers and continued to push his men forward rapidly. The Union artillery (Captain Totten's battery, Company F, 2nd U.S. Lt Artillery) quickly displaced sharpshooters stationed in the William Adams house, while Union infantry closed with the line of guardsmen and fired several volleys into them, causing them to retreat. This portion of the fighting lasted barely 20 minutes. Some attempts were made to rally and resist the Federal advance, but these collapsed when a Union company flanked the Guard's line, supported by cannon fire from a light howitzer on the river steamer Augustus McDowell. As Marmaduke feared, the Guard's retreat rapidly turned into a rout. The guardsmen fled back through Camp Bacon and the town of Boonville; some continued on to their homes, while the rest retreated with the Governor to the southwest corner of Missouri. Lyon took possession of Boonville at 11 am. The short fight at Boonville and the State Guard's precipitate retreat earned the battle the nickname of \\"The Boonville Races.\\" Casualties and impact Cartoon by Cincinnati lithographers Ehrgott & Forbriger published after the Battle of Boonville and mimicking the public notice of strayed animals, 21 June 1861 Federal casualties were light, with five men killed or mortally wounded and seven less seriously injured. There are no reliable figures of casualties for the Missouri State Guard: but it appears five were killed or mortally wounded and ten wounded, while about 60 to 80 were captured. Lyon seized the State Guard's supplies and equipment, which included two iron 6-pounder cannon without ammunition, 500 obsolete flintlock muskets, 1,200 pairs of shoes, a few tents, and food. Federal casualties and sources: Sergeant Jacob Kiburz, Private Marcus M. Coolidge, Charles O. Kelly were recorded as killed or mortally wounded. Private John Miller (likely mortally), Andrew Wood, Charles Clifton, Private Redee, Private Finney, Thomas McCord, Sergeant Armstrong, and two anonymous soldiers were recorded as wounded. Their names appear in the following sources: Daily Democrat, St. Louis, Missouri, June 21, 1861; New York Tribune, June 24, 1861; The New-York Times, June 24, 1861; Daily Democrat, St. Louis, Missouri, June 24, 1861; Louisville Daily Courier, Louisville, Kentucky, June 26, 1861; The Daily Cleveland Herald, Cleveland, Ohio, June 24, 1861; Scioto Gazette, Chillicothe, Ohio, August 13, 1861; Service cards, accessed through the Missouri Secretary of State's website. Missouri State Guard casualties and sources: Jeff McCutchen, Dr. William Mills Quarles, Isaac Hodges, Frank E. Hulen, and Mr. Woods were named as killed or mortally wounded. Lane Bynam, Robert Withers, Clay Bredlove, William Brown, 1st Lt R. H. Carter, Tip Garth, John Henderson, W. T. Marshall, Mr. Miller, and W. B. Napton Jr, are the named wounded. Their names are recorded in the following sources: Boonville Weekly Advertiser, June 13, 1924; Chariton Courier, Keytesville, Missouri, August 8, 1924; Tri-Weekly Republican, St. Louis, Missouri, June 20, 1861; Daily Democrat, St. Louis, Missouri, June 21, 1861 New York Tribune, June 24, 1861 New York Herald, June 23, 1861; Daily Missouri Republican, St. Louis, Missouri, June 21, 1861; Columbia Missouri Statesman, June 21, 1861. The real impact of the Battle of Boonville was strategic, far out of proportion to the minimal loss of life. The Battle of Boonville effectively ejected the secessionist forces from the center of Missouri, and secured the state for the Union. Price realized he could not hold Lexington and retreated, though he would return three months later to re-take the city. Secessionist communications to the strongly pro- Confederate Missouri River valley were effectively cut, and would-be recruits from slave-owning regions north of the Missouri River found it difficult to join the Southern army. Provisions and supplies also could no longer be obtained from this section of the state. A second result of the battle was demoralization. While the Missouri State Guard would fight and win on other days (most notably at Wilson's Creek and Lexington just two and three months later, respectively), it was badly dispirited by this early defeat. Lyon's victory gave the Union forces time to consolidate their hold on the state, while Marmaduke's disappointment led him to resign from the Missouri State Guard and seek a regular commission in the Confederate Army. Marmaduke and Price would team up again during Price's Missouri Raid of 1864, culminating in their defeat at the Battle of Westport on October 23 of that year, which in turn put an end to significant Confederate operations in the state. Other battles at Boonville Following the battle of June 17, Boonville would serve as the scene for three other Civil War engagements, all of extremely minor importance:Where the Civil War Began =Second Battle of Boonville= The Second Battle of Boonville was fought on September 13, 1861, when Colonel William Brown of the Missouri State Guard led 800 men in an attack on 140 pro- Union Boonville Home Guardsmen, under the command of Captain Joseph A. Eppstein, while the Union soldiers were eating breakfast. Due to rain, the Confederates wrapped their flags in black sheathing, which the Home Guard mistook as a sign of no quarter. Highly motivated by a perception that the fight was one of \\"victory or death\\", the Home Guardsmen managed to defeat the State Guard troops, killing Colonel Brown in the process. =Third Battle of Boonville= The Third Battle of Boonville was fought on October 11, 1863, during Shelby's Great Raid, and saw General Joseph Shelby's troops engage Union forces in the city. When Federal reinforcements arrived the next day, the Confederates retreated westward. =Fourth Battle of Boonville= The Fourth Battle of Boonville was fought on October 11, 1864 between Unionists and elements of General Sterling Price's Army of Missouri, who had occupied the town. This skirmish resulted in a Confederate victory, though Price's forces abandoned the city the following day.

It was the first combat test in the American Civil War for Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, the future Union Army general in chief and eventual U.S. president, who was fighting Major General Leonidas Polk. Grant's troops in this battle were the \\"nucleus\\" of what would become the Union Army of the Tennessee.John Aaron Rawlins, 1866 Address, Report of the Proceedings of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee (Cincinnati: F.W. Freeman, 1877), pp. 24, 28. On November 6, Grant moved by riverboat from Cairo, Illinois, to attack the Confederacy's small outpost near Belmont, Missouri across the Mississippi River from the Confederate stronghold at Columbus, Kentucky. He landed his men on the Missouri side and marched to Belmont. Grant's troops overran the surprised Confederate camp and destroyed it. However, the scattered Confederate forces quickly reorganized and were reinforced from Columbus. They counterattacked, supported by heavy artillery fire from across the river. Grant retreated to his riverboats and took his men to Paducah, Kentucky. The battle was relatively unimportant, but with little happening elsewhere at the time, it received considerable attention in the press, with southerners praising it and northerners lamenting the Union defeat. Background Shiloh (April 1862) At the beginning of the war, the critical border state of Kentucky, with a pro-Confederate governor but a largely pro-Union legislature, declared neutrality between the opposing sides. Pro-Confederate Kentuckians crossed into Tennessee to enlist, but the Union men openly formed a recruiting camp inside Kentucky, violating the state's neutrality. In response, Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk moved Confederate forces into Kentucky on September 3, 1861 and occupied Columbus, a key position on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. Three days later Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant seized Paducah. Grant, commanding the District of Southeast Missouri, requested permission from theater commander Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont to attack Columbus, but no orders came. For the next two months only limited demonstrations were conducted against the Confederates.Nevin, p. 46. Fr√©mont learned the Confederates planned to reinforce their forces in Arkansas, and on November 1 he ordered Grant to make a feint toward Columbus to keep the Confederates there. Grant sent about 3,000 men under Col. Richard Oglesby into southeastern Missouri. Grant learned that Confederate reinforcements were moving into Missouri to intercept Oglesby's column. He sent reinforcements and also ordered Brig. Gen. Charles F. Smith to move from Paducah into southwestern Kentucky to distract the Confederates. Grant chose to attack Belmont, a ferry landing and tiny hamlet of three shacks, directly across the river from Columbus. Grant's Expeditionary Command numbered 3,114 officers and men, and was organized into two brigades under Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand and Col. Henry Dougherty, two cavalry companies, and an artillery battery. On November 6, escorted by the gunboats USS Tyler and USS Lexington, Grant's men left Cairo, Illinois on the steamboats Aleck Scott, Chancellor, Keystone State, Belle Memphis, James Montgomery, and Rob Roy.Gott, p. 41; Eicher, pp. 142‚Äì43; Nevin, p. 48; Feis, p. 207. Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk had about 5,000 troops guarding Columbus. When he learned of Grant's movements, he assumed that Columbus was their primary objective and that Belmont was a feint. He ordered 2,700 men under Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow to Belmont, retaining the rest to defend Columbus. When he reached Belmont, Grant found Camp Johnston, a small Confederate observation post, supported by an artillery battery. He decided to attack to keep the Confederates from reinforcing Maj. Gen. Sterling Price or Brig. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson of the Missouri State Guard, and to protect Oglesby's exposed left flank.Eicher, p. 143. Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Battle Map of Belmont Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program At 8:30 a.m. on November 7, Grant's force disembarked at Hunter's Farm, 3 miles north of Belmont, out of range of the six Confederate batteries at Columbus. (The Columbus heavy water batteries featured 10-inch Columbiads and 11-inch howitzers and one gun, the \\"Lady Polk\\", was the largest in the Confederacy, a 128-pounder Whitworth rifle.) He marched his men south on the single road, clearing the obstructions of fallen timber that formed an abatis. A mile away from Belmont, they formed a battle line in a corn field. The line consisted of the 22nd Illinois Infantry, 7th Iowa Infantry, 31st Illinois Infantry, 30th Illinois Infantry, and 27th Illinois Infantry, intermixed with a company of cavalry. The Confederate battle line, on a low ridge northwest of Belmont, from north to south, was made up of the 12th Tennessee Infantry, 13th Arkansas Infantry, 22nd Tennessee Infantry, 21st Tennessee Infantry, and 13th Tennessee Infantry.Eicher, p. 143; Hughes, pp. 36, 70, 140. Grant's attack drove in the Confederate skirmish line and for the remainder of the morning, both armies, consisting of green recruits, advanced and fell back repeatedly. By 2 p.m., the fighting became one-sided as Pillow's line began to collapse, withdrawing toward Camp Johnston. The orderly retreat began to panic when four Federal field pieces opened up on the retreating soldiers. A volley from the 31st Illinois killed dozens of Confederates, and the Union soldiers attacked from three sides and surged into the camp. The Confederates abandoned their colors and their artillery, and ran toward the river, attempting to escape. Grant was constantly at the front, leading his men. His horse was shot from under him, but he mounted an aide's horse and continued to lead.Nevin, p. 48; Eicher, p. 144. Grant's inexperienced soldiers became, in his own words, \\"demoralized from their victory.\\" Brig. Gen. McClernand walked to the center of the camp, which now flew the Stars and Stripes, and asked for three cheers. A bizarre, carnival-like atmosphere prevailed; the troops were carried away by the joy of their victory, having captured several hundred prisoners and the camp. To regain control of his men, who were plundering and partying, Grant ordered the camp set on fire. In the confusion and blinding smoke, wounded Confederate soldiers in some of the tents were accidentally burned to death, causing returning Confederates to believe the prisoners had been deliberately murdered.Eicher, pp. 144‚Äì45. Lexington and Tyler duel the Confederate batteries The Federals began to march back to their transports, taking with them two captured guns and 106 prisoners. They were suddenly attacked by Confederate reinforcements brought over from Columbus on the transports Prince and Charm, who threatened to cut off Grant's retreat. These were the men of the 15th Tennessee Infantry, the 11th Louisiana Infantry, and mixed infantry under Pillow and Col. Benjamin F. Cheatham. By this time Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk had also crossed the Mississippi River from Columbus and took charge of Confederate forces during the fighting.Hughes, Nathaniel Cheairs, The Battle of Belmont: Grant Strikes South (Univ of North Carolina Press, 1991), p. 184. As the Union men turned to face the Confederate reinforcements, the cannon \\"Lady Polk\\" fired into their ranks from Columbus and numerous other Confederate guns opened fire. The Union gunboats exchanged fire in a battle with the Confederate batteries. Grant said, \\"Well, we must cut our way out as we cut our way in.\\"Eicher, p. 145; Nevin, p. 48. Grant's troops withdraw after the battle When Grant reached the landing, he learned that one Union regiment was unaccounted for. He galloped back to look for it, but found only Confederate soldiers moving in his direction. He spun his horse and raced for the river, but saw that the riverboat captains had already ordered the mooring lines cast off. Grant wrote in his memoirs, > \\"The captain of the boat that had just pushed out recognized me and ordered > the engineer not to start the engine: he then had a plank run out for me. My > horse seemed to take in the situation. He put his fore feet over the bank > without hesitation or urging, and, with his hind feet well under him, slid > down the bank and trotted on board.\\"Gott, p. 43; Nevin, p. 48. While the riverboats were returning to Paducah, the missing Illinois regiment was seen marching upriver and the men were taken aboard.McGhee, James E. \\"The Neophyte General: U.S. Grant and the Belmont Campaign\\", Civil War in St. Louis In the retreat, Grant lost his bay horse, saddle, mess chest, and gold pen, while McClernand lost his \\"handsome iron-framed cot,\\" field desk with dispatches, and an inkstand inscribed with his name.Hughes, p. 185 Aftermath The Confederates viewed Belmont as a Southern victory, since Grant had staged an attack and been driven off. Polk's superior, General Albert Sidney Johnston, remarked that \\"The 7th of November will fill a bright gap in our military annals, and be remembered with gratitude by the sons and daughters of the South.\\" On the evening of November 7th and the morning of November 8th, Grant recalled the units he had ordered forward in Missouri and Kentucky. One Union soldier commented, \\"Well, Grant got whipped at Belmont, and that scared him so that he countermanded all our orders and took all the troops back to their old stations by forced marches.\\"Hughes, p. 190-191, 193 However, Grant viewed the battle very differently. In his memoirs he states, \\"The two objects which the battle of Belmont was fought were fully accomplished. The enemy gave up all idea of detaching troops from Columbus. His losses were very heavy for that period of the war.\\"Ulysses Grant, Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant (New York: The Library of America, 1990), 185. Union losses were 607 (120 dead, 383 wounded, and 104 captured or missing). Confederate casualties were slightly higher at 641 (105 killed, 419 wounded, 106 captured, and 11 missing). A noteworthy result of the battle was the combat and large unit command experience Grant gained. It also gave President Abraham Lincoln, who was desperate for his armies to attack the Confederates somewhere, a positive impression of Grant.Eicher, p. 147. Belmont Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, was named after this battle.Maggio, Alice, Punkin' Donuts and the Battle of Belmont, Gapers Block website, Chicago. The formerly fortified site on the Kentucky side has been designated as the Columbus- Belmont State Park, commemorating the Confederate victory.

Grant ","title":"Battle of Belmont"},{"id":"1615893","text":"The First Battle of Newtonia was fought on September 30, 1862, between Confederate soldiers commanded by Colonel Douglas H. Cooper and a Union column commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Salomon near Newtonia, Missouri, during the American Civil War. Cooper's force had moved into southwestern Missouri, and encamped near the town of Newtonia. The Confederate column was composed mostly of cavalry led by Colonel Joseph O. Shelby and a brigade of Native Americans. A Union force commanded by Brigadier General James G. Blunt moved to intercept Cooper's force. Blunt's advance force, led by Salomon, reached the vicinity of Newtonia on September 29, and attacked Cooper's position on September 30. A Union probing force commanded by Colonel Edward Lynde was driven out of Newtonia by Cooper's forces on the morning of the 30th. Both sides brought up further reinforcements, and seesaw fighting took place during much of the afternoon. Shortly before nightfall, Cooper's Confederates made an all-out attack against the Union line; this led Salomon to withdraw from the field. Militia commanded by Colonel George Hall covered the Union retreat, although Confederate artillery fire struck the retreating forces. This panicked some of Salomon's men, and the retreat turned into a disorderly rout. Union casualties are variously reported as either 245 or over 400, and Confederate casualties were 78. Blunt's whole division began advancing towards Newtonia in early October, leading Cooper to abandon Missouri. A portion of the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 as the First Battle of Newtonia Historic District. Background As the United States matured during the early 19th century, a large cultural divide developed between the northern states and the southern states over the issue of slavery. By the time of the 1860 United States Presidential Election, slavery had become one of the defining features of southern culture, with the ideology of states' rights being used to defend the institution. Eventually, many southerners decided that secession was the only way to preserve slavery, especially after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. Lincoln's candidacy was regionally successful, as much of his support was from the northern states, while he received no electoral votes from the Deep South. Many southerners rejected the legitimacy of Lincoln's election, and promoted secession. On December 20, the state of South Carolina seceded, and the states of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit in early 1861. On February 4, the seceding states formed the Confederate States of America; Jefferson Davis became the nascent nation's president. In Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, the important military installation of Fort Sumter was still held by a Union Army garrison. On the morning of April 12, the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the American Civil War. The fort surrendered on the 13th. Shortly after Fort Sumter was attacked, Lincoln requested that the states remaining in the Union provide 75,000 volunteers for the war effort. In the coming weeks, the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas joined the Confederacy. A Union army commanded by Brigadier General Irvin McDowell moved south into Virginia and attacked two Confederate armies commanded by Brigadier Generals P. G. T. Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston on July 21. In the ensuing First Battle of Bull Run, the Union army was routed. Meanwhile, the population of the state of Missouri was badly divided. While Governor Claiborne F. Jackson and the Missouri State Guard, a militia organization, supported the Confederacy, Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, commander of the St. Louis Arsenal, supported the Union. Lyon drove Jackson and the Missouri State Guard, which was commanded by Major General Sterling Price, into southwestern Missouri, where they were joined by Brigadier General Ben McCulloch's Confederate force. Lyon attacked Price and McCulloch's combined camp on August 10 in the Battle of Wilson's Creek; Lyon was killed and his army defeated. Price then moved north with the Missouri State Guard in a campaign that culminated in the capture of Lexington in September. However, Union forces concentrated against Price, who then retreated back into southwestern Missouri. In February 1862, Union Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis advanced against Price's position, causing the Confederates to abandon Missouri and enter Arkansas. In March, Price, McCulloch, and Major General Earl Van Dorn joined forces. Under the command of Van Dorn, the Confederates attacked Curtis at the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8 but were repulsed. Pea Ridge and another Union victory at the Battle of Island Number Ten led the Union high command to feel secure enough to proclaim that \\"[there was] no Rebel flag now flying in Missouri\\". Prelude This state of affairs did not last long. Price sent some of his troops into Missouri to obtain supplies and recruit new volunteers. The state was also raided by Confederate forces including the command of Colonel Joseph C. Porter, and was plagued by guerrilla attacks from bushwhackers including William Quantrill. At one point Quantrill's guerrillas combined with a regular Confederate force commanded by Colonel John T. Hughes. This combined force defeated a Union force at the First Battle of Independence on August 11. Union forces suffered another defeat on August 15, at the Battle of Lone Jack. The resurgence in Confederate activity was an embarrassment to the commander of the Union's Department of the Missouri, Brigadier General John M. Schofield, who was replaced by Curtis and relegated to the command of the Army of the Frontier. During this period of increased Confederate activity in Missouri, Confederate Colonel Douglas H. Cooper began an incursion into the southwestern portion of the state. Cooper's force included the cavalry of Colonel Joseph O. Shelby's Iron Brigade, and a brigade of Confederate- sympathizing Native Americans. A Union force commanded by Brigadier General James G. Blunt and spearheaded by Brigadier General Frederick Salomon began moving south to confront the Confederates. Cooper sent a scouting force to the Newtonia area on September 27. Commanded by Colonel Trezevant C. Hawpe, it was composed of the 31st Texas Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Cherokee Battalion. Hawpe determined that Newtonia, which was a communications hub, would be a good encampment and had his troops begin operating a grist mill to produce flour. After receiving Hawpe's appraisal of Newtonia's potential as a military base, Cooper ordered him to remain in Newtonia and reinforced him with Captain Joseph Bledsoe's Battery. On September 28, Hawpe was informed by local residents that Union troops were advancing towards Granby, which was about away, but Confederate scouts found no evidence of this movement. Meanwhile, Union forces began concentrating in southwestern Missouri. On September 28, two brigades under Colonel William A. Weer and Salomon rendezvoused at Sarcoxie, which was over from Newtonia; Colonel James Totten's division was expected to leave Springfield on September 29. Opposing forcesUnion= The Union force engaged at Newtonia was a mixture of all three arms of the Union Army: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Union cavalry consisted of the 6th and 9th Kansas, the 2nd Ohio, and 3rd Wisconsin Cavalry Regiments. Infantry regiments present at the battle were the 10th and 13th Kansas, and 9th Wisconsin Infantry Regiments. Artillery came from the 1st and 2nd Kansas Light Artillery Batteries, and the 25th Ohio Battery, as well as two mountain howitzers attached to Company F of the 9th Kansas Cavalry. Three of the cannons were 3-inch rifles and two were mountain howitzers. Also present was the 3rd Indian Home Guard. The historian Shelby Foote stated that the total strength of the Union column was 4,000 men, although other sources place the overall strength at 4,500. =Confederate= The Confederate forces at Newtonia included the 1st Cherokee Battalion, the 1st Choctaw Regiment, the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles, Colonel A. M. Alexander's 34th Texas Cavalry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Beal G. Jeans' Missouri Cavalry Regiment, Hawpe's 31st Texas Cavalry Regiment, the 5th Missouri Cavalry Regiment, Colonel James G. Stevens' 22nd Texas Cavalry Regiment, Bledsoe's Battery, and Captain Sylvanus Howell's Battery. Estimates of Confederate strength vary. Foote gives the total Confederate strength as 5,500 men: composed of 2,500 cavalrymen and 3,000 \\"Indians and guerrillas\\". The historian Daniel O'Flaherty provides a range compatible with Foote's estimate, the historian Larry Wood gives a range of 4,000 to 7,000, and other sources provide a range of 6,000 to 7,000. BattlePreliminary action= On September 29, Salomon sent out three scouting forces: one to Neosho, one to Granby, and one to Newtonia. While the patrol to Neosho participated in a small action, the men sent to Granby saw no Confederate soldiers. The force headed for Newtonia consisted of 150 men from the 9th Kansas Cavalry, in four companies, commanded by Colonel Edward Lynde of the same unit, and including the regiment's two mountain howitzers. Lynde's men drove Confederate skirmishers back towards Newtonia, and determined that a strong enemy force occupied the town. Hawpe, still commanding the Confederates in Newtonia, reported the Union probe to Cooper, who sent Jean's regiment and the 5th Missouri Cavalry to Newtonia. Cooper had also been informed that Granby had been occupied by Union forces, so he ordered the 22nd Texas Cavalry there. Lynde reached Newtonia and found it held by the Confederates. After realizing that his mountain howitzers lacked the range to shell Newtonia, Lynde ordered a retreat. Two Confederate soldiers were captured, and informed the Union commander that Newtonia was occupied in strength. Meanwhile, Cooper and Shelby's two regiments arrived in Newtonia after the Union retreat; the retreating Union force was not pursued. Cooper then returned to the main Confederate camp. The two reinforcing regiments remained in Newtonia overnight, but were sent back to the main Confederate camp early the next morning. The 22nd Texas Cavalry arrived after the Union patrol had left Granby; the Texans occupied the abandoned town. Salomon noted the sounds of combat coming from the Newtonia area, and sent two companies of the 9th Wisconsin Infantry to support Lynde. =September 30= Map of the First Battle of Newtonia The detachment from the 9th Wisconsin Infantry, joined by two more companies of the regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Jacobi, was reinforced by 45 men of the 6th Kansas Cavalry, 50 men from the 3rd Indian Home Guard, and three guns of the 25th Ohio Battery; the group reached the Newtonia area around 07:00 on September 30. An attempt to cut off the Confederate skirmish line by the men of the 6th Kansas Cavalry failed, and Jacobi's force lost the element of surprise. After some hard fighting, the detachment was joined by Lynde's probing force, who had returned to the Newtonia area. Hawpe responded to the start of the action by reporting the Union advance to Cooper. The Confederates, represented by the 31st Texas Cavalry, the 1st Cherokee Battalion, and Bledsoe's artillery, took up defensive positions near Mathew H. Ritchey's farm. An artillery duel began, which was deadlocked until the Union artillery advanced closer to the Confederate lines, which allowed their fire to become more effective. Some of the men of the 9th Wisconsin Infantry moved to the cover of the houses on the edge of Newtonia; they began sniping at the cannoneers of Bledsoe's battery. Cooper noticed that sounds of battle were coming from Newtonia, and sent the 34th Texas Cavalry there to reinforce Hawpe. The men of the 31st Texas Cavalry had been taking shelter behind a stone wall, but left its cover to assault the Union line. This charge was quickly repulsed by canister fire from the Union artillery. After this, the Union artillery concentrated on Bledsoe's battery. The Confederate guns ran low on ammunition after about 30 minutes, and when the Union commanders saw the Confederate artillery fire slacken, the 9th Wisconsin Infantry charged the Confederate line. Bledsoe withdrew the pieces some distance, although the guns' silent presence did discourage a small Union cavalry force from advancing against the new Confederate artillery position. At this time, Confederate reinforcements in the form of the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles and the 5th Missouri Cavalry arrived. The fresh units were enough to turn the tide against the 9th Wisconsin Infantry, which conducted a fighting retreat out of Newtonia. Additionally, the 22nd Texas Cavalry arrived from Granby to further strengthen the Confederates. The 22nd Texas Cavalry had planned on assaulting the Union artillery position, but the Missouri cavalry, commanded by Colonel B. Frank Gordon, mistook the Texans for Union troops, and the delay caused by the subsequent confrontation prevented an immediate assault. Lynde and Jacobi decided to withdraw, although a delayed charge by Gordon's cavalry interfered with the process. The Confederate charge was again dispersed with canister fire, after which the Union retreat began. The Confederates pursued, and the retreat soon became disorderly. Like Cooper, Salomon learned about the fighting by hearing the sounds of battle coming from Newtonia. In response, Salomon sent the rest of the 6th Kansas Cavalry and the 3rd Indian Home Guard towards the town. Additional Union forces would begin moving towards Newtonia later, although Salomon's supply train was left behind in Sarcoxie. The two regiments encountered the Confederates pursuing Lynde's column, and the pursuit ended in the face of these fresh Union troops. In the interim, more Confederate units had reached Newtonia: Jeans' Cavalry Regiment and four cannons under the command of Howell. The Confederates were aware that Union reinforcements were on the way, and Howell placed his cannons in a position where they commanded the road the Union troops were advancing down. Union soldiers sighted Confederate troops positioned in front of Newtonia, and two Union cannons were then unlimbered. They began firing at the Confederate line, which soon retreated. After reaching Newtonia, the Union artillery again fired at the Confederate position, although Howell's guns quickly responded, driving off the Union cannons. The American Battlefield Protection Program's map of the battlefield The repulse of the 6th Kansas Cavalry and 3rd Indian Home Guard had occurred in the mid-morning of the 30th, and no further serious fighting occurred until the early afternoon. Salomon had left Sarcoxie earlier, but did not reach the Union line until about 15:30. He then proceeded to form a defensive line with nine available cannons, as well as the 6th Kansas Cavalry, the 3rd Indian Home Guard, and a portion of the 9th Wisconsin Infantry. Three cannons and their crews that had seen heavy fighting in Lynde's morning action and the 10th Kansas Infantry formed a reserve. The Union guns began an artillery duel with Howell's cannons, and the Confederate cannoneers were soon forced to retreat. An attempt by the Confederates to use the Ritchey barn as a fortification proved futile once the Union guns found the range of the structure. Meanwhile, the Confederates were again reinforced: Bledsoe's battery returned after leaving the field to resupply, and the 1st Choctaw Regiment arrived. Cooper then sent Jeans' regiment and the 22nd Texas Cavalry to probe the Union line, but artillery fire and the 3rd Indian Home Guard drove them back; the 6th Kansas Cavalry was detached south as a result of this threat. The 3rd Indian Home Guard pursued the retreating Confederates, threatening the stability of the main Confederate line, but a flank attack by the 1st Choctaw Regiment stabilized the situation for the Confederates. The 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles also counterattacked. Salomon sent the 10th Kansas Infantry into the fray to support the 3rd Indian Home Guard, but fire from Howell's Confederate artillery, which had moved closer to the Union line, and an advance by the 22nd Texas Cavalry, compelled the Union troops to break off the assault. Cooper responded by initiating an attack with his entire force against the Union line. Salomon then ordered a withdrawal, and the Union troops began to retreat from the field. A brigade of Unionist Missouri state militia forces commanded by Colonel George Hall arrived on the field as Salomon was ordering his retreat. Hall was ordered to cover the Union withdrawal, and the militia formed a line between Salomon's retreating force and the pursuing Confederates. A few pieces of Union artillery had remained in fighting order, and these guns supported Hall's line. Darkness hampered the effectiveness of the Union cannons, but Howell's artillery responded, using the muzzle flashes of the Union cannons as aiming points. The Confederate fire panicked the Union forces, and the orderly retreat turned into a rout. Some of the Union soldiers fled all the way to Sarcoxie. By this point, darkness had fallen, and neither army wished to bring on a night battle. After Salomon's troops had left the battlefield, Hall's militiamen withdrew in turn, still acting as a rear guard. Around the same time, Cooper called off the pursuit. The 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles failed to receive the order; Cooper later sent an officer to retrieve the regiment, ordering it back to the Confederate camp. Aftermath Flag of the 6th Kansas Cavalry, showing Newtonia battle honor During the battle, the Confederates suffered 78 casualties; Union casualties are variously reported as 245 or over 400. Confederate casualties were highest in the 5th Missouri Cavalry, which lost four men killed and 11 wounded. The Confederates saw 15 officers become casualties, including one killed in each of the 1st Choctaw Regiment and the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles. Salomon did not file an official report of his losses. However, he did note that the morning stage of the battle resulted in more Union casualties than the afternoon stage. Four companies of the 9th Wisconsin Infantry were stated to have suffered particularly high losses; those companies had been engaged with Lynde in the morning fight. Despite defeating Salomon's Union force, the Confederate position around Newtonia was still not secure. Salomon had represented only the advance guard of Blunt's command. On October 2, additional troops of Blunt's division reached the Newtonia area from Fort Scott, Kansas, and Totten's division arrived from Springfield. By October 4, Cooper had decided to abandon Newtonia and southwestern Missouri. Shelby's cavalry was tasked with remaining in Newtonia to serve as a rear guard. However, he did not remain there long, as he soon received word that his line of retreat was in danger of being cut by the Union advance. Shelby fell back, and the Union troops occupied Newtonia after a brief bombardment of the town. The Confederate Native American troops retreated back to Indian Territory; the others retreated into northwestern Arkansas. As the Confederates engaged at Newtonia retreated from Missouri, other Confederate troops attacked and forced the surrender of a small Union garrison at the Battle of Clark's Mill near Vera Cruz. First Newtonia was the first battle in the American Civil War that saw Native Americans fight on both sides in an organized manner. On October 28, 1864, the Second Battle of Newtonia was fought near the site of the 1862 battle. In the 1864 battle, a Union army commanded by Blunt attacked and defeated a Confederate army led by Price. The Confederates had been retreating southwards after being defeated at the battles of Westport in Missouri, and Mine Creek in Kansas. Preservation The First Battle of Newtonia Historic District preserves of the battlefield; the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The separately-listed Mathew H. Ritchey House is located within the district. The site contains the Ritchey barn and barnyard site, a Civil War-era cemetery, the Newtonia Branch stream, the historic Neosho Road, and the battlefield itself. While much of the land in the district is privately owned, the Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association has ownership of . At least nine Union soldiers are buried in the cemetery, although not all of them are related to the First Battle of Newtonia. More war-related burials had previously been located there, as many of the military burials were exhumed and moved to the Springfield National Cemetery in 1869. The Mathew H. Ritchey House is notable for having served as a headquarters building for both sides during the two battles of Newtonia and was used as a field hospital after the fighting. The American Battlefield Trust has participated in the preservation of of the battlefield. The American Battlefield Protection Program has suggested that it may be possible to enlarge the area of the historic district. However, the same study determined that the site did not meet the inclusion criteria for becoming an official unit of the National Park Service, as the cultural features at Newtonia were deemed too similar to those preserved in other National Park Service sites.

Blunt of the Union Army and Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby's rear guard of the Confederate Army of Missouri. In September 1864, Confederate Major General Sterling Price had entered the state of Missouri with hopes of creating a popular uprising against Union control of the state. A defeat at the Battle of Pilot Knob in late September and the strength of Union positions at Jefferson City led Price to abandon the main objectives of the campaign; he instead began moving his force west towards Kansas City, where it was badly defeated at the Battle of Westport by Major General Samuel R. Curtis on October 23. Following a set of three defeats in Missouri and Kansas on October 25, Price's column halted to rest near Newtonia on October 28. On the afternoon of the 28th, Union pursuers commanded by Blunt caught up with Price and drove back his skirmishers. Price ordered the withdrawal of his main army, and ordered Shelby to hold a rear guard. Shelby initially had a numerical advantage, and used it to outflank Blunt's smaller line. With his men low on ammunition, Blunt was considering a retreat shortly before sundown when reinforcements arrived in the form of Brigadier General John B. Sanborn and his brigade. Sanborn formed on Blunt's left, and the Union troops counterattacked. Shelby ordered a retreat, and the Union troops did not begin to pursue until October 30. Once the pursuit resumed, it continued until they reached the Arkansas River. The Confederates did not stop retreating until they reached Texas; Price had lost over two thirds of his army during the campaign. While both sides initially claimed victory, modern historians credit the Union with a victory at Newtonia. Estimates of casualties suffered during the battle range greatly. Background Map of Price's Raid As the American Civil War began in 1861, the state of Missouri was a slave state, but did not secede. However, the state was politically divided: Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and the Missouri State Guard (MSG) supported secession and the Confederate States of America, while Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon and the Union Army supported the United States and opposed secession. Under Major General Sterling Price, the MSG defeated Union armies at the battles of Wilson's Creek and Lexington in 1861, but by the end of the year, the Price and the MSG were restricted to the southwestern portion of the state. Meanwhile, Jackson and a portion of the state legislature voted to secede and join the Confederate States of America, while another element of the legislature voted to reject secession, essentially giving the state two governments. In March 1862, a Confederate defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas gave the Union control of Missouri, and Confederate activity in the state was largely restricted to guerrilla warfare and raids throughout 1862 and 1863. By the beginning of September 1864, events in the eastern United States, especially the Confederate defeat in the Atlanta campaign, gave Abraham Lincoln, who supported continuing the war, an edge in the 1864 United States presidential election over George B. McClellan, who favored ending the war. At this point, the Confederacy had very little chance of winning the war. Meanwhile, in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Confederates had defeated Union attackers in the Red River campaign in Louisiana in March through May. As events east of the Mississippi River turned against the Confederates, General Edmund Kirby Smith, Confederate commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to transfer the infantry under his command to the fighting in the Eastern and Western Theaters. However, this proved to be impossible, as the Union Navy controlled the Mississippi River, preventing a large scale crossing. Despite having limited resources for an offensive, Smith decided that an attack designed to divert Union troops from the principal theaters of combat would have an equivalent effect as the proposed transfer of troops, through decreasing the Confederates' numerical disparity east of the Mississippi. Price and the Confederate Governor of Missouri Thomas Caute Reynolds suggested that an invasion of Missouri would be an effective offensive; Smith approved the plan and appointed Price to command the offensive. Price expected that the offensive would create a popular uprising against Union control of Missouri, divert Union troops away from principal theaters of combat (many of the Union troops previously defending Missouri had been transferred out of the state, leaving the Missouri State Militia to be the state's primary defensive force), and aid McClellan's chance of defeating Lincoln in the election. On September 19, Price's column entered the state. Originally, Price and his Army of Missouri had hoped to capture St. Louis, but a defeat at the Battle of Pilot Knob in late September dissuaded the Confederates from assaulting that city. Jefferson City, a secondary target, was deemed too strong to attack when it was reached in early October, so the Confederates began moving westwards towards Kansas City. During the movement, the Army of Missouri collected supplies during side raids such as the Battle of Glasgow, although Major General William S. Rosecrans, commander of the Union Department of the Missouri, began mobilizing troops against Price. On October 23, Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis and the Army of the Border caught up with Price near Kansas City and badly defeated him in the Battle of Westport. The Army of Missouri then began retreating through Kansas, but was forced to fight three battlesMarais des Cygnes, Mine Creek, and Marmiton River. Mine Creek in particular was a disastrous rout in which large quantities of supplies and soldiers were lost to capture. On October 28, Price halted his retreat near Newtonia, Missouri, hoping to give his weary men a rest. Battle Map of battlefield movements at Second Newtonia Price's men encamped south of Newtonia, near the McClain Farm. While the Confederates were harvesting corn, Union pursuers under the command of Major General James G. Blunt arrived at Newtonia around 14:00 and quickly drove a small group of Confederate skirmishers away from their position west of the town near the Mathew H. Ritchey Farm. Price was caught by surprise; he ordered Shelby to provide a rear guard while the rest of his army withdrew, as he believed that Curtis and the entire Union army was upon him. Meanwhile, Blunt made two incorrect assumptions: that Curtis was close behind his force in support, and that the Confederates would not act aggressively. As a result, Blunt decided to attack with his two brigades, who numbered only about 1,000 men; the brigades were nominally under the command of Colonels Charles R. Jennison and James H. Ford, although Lieutenant Colonel George H. Hoyt held temporary command of the former unit. The Union troopers then moved up to the northern edge of the McClain Farm with four cavalry regiments, aligned left to right in the order of 16th Kansas Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Wisconsin Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Colorado Cavalry Regiment, and the 15th Kansas Cavalry Regiment; McLain's Colorado Battery formed up in a supporting position with four guns. Shelby aligned his men away on the other side of the farm, with the brigades of Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson and Colonel Sidney D. Jackman in the center and two small mounted detachments covering the flanks. The two guns of Collins' Missouri Battery provided artillery support; all in all, Shelby had about 2,000 men on the field. The two sides' artillery opened fire, with Collins' Battery having the early advantage over McLain, whose pieces had trouble finding the range of the Confederates. Two mountain howitzers added to the Union line by Hoyt were more effective than McLain's pieces, but could not gain an advantage over Collins. Fearing that the Union guns' numerical advantage would eventually overwhelm Collins; Shelby ordered an attack, which outflanked the Union line and had initial success. While the two mountain howitzers helped hold the Union right, the mounted detachment on the Confederate right outflanked the Union left, causing the retreat of McLain's Battery. The sight of the guns retreating demoralized some of the men of the 15th and 16th Kansas Cavalry Regiments, parts of which routed. Watching elements of their opponents flee emboldened the Confederates, and the attack was pressed harder. The Union lines fell all the way back to the Ritchey Farm, where they reformed their lines. Blunt, concerned that his men would run out of ammunition, began making preparation to withdraw from the field and positioned McLain's Battery on an elevation behind his main line. By now, it was approaching sundown, and Union reinforcements commanded by Brigadier General John B. Sanborn arrived on the field, having forced marched from Fort Scott, Kansas. After arriving, Sanborn aligned his men to Blunt's left; there were now about 1,500 Union soldiers in the fight. Curtis arrived with Sanborn, and watched McLain's Battery withdraw in a state that Curtis described as \\"badly cut up\\". Curtis helped to rally the Colorado battery, while Sanborn dismounted his men and prepared for an assault. Once Sanborn's men began attacking, Blunt's rejuvenated troopers joined in the counterattack. Two cannons of Battery H, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Regiment had arrived, giving the Union an artillery advantage of eight guns to two. With the Union having thrown fresh troops into the fray and with the artillery advantage growing more disparate, Shelby ordered a withdrawal. Elements of Fagan's command arrived to reinforce Shelby during the retreat, but the Confederates still withdrew to some woods near their original camp. By this time, both sides were heavily fatigued, and Curtis and Blunt decided to postpone any pursuit until morning. Aftermath and preservation Both armies claimed victory. Curtis reported that the Confederates had been \\"conquered\\", while Price claimed that Blunt had been driven and to have inflicted severe casualties. Both the American Battlefield Trust and the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission interpret the outcome as a Union victory. Likewise, estimates of casualties vary greatly. One modern historian places total Union casualties at 26 and those for the Confederates at 24; the American Battlefield Trust estimated 400 and 250, respectively; and a contemporary newspaper reported 113 Union casualties, and under 200 for the Confederates. During the night, Shelby's men left the field to rejoin Price's main command, having completed their mission of providing a rear guard. The Confederate force, which the historian Albert E. Castel described as being essentially an armed mob after Marmiton River, began completely falling apart. Rosecrans had received orders from General Ulysses S. Grant to divert any troops not needed to deal with Price east of the Mississippi, so two brigades, including Sanborn's, were detached from Curtis on October 29. Curtis planned on stopping the pursuit, but the detached troops were returned to him the next day, and the pursuit resumed. Price withdrew to the Arkansas River via Cane Hill, Arkansas; Curtis' pursuit ended on November 8 at the Arkansas. After marching through the Indian Territory, the Confederates reached Texas. The campaign had cost Price more than two thirds of the men he had taken into Missouri. The battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Second Battle of Newtonia Site on December 23, 2004. Within the historic district are four contributing properties: the battlefield proper, the position of McLain's Battery on the ridge, a cornfield at the site of the Ritchey Farm, and the site of a historic road that led to Granby. Most of areas where fighting occurred are preserved in the district, which shares a boundary with the First Battle of Newtonia Historic District at two places. Modern landscape use is similar to that in 1864, although railroad construction and open-pit mining have intruded on the site. The American Battlefield Trust has been part of the preservation of at Newtonia.

After back-and-forth operations throughout 1861, the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard under the command of Sterling Price had been confined to southwestern Missouri. In December 1861, Price authorized recruiting and raiding activities in the central portion of the state, with the North Missouri Railroad being a major target. In January 1862, Major W. M. G. Torrence of the Union Army located a Missouri State Guard base in Randolph County and attacked in on January 8 with elements of four cavalry regiments. The camp, which was commanded by Colonel John A. Poindexter put up little resistance and was soon overrun. Large quantities of supplies were captured in the abandoned camp, which was destroyed. The action at Roan's Tan Yard, along with a Missouri State Guard defeat at the Battle of Mount Zion Church the preceding December, led to a decrease in pro-Confederate activity in central Missouri. Background When the American Civil War began in early 1861, the state of Missouri was politically divided. Despite being a slave state, it did not secede, although Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson supported secession. An attempt by Jackson and his pro-secession followers to move against the St. Louis Arsenal was thwarted on May 10 by Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon of the Union Army. In response, Jackson formed the Missouri State Guard as a pro- secession militia unit and appointed Sterling Price to lead it. Lyon chased Jackson and Price into the southwestern portion of the state in June, where Price was reinforced by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch and his Confederate States Army unit. On August 10, Lyon attacked Price's and McCulloch's combined camp, but Lyon was killed and his army routed in the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Price followed up the victory by leading the Missouri State Guard on a foray north towards the Missouri River, culminating in the capture of Lexington in September. In mid-October, Union troops concentrated against Price, who then retreated back into southwestern Missouri. On November 3, while at Neosho, Jackson and the pro-secession state legislators, who had previously been evicted from the state capital by Lyon, voted to secede and join the Confederate State of America as a government-in- exile; the anti-secession elements of the state legislature had previously voted to remain in the United States. Battle Map of the Roan's Tan Yard battlefield In December, Price sent recruiters into the central portions of Missouri, in the hope that men would volunteer to serve in his command. An additional goal was to raid the North Missouri Railroad on the night of December 20. Several hundred men volunteered for the raid on the railroad, and damaged a stretch of it by burning bridges; thousands of Missourians joined Confederate-supporting units in the period after the raid. The Missouri State Guard then formed a camp in the vicinity of Yates, Missouri, in Randolph County, to attract and train new recruits. While scouting near Silver Creek in January 1862, Union Major W. M. G. Torrence of the 1st Iowa Cavalry Regiment learned of the presence of a Missouri State Guard camp in the area. While Union authorities had been aware of the existence of the camp for over a week, its location had not previously been established. The Missouri State Guard outpost was under the command of Colonel John A. Poindexter. An 1864 source estimated that Poindexter had around 1,000 men on hand. On January 8, Torrence decided to attack Poindexter's camp. Collecting together detachments from his own regiment, as well as the 1st and 2nd Missouri and the 4th Ohio Cavalry Regiments, Torrence began preparing for an attack. The National Park Service estimates the Union column's strength at around 450 men, while a 1908 history of the Union Army gives a strength of about 500. About from the Missouri State Guard camp, Torrence deployed his men. One battalion of the 2nd Missouri Cavalry and one company of the 4th Ohio Cavalry were to draw Poindexter's fire, while elements of the 1st Iowa Cavalry and the 1st Missouri Cavalry were to conduct a mounted charge; three additional companies of the 2nd Missouri Cavalry were to attack from a different direction. The attack hit around 16:30 with fog on the field. Initially, the Missouri States Guardsmen held out, using the fog and the terrain as cover, with the two sides trading volleys. Torrence broke the stalemate by sending four companies, three of which were from the 1st Iowa Cavalry, to charge Poindexter's line. This threw the defenders into confusion, and the camp was captured after a fight of only thirty or forty minutes. Large quantities of supplies and equipment were taken in the camp. Poindexter's surviving men fled, using fog to cover their retreat. In his official report, Torrence stated that he had sent two companies to block the Missouri State Guardsmen's path of retreat, but that fog and the terrain thwarted the attempt, allowing the retreat. Aftermath After the battle, the camp was destroyed; with the camp unusable, Missouri State Guard recruiting activities in Randolph County ceased. Coupled with another defeat at the Battle of Mount Zion Church the previous December, the setbacks led to a reduction of pro-Confederate activities in the central Missouri region. Estimates of casualties suffered in the action vary. Torrence estimated that between 80 and 100 Missouri State Guard soldiers were killed or wounded, and reported the capture of a further 28; the National Park Service and the modern history Frances H. Kennedy place Poindexter's loss at a total of 80. Union casualties are generally reported to have been either four or 11, although one source places their loss at as high as 27. The site of the battle is privately owned and is not commemorated on-site, although a museum in nearby Huntsville provides interpretation of the action. A 2011 study by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission determined that of the battlefield are likely eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The same study determined that land use at the site was relatively unchanged when compared to the time of the battle.

It was the only Union victory in southwestern Missouri in 1861.NPS/ABPP  Prelude  Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont commanded the Union Department of the West, with headquarters in St. Louis. He formulated a plan to clear Confederate forces from the state, and then, if possible, carry the war into Arkansas and Louisiana. His force left St. Louis on October 7, 1861; it eventually numbered more than 20,000. He had 5,000 cavalry, which included Maj. Frank J. White's Prairie Scouts and Fr√©mont's Body Guards under Maj. Charles Zagonyi. Maj. White became ill and turned his command over to Zagonyi. These two units scouted in front of the army. By December, the army had advanced into southwest Missouri. Opposing them was the main body of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard under Major General Sterling Price, at Springfield, Missouri. With his force heavily outnumbered, Price withdrew from Springfield. Other MSG forces organizing nearby attempted to link up with Price's army at Springfield, only to find the place had already been abandoned.Banasik, Confederate Tales..., pp. 136-137  Opposing forces  Union = * Fremont's Bodyguards: Major Charles Zagonyi * Major Frank White's Prairie Scouts = Confederate = * Missouri State Guard: Colonel Julian Frazier  Battle  Zagony's \\"death attack\\" at Springfield, October 25th.

Fr√©mont camped on the Pomme de Terre River, near Bolivar, Missouri. Zagonyi's scouting column, though, continued on to Springfield, and Frazier's mixed force of 1,000 to 1,500 infantry and cavalry prepared to meet it. Zagonyi's combined force of 326 men approached Springfield on the Mt. Vernon Road.Banasik, Confederate Tales..., pp. 136-137 Frazier set up an ambush along the road that Zagonyi traveled.

Zagonyi's men continued into town, hailed Federal sympathizers and released Union prisoners, tore down the Confederate flag flying over the courthouse and hoisted Union colors. Leery of a Confederate counterattack, Zagonyi departed Springfield before night, but Fr√©mont's army returned, in force, a few days later and set up camp in the town.  Casualties  Union casualties were reported as 15 killed, 27 wounded, and 10 missing/captured for Fremont's Body Guard, and 33 killed, wounded and missing/captured for White's command, for a total of 85.Banasik, Confederate Tales..., pp. 140-141 Confederate casualties are unknown but estimated as 133.NPS/ABPP  Aftermath  In mid-November, after Fr√©mont was sacked and replaced by Maj. Gen. David Hunter, the Federals evacuated Springfield and withdrew to Sedalia and Rolla. Federal troops reoccupied Springfield in early 1862 and it was a Union stronghold from then on. This small engagement was the only Union victory in Southwestern Missouri in 1861.

Carter The Battle of Blue Springs was a battle of the American Civil War, occurring on October 10, 1863, in Greene County, Tennessee. Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, commander of the Department of the Ohio, undertook an expedition into East Tennessee to clear the roads and passes to Virginia, and, if possible, secure the saltworks beyond Abingdon. In October, Confederate Brig. Gen. John S. Williams, with his cavalry force, set out to disrupt Union communications and logistics. He wished to take Bulls Gap on the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. On October 3, while advancing on Bulls Gap, he fought with Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Carter's Union Cavalry Division, XXIII Corps, at Blue Springs, about nine miles from Bulls Gap, on the railroad. Carter, not knowing how many of the enemy he faced, withdrew. Carter and Williams skirmished for the next few days. On October 10, Carter approached Blue Springs in force. Williams had received some reinforcements. The battle began about 10:00 a.m. with Union cavalry engaging the Confederates until afternoon while another mounted force attempted to place itself in a position to cut off a Confederate retreat. Captain Orlando M. Poe, the Chief Engineer, performed a reconnaissance to identify the best location for making an infantry attack. At 3:30 pm, Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero's 1st Division, IX Corps, moved up to attack, which he did at 5:00 p.m. Ferrero's men broke into the Confederate line, causing heavy casualties, and advanced almost to the enemy's rear before being checked. After dark, the Confederates withdrew and the Federals took up the pursuit in the morning. Within days, Williams and his men had retired to Virginia. Burnside had launched the East Tennessee Campaign to reduce or extinguish Confederate influence in the area; Blue Springs helped fulfill that mission.

Edward Bloodgood held Brentwood, a station on the Nashville & Decatur Railroad, with 400 men on the morning of March 25, 1863, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, with a powerful column, approached the town. The day before, Forrest had ordered Col. J. W. Starnes, commanding the 2nd Brigade, to go to Brentwood, cut the telegraph, tear up railroad track, attack the stockade, and cut off any retreat. Forrest and the other cavalry brigade joined Bloodgood about 7:00 am on March 25. A messenger from the stockade informed Bloodgood that Forrest's men were about to attack, and had destroyed the railroad tracks. Bloodgood sought to notify his superiors and discovered that the telegraph lines were cut. Forrest sent in a demand for a surrender under a flag of truce, but Bloodgood refused. Within a half-hour, though, Forrest had artillery in place to shell Bloodgood's position and had surrounded the Federals with a large force. Bloodgood decided to surrender.

Background In November 1864, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge undertook an expedition into East Tennessee from Virginia to secure the countryside for food and forage and to drive the Federals from the area. A Federal force under the command of Brig. Gen. Alvan C. Gillem had advanced beyond Greeneville, but retired in front of the larger Confederate force moving out of Jonesborough toward Greeneville. To protect the rail lines to Knoxville, the Federals fell back to Bulls Gap east-southeast of Whitesburg on the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad. Battle On November 11, the Confederate forces attacked in the morning, but were repulsed by 11:00 a.m. Artillery fire continued throughout the day. Both sides launched morning attacks on November 12. The Confederates sought to hit the Union forces in a variety of locations but they gained little ground. On November 13, firing occurred throughout most of the day, but the Confederates did not assault the Union lines. The Union forces, short on everything from ammunition to rations, withdrew from Bulls Gap toward Russellville late in the evening. Aftermath Breckinridge pursued the Federals on November 14 and engaged them near Russellville, causing a rout. The Federals fell back to Strawberry Plains (outside of Knoxville) where Breckinridge again engaged his forces. Federal reinforcements soon arrived and foul weather began to play havoc with the roads and streams. Breckinridge, with most of his force, retired back to Virginia. The Confederate victory at the Battle of Bulls Gap was a setback in the Federal plans to rid East Tennessee of Confederate military presence, though temporary following Breckinridge's withdrawal to Virginia.

Background In late January 1863, Confederate Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler, commanding two brigades of cavalry, took position on the Cumberland River at Palmyra to disrupt Union shipping. The Federals, however, apprised of Wheeler's intent, refrained from sending any boats up or downriver. Unable to disrupt Union shipping and realizing that he and his men could not remain in the area indefinitely, Wheeler decided to attack the garrison at Dover, Tennessee, which informers reported was small and could easily be overwhelmed. Battle Map of Dover Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program The Confederates set out for Dover and began an attack between 1 and 2 p.m., on February 3. The 800-man garrison, under the command of Colonel Abner C. Harding, was in and about the town of Dover where they had chosen camps that commanded the area and had dug rifle pits and battery emplacements. The Confederates mounted a determined attack using artillery fire with great skill, but were repulsed with heavy losses. By dusk, both sides were mostly without ammunition. The Confederates surveyed the Union defenses and decided that the enemy was too well placed to allow capture. Aftermath Wheeler's force retired. The Federals sent out a pursuit but to no avail. The Confederates had failed to disrupt shipping on the Cumberland River and capture the garrison at Dover. This Confederate failure left the Union in control in Middle Tennessee and a bitter Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest denounced Wheeler, a favorite of Gen. Braxton Bragg, saying he would not serve under him again.

Hartsville Battlefield is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Background The Stones River Campaign started in early November 1862 when Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans moved his Army of the Cumberland southeast from Nashville, Tennessee, toward Murfreesboro. Confederate General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Tennessee, had retreated there after his defeat at the Battle of Perryville. Bragg ordered Colonel John Hunt Morgan to move north with his cavalry and operate along Rosecrans's lines of communications, to prevent him from foraging for supplies north of Nashville. The action at Hartsville, a crossing point on the Cumberland River about 40 miles upstream from Nashville, north of Murfreesboro, was an incident in Morgan's raid to the north, before Rosecrans had the bulk of his infantry forces on the move. Battle Map of Hartsville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Guarding the river crossing at Hartsville was the 39th Brigade, XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, consisting of the 106th Ohio Infantry, 108th Ohio Infantry, 104th Illinois Infantry, and 2nd Indiana Cavalry. The brigade was commanded by Col. Absalom B. Moore. Under the cover of darkness, Morgan crossed the river in the early morning of December 7, 1862, with about 1,300 men, mainly Kentuckians, outnumbered by about 1,000 troops by the Union brigade. Another Union force, three times that size, was encamped nine miles away at Castalian Springs, close enough to hear the guns, but too far away to take part. Morgan's attack took the Union camp by surprise. One account indicates that the Confederates were able to get past the picket line by wearing blue uniforms, while another says they wore civilian clothes and posed as refugees. The attack began at 6:45 a.m. with a simultaneous artillery bombardment and an infantry attack, while the cavalry struck the flanks and rear. One of Moore's units broke and ran after an hour, which caused confusion and helped force the Federals to fall back. By 8:30 a.m., the Confederates had surrounded the Union soldiers, convincing Col. Moore to surrender. Aftermath The Union 75th Indiana regiment was camped about 8 or 9 miles away at Castalian Springs. They marched to Hartsville after hearing cannons firing in the distance. Their advance was hesitant because they may have encountered the rear guard of Morgan's cavalry. They reached the battlefield to find Union and Confederate casualties abandoned in the snow. The Union forces had already been defeated by the Morgan's combined light infantry, light artillery and cavalry. Some of Morgan's men were barefooted and inadequately clothed. They helped themselves to the Union supplies of shoes and filled several wagons with supplies. Reports gave the number of dead and wounded as about 200 combined. Basil W. Duke, the Confederate field commander, wrote that fifteen Confederate soldiers ‚Äúfrozen so stiff‚Äù were left behind along with other wounded. The Union wounded were also left behind, while the 2,004 prisoners taken were marched south to Lebanon. Duke wrote that the Confederates knew of the Union strength and even where they were deployed. Morgan thus took the precaution of deploying Quirk's Scouts and Cluke's regiment to impede any Union pursuit. The Confederates stepped up the pace, and some Union prisoners were forced to wade the Cumberland River or one of the smaller creeks.Duke, Basil W. History of Morgan's Cavalry. Cincinnati, OH: Miami Printing and Publishing Company, 1867, pp. 309‚Äì316. Morgan inflicted 58 Union casualties, at the cost of 139 Confederate; however, he also left the battlefield with 1,844 Union prisoners and a wagon train heavily loaded with captured equipment and supplies. General Joseph E. Johnston, who was in overall command of Confederate forces in the Western Theater, called this a \\"brilliant feat\\" and recommended that Morgan be appointed brigadier general immediately. Jefferson Davis happened to be in the vicinity at Murfreesboro and promoted Morgan in person when he arrived. The action at Hartsville foreshadowed the Confederate cavalry raids by Nathan Bedford Forrest into West Tennessee, December 1862 to January 1863, and by Morgan into Kentucky, from December 1862 to January 1863. Rosecrans arrived in Murfreesboro on December 29, setting the stage for the Battle of Stones River. NotesReferences * National Park Service battle description * Foote, Shelby.

Background The engagement at Jackson occurred during Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's Expedition into West Tennessee, between December 11, 1862, and January 1, 1863. Forrest wished to interrupt the rail supply line to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's army, campaigning down the Mississippi Central Railroad. If he could destroy the Mobile & Ohio Railroad running south from Columbus, Kentucky, through Jackson, Tennessee, Grant would have to curtail or halt his operations. Forrest's 2,100-man cavalry brigade crossed the Tennessee River from December 15 to December 17, heading west.NPS Grant ordered a troop concentration at Jackson under Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan and sent a cavalry force out under Col. Robert G. Ingersoll, to confront Forrest. Forrest, however, smashed the Union cavalry at Lexington on December 18. Battle As Forrest continued his advance the next day, Sullivan ordered Col. Adolph Englemann to take a small force northeast of Jackson. At Old Salem Cemetery, acting on the defensive, Englemann's two infantry regiments repulsed a Confederate mounted attack and then withdrew a mile closer to town. To Forrest, the fight amounted to no more than a feint and show of force intended to hold Jackson's Union defenders in place while two mounted columns destroyed railroad track north and south of the town and returned. This accomplished, Forrest withdrew from the Jackson area to attack Trenton and Humboldt. Thus, although the Federals had checked a demonstration by a portion of Forrest's force, a major accomplishment, other Confederates had fulfilled an element of the expedition's mission.

Confederate cavalry commander Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest culminated a 23-day raid through western Tennessee by attacking the Union supply base at Johnsonville. Forrest's attack destroyed numerous boats in the Tennessee River and millions of dollars of supplies, disrupting the logistical operations of Union Major General George H. Thomas in Nashville. As a result, Thomas's army was hampered in its (eventually successful) plan to defeat Confederate Lieutenant General John Bell Hood's invasion of Tennessee, the Franklin- Nashville Campaign. Background One of the critical routes used to supply the Federal forces in Tennessee was the Tennessee River. Supplies were offloaded at Johnsonville and then shipped by rail to Nashville. In the fall of 1864 the supplies were principally meant for the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Thomas. Meanwhile, Hood's army was marching through northern Alabama on its way to an invasion of Tennessee. In late September 1864, Hood's army departed northwest from the vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia hoping its destruction of Union supply lines would lure Major General William T. Sherman's Union army into battle. Sherman pursued Hood as far as Gaylesville, Alabama, but decided to return his army to Atlanta and conduct instead a March to the Sea through Georgia. He gave responsibility for the defense of Tennessee to Thomas.Kennedy, p. 389; Eicher, p. 770. Federal artillery rushing out of Johnsonville after Forrest's raid Lieutenant General Richard Taylor ordered Forrest on a wide-ranging cavalry raid through Western Tennessee to destroy the Union supply line to Nashville. Forrest's initial objective was Fort HeimanFort Heiman was captured by the Union Army in conjunction with the Battle of Fort Henry in February 1862. on the Tennessee River north of Johnsonville, possession of which would prevent Union transports from reaching Johnsonville, upriver. The first of Forrest's men began to ride on October 16, 1864. They were exhausted from a previous raid and Forrest gave them orders to disperse, obtain new mounts and supplies, and return to the raid. Forrest himself began moving north on October 24 and reached Fort Heiman on October 28, where he emplaced artillery. On October 29 and October 30, his artillery fire caused the capture of the steamers Mazeppa, Anna, and Venus, as well as the gunboat Undine. At this point, the Union stopped river supply traffic to Johnsonville.Wills, pp. 263‚Äì65. Forrest repaired two of the boats, Undine and Venus, to use as a small flotilla to aid in his attack on Johnsonville. The boats and his cavalrymen departed on November 1, 1864, while the land component of his expedition encountered difficult road conditions following recent rains. On November 2, Forrest's flotilla was challenged by two Union gunboats, Key West and Tawah, and Venus was run aground and captured. The Federals dispatched six more gunboats from Paducah, Kentucky, and on November 3 they engaged in artillery duels with strong Confederate positions on either end of Reynoldsburg Island, near Johnsonville. The Federal fleet had difficulty attempting to subdue these positions and were occupied as Forrest prepared his force for the attack on Johnsonville.Wills, pp. 265‚Äì69. Battle Map of Johnsonville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On the evening of November 3, 1864, Forrest's artillerist, Capt. John Morton, positioned his guns across the river from the Federal supply base at Johnsonville. On the morning of November 4, Undine and the Confederate batteries were attacked by three Union gunboats from Johnsonville under U.S. Navy Lt. Edward M. King and by the six Paducah gunboats under Lt. Cmdr. LeRoy Fitch. Capt. Frank M. Gracey (a former steamboat captain now serving as a Confederate cavalryman) abandoned Undine, setting her on fire, which caused her ammunition magazine to explode, ending Forrest's brief career as a naval commander. Despite this loss, the Confederate land artillery was completely effective in neutralizing the threat of the Federal fleets. Fitch was reluctant to take his Paducah gunboats through the narrow channel between Reynoldsburg Island and the western bank, so limited himself to long-range fire. King withered under the Confederate fire, which hit one of his vessels 19 times, and returned to Johnsonville.Wills, pp. 268‚Äì70. Capt. Morton's guns bombarded the Union supply depot and the 28 steamboats and barges positioned at the wharf. All three of the Union gunboats‚ÄîKey West, Tawah, and Elfin‚Äîwere disabled or destroyed.Library of Congress- A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 ‚Äì 1875 The Union garrison commander ordered that the supply vessels be burned to prevent their capture by the Confederates. Forrest observed, \\"By night the wharf for nearly one mile up and down the river presented one solid sheet of flame. ... Having completed the work designed for the expedition, I moved my command six miles during the night by the light of the enemy's burning property.\\"Wills, pp. 270‚Äì73; Kennedy, p. 389. Aftermath Forrest caused enormous damage at very low cost. He reported only 2 men killed and 9 wounded. He described the Union losses as 4 gunboats, 14 transports, 20 barges, 26 pieces of artillery, $6,700,000 worth of property, and 150 prisoners. One Union officer described the monetary loss as about $2,200,000. An additional consequence of the raid was that the Union high command became increasingly nervous about Sherman's plan to move through Georgia instead of confronting Hood and Forrest directly. Forrest's command, delayed by heavy rains, proceeded to Perryville, Tennessee, and eventually reached Corinth, Mississippi, on November 10, 1864. During the raid, on November 3, Confederate theater commander Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard designated Forrest's cavalry for assignment to Hood's Army of Tennessee for the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign. Hood elected to delay his advance from Tuscumbia, Alabama, north into Tennessee, until Forrest was able to link up with him there on November 16.Wills, pp. 272‚Äì73; Sword, pp. 67‚Äì68; Nevin, p. 34; Eicher, p. 769; Kennedy, p. 389.

Nathan Bedford Forrest made a daring raid on Union-held Memphis, Tennessee, but it was not an attempt to capture the city, which was occupied by 6,000 Federal troops. The raid had three objectives: to capture three Union generals posted there; to release Southern prisoners from Irving Block Prison; and to cause the recall of Union forces from Northern Mississippi. Striking northwestward for Memphis with 2,000 cavalry, Forrest lost about a quarter of his strength because of exhausted horses. Surprise was essential. Taking advantage of a thick dawn fog and claiming to be a Union patrol returning with prisoners, the Confederates eliminated the sentries. Galloping through the streets and exchanging shots with other Union troops, the raiders split to pursue separate missions. One union general was not at his quarters. Another, General Cadwallader C.

Troops under Confederate cavalry commander Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest surprised and quickly overran a Federal hospital, the camps of several small Union units, and the jail and courthouse in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. All of the Union units surrendered to Forrest, and the Confederates destroyed much of the Union's supplies and destroyed railroad track in the area. The primary consequence of the raid was the diversion of Union forces from a drive on Chattanooga. Background On June 10, 1862, Union Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, commanding the Army of the Ohio, started a leisurely advance toward Chattanooga. Brig. Gen. James S. Negley and his force threatened the city on June 7-8\\\\. In response to the threat, the Confederate government sent Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest to Chattanooga to organize a cavalry brigade. By July, Confederate cavalry under the command of Forrest and Colonel John Hunt Morgan were raiding into Middle Tennessee and Kentucky. Forrest left Chattanooga on July 9 with two cavalry regiments and joined other units on the way, bringing the total force to about 1,400 men. The major objective was to strike Murfreesboro, an important Union supply center on the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad, at dawn on July 13. Battle The Murfreesboro garrison was camped in three locations around town and included detachments from four units comprising infantry, cavalry, and artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas Turpin Crittenden, who had just arrived on July 12. Between 4:15 and 4:30 a.m. on the morning of July 13, Forrest's cavalry surprised the Union pickets on the Woodbury Pike, east of Murfreesboro, and quickly overran a Federal hospital and the camp of a detachment from the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment. Additional Confederate troops attacked the camps of the other Union commands and the jail and courthouse. By late afternoon all of the Union units had surrendered to Forrest. Aftermath The Confederates destroyed much of the Union supplies and tore up railroad track in the area, but the main result of the raid was the diversion of Union forces from a drive on Chattanooga. This raid, along with Morgan's raid into Kentucky, made possible Bragg's concentration of forces at Chattanooga and his early September invasion of Kentucky. The next action at Murfreesboro was the more prominent Battle of Stones River (known as the Battle of Murfreesboro in the South), fought December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863.

Background Union Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis, while encamped at Mossy Creek and forward towards Talbott's Station, received a report on the night of December 28, 1863, that a brigade of Confederate cavalry had gone into camp that afternoon near Dandridge south of Mossy Creek. Surmising that the enemy force was split, Sturgis decided to meet, defeat, and possibly capture the encamped enemy cavalry. To accomplish this, he ordered a portion of his troops out of Mossy Creek and Talbott's Station toward Dandridge. After these forces had departed, Maj. Gen. William T. Martin, commander of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's Confederate cavalry, encamped at Panther Creek near Morristown, attacked the small Federal force at Talbott's Station at 9:00 a.m. on December 29. Battle Map of Mossy Creek Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Federals slowly fell back to Mossy Creek and Sturgis sent messages to his subordinates on the way to Dandridge to return promptly if they found no enemy there. The Confederates advanced on Mossy Creek, driving the Federals in front of them. Finding no enemy forces in Dandridge, the Union troops hastily returned to Mossy Creek and joined the battle. Around 3:00 p.m. the Federals began driving the Confederates back out of Mossy Creek towards Talbott's Station and Panther Creek. By dark, the Confederates were back to their original location at Panther Creek. Union pursuit was not mounted that night, but as it was late in the season, Martin chose to retreat from the area back towards Morristown for the winter. After the victory at Mossy Creek, the Union held the line about Talbott's Station for some time. The battle lasted about seven hours, and approximately 500 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded. References 2\\\\.

On December 4, Bate's division attacked Blockhouse No. 7 protecting the railroad crossing at Overall's Creek, but Union forces fought it off. On the morning of December 5, Forrest marched toward Murfreesboro in two columns, one to attack the fort on the hill and the other to take Blockhouse No. 4, both at La Vergne. Forrest demanded the garrisons at both locations surrender, which they did. Outside La Vergne, Forrest joined Bate's division and the command advanced on to Murfreesboro along two roads, driving the Union forces into their Fortress Rosecrans fortifications, then encamped in the city outskirts for the night.

Battle Map of Parker's Cross Roads Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Dunham's and Forrest's march routes brought them into contact at Parker's Crossroads on December 31, 1862. Skirmishing began about 9:00 a.m., with Forrest taking an initial position along a wooded ridge northwest of Dunham at the intersection. Confederate artillery gained an early advantage. Dunham pulled his brigade back a half mile and redeployed, facing north. His Federals repelled frontal feints until attacked on both flanks and rear by Forrest's mounted and dismounted troops. During a lull, Forrest sent Dunham a demand for an unconditional surrender. Dunham refused and was preparing for Forrest's next attack when Fuller's Union brigade arrived from the north and surprised the Confederates with an attack on their rear; Confederate security detachments had failed to warn of Fuller's approach. \\"Charge 'em both ways,\\" ordered Forrest. The Confederates briefly reversed front, repelled Fuller, then rushed past Dunham's demoralized force and withdrew south to Lexington, Tennessee. Aftermath After the fight, Forrest was able to cross the Tennessee River. Both sides claimed this battle as a victory, but the Confederate claims appear to have more credence.

The Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood, attacked a Union force under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield as it retreated from Columbia through Spring Hill. Because of a series of command failures, the Confederates were unable to inflict serious damage on the Federals and could not prevent their safe passage north to Franklin during the night. The next day, Hood pursued Schofield and attacked his fortifications in the Battle of Franklin, resulting in severe Confederate casualties. Background Following his defeat in the Atlanta Campaign, Hood had hoped to lure Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman into battle by disrupting his supply lines from Chattanooga to Atlanta. After a brief period in which he pursued Hood, Sherman elected instead to conduct his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, Georgia. He left forces under the command of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, the commander of the Army of the Cumberland, to defend Tennessee and defeat Hood: principally the IV Corps from the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley, and the XXIII Corps from the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Schofield.Jacobson, p. 41; McPherson, p. 179. Hood moved through northern Alabama and concentrated his army at Florence from October 30 to November 21, waiting for supplies and to link up with his newly assigned cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Rather than attempting to pursue Sherman through Georgia, Hood decided to execute a new plan: move north into Tennessee, defeat Thomas's army before it could concentrate, seize the important manufacturing center of Nashville, and continue north into Kentucky, possibly as far as the Ohio River. From this point, he could travel east to Virginia to join up with Gen. Robert E. Lee at Petersburg. His theater commander, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, urged Hood to take immediate action in an attempt to distract Sherman's advance, emphasizing the importance of moving before Thomas could consolidate his forces.McPherson, p. 180; Jacobson, pp. 44‚Äì47; Sword, pp. 68, 72‚Äì73; Nevin, p. 82. The Army of Tennessee marched north from Florence on November 21 in three columns: Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham's corps on the left, Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's in the center, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart's on the right, all screened aggressively by Forrest's cavalry. Schofield, who commanded Stanley's corps as well as his own, retreated in the face of this advance, marching rapidly north from Pulaski to Columbia. The Federals were able to reach Columbia and erect fortifications just hours before the Confederates arrived.Sword, pp. 84, 89, 91; Nevin, pp. 82‚Äì83; Jacobson, pp. 53, 55; Welcher, p. 586; McPherson, p. 180. On November 24‚Äì29, the \\"Battle of Columbia\\" was a series of skirmishes and artillery bombardments against Columbia. On November 28, Thomas directed Schofield to begin preparations for a withdrawal north to Franklin. He was expecting (incorrectly) that Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith's XVI Corps arrival from Missouri was imminent and he wanted the combined force to defend against Hood on the line of the Harpeth River at Franklin instead of the Duck River at Columbia. Schofield sent his 800-wagon supply train out in front, guarded by part of the IV Corps division of Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner. On the same day, Hood sent the three cavalry divisions under Nathan Bedford Forrest miles east of Columbia, where they crossed the river and headed north.McPherson, p. 182. On November 29 Hood sent Cheatham's and Stewart's corps on a flanking march north, crossing the Duck River at Davis's Ford east of Columbia while two divisions of Lee's corps and most of the army's artillery remained on the southern bank to deceive Schofield into thinking a general assault was planned against Columbia. Hood, riding near the head of the column with Cheatham's corps, planned to interpose his army between Schofield and Thomas, hoping to defeat Schofield as the Federals retreated north from Columbia. Stewart's corps followed Cheatham, and they were followed by the division of Maj. Gen. Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson (Lee's corps). The rest of Lee's corps remained south of Columbia, demonstrating with artillery fire against Schofield's men north of the Duck.Jacobson, pp. 72‚Äì75; Eicher, p. 770; McPherson, p. 182; Welcher, p. 588; Nevin, p. 88. Cavalry skirmishing between Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson's Union cavalry and Forrest's Confederate troopers continued throughout the day as the Confederates advanced. Forrest's wide turning movement with 4,000 troopers had forced Wilson north to Hurt's Corner, preventing the Union horsemen from interfering with Hood's infantry advance. By 10 a.m. on November 29, Forrest ordered his men to turn west toward Spring Hill. Wilson sent multiple messages to Schofield warning of Hood's advance, but it was not until dawn on November 29 that Schofield believed the reports, understood the deception represented by Lee's artillery bombardment, and realized the predicament he was in. He sent Stanley north with the IV Corps division of Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball, the remainder of Wagner's division, and the bulk of the Federal reserve artillery. Their mission initially was to protect the trains, but also to hold the crossroads at Spring Hill to allow the entire army to withdraw safely to Franklin.Jacobson, pp. 72‚Äì75; McPherson, p. 182; Welcher, p. 588; Nevin, p. 89. Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Battle thumbupright=1.5Actions at Spring Hill, afternoon, November 29, 1864 Forrest's cavalrymen approached Spring Hill on the Mount Carmel Road and at about 11:30 a.m. ran into pickets from the IV Corps. Stanley had moved north rapidly and formed up positions with Wagner's division that protected the village of Spring Hill on three sides. To the northwest of the village, the lines of Col. Emerson Opdycke's brigade protected the enormous supply trains, Brig. Gen. Luther P. Bradley's brigade. Lane's brigade rushed forward and pushed back the dismounted cavalrymen, primarily Brig. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong's Mississippi brigade. Forrest received a message from Hood to hold the position at all hazards until the infantry could arrive. Maj. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne's division of Cheatham's corps arrived midafternoon on Forrest's left. The cavalrymen, low on ammunition, pulled out of the line and moved north to be ready to cover a further advance of Hood's army, or to block Schofield's withdrawal.Jacobson, pp. 88‚Äì96; McPherson, pp. 182‚Äì83; Welcher, p. 589. Forrest's men moved south and he directed the brigade of Brig. Gen. Tyree H. Bell of Chalmer's division to drive off what he thought was a small force of cavalry from a knoll south of McCutcheon's Creek. They were actually engaging with Bradley's brigade, which drove them back immediately with heavy artillery support. The chastened Forrest remarked, \\"They was in there sure enough, wasn't they, Chalmers?\\"Sword, pp. 121‚Äì22; Jacobson, p. 95. The first command miscommunication of the battle took place upon Hood's arrival as he established his headquarters at the Absalom Thompson house, \\"Oaklawn\\". Cheatham had ordered his division under Maj. Gen. William B. Bate to move against Spring Hill in concert with Cleburne, forming up on the Irishman's left. Hood then personally ordered Bate to move towards the Columbia Pike and \\"sweep toward Columbia.\\" Neither Bate nor Hood bothered to inform Cheatham of this change in orders. Bate's men advanced about 3,000 yards in battle formation before they reached the pike, a journey taking over two hours. At about 5:30 p.m., his lead element, sharpshooters under Maj. Thomas D. Caswell, fired on a Federal column approaching from their left‚ÄîMaj. Gen. Thomas H. Ruger's division of the XXIII Corps, the vanguard of Schofield's main body. But before the two divisions could engage in battle, an officer from Cheatham's staff arrived to insist that Bate follow Cheatham's original orders and join Cleburne's attack. Late that night, Bate reported the contact with the Federal column, but Cheatham discounted the importance of the encounter.McPherson, p. 183; Connelly, p. 496; Jacobson, pp. 102, 122‚Äì24; Welcher, pp. 589‚Äì90; Sword, pp. 136‚Äì37. Back in Columbia, Schofield became convinced at about 3 p.m. that the Confederates would not attack him there and at 3:30 he joined two brigades from Ruger's division on the march to Spring Hill. He ordered his remaining force to remain until dark and then join him on the march north. As soon as Schofield departed, Stephen D. Lee coincidentally began an attack against the Union position, although he had considerable difficulty deploying pontoon bridges for the river crossing. By the time the bulk of his two divisions were able to cross, the senior Union commander left behind at Columbia, Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, began his withdrawal and the final troops departed up the Franklin Pike by 10 p.m.Sword, pp. 140‚Äì44; Jacobson, pp. 102‚Äì03, 137‚Äì38; Welcher, pp. 590‚Äì91; Nevin, p. 93. Cleburne's 3,000 men began an en echelon attack against Bradley's brigade at about 4 p.m. From right to left, his brigades were led by Brig. Gens. Mark P. Lowrey, Daniel C. Govan, and Hiram B. Granbury. Bell's cavalry brigade supported on the right, although they remained low on ammunition and had little effect in the fight. Whereas Cheatham was expecting Cleburne to drive north into Spring Hill, Hood's intention was to use this formation to sweep toward the turnpike and wheel left to intercept Schofield's arriving units, but he apparently had not observed the location of the Union positions south of the town. The stairstep echelon formation was therefore less effective against Bradley's fortified position on their right and front, allowing only Lowrey's brigade to engage them initially. After Lowrey requested assistance, Cleburne personally led Govan's Arkansas brigade forward, wheeling them into a northern alignment against Bradley's right flank. The attack by Govan and Lowrey outflanked Bradley and his men fled in disorder. Cleburne's two brigades chased them vigorously, and they were stopped short of the turnpike only by heavy fire from the IV Corps artillery, placed earlier by Stanley on a knoll north of the creek.Jacobson, pp. 105‚Äì15; Sword, pp. 126‚Äì31; Kennedy, p. 394; Nevin, p. 92; McPherson, p. 183; Connelly, pp. 495‚Äì96. By this time, Cheatham's division under Maj. Gen. John C. Brown (Cheatham's own division before he assumed corps command) had crossed Rutherford Creek and was moved into position by Cheatham for another attack on Spring Hill, on Cleburne's right. In the gathering darkness, the sounds of Brown's guns would be the signal for Cleburne's men to resume their attack. Brown did not attack, however. His brigade commander on the right, Brig. Gen. Otho F. Strahl, reported that there were Union troops in position on his right flank and front and that Forrest's cavalrymen, promised to protect his right flank, did not seem to be present. Since his brigade under Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist had not yet arrived to join the attack, Brown decided to consult with his corps commander before proceeding.Connelly, pp. 496‚Äì97; Sword, pp. 133‚Äì34; Jacobson, pp. 117‚Äì21; Welcher, p. 590; Nevin, p. 92; McPherson, p. 183. Positions at Spring Hill after dark Cheatham was at that time attempting to find Bate and steer him into the combined attack. Brown sent two staff officers to find Cheatham and halted his troops while he awaited a decision. By the time Cheatham and Brown were able to speak, at around 6:15 p.m., the battlefield was in total darkness, and the two officers decided that an assault conducted then without knowing the condition of their right flank might be a disaster. Cheatham rode off to Hood's headquarters to consult with the army commander. Hood was furious that the attack had not proceeded as he intended and that the pike was still open. Cheatham said that he needed assistance from Stewart to protect his right flank, so Hood dispatched a staff officer to find Stewart. Having been up since 3 a.m., Hood was by this time very fatigued. He indulged in a large dinner at Oaklawn, which included considerable \\"toasting\\" of drinks, and went to bed at 9 p.m., confident that whatever setbacks his army had suffered during the day, they would be able to correct them in the morning and bag Schofield.Sword, pp. 132‚Äì36; Jacobson, pp. 128‚Äì36. Earlier in the afternoon, Hood had brought up Stewart's corps across Rutherford Creek and directed him to move north of Spring Hill and cut off the Federal column. After taking a wrong turn, Stewart ended up at Forrest's headquarters at the Caldwell house. There he conferred with Forrest about the positions of the army, when suddenly one of Cheatham's staff officers arrived and directed in Hood's name that Stewart's corps move to support Brown's attack. After Stewart's column retraced its route, he arrived at Brown's command post, but was confused about the apparent disagreement in orders he was receiving, so he traveled back to Hood's headquarters for clarification. He informed Hood that because his men were tired and had been on the move since daylight‚Äîit was now 11 p.m.‚Äîhe had ordered them to bivouac while they waited. Hood accepted the situation and told Stewart to head in the direction of Franklin in the morning after the men had rested.Jacobson pp. 130‚Äì36; Connelly, pp. 497‚Äì500; Sword, pp. 135‚Äì39; Nevin, p. 93; Welcher, p. 590; McPherson, pp. 183‚Äì84. Aftermath The Battle of Spring Hill was a minor affair in terms of casualties‚Äîabout 350 Union and 500 Confederate‚Äîbut the result of miscommunication and simply bad military management was that during the night all of Schofield's command, including Cox, passed from Columbia through Spring Hill while the Confederate commanders slept. The passage of the army did not go unnoticed by some of the soldiers, but no concerted effort was made to block the pike. Brig. Gen. Lawrence S. Ross's cavalry brigade attempted to block the passage of the supply trains north of Spring Hill, at Thompson's Station, but accompanying Federal infantry drove them off. A private soldier woke up the commanding general at 2 a.m. and reported he saw the Union column moving north, but Hood did nothing beyond sending a dispatch to Cheatham to fire on passing traffic.Sword, pp. 152‚Äì55; Connelly, p. 500; Nevin, pp. 95‚Äì96; McPherson, p. 185; Eicher, p. 771. By 6:00 a.m. on November 30, all of Schofield's army was well north of Spring Hill and its vanguard had reached Franklin, where it began to build breastworks south of town. In the morning Hood discovered Schofield's escape, and after an angry conference with his subordinate commanders in which he blamed all but himself for the failure, ordered his army to resume its pursuit, setting up the disastrous Battle of Franklin that afternoon.Eicher, p. 771; Sword, p. 152; Kennedy, p. 395. Spring Hill had been, arguably, Hood's best chance to isolate and defeat the Union army (Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, argues that the importance of Spring Hill has been overblown and that Schofield had three alternative routes to either Franklin or Nashville.) Recriminations for the lost opportunity soon began flying. Rumors circulated about Brown being drunk, but they were never substantiated and he was later elected governor of Tennessee. Hood believed that Cheatham was most responsible, although he also had criticism for two of Cheatham's division commanders, Cleburne and Brown. His official report said, \\"Major-General Cheatham was ordered to attack the enemy at once vigorously and get possession of the pike, and, although these orders were frequently and earnestly repeated, he made but a feeble and partial attack, failing to reach the point indicated.\\" Historians Thomas L. Connelly, Eric Jacobson, and Wiley Sword have each assigned blame to both Hood and Cheatham.Connelly, p. 501; Sword, pp. 152‚Äì55; Jacobson, pp. 173‚Äì79. A variety of theories about Hood's personal failures have occupied historians for years. One of the more persistent is that the general was debilitated from ingesting laudanum in the evening, attempting to relieve the pain and irritation to his amputated leg by the long, damp ride over rough roads that day. Eric Jacobson's book, For Cause & for Country, lists many authors who have supported this story, but he states that \\"there is no evidence that Hood took any sort of drugs, or even alcohol, at Spring Hill.\\"McPherson, p. 185; Jacobson, p. 150.

In a period of relative inactivity following the Battle of Stones River, a reinforced Union infantry brigade, under Col. John Coburn, left Franklin to reconnoiter south toward Columbia. Four miles from Spring Hill, Coburn attacked with his right wing, a Confederate Army force composed of two regiments; he was repelled. Then, Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn seized the initiative. Brig. Gen.

Out of ammunition and surrounded, Coburn surrendered, along with all but two of his field officers. Union influence in Middle Tennessee subsided for a while. Van Dorn and Forrest received help with their victory from an unlikely participant. Miss Alice Thompson, age 17 at the time, was visiting the residence of Lieutenant Banks.

A Union force had seized Brown's Ferry on the Tennessee River, opening a supply line to the Union army in Chattanooga. Confederate forces attempted to dislodge the Union force defending the ferry and again close this supply line but were defeated. Wauhatchie was one of the few night battles of the Civil War. Background After their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga, Union forces under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. Bragg's troops occupied Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, both of which had excellent views of the city, the river, and the Union's supply lines. Confederate troops launched raids on all supply wagons heading toward Chattanooga, which made it necessary for the Union to find another way to feed their men. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant relieved Rosecrans of his command and replaced him with Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas. Grant's first priority upon reaching Chattanooga was to resupply the Union army.McDonough, pp. 13, 47, 49. =Brown's Ferry operation= Grant and Thomas initiated the \\"Cracker Line Operation\\" on October 26, 1863. It was designed to open the road to Chattanooga from Brown's Ferry on the Tennessee River with a simultaneous advance up Lookout Valley, securing the Kelley's Ferry Road. Brig. Gen. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith, Chief Engineer of the Military Division of the Mississippi, who conceived the overall Cracker Line plan, was assigned the task of establishing the Brown's Ferry bridgehead. He was assigned two infantry brigades from the 3rd Division, XIV Corps, to accomplish this: the 1st Brigade under Brig. Gen. John B. Turchin and the 2nd under Brig. Gen. William B. Hazen.McDonough, pp. 75‚Äì76. At 3:00 a.m. on October 27, portions of Hazen's brigade embarked upon pontoons and floated around Moccasin Bend to Brown's Ferry. Turchin's brigade took a position on Moccasin Bend across from Brown's Ferry. Upon landing, Hazen secured the bridgehead and then positioned a pontoon bridge across the river, allowing Turchin to cross and take position on his right.Sword, pp. 119-120. Col. William C. Oates of the 15th Alabama guarded the valley with his regiment plus elements of other units. Due to a command mixup, Oates did not know where three reserve regiments were positioned. After the Union surprise landing, Oates attempted a counterattack with his scratch force, but it failed after he was seriously wounded. By the time Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law turned up with the reserve regiments, it was too late; the Federals were too numerous and well entrenched.Cozzens, pp. 63-65. =Hooker's advance= Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker marched with three Union divisions from Bridgeport by following the railroad via Shellmound and the Running Water Creek gorge. On October 28, after a rapid march, Hooker's column entered Lookout Valley to the astonishment of Generals Braxton Bragg and James Longstreet, who were having a conference on Lookout Mountain. Longstreet, obsessed with the possibility of a Union attack further to the southwest, had failed to properly scout Hooker's advance.Cozzens, pp. 69-71. Hooker, while his force passed through Lookout Valley on October 28, detached Brig. Gen. John W. Geary's division at Wauhatchie Station, a stop on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, to protect the line of communications to the southwest as well as the road west to Kelley's Ferry.

Noting that a wagon train had stopped near Wauhatchie, Longstreet determined to crush Geary's force. He ordered Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins's division to mount a night attack on the Union forces. While Law took his own and Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's brigades to block Hooker from reinforcing Geary, Jenkins's own 1,800-manBoatner, p. 896. South Carolina brigade, led by Col. John Bratton, would assault Wauhatchie Station. Law had Brig. Gen. Henry Benning's brigade remain in support for both Law's and Bratton's efforts. Although the attack was scheduled for 10:00 p.m. on the night of October 28, confusion delayed it until midnight. Though Geary and his officers expected an attack and had thrown out pickets, its suddenness took them by surprise. Enveloped from the north by Bratton, the Union defenders formed into a V-shaped battle line, facing north and east. Geary's son, an artillery lieutenant, was killed in the battle, dying in his father's arms.Cozzens, pp. 78-85. Hearing the sounds of battle, the XI Corps quickly fell into ranks near Brown's Ferry. Hooker bypassed Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard in the chain of command and ordered Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz to march to Wauhatchie Station as reinforcements. In the confusion, Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr got his division on the road first. Col. Orland Smith's brigade of Steinwehr's division was fired on by Law's Confederates, who were positioned on a high hill that dominated the road from Brown's Ferry. Smith veered to the east and began climbing the hill. Meanwhile, Hooker mistakenly deployed units from both XI Corps divisions against Law and Benning, leaving no one to go to Geary's aid. Though Law's 2,000 men were greatly outnumbered by Hooker's force, the hilltop position was naturally strong. In the darkness, the only unit in direct contact with Law was Smith's 700-man brigade. Several vigorous assaults by Smith were repulsed. Then, after Law received some erroneous reports, he decided to pull back. Just as his men left their entrenchments, Smith's men spilled over them, capturing some stragglers and scattering a regiment that had failed to get the order to retreat. Meanwhile, Hooker agreed to let Howard proceed to Wauhatchie with some cavalry.Cozzens, pp. 91-97. Geary's men continued to hold fast, though they began to run low on ammunition. Just as Bratton began to sense victory, he received a note to retreat since Union reinforcements were arriving at his rear. Bratton withdrew to Lookout Mountain, successfully covered by Benning's brigade. In the Wauhatchie fight, Bratton lost 356 men, while Geary's casualties numbered 216.Cozzens, p. 100. Aftermath A rumor circulated through the Union camps that Union mules stampeded by the fight had made the Confederates believe they were being attacked by cavalry, causing the Southern retreat; the Union soldiers joked that the mules be \\"breveted as horses\\".Korn, p. 95. In truth, the Hampton Legion was disordered by the mules for only a short time. However, this lull allowed the 137th New York to plug a gap in the Federal line.Cozzens, p. 88. Union losses in the battle were 78 killed, 327 wounded, and 15 missing. The Confederates reported their losses as 34 killed, 305 wounded, and 69 missing. One account says Bratton lost 408 men while Law lost only 52. Geary reported burying 153 Confederates and capturing over one hundred prisoners, so the Confederate losses may have been over 900 men.Furqueror, p. 40. The Union army now had its window to the outside and could receive supplies, weapons, ammunition, and reinforcements via the Cracker Line. The way was clear for the start of the Battles for Chattanooga on November 23. NotesReferences * Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. .

A Union force under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock began destroying part of the Petersburg Railroad, which was a vital supply line for Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate army in Petersburg, Virginia. Lee sent a force under Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill to challenge Hancock and the Confederates were able to rout the Union troops from their fortifications at Reams Station. However, they lost a key portion of the railroad, causing further logistical difficulties for the remainder of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign. Background As the siege of Petersburg began to take hold, Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant continued to look for ways to sever the railroad links supplying the city of Petersburg, Virginia, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's army, and the Confederate capital of Richmond. One of these critical supply lines was the Petersburg Railroad, also called the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, which led south to Weldon, North Carolina, and connected to the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad which led to the Confederacy's only remaining major port, Wilmington, North Carolina. In the Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road (June 21‚Äì23, 1864), Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps was able to destroy a short segment of the Weldon before being driven off by the Third Corps of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.Trudeau, pp. 160‚Äì64; Salmon, p. 424. In the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18‚Äì21), Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren's V Corps with reinforcements from the IX Corps destroyed miles of track and withstood strong attacks from Confederate troops under Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard and Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill. This Union victory forced the Confederates to carry their supplies by wagon to bypass the new Union lines that were extended farther to the south and west. However, this was not yet a critical problem for the Confederates. A member of Lee's staff wrote, \\"Whilst we are inconvenienced, no material harm is done us.\\"Davis, p. 104. General Grant wanted the Petersburg Railroad closed permanently, destroying of track from Warren's position near Globe Tavern as far south as Rowanty Creek (about north of the town of Stony Creek). He assigned the operation to Hancock's II Corps, which was in the process of moving south from their operation north of the James River at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom. He chose Hancock's corps because Warren was busy extending the fortifications at Globe Tavern, although his selection was of troops exhausted from their efforts north of the James and their forced march south without rest; Hancock himself continued to suffer lingering effects from his wounds at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Grant augmented Hancock's corps with the cavalry division of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg.Trudeau, pp. 176‚Äì77; Horn, p. 141; Salmon, p. 426; Davis, p. 104. Gregg's division departed on August 22 and, after driving off Confederate pickets, they and the II Corps infantry division commanded by Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles (replacing Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, who was on leave) destroyed the railroad tracks to within of Reams Station.Located at the currently unincorporated community of Reams, Virginia, south of Petersburg, this railroad station is referred to variously as Reams, Ream's, and Reams's Station. Early on August 23, Hancock's other division, commanded by Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, occupied Reams Station, taking up positions in earthworks that had been constructed by the Union cavalry during the Wilson-Kautz Raid in June. The earthworks were constructed in a partial ellipse with an opening facing to the east, and although they had degraded and were partially filled with water, Hancock's men made little effort to improve them.Horn, p. 141; Trudeau, pp. 178‚Äì79, 182; Kennedy, p. 360; Salmon, p. 427; Davis, pp. 105‚Äì07, describes the earthworks as three sides of a square, each side roughly long. Robert E. Lee considered that the Union troops at Reams Station represented not only a threat to his supply line, but also to the county seat of Dinwiddie County; if Dinwiddie Court House were to fall, the Confederates would be forced to evacuate both Petersburg and Richmond because it represented a key point on the army's potential retreat route. He also saw an opportunity‚Äîthat he could impose a stinging defeat on the Union Army not long before the presidential election in November. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill to take the overall command of an expedition that included two cavalry divisions of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton's cavalry, Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's division, part of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, and part of Maj. Gen. William Mahone's division, about 8‚Äì10,000 men in all. Hill, who was suffering from one of his periodic bouts of illness, assigned Heth to tactical command, telling him he \\"must carry the position.Trudeau, pp. 179, 181‚Äì86; Salmon, p. 428; Davis, p. x; Horn, p. 141. Hancock arrived personally at Reams Station on August 24 and by that evening the Union troops had destroyed track for south of the station. On the morning of August 25 they left their earthworks to start working on the remaining of track, but Hancock recalled them when he heard that Confederate cavalry was approaching.Salmon, p. 428; Trudeau, pp. 181‚Äì82. Opposing forcesUnionConfederate=Battle After the Confederate cavalry pushed back Gregg's cavalry, Hill's column advanced down the Dinwiddie Stage Road. Wilcox's three infantry brigades assaulted the Union position at about 2 p.m. on August 25. Despite launching two attacks, Wilcox was driven back by Miles's division, which was manning the northern part of the earthworks. To the south, Gibbon's division was blocking the advance of Hampton's cavalry, which had swept around the Union line.Horn, pp. 141‚Äì42; Trudeau, pp. 183‚Äì85; Calkins, np.; Kennedy, p. 360-62; Davis, pp. 105‚Äì07. While these two attacks were going on, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, commander of the Army of the Potomac and in temporary overall command while Grant was ill, became concerned that Lee was attempting to turn the left flank of the Union army. Historian John Horn wrote that if Grant had been on the scene, he might have very well ordered an attack on Petersburg at this point, similar to the tactic he would use in April 1865 that caused the fall of the city, taking advantage of the weakly defended lines vacated by the heavy force that Lee had sent to Reams Station. Meade, however, cautiously assumed a defensive stance and rushed reinforcements to his flank, thinning his own lines. The only point that Meade did not reinforce was the sector commanded by his trusty subordinate Hancock, assuming that Hancock would hold the line with his existing resources.Horn, pp. 142‚Äì44; Trudeau, pp. 185‚Äì86. Confederate reinforcements from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived while the Confederate artillery under Col. William Pegram softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30 p.m. by six brigades against Miles's position and it broke through the northwest corner of the Union fortifications; although the Union defensive fire was fierce enough to keep the Confederates at bay, suddenly two Union regiments panicked and bolted for the rear, opening a gap. Miles ordered his reserve brigade under Col. Horace Rugg to close the gap, but to his astonishment, Rugg's men fell prone and refused to open fire. Heth personally led the charge through the earthworks, tussling with Sgt. Thomas Minton of the 26th North Carolina about who would carry the colors forward.Trudeau, pp. 186‚Äì88; Davis, p. 108; Salmon, p. 428; Calkins, np.; Kennedy, p. 360-62. Hancock desperately galloped from one threatened point to the next, attempting to rally his men. At one point his horse dropped from under him and, assuming that it had been killed, Hancock proceeded on foot. The horse later jumped to its feet, having been temporarily paralyzed by a glancing blow to the spine, and Hancock remounted. He shouted, \\"We can beat them yet. Don't leave me, for God's sake!\\" As he witnessed the men of his once proud corps reluctant to retake their positions from the enemy, he remarked to a colonel, \\"I do not care to die, but I pray God I may never leave this field.\\"Davis, p. 108; Trudeau, p. 188. By this time, Hampton's cavalry was making progress against Gibbon's infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon's men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time to allow for an orderly Union withdrawal to Petersburg after dark.Salmon, p. 428; Horn, pp. 148‚Äì50; Calkins, np.; Kennedy, p. 360-62; Trudeau, p. 188; Davis, p. 109. Aftermath Union casualties were 2,747 (the II Corps lost 117 killed, 439 wounded, 2,046 missing/captured; the cavalry lost 145); Confederate casualties were 814 (Hampton's cavalry lost 16 killed, 75 wounded, 3 missing; Hill's infantry 720 total). Although the Confederates had won a clear victory, they had lost a vital piece of the Petersburg Railroad and from this point on they would be able to transport supplies by rail only as far north as Stony Creek Depot, south of Petersburg. From that point, supplies had to be unloaded and wagon trains would have to travel through Dinwiddie Court House and then on the Boydton Plank Road to get the supplies into Petersburg. The South Side Railroad was the only railroad left to supply Petersburg and Lee's army.Trudeau, p. 190; Calkins, np.; Kennedy, p. 362. Grant and Meade were generally satisfied with the results of their operations against the Petersburg Railroad, despite the tactical setback suffered by Hancock.Davis, p. 110. Meade wrote, The siege of Petersburg and its trench warfare continued. The next major combat would be seen in late September as two Union attacks proceeded in parallel: at New Market Heights, north of the James (the Battle of Chaffin's Farm), and south at the Battle of Peebles' Farm, against the South Side Railroad.Salmon, pp. 429‚Äì36.

It never reached the other two cities in its name, although it did have branch lines extending to Dunnville and Port Maitland. History TH&B; system map, circa 1908. TH&B; tracks marked in red. The railway was originally chartered in 1884 by the Ontario Legislative Assembly to run from Toronto to the International Railway Bridge, connecting with local lines to Buffalo. The original charter forbade the company any attempt to merge with, lease from, sell to, or pool with any other railway. Given the business conditions at the time, this turned out to be an impossible condition. The original corporation was unable to complete the line before the original charter expired, so the government revived the act, requiring the line to be completed by 1894, with a new group of promoters. It began operations in 1892, when it took over the incomplete line of the Brantford, Waterloo & Lake Erie Railway between Brantford and Waterford. The line reached Hamilton in October, 1894 and Welland on December 30, 1895. In 1895, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the New York Central Railroad bought the TH&B.; TH&B; locomotive No. 22 with crew, circa 1900-1910. The TH&B; was jointly owned by the CPR and the NYC for several decades. NYC and its subsidiaries (Michigan Central Railroad and Canada Southern Railway) owned 73%, while the CPR owned the other 27%. It never built into Toronto or Buffalo, but used its parent companies' trackage to reach the two cities. Passenger service on the TH&B; was discontinued on April 26, 1981 when Amtrak's Maple Leaf began service. In 1977, CP Rail acquired NYC's portion (at that point part of the bankrupt Penn Central giving the CPR 90% ownership and destined not to be included in Conrail) which held a 10% ownership, The CPR merged the TH&B; into its system in 1987. While the TH&B; line between Hamilton and Welland is still in use, its former line west of Hamilton to Waterford via Brantford has been abandoned past Aberdeen Avenue in Hamilton. The portion between Hamilton and Brantford was abandoned in the 1990s after trackage next to the Grand River was washed out. Some former TH&B; industrial trackage still remains in the city of Brantford, although it is now operated by Canadian National Railway. Increased operating costs, and tighter profit margins in that decade meant the future of the railroad was much in doubt. The TH&B; Railway was merged into the Canadian Pacific Railway on January 1, 1987. A portion of the branch of the former TH&B; railroad (CP's Dunnville Spur, built by the TH&B; in 1914), running from Smithville to Port Maitland via Dunnville, was abandoned on May 7, 2001, when the Port Maitland Turn made its final run between Smithville and E & O on that line. Trains were redirected onto the former NYC CASO subdivision, at Welland, to the remainder of the Dunnville spur, via a new connecting track. Paint scheme The railroad's yellow and black paint scheme started being applied to boxcars in early 1952, and was later applied to cabooses in 1954. These colours were chosen in honour of the local Hamilton Tiger-Cats football team. Railway stations Former TH&B; Hamilton station, now Hamilton GO Centre The TH&B;'s second train station in Hamilton, built in 1932-33, was in fact the first building in Canada adhering to the International Style. The station was refurbished in 1996 and is now used by GO Transit for both bus and train service as the Hamilton GO Centre. The TH&B;'s Brantford station has been converted to use as a restaurant and has carried several names since the first one opened in 1970. The TH&B;'s Smithville station, built 1903, was restored in 1996, and is now the headquarters of the West Lincoln Historical Society. It is open seasonally as a tourist information centre. The TH&B;'s Jerseyville station is now at the Westfield Heritage Village near Rockton, Ontario, along with preserved TH&B; steam locomotive #103. Perce Hankinson Perce Hankinson, who began his railway career in 1917 with the Michigan Central Railroad (MCR) realized a lifelong dream when made Vice-President and General Manager of the TH&B; on June 7, 1965. He retired 5 years later after 53 years of working for the railroad only to return to the TH&B; the next year and spend another 16 years on the Board of Directors. Hankinson retired from the board June 2, 1987, at the age of 85 after 68 years of railway service. In 2001, Perce Hankinson was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category of \\"Local: Railway Workers & Builders.\\" Diesel locomotives TH&B; car undergoing restoration in St. Jacobs, Ontario Caboose on display at Roundhouse Park in Toronto The TH&B; was one of the first railways in Canada to fully dieselize. Starting in January 1948, the railway purchased four NW2 diesel switchers from General Motors Electro-Motive Division. These locomotives were numbered 51-54. In the fall of 1950 the TH&B; received an order of four GP7 road switchers built by GMD in London. These GP7s were the first Canadian- built \\"Geeps\\", and were numbered 71-74. In December 1950 the TH&B; took a second group from GMD for four SW9 switchers. With its switcher fleet complete the TH&B; looked to add to its freight Geeps. In the summer of 1953 the final three GP7s were purchased from GMD, and numbered 75-77. Still needing to commit motive power to the locomotive pool for through Toronto-Buffalo passenger service, the TH&B; purchased three GP9s. These three locomotives were delivered in early 1954, and numbered 401-403. This completed the railway's diesel fleet, and the TH&B; did not purchase any new motive power for the remainder of its operating years. Cultural references In his song \\"Under a Stormy Sky\\" (from the 1989 album Acadie), Quebec-born singer, songwriter and producer Daniel Lanois pays homage to the presence of TH&B; locomotives during his youth: \\"I hear the T.H.& B. the diesel turning, calling you and me to the city of steel, smokestack - spinning wheel come with me Bebette, oui under the stormy sky\\" See also *Hamilton‚ÄìBrantford‚ÄìCambridge Trails ReferencesExternal links * Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway Historical Society * (http://www.canrailvideo.ca) Canrail Video Productions * The North America Railway Hall of Fame Category:Railway companies established in 1884 Category:Canadian Pacific Railway subsidiaries Category:Companies affiliated with the New York Central Railroad Category:History of Hamilton, Ontario Category:Rail transport in Brantford Category:Transport in Hamilton, Ontario Category:Predecessors of the Canadian Pacific Railway ","title":"Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway"},{"id":"1615934","text":"Hopfgarten can refer to: * Hopfgarten, Thuringia, a municipality of Weimarer Land, Germany * Hopfgarten im Brixental, in the district of Kitzb√ºhel, Tyrol, Austria * Hopfgarten in Defereggen, in the district of Lienz, Tyrol, Austria ","title":"Hopfgarten"},{"id":"1615947","text":"The Major BBS (sometimes MajorBBS or MBBS) was bulletin board software (a bulletin board system server) developed between 1986 and 1999 by Galacticomm. In 1995 it was renamed Worldgroup Server and bundled with a user client interface program named Worldgroup Manager for Microsoft Windows. Originally DOS-based, two of the versions were also available as a Unix-based edition, and the last versions were also available for Windows NT-based servers. Galacticomm headquarters (4101 S.W. 47 Ave., Suite 101, Fort Lauderdale, FL) in August 1994 Galacticomm logo Worldgroup logo History The Major BBS was developed by Tim Stryker and launched in 1986 by Stryker's company, Galacticomm, Inc., as a demonstration of the abilities of the Galacticomm Software Breakthrough Library (or GSBL). The GSBL was a powerful set of assembler routines written for IBM and compatible PCs that allowed up to 32 simultaneous serial port or dialup connections to a single software instance without the need for an external multitasker. The \\"breakthrough\\" was that the library polled the serial ports, rather than allowing them to interrupt the processor, which was the against the accepted wisdom of the time, and through use of polling and making use of the FIFO buffers that were by this time standard on UART chips, an - at the time - unheard of number of serial ports could be attached to a PC. Because interrupts were not used, there were no issues relating to interrupt conflicts on PC hardware of the day. The GSBL was licensed to developers for varied uses, such as communications systems, bank systems, and real estate systems. Eventually, The Major BBS was enhanced enough that it became a marketable product in its own right. By late 1987, Galacticomm was licensing more copies of The Major BBS than the GSBL by itself. The GSBL continued to be enhanced, expanding to 64 users by 1988, then 256 by 1992, with The Major BBS's line capacity expanding as a result. Because it was one of the few multi-line bulletin board systems, MBBS software was known for fostering online communities and an interactive online experience where users were able to interact with each other via Teleconference (chat rooms) and multiplayer games. This flexibility spawned a small industry of Independent Software Vendors (ISV) who began developing MBBS add-ons, which ranged from shopping malls (what would now be called shopping cart software) to online role playing games. The Major BBS allowed incoming connections via modems on telephone lines, IPX networks, and X.25 packet-switched networks. In the mid-1990s, the offering expanded to include TCP/IP by the ISV Vircom, a Canadian company that has since become well known for its anti-spam/anti-virus software, shortly followed by Galacticomm's own TCP/IP add-on, the Internet Connection Option (ICO), which was derived from another ISV's offering. In 1992, the Major BBS was selected by the National Library of Medicine as the access mechanism for the Grateful Med medical journal system, just prior to universal access via the World Wide Web. =Worldgroup= Seeking to compete with America Online, Galacticomm extended The Major BBS software to communicate in a client‚Äìserver model with a custom program. The MBBS software was renamed Worldgroup Server, and released in 1995 with the version number restarting at 1.0; the included user-side client software was named Worldgroup Manager (but sometimes known as Worldgroup Client) and ran in Microsoft Windows. As version 3.0 in 1997, the first 32-bit version of Worldgroup Server was released for Windows NT, and other versions were simultaneously continued. This release finally focused on an active HTML web community, after three years of concentrating on the original client‚Äìserver strategy. The DOS version of the server was discontinued with version 3.1. =Demise= Although Worldgroup initially had some success, the initial proprietary client/server model was an unfortunate strategic choice, as the world wide web was just emerging as a dominant phenomenon. The popularity of the text-terminal-based BBSes, as well as America Online's proprietary client model, faded as online use became web-oriented. Galacticomm's slow response in adapting to the web- based online model probably was fatal. Founder Tim Stryker committed suicide on August 6, 1996, in Colorado, and the company was sold by his widow Christine to a group headed by Yannick Tessier, owner of Tessier Technologies, who developed software as an ISV. As Galacticomm Technologies, Inc., Tessier and Peter Berg led the company toward an initial public offering, which failed in 1998. The company discontinued operations in 1999 and was foreclosed upon by their primary lender; the lender acquired the company's assets through the foreclosure in 2002. The company's assets were purchased by an ISV from the bank in 2005.

It has about 11,000 inhabitants. Doma≈ælice is also a Municipality with Extended Competence and a Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority within the same borders. History Doma≈ælice was first recorded as a town in 1231, when P≈ôemysl Otakar II of Bohemia ordered the city to be fortified for the purpose of protecting the border with Bavaria. It would remain fortified from 1262 to 1265. Border guards were recruited from the Chodov√© (Slavic free farmers) who settled in the vicinity of Doma≈ælice. The city was mortgaged to Bavaria in 1331, lasting until 1419 (with some interruptions). Under Hussite rule, German citizens were expelled from the city, and since then, the population has been predominantly Czech. In 1431, Prokop the Bald defeated the crusaders of the Holy Roman Empire near Doma≈ælice. The 15th and 16th century saw Doma≈ælice change hands frequently, but its importance diminished following the end of the Thirty Years' War. It was not until 1770 that it recovered, largely due to innovations in the textile industry. Until 1918 the town was part of the Austrian monarchy, finding itself on the Austrian side of the Austro-Hungarian internal frontier following the 1867 \\"Ausgleich\\" (compromise). It was the district capital of the district with the same name, being one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften (district capitals) in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 Within the context of the Czech National Revival, Doma≈ælice became a central place during the 19th century. At the time, it was the most western ethnic Czech town, very close to the border with the Kingdom of Bavaria. In the city, a pilgrimage took place on August 13, 1939, which developed into a large Czech protest demonstration against the German occupation and control of the ethnic Czech Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The German population was expelled in 1945 according to the Potsdam Agreement. In 2005 a mass grave was discovered on the outskirts of the town, holding 54 Germans, mainly members of the local SA, executed by the Czech resistance after the end of the war, around May 8, 1945.

The site of the battle was Midtskogen farm, situated approximately west of the town of Elverum at the mouth of the √òsterdalen valley in southern Norway. The invading German troops aimed to capture King Haakon VII and his cabinet, thereby forcing Norway into submission. After a short battle, the German force withdrew, having lost its commander in the fighting.Minnestund p√• Midtskogen (H√¶rstaben)  Background  On 9 April 1940 Nazi-Germany launched Operation Weser√ºbung, the code name for the assault and subsequent occupation of Denmark and Norway. Invading several major Norwegian cities by sea, the Germans planned to capture King Haakon VII and the Norwegian Cabinet, which they believed would then lead to an immediate surrender of all Norwegian forces. While the invasion was successful in most areas, the German fleet sailing towards Oslo was temporarily forced to withdraw after the heavy cruiser Bl√ºcher was sunk by fire from Oscarborg fortress at Dr√∏bak. This gave the Norwegian royal family and members of government time to flee to Hamar, and later Elverum. A small party of German Fallschirmj√§ger, under the command of military attach√© Hauptmann Eberhard Spiller, were sent after them in commandered Norwegian civilian vehicles. Opposing forces The Norwegian defenders were a mixed group of hastily mustered volunteers and professional soldiers. About 20-30 Royal Guardsmen, from the 1st Guard Company were backed up by volunteers from Terningmoen military camp and a large group of members from local rifle clubs.H.M. Kongens Garde (Kongehuset) The Norwegians were mainly armed with Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen bolt-action rifles, as well as two Colt M/29 machine guns. The German party consisted of approximately 100-120 paratroopers travelling in a convoy of four buses, a captured army truck and Spiller's private car. Though somewhat numerically inferior the Germans were vastly superior in terms of both training and firepower, possessing numerous modern submachine guns, light machine guns and hand grenades.  Initial plan of defence  The Norwegian battle plan was to have one blockade at Sagstuen, about 1.5 km (0.9 mi) west of Terningmoen and another at Midtskogen another few kilometers further west. They planned to stop the German convoy at Midtskogen, forcing the Germans to continue on foot through the deep snow, before retreating to Sagstuen where they would hold off the attackers. The two machine guns were to focus their fire on the blockade, while the rifle companies would engage the Germans from the flanks. Battle The blockade at Midtskogen were created from stopped civilian cars, some forced off the road with others wedged between and behind them. Due to the unusually heavy traffic that night, the blockade became over a hundred meters long. At around 02:00 on 10 April the German vehicles crashed into the Norwegian roadblock. Because of the length of the blockade, the Germans were stopped further west than the Norwegians had originally planned. While the Norwegian flanking units were being redeployed, they came under heavy fire from the Germans. During the ensuing fire-fight the nearby barn at Midtskogen farm started to burn, after being hit by German illumination rounds, subsequently revealing the Norwegian defenders stationed at the farm. Unfortunately for the Norwegians, their two machine guns were unable to engage the Germans, due to the distance between their deployment and the fire-fight. It was not until the Germans started moving ahead of the blockade that they could open fire; however, due to cold temperatures, the machine guns initially refused to work. After frantic efforts the Norwegians managed to get one of the machine guns working, enabling them to give covering fire to the retreating Norwegian forces. The fire-fight continued until 03:00, ending with both forces pulling back. The Norwegians regrouped at Sagstuen, where they were reinforced by units from the Norwegian Military Academy. The Germans, with their commander Spiller badly wounded, realized their raid had failed and retreated to Oslo. Aftermath Memorial stone to commemorate the battle. \\"Here Norwegian forces stopped the enemy‚Ä≤s attempt at capturing the King, Crown Prince, parliament and cabinet\\". The casualties on both sides were relatively light. The Germans suffered five men killed in action and an unknown number of wounded. One of the German fatalities was their military attach√© Hauptmann Eberhard Spiller. Norwegian losses were three men wounded in action, with at least one being severely wounded. The retreat of the German forces gave the Norwegian Cabinet and royal family time to finish the Elverum Authorization, which allowed the Cabinet to temporarily assert absolute authority given that the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament) was no longer able to convene in ordinary session. It also gave them the opportunity to escape further from the invading forces. On 11 April the nearby town of Elverum was subjected to heavy bombing from German airplanes. While the action may have been small, it proved a major boost to Norwegian morale and resolve, which had been very low due to the early German successes in the Norwegian Campaign.  In popular culture  The battle of Midtskogen is featured in the Norwegian movie The King's Choice (2016).

Listed as the Paramount Theatre on the National Register of Historic Places, this theater is an important part of theater in Kentucky. History The Paramount Arts Center, at that time known as the Paramount Theater, was one of the first transitional theatres built for \\"talking pictures\\" and was to be a model theatre for others around the country to showcase films produced by Paramount Pictures. The Great Depression, however, soon changed the course of events for the theater, as Paramount had decided to do away with the project altogether. The plans were picked up by an Ashland- based company with Paramount craftsmen providing the interior furnishings - and the building was then leased to Paramount Publix Corporation. Because of the change in plans, the original design by Rapp and Rapp was scaled back by one third. Had the Depression not caused a redesign, the Paramount would be three times as large. In 2001, Mike Myers of Ashland reported that the original general contractor was Wade Gates of Ashland. Gates's secretary, Marie Duncan, provided this information.Paramount Arts Center History The Paramount first opened on September 5, 1931,Paramount to celebrate the big 8-0 and closed forty years later in 1971. In 1972, the Greater Ashland Foundation (Foundation for the Tri-State Community), was created. Under the leadership of Ashland Oil Inc. Foundation President Paul G. Blazer, Jr. (son of Ashland Oil & Refining Company founder Paul G. Blazer) one half of the corpus of the terminating Stuart M. Blazer [family] Foundation was gifted and used for the Greater Ashland Foundation's purchase of the Paramount Theatre and establishing it as a performing arts center. It opened that same year under the new name \\"Paramount Arts Center\\". The theater has undergone several renovations since 1972, most recently in 2002 when a new stagehouse was added and new dressing rooms, rehearsal space and banquet facility were added in a nearby building that was purchased in 1998. In addition, this renovated space was connected to the main building. The theater now operates as a non-profit organization, showing symphonies, Broadway plays, ballets and other productions. In addition, in 1992 the music video for the song \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\" by Billy Ray Cyrus was filmed here. 2006 water damage The Paramount Arts Center suffered major water damage in November 2006. It occurred when a beauty pageant contestant hung a dress from a water sprinkler while using a steamer to remove wrinkles. Heat from the steam set off the sprinkler system. Water poured from the second floor causing close to $30,000 US dollars in damage to the building.1 Haunting It is said that during early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there and the man's ghost has since haunted the Paramount. According to the story, in the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except one man, named Joe. When the other three returned, they are said to have found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. Allegedly, since that time, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and the image of a man has been seen to appear on occasion. Despite this, most versions of the story refer to Joe as a \\"good ghost\\"‚Äîone who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was at the Paramount filming his video for \\"Achy Breaky Heart,\\" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each woman put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers. As time passed and the walls in the box office became too full of 8x10's signed by other performers, the executive director felt that some of the pictures and posters needed to come down. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, the story has it that every 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered. Paramount Joe's poster still hangs in the Paramount, in part of The Marquee Room, which is now the site of Paramount Joe's Rising Star Caf√©. In 2004, marketing director Tyson Compton was giving a tour to some high school students. As he was relating the Paramount Joe story, he realized that he was always talking about Joe, and not to him. So as he spoke to the students, he stopped and called out, \\"Joe, are you here? Is it okay that I tell your story?\\" While he swears that he then heard a seat squeak, that is not the most chilling part of this story. Compton relates how he received a call the next day from a psychic who lived in the area. She asked him if someone in his family or a close friend had recently died because she had gotten a message from \\"the other side.\\" She said, \\"I'm supposed to tell you that Joe said he is here.\\" http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2NHP_Paramount_Arts_Center_Ashland_KY The Paramount Players The Paramount Players are a group of local actors that come together and audition for the various straight plays and musicals that are produced under the direction of Paramount Arts Center's Director of Education.

Her murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. During her lifetime, Maria, too young to become a Red Cross nurse like her elder sisters during World War I, was patroness of a hospital and instead visited wounded soldiers. Throughout her lifetime she was noted for her interest in the lives of the soldiers. The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and have a large family. She was an elder sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, whose alleged escape from the assassination of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years.Kurth (1983), p. xiv However, it was later proven that Anastasia did not escape. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Maria might have been the grand duchess whose remains were missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near Yekaterinburg, Russia and exhumed in 1991.Klier and Mingay (1995), p. 203 Further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918. A funeral for the remains of Maria and Alexei to be buried with their family in October 2015 was postponed indefinitely by the Russian Orthodox Church, which took custody of the remains in December and declared without explanation that the case required further study; the 44 partial bone fragments remain stored in a Russian state repository. Life and characteristics Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, and Maria Nikolaevna in an official portrait taken in 1901 Contemporaries described Maria as a pretty, flirtatious girl, broadly built and with the great strength of her grandfather Alexander III of Russia. She had light brown hair and large blue eyes that were known in the family as \\"Marie's saucers\\".Massie (1967), p. 133. Her French tutor Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and well-built, with rosy cheeks. Tatiana Botkina thought the expression in Maria's eyes was \\"soft and gentle\\".Kurth (1983), p. 138 As an infant and toddler, her physical appearance was compared to one of Botticelli's angels. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia nicknamed her \\"The Amiable Baby\\" because of her good nature. As a toddler, little Maria once escaped from her bath and ran naked up and down the palace corridor while her distracted Irish nurse, Margaretta Eagar, who loved politics, discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend. \\"Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus,\\" recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia.Massie (1967), p. 132 Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their \\"stepsister\\" because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, \\"I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child.\\" Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was \\"marked\\" and she often tried to escape from the nursery to \\"go to Papa\\". When the Tsar was ill with typhoid, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night. Maria's siblings were Grand Duchess Olga of Russia, Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. Maria's Russian title (Velikaya Knyazhna –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è –ö–Ω—è–∂–Ω–∞) is most precisely translated as \\"Grand Princess\\", meaning that Maria, as an \\"Imperial Highness\\" was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were \\"Royal Highnesses\\". \\"Grand Duchess\\" is the most widely used English translation of the title.Zeepvat (2004), p. xiv. However, in keeping with her parents' desire to raise Maria and her siblings simply, even servants addressed the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym, Maria Nikolaevna. She was also called by the French version of her name, \\"Marie\\", or by the Russian nicknames \\"Masha\\" or \\"Mashka\\". Maria and her younger sister Anastasia were known within the family as \\"The Little Pair\\". The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as \\"The Big Pair\\". The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname OTMA, which was derived from the first letters of their first names.Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), pp. 88‚Äì89 Maria and Anastasia were dressed similarly for special occasions, when they wore variations of the same dress.Massie (1967), p. 133 She tended to be dominated by her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her \\"fat little bow-wow\\". In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 337 Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy.Massie, p133 Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and \\"bellowed\\" at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from \\"Madame Becker\\".Mironenko and Maylunas (1997), p. 463 Grand Duchesses Maria and Tatiana in 1910 Young Maria enjoyed innocent flirtations with the young soldiers she encountered at the palace and on family holidays. She particularly loved children and, had she not been a Grand Duchess, would have loved nothing more than to marry a Russian soldier and raise a large family. Maria was fond of soldiers from a very early age, according to Margaretta Eagar: Until his own assassination in 1979, her first cousin, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, kept a photograph of Maria beside his bed in memory of the crush he had upon her.King and Wilson (2003), p. 49 Alexandra's letters reveal that Maria, the middle child of the family, sometimes felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved as much as the other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. \\"Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said,\\" Alexandra wrote to her on 6 December 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. \\"One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so.\\"Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 336 Maria, like all her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or \\"Baby\\", who suffered frequent complications of hemophilia and nearly died several times. Her mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering starets or \\"holy man\\" and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Maria and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as \\"Our Friend\\" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Maria's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. \\"All the children seemed to like him,\\" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. \\"They were completely at ease with him.\\"Massie (1967), pp. 199‚Äì200 Rasputin's friendship with the imperial children was evident in the messages he sent to them. \\"My Dear Pearl M!\\" Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. \\"Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss.\\" In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, \\"My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world.\\"Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 314 In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to \\"Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.\\"Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 321 Smiling Grand Duchess Maria, Finland, c. 1912 Grand Duchess Maria in 1913 Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana and Maria aboard the imperial yacht in 1914. Courtesy: Beinecke Library. One of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 because Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns. Tyutcheva wanted Rasputin barred from the nurseries. In response to Tyutcheva's complaints, Nicholas did ask Rasputin to end his nursery visits. \\"I am so afr(aid) that S.I. can speak ... about our friend something bad,\\" Maria's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910, after begging Alexandra to forgive her for doing something she didn't like. \\"I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.\\"Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 330 Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.Radzinsky (2000), p. 139 Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family, who were scandalized by the reports, though Rasputin's contacts with the children were by all accounts completely innocent.Massie (1967), p. 208 Nicholas's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote on 15 March 1910 that she couldn't understand \\"...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!) He's always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and caressing them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don't dare talk to her about him. It's all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.\\" Another of the nursery governesses claimed in the spring of 1910 that she was raped by Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova had at first been a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. The empress refused to believe Vishnyakova \\"and said that everything Rasputin does is holy\\". Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but \\"they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.\\" Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.Radzinsky (2000), pp. 129‚Äì130. It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses.Mager (1998), p. 257 Rasputin had released ardent letters written to him by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses. The letters circulated throughout society, fueling the rumors. Pornographic cartoons also circulated that depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background.Christopher et al. (1995), p. 115. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.Christopher et al. (1995), p. 116 Despite the scandal, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on 17 December 1916. \\"Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed,\\" Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 489 In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared \\"cold and visibly terribly upset\\" by Rasputin's death and sat \\"huddled up closely together\\" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 507 Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by Maria, her sisters, and mother. Maria attended Rasputin's funeral on 21 December 1916 and her family planned to build a church over his grave site.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 511 Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, c. 1915 Maria, like her mother, was likely a carrier of the hemophilia gene and might have passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, as well as one of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother.Vorres (1965), p. 115. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy.Zeepvat, p. 175 DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria. Like her younger sister Anastasia, Maria visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital on the grounds of the palace at Tsarskoye Selo during World War I. The two teenagers, who were too young to become nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of checkers and billiards with the soldiers and attempted to uplift their spirits. A wounded soldier named Dmitri signed Maria's commonplace book and addressed her by one of her nicknames: \\"the famous Mandrifolie\\".Kurth (1983), p. 417. During the war, Maria and Anastasia also paid a visit to a nurses' school and helped to tend to the children. She wrote her father that she thought of him when she was feeding the children and cleaned the gruel running down their chins with a spoon.Bokhanov et al. (1993), p. 125 For a break during the war, Maria, her sisters and mother sometimes visited the Tsar and Tsarevich Alexei at the war headquarters in Mogilev. During these visits, Maria developed an attraction to Nikolai Dmitrievich Demenkov, an officer of the day at the Tsar's Headquarters. When the women returned to Tsarskoye Selo, Maria often asked her father to give her regards to Demenkov and sometimes jokingly signed her letters to the Tsar \\"Mrs. Demenkov\\".Bokhanov et al., p. 125 Revolution and captivity Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia in a formal portrait taken in 1916 Revolution broke out in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her siblings were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of 13 March 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died. She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover. The family was arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria attempted to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk that she would be happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously.Christopher et al. (1995), p. 180 Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned most of their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 613 None of Anastasia's diaries survived, but several of Maria's are still in existence. Also in April 1918, Nicholas and Alexandra were summoned for a trial in Moscow and wanted one of their daughters to go with them. It's unknown whether it was ever intended for the Romanovs to actually reach Moscow, or whether the Ural Soviet's interception of their train was unplanned. The girls decided amongst themselves that Maria would go with their parents. Olga was too emotionally unstable to be of much help, level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over their ill brother, and Anastasia was considered too young. The rest of the children were left behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill with a severe hemophilia attack after which he would never walk again. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later. In her letters to her siblings in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease at the new restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they would be subject to further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. \\"Oh, how complicated everything is now,\\" she wrote on 2 May 1918. \\"We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again.\\"Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 618 Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she \\"was a girl who loved to have fun\\". Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur.King and Wilson (2003), p. 238 One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in \\"severe and angry whispers\\", apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, \\"We're so bored! In Tobolsk there was always something to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!\\" The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.King and Wilson (2003), p. 240. In his memoirs, one guard recalled that on one occasion another guard forgot himself and told an off-color joke to the grand duchesses during one of these meetings. The offended Tatiana ran from the room, \\"pale as death\\". Maria eyed the man and said, \\"Why are you not disgusted with yourselves when you use such shameful words? Do you imagine that you can woo a well-born woman with such witticisms and have her be well disposed towards you? Be refined and respectable men and then we can get along.\\"King and Wilson (2003), p. 242 Ivan Kleschev, a 21-year-old guard, declared that he intended to marry one of the grand duchesses and if her parents said no he would rescue her from the Ipatiev House himself.King and Wilson (2003), p. 243 From left to right, Grand Duchesses Maria, Olga, Anastasia, and Tatiana Nikolaevna in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo in spring 1917 It has been alleged by Greg King and Penny Wilson that Ivan Skorokhodov, yet another of the guards, smuggled in a birthday cake to celebrate Maria's nineteenth birthday on 26 June 1918. They continued in their claim that Maria slipped away from the group with Ivan Skorokhodov for a private moment and they were discovered together in a compromising position when two of his superiors conducted a surprise inspection of the house. They further alleged Shorokhodov was removed from his position after his actions and friendliness towards the grand duchess were discovered by his commanding officers and that several guards reported that both the Tsarina and her older sister Olga appeared angry with Maria in the days following the incident and that Olga avoided her company.King and Wilson (2003), pp. 242‚Äì247 However, the claim has been contested by Helen Azar and George Hawkins (based on information provided by Margarita Nelipa), who dismiss the story as a myth being based in \\"absolutely no first-hand evidence\\".Azar and Hawkins (2019), pp. 231‚Äì232. The authors' note that the story seems to originate from proven unreliable accounts of the executioner Peter Ermakov. Shorokhodov, in fact, left the Ipatiev House due to \\"illness and hospitalization rather than dismissal\\". They further report that any minor violation by the guards would result in being imprisoned in a local jail, adding to the unlikeness of the story. Moreover, Azar and Hawkins note there isn't evidence of Alexandra and Olga being angry with Maria, reporting the myth stems from a misconstrued passage in the Yurovsky note. The original note, in place of an alleged implication that an \\"imperial soul\\" needed passage for inappropriate behavior, reports that the Deacon actually said \\"This is what happened before and not with such important people. If one messed it up, it can cause a scandal, but in this situation, we can sort it out in good spirit.\\" This was in response to Yurovky telling the Deacon that he could perform service but not converse with the imperial family. Consequently, the passage cited by King and Wilson as evidence of Maria being shunned is based on nothing more \\"than perhaps faulty translation in the original publication that referenced the alleged incident\\".Azar and Hawkins (2019), pp. 231‚Äì232. On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Maria and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead.King and Wilson, p. 276 The following day, on 15 July, Maria and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was \\"tumbled and disorderly\\". They boasted that Maria was so strong she could lift Alexei and told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House.Rappaport, The Last Days of the Romanovs, p. 172 On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Maria walked in the garden with her father and sisters and the guards observed nothing unusual in the family's spirits. As the family was eating dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him along with the rest of the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence, which came after five other members of their detachment had already been sent away. Dr. Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated them by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.Rappaport, The Last Days of the Romanovs, p. 180. Death Late that night, on the night of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms carrying pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. Anastasia carried one of the family's three dogs, a King Charles Spaniel named Jimmy. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family \\"Well, we're going to get out of this place.\\" They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Maria and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Maria and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.Rappaport, The Last Days of the Romanovs, pp. 184‚Äì189 The first volley of gunfire killed the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded the family's doctor and the empress' maidservant. Maria tried to escape through the doors at the rear of the room, which led to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise as she rattled the doors attracted the attention of the drunken military commissar Peter Ermakov. A heavy layer of smoke had accumulated in the room from the gunfire and from plaster dust released from the walls by errant bullets, and the gunmen could see only the lower bodies of those who were still alive. Ermakov fired at Maria, and his bullet struck her in the thigh. She fell to the floor with Anastasia and Demidova and lay there moaning. The assassins then left the room for several minutes to let the haze clear, and when they returned they killed Dr Botkin, Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. Ermakov then turned on the wounded Maria and Anastasia, who was still unharmed. He struggled with Maria and tried to stab her with a bayonet. The jewels sewn into her clothes protected her, and he said he finally shot her in the head. But the skull that is almost certainly Maria's has no bullet wound. Perhaps the drunken Ermakov inflicted a scalp wound, knocking her unconscious and producing a considerable flow of blood, leading Ermakov to think he had killed her. He then struggled with Anastasia, whom he also claimed he shot in the head. As the bodies were being removed from the house, Maria and/or Anastasia regained consciousness and screamed. Ermakov tried to stab her again but failed, and struck her in the face until she was silent. The facial area of Maria's skull was indeed destroyed, but Yurovsky wrote that the victims' faces were shattered with rifle butts at the burial site. Though Maria unquestionably died with her family, the exact cause of her death remains a mystery.King and Wilson (2003), pp. 303‚Äì310, 434. Claims of survival Grand Duchess Maria in 1915 For decades (until all the bodies were found and identified, see below) conspiracy theorists suggested that one or more of the family somehow survived the slaughter. Several people claimed to be surviving members of the Romanov family following the assassinations. According to the conspiracists, there may have been an opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a supposed survivor(s). Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.King and Wilson (2003), p. 314 At least two of the Grand Duchesses were speculated to have survived the initial attack on the Imperial Family. Two of the Grand Duchesses, Maria and Anastasia, \\"sat up screaming\\" when they were being carried out to a waiting truck. They were then attacked again.King and Wilson (2003), p. 470 There were claims made that Maria survived. A man named Alex Brimeyer claimed to be Maria's grandson \\"Prince Alexis d'Anjou de Bourbon-Cond√© Romanov-Dolgoruky\\". He said Maria had escaped to Romania, married and had a daughter, Olga-Beata. Olga-Beata then allegedly married and had a son named \\"Prince Alexis\\". Brimeyer was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a Belgian court after he was sued in 1971 by the Dolgoruky family and the Association of Descendants of the Russian Nobility of Belgium.Massie (1995), p. 148 Two young women who claimed to be Maria and her sister Anastasia were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919, where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.Massie (1995), p. 146 As late as 2004, Gabriel Louis Duval wrote a book, A Princess in the Family, claiming that his foster grandmother \\"Granny Alina\\" might have been the Grand Duchess Maria. According to Duval, Granny Alina married a man named Frank and emigrated to South Africa. She later lived with his family before dying in 1969. Her body was exhumed, but DNA was too degraded to be useful in determining whether she shared DNA with the imperial family. Most historians continued (later proven right) to discount the claims that Maria or any other member of the family survived the killings. Romanov graves and DNA proof In 1991, bodies believed to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found. Once the grave was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the grave held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave.Massie (1995), p. 67 Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.Massie (1995), p. 67. A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.King and Wilson (2003), p. 251 Grand Duchess Maria wearing a kimono-style dressing gown c. 1915 American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7 inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing.King and Wilson (2003), p. 434. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists. The mitochondrial DNA from the skeletons was compared against mitochondrial DNA from relatives of the imperial family in the maternal line of descent, including the Tsarina's great-nephew Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and was found to be a match. Scientists believed that the matching DNA was enough to identify the remains of the Imperial Family and their servants. The \\"Yurovsky Note\\", a report filed by commander Yakov Yurovsky with his superiors following the murders, stated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area.Radzinsky (1992), pp. 380‚Äì393 If the Whites ever discovered the grave, Yurovsky believed they would doubt the grave belonged to the Tsar and his retinue because the body count would be incorrect. Some forensic experts believe the complete burning of two bodies in so short a time would have been impossible given the environment and materials possessed by Yurovsky and his men.King and Wilson, p. 468 Initial searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.King and Wilson (2003), p. 469. However, on 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty- three years old. Maria was nineteen years, one month old at the time of the assassinations while her sister Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was less than a month shy of his fourteenth birthday. Maria's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassinations. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \\"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber\\". The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Preliminary testing indicated a \\"high degree of probability\\" that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on 22 January 2008. The testing began in late December 2007. On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing proves that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to a young woman the Russians continue to identify as Maria. Eduard Rossel, governor of the region 900 miles east of Moscow, said tests done by a U.S. laboratory had identified the shards as those of Alexei and Maria. In March 2009, results of the DNA testing were published, confirming that the two bodies discovered in 2007 were those of Tsarevich Alexei and one of the four Grand Duchesses. \\"This has confirmed that indeed it is the children,\\" he said. \\"We have now found the entire family.\\" On 11 September 2015, it was announced that the remains of Maria and Alexei, which had been in storage in the state archives for 8 years, were to be buried alongside their family on 18 October 2015. However, the Russian Government has given the Russian Orthodox Church permission to do one last DNA test of the two Romanov children against DNA from a blood stained cloth from their great- grandfather Emperor Alexander II, who was killed by a bomb, and their aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna. Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse) were exhumed from their tombs in September 2015 to confirm links to other relatives. This test was done so the Church and a branch of the Romanov line could set aside their doubts. The burial of what now are considered to be Maria's and Alexei's remains, to be with those of the family, was planned for 2015 but has been delayed mainly due to the insistence of the Russian Orthodox Church on more DNA-testing. Sainthood :For more information, see Romanov sainthood In 2000, Maria and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were murdered.

The Mardaites were early Christians following either Miaphysitism or Monothelitism and bear a possible, but unconfirmed, relation to the Maronites. Little is known about their ethnicity, but it has been speculated that they might have been Persians (see, for a purely linguistic hypothesis, the Amardi, located south of the Caspian sea in classical times) or Armenians, yet other sources claim them to have been native to the Levant or possibly even from the Arabian peninsula. Their other Arabic name, al-JarƒÅjimah, suggests that some were natives of the town Jurjum in Cilicia; however the name also exists in Arabic and translates to \\"Sick\\" or \\"Insane\\" as is the case with the word \\"Mareed\\", due to their fierce fighting style and retaliation against attacks. They were joined later by various escaped slaves and peasants during their insurgency and were said to have claimed territory from \\"the Holy City\\" to the \\"Black Mountain\\" (Nur Mountains).  History  According to some historians, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the Mardaites gained a semi-independent status around the Nur Mountains within al- øAwƒÅ·π£im, the Byzantine-Arab border region. They initially agreed to serve as mercenaries for the Arabs and to guard the Amanian Gate, but their loyalty was intermittent and they often sided with the Byzantine Empire as their agenda varied. According to Greek and Syriac historians, their territory stretched from the Amanus to the \\"holy city\\", the latter often identified as Jerusalem, although more likely to refer to Cyrrhus, also called Hagioupolis, the capital of Cyrrhestica, in upper Syria. Their numbers were swelled by thousands of runaway slaves, making them an ethnically diverse group. In light of this, it is claimed that they forced Muawiyah I, Caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, to pay tribute to the Byzantine emperor Constantine IV, or possibly to them instead. Emperor Justinian II sent the Mardaites again to raid Syria in 688/9; this time they were joined by native peasants and slaves and were able to advance as far as Lebanon. The Umayyads were compelled to sign another treaty by which they paid the Byzantines half the tribute of Cyprus, Armenia and the Kingdom of Iberia in the Caucasus Mountains; in return, Justinian relocated around 12,000 Mardaites to the southern coast of Anatolia, as well as parts of Greece such as Epirus and the Peloponnese, as part of his measures to restore population and manpower to areas depleted by earlier conflicts. There they were conscripted as rowers and marines in the Byzantine navy for several centuries. Others however remained behind and continued raiding Muslim-held territories until their chief stronghold fell to Umayyad prince-general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik in 708. Maslama(h) then resettled them throughout Syria, and although he allowed them to retain their faith, he conscripted them into his army. Describing the abna' of Yemen, Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani states in his Kitab al-Aghani that, up to his time (10th century), these people were called \\"ban≈´ al-a·∏•rƒÅr () in Sanaa, al-abnƒÅ æ in Yemen, al-a·∏•ƒÅmira () in Kufa, al-asƒÅwira () in Basra, al-kha·∏çƒÅrima () in al-Jazira, and al-jarƒÅjima () in Bilad al-Sham\\".  The Maronites  Many Maronites claim that the modern Maronites are of Mardaite ancestry, and oral tradition is said to indicate this. However, documented evidence is sporadic at best as the Maronites sources are recent due to their lack of a thorough recorded history beyond the 16th century, leaving the matter open for debate among historians. That being said, Maronite oral tradition does mirror much of the history of the Mardaites and it is possible that the similarities are superficial and the groups are similar, but unrelated. In reality there is no way to prove or disprove this connection due to the lack of a thorough recorded history, but oral traditions are unlikely to have been falsified in isolated mountain communities. Many attribute the view that the Maronites are unrelated to the Mardaites due to early historic bias, when the West favored the Druze until the pogroms of Syria in the 19th century which resulted in the death of 50,000 Maronites and other Christians at the hands of the Druze as a reprisal for Maronite peasantry and Maronite church attempts to topple their feudal lords in the South of Mount Lebanon. This term was adopted by the Marada Movement during the Lebanese Civil War as the movement claims descent from the Mardaite warriors. See also *Marada Movement  Notes References * * Phares, Walid.

The company was founded in about 1920 by its namesake in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. History Founded at Bradford by Edward Exley about 1920, the products were initially locomotives, in live steam, clockwork and electrically powered, in gauges 0 and 1, which were made to order. By the 1930s, 0 gauge coaches had joined the range of products, probably Exley's most successful line. In the later 1930s high quality 00 gauge coaching stock was added to feed a growing market in this new scale. By 1952 Edward Exley (Sales) Ltd had moved to Baslow in Derbyshire and Edward Exley had resigned as a Director of the Sales Company in July 1955. Locomotives were made available after the war, mainly to order, but in the late 1950s Edward Exley sold the loco construction part of the business to Stanley Beeson, who had made locos for a number of Exley clients. Coaches were listed until 1962 when there was a terrible fire which destroyed the Bradford premises and most of the tools. At this point Edward Exley decided to retire. The company at Baslow continued to offer coaches but discontinued the 00 gauge range as the manufacturing facility was lost in the fire. The 0 gauge models were listed as available until January 1995, but were in fact being made by outside workers to order. Because of the premium nature of Exley's products, they tend to be well preserved, and many examples survive today. They are highly collectible and good examples of 0 gauge coaches often change hands at auction for hundreds of pounds. The company is still in existence, although it is not currently trading. Most recently it has acted as a restoration company for existing Exley models and as a point of contact for technical queries.

The test examines interaction between sperm and mucus of the cervix. The PCT, or Sims‚ÄìHuhner test, examines sperm survival in cervical mucus and determines whether sperm are migrating into the female reproductive system. It does not predict whether pregnancy can occur. The test is performed after 2 days of sexual abstinence and 1 to 2 days before ovulation, when estrogen-stimulated cervical mucus is abundant. Basal body temperatures or the midcycle Luteinizing hormone surge may be used to determine the timing of the PCT. Mucus is withdrawn from the endocervical canal within 8 hours of coitus and examined. The presence of any forwardly motile sperm in alkaline mucus suggests adequate coital technique and a normal cervical mucus‚Äìsperm interaction. Procedure The PCT is scheduled close to ovulation when mucus is abundant, and the infertile couple is asked to have sexual intercourse, preferably in early hours of morning. Several hours later (usually 2), the woman is examined by the physician. The mucus is aspirated from cervical canal and spread on a glass slide. Smear from posterior fornix is used as control. 10-50 motile sperms per high power field are considered normal. Rotatory or shaky motion of sperms indicates presence of antispermal antibody. Cervical mucus is examined for quality, viscosity and fern test.Padubidri; Daftary (2011). Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology, 15e. p. 204. A poor PCT may indicate sperm or mucus problems, including perhaps presence of immune factors that inactivate sperm. Also ovulatory problems and poor coital technique may affect the PCT. The test is useless in presence of cervical infection. With the application of principles of evidence-based medicine the role of the PCT has been questioned and its use has become controversial.Pavone ME, Hirshfeld-Cytron JE, Kazer RR, 'The progressive simplification of the infertility evaluation.'

The medically relevant complaints reported by the patient or others familiar with the patient are referred to as symptoms, in contrast with clinical signs, which are ascertained by direct examination on the part of medical personnel. Most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken. Medical histories vary in their depth and focus. For example, an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details, such as name, history of presenting complaint, allergies, etc. In contrast, a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth, as many details about the patient's life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness. The information obtained in this way, together with the physical examination, enables the physician and other health professionals to form a diagnosis and treatment plan. If a diagnosis cannot be made, a provisional diagnosis may be formulated, and other possibilities (the differential diagnoses) may be added, listed in order of likelihood by convention. The treatment plan may then include further investigations to clarify the diagnosis. The method by which doctors gather information about a patient‚Äôs past and present medical condition in order to make informed clinical decisions is called the history and physical (a.k.a. the H&P;). The history requires that a clinician be skilled in asking appropriate and relevant questions that can provide them with some insight as to what the patient may be experiencing. The standardized format for the history starts with the chief concern (why is the patient in the clinic or hospital?) followed by the history of present illness (to characterize the nature of the symptom(s) or concern(s)), the past medical history, the past surgical history, the family history, the social history, their medications, their allergies, and a review of systems (where a comprehensive inquiry of symptoms potentially affecting the rest of the body is briefly performed to ensure nothing serious has been missed). After all of the important history questions have been asked, a focused physical exam (meaning one that only involves what is relevant to the chief concern) is usually done. Based on the information obtained from the H&P;, lab and imaging tests are ordered and medical or surgical treatment is administered as necessary. Process right A practitioner typically asks questions to obtain the following information about the patient: * Identification and demographics: name, age, height, weight. * The \\"chief complaint (CC)\\" ‚Äì the major health problem or concern, and its time course (e.g. chest pain for past 4 hours). * History of the present illness (HPI) ‚Äì details about the complaints, enumerated in the CC (also often called history of presenting complaint or HPC). * Past medical history (PMH) (including major illnesses, any previous surgery/operations (sometimes distinguished as past surgical history or PSH), any current ongoing illness, e.g. diabetes). * Review of systems (ROS) Systematic questioning about different organ systems * Family diseases ‚Äì especially those relevant to the patient's chief complaint. * Childhood diseases ‚Äì this is very important in pediatrics. * Social history (medicine) ‚Äì including living arrangements, occupation, marital status, number of children, drug use (including tobacco, alcohol, other recreational drug use), recent foreign travel, and exposure to environmental pathogens through recreational activities or pets. * Regular and acute medications (including those prescribed by doctors, and others obtained over-the-counter or alternative medicine) * Allergies ‚Äì to medications, food, latex, and other environmental factors * Sexual history, obstetric/gynecological history, and so on, as appropriate. * Conclusion & closure History-taking may be comprehensive history taking (a fixed and extensive set of questions are asked, as practiced only by health care students such as medical students, physician assistant students, or nurse practitioner students) or iterative hypothesis testing (questions are limited and adapted to rule in or out likely diagnoses based on information already obtained, as practiced by busy clinicians). Computerized history-taking could be an integral part of clinical decision support systems. A follow-up procedure is initiated at the onset of the illness to record details of future progress and results after treatment or discharge. This is known as a catamnesis in medical terms. Review of systems Whatever system a specific condition may seem restricted to, all the other systems are usually reviewed in a comprehensive history. The review of systems often includes all the main systems in the body that may provide an opportunity to mention symptoms or concerns that the individual may have failed to mention in the history. Health care professionals may structure the review of systems as follows: * Cardiovascular system (chest pain, dyspnea, ankle swelling, palpitations) are the most important symptoms and you can ask for a brief description for each of the positive symptoms. * Respiratory system (cough, haemoptysis, epistaxis, wheezing, pain localized to the chest that might increase with inspiration or expiration). * Gastrointestinal system (change in weight, flatulence and heartburn, dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, vomiting, bowel habit). * Genitourinary system (frequency in urination, pain with micturition (dysuria), urine color, any urethral discharge, altered bladder control like urgency in urination or incontinence, menstruation and sexual activity). * Nervous system (Headache, loss of consciousness, dizziness and vertigo, speech and related functions like reading and writing skills and memory). * Cranial nerves symptoms (Vision (amaurosis), diplopia, facial numbness, deafness, oropharyngeal dysphagia, limb motor or sensory symptoms and loss of coordination). * Endocrine system (weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, increased appetite (polyphagia) and irritability). * Musculoskeletal system (any bone or joint pain accompanied by joint swelling or tenderness, aggravating and relieving factors for the pain and any positive family history for joint disease). * Skin (any skin rash, recent change in cosmetics and the use of sunscreen creams when exposed to sun). Inhibiting factors Factors that inhibit taking a proper medical history include a physical inability of the patient to communicate with the physician, such as unconsciousness and communication disorders. In such cases, it may be necessary to record such information that may be gained from other people who know the patient. In medical terms this is known as a heteroanamnesis, or collateral history, in contrast to a self-reporting anamnesis. Medical history taking may also be impaired by various factors impeding a proper doctor-patient relationship, such as transitions to physicians that are unfamiliar to the patient. History taking of issues related to sexual or reproductive medicine may be inhibited by a reluctance of the patient to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the patient's mind, he or she often doesn't start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or reproductive health. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.  Computer-assisted history taking  Computer-assisted history taking systems have been available since the 1960s. However, their use remains variable across healthcare delivery systems. One advantage of using computerized systems as an auxiliary or even primary source of medically related information is that patients may be less susceptible to social desirability bias. For example, patients may be more likely to report that they have engaged in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Another advantage of using computerized systems is that they allow easy and high-fidelity portability to a patient's electronic medical record. Also an advantage is that it saves money and paper. One disadvantage of many computerized medical history systems is that they cannot detect non-verbal communication, which may be useful for elucidating anxieties and treatment plans. Another disadvantage is that people may feel less comfortable communicating with a computer as opposed to a human. In a sexual history-taking setting in Australia using a computer-assisted self-interview, 51% of people were very comfortable with it, 35% were comfortable with it, and 14% were either uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with it. The evidence for or against computer-assisted history taking systems is sparse. As of 2011, there were no randomized control trials comparing computer-assisted versus traditional oral-and-written family history taking to identifying patients with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Early life When Paisley was two-years-old, his father left the family. He was raised by his grandparents when his mother went to work as a practical nurse. Career Paisley served in the CIA from 1963 to 1974. During his career, he was heavily involved in Soviet operations. Paisley retired as deputy director in the Office of Strategic Research, the branch that monitored Soviet military movements and nuclear capabilities. Later life and death Around 1976, Paisley and Maryann separated. In December 1977 and March 1978, he attended two five-day \\"personal awareness\\" seminars conducted by Lifespring. According to Paisley's psychiatrist, Paisley began attending individual and group psychotherapy sessions in April. On September 24, 1978, Paisley disappeared after setting sail on the Chesapeake Bay with his sloop Brillig. On October 1, his body was found floating in the Bay near the mouth of the Patuxent River with a gunshot wound to his head and a weighted dive belt around his waist. His boat was found the previous week run aground. Shortly after his death, the psychiatrist stated Paisley was to attend a group therapy session in Chevy Chase, Maryland on September 26 with his estranged wife to discuss the failure of their marriage. He speculated that due to personal developments Paisley may have been experiencing \\"feelings of loss and abandonment\\". Senate inquiry Due to the circumstances of Paisley's death and press speculation, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) opened an inquiry in order to determine if his death was due to his activities with the CIA. After a two year investigation and three public statements, the SSCI reported that it ‚Äúfound no information to support the allegations that Mr. Paisley‚Äôs death was connected in some way to involvement in foreign intelligence or counterintelligence matters.‚Äù In 1989, Crown Publishers put out Widows, a book by William R. Corson, Susan B. Trento, and Joseph J. Trento that stated the CIA failed to properly investigate the deaths of Paisley and two other CIA officials, Nicholas Shadrin and Ralph Sigler.

When stretched, they become thicker perpendicular to the applied force. This occurs due to their particular internal structure and the way this deforms when the sample is uniaxially loaded. Auxetics can be single molecules, crystals, or a particular structure of macroscopic matter. Such materials and structures are expected to have mechanical properties such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance. Auxetics may be useful in applications such as body armor, packing material, knee and elbow pads, robust shock absorbing material, and sponge mops. The term auxetic derives from the Greek word Œ±·ΩêŒæŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (auxetikos) which means \\"that which tends to increase\\" and has its root in the word Œ±·ΩîŒæŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, or auxesis, meaning \\"increase\\" (noun). This terminology was coined by Professor Ken Evans of the University of Exeter... One of the first artificially produced auxetic materials, the RFS structure (diamond-fold structure), was invented in 1978 by the Berlin researcher K. Pietsch. Although he did not use the term auxetics, he describes for the first time the underlying lever mechanism and its non-linear mechanical reaction is therefore considered the inventor of the auxetic net. The earliest published example of a material with negative Poisson's constant is due to A. G. Kolpakov in 1985, \\"Determination of the average characteristics of elastic frameworks\\"; the next synthetic auxetic material was described in Science in 1987, entitled \\"Foam structures with a Negative Poisson's Ratio\\" by R.S. Lakes from the University of Wisconsin Madison. The use of the word auxetic to refer to this property probably began in 1991.. Designs of composites with inverted hexagonal periodicity cell (auxetic hexagon), possessing negative Poisson ratios, were published in 1985. Typically, auxetic materials have low density, which is what allows the hinge- like areas of the auxetic microstructures to flex.A stretch of the imagination ‚Äì 7 June 1997 ‚Äì New Scientist Space At the macroscale, auxetic behaviour can be illustrated with an inelastic string wound around an elastic cord. When the ends of the structure are pulled apart, the inelastic string straightens while the elastic cord stretches and winds around it, increasing the structure's effective volume. Auxetic behaviour at the macroscale can also be employed for the development of products with enhanced characteristics such as footwear based on the auxetic rotating triangles structures developed by Grima and Evans. In footwear, auxetic design allows the sole to expand in size while walking or running, thereby increasing flexibility. Examples of auxetic materials include: * Auxetic polyurethane foam * Œ±-Cristobalite. * Liquid crystal polymers with rotating transverse rods could potentially be auxetic. Experimental pursuits towards producing materials auxetic at the molecular scale (and also in the macroscopic sense) have rarely been successful so far. * Crystalline materials: Li, Na, K, Cu, Rb, Ag, Fe, Ni, Co, Cs, Au, Be, Ca, Zn, Sr, Sb, MoS_2, BAsO_4 and other. * Certain rocks and minerals * Graphene, which can be made auxetic through the introduction of vacancy defects * Carbon diamond-like phases * Noncarbon nanotubes * Living bone tissue (although this is only suspected) * Tendons within their normal range of motion. * Specific variants of polytetrafluorethylene polymers such as Gore-Tex. * Paper, several types. If a paper is stretched in an in-plane direction it will expand in its thickness direction due to its network structure.Baum et al. 1984, Tappi journal, √ñhrn, O. E.

In his article Economics of Shortage (1980), Kornai argued that the chronic shortages seen throughout Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1970s (and which continued during the 1980s) were not the consequences of planners' errors, but rather systemic flaws. A shortage of a certain item does not necessarily mean that the item is not being produced; rather, it means that the amount of the good demanded exceeds the amount supplied at a given price (see supply and demand). This may be caused by a government-enforced low price which encourages consumers to demand a higher amount than is supplied. However, Kornai concentrated on the role of reduced supply and argued that this was the underlying cause of Eastern European shortages during the 1980s.  Definition and characteristics  According to Kornai, shortage economies share several common characteristics. They all experience frequent, intensive and chronic shortages. These are general in nature; that is, they occur in all spheres of the economy (consumer goods and services, means of production and producer goods). The shortages are both horizontal and vertical which means that they affect both the supply of intermediate goods as well as related complementary goods. Furthermore, the shortages are occasionally replaced by situations of surplus \\"slack\\" when too much of a particular good is supplied (often due to the mis-timing of production orders which arrive too late).  Buyers' actions  Kornai distinguishes between several different possible actions and individual outcomes that can occur in a shortage economy. It could happen that the item sought by the consumer is available in the shop, but there may be a limited amount of a sought-after good available, which means that consumers have to queue for it (theoretically, in a market economy such a situation would generally, but not always, be eliminated by price adjustments). Queueing involves a considerable cost in terms of time spent in the queue for consumers. In the economies which Kornai studied, this could have involved several hours a day spent in queues just to obtain basic products like food. Other consumer goods had explicit waiting lists for which potential buyers had to sign up months or even years in advance. An example is the wait in the 1980s Soviet Union for the right to purchase an apartment which could take as long as ten or fifteen years. Another possible situation is that the item is simply not available. In that case, the buyer can either abandon the intent of purchase completely, spend additional time (an implicit economic cost) in further search for the good, or purchase a substitute good. According to Kornai, the purchase of a substitute is compulsory. Finally, it is possible that the consumer ends up purchasing a completely unrelated good due to the income effect simply in the hope that selling the unneeded item later will enable him to purchase the actual good he is seeking at a future time. This has the effect of increasing demand for other goods simply because they are there and can lead to the spread of shortages throughout the economy.  Outcomes  The common results of these shortages for consumers are forced substitutions between goods which are imperfect substitutes and forced savings as consumers are unable to fully utilize their current purchasing power. The institutional outcomes involve the so-called soft budget constraint in which production units under a planned economy form expectations of always being bailed out by central authorities, paternalistic behaviour on the part of the planners who blame the shortages on the fact that consumers demand \\"wrong things\\" and in macroeconomic terms repressed inflation resulting from pent up demand.

Spreckels. Dubbed \\"The Impossible Railroad\\" by many engineers of its day due to the immense logistical challenges involved, the line was established in part to provide San Diego with a direct rail link to the east by connecting with the Southern Pacific Railroad lines in El Centro, California. The SD&A;'s route originates in San Diego, California and terminates in El Centro, California. The SD&AE; uses about of the original SD&A; system, broken into four segments: # The Blue Line runs south from San Diego, California to San Ysidro, California ( in length). # The Desert Line runs northeast from the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border at \\"Division\\" to Plaster City, California ( total length). # The Orange Line runs east from San Diego, California to El Cajon, California ( total length). # The Coronado Branch runs south from 12th Street Junction, south of San Diego, to Imperial Beach, California ( in length; out of service since 2002) The company took over the SD&A;'s operations in February 1933 after financial troubles led John Spreckels' descendants to sell their interests in the railroad to the Southern Pacific. Through the years natural disasters and vandalism rendered sections of the line unserviceable, and portions of the line have been sold to various interests. Carrizo Gorge, 2010. In 1967 the railroad reported 46 million ton miles of revenue freight on its of line operated. In 1979 the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) bought the SD&AE; railway from Southern Pacific to establish the San Diego Trolley, an intra-county light rail passenger line. The San Diego Trolley carries over 35 million riders annually. The remaining track into Imperial County is used for freight and was part of the sale condition to MTS by Southern Pacific. In December 1985, the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum began operating passenger excursion trains out of their property in Campo, California over the SD&AE.; The museum maintains equipment and corporate records of both the SD&A;/SD&AE; Railways. As of January 2013, freight operations are conducted by the Pacific Imperial Railroad (PIRR) for the Desert Line and the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad (SDIY) for the Blue and Orange lines, including the San Ysidro and San Diego yards. As of October 2017, Pacific Imperial Railroad had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and sold its lease to operate freight for 99 years on the desert line to Baja California Railroad. While BJRR will now operate freight, MTS still owns the line and BJRR must pay MTS US$1 million per year for the rights to operate. BJRR has also announced a three phase plan to rehabilitate the line. Phase 1 will cover the border crossing at Division to Jacumba. Phase two will cover Plaster City to Dos Cabezas. Phase three will be from Jacumba to Dos Cabezas. As of February 2019 no rehabilitation work had begun. The San Diego Model Railroad Museum maintains representations of the SD&AE;'s operations in both HO scale (1:87) and N scale (1:160).

They were an influential force in the American power metal genre emerging in the mid-1980s. HistoryEarly days and Combat- era (1982‚Äì1986)= Helstar began with a basic heavy metal style in 1983 with two demos, followed by their first studio album in 1984 titled Burning Star for Combat Records, making them label mates with Megadeth and Exodus. Struggles within the band and management issues led to changes in the band's line-up. After a year they released the Remnants of War album, also on Combat, produced by Randy Burns. The band played their first arena show in December 1985 opening for Stryper at the Sam Houston Coliseum. =Metal Blade-era (1987‚Äì1989)= In 1987, they briefly moved to Los Angeles with another line up change, with guitarist Rob Trevino departing, and it is believed that the song \\"Abandon Ship\\", from the 1988 album A Distant Thunder, was dedicated to his departure. Along with guitarist Andre' Corbin, Frank Ferreira was an addition to drums. They returned to Houston in 1988, signed with Metal Blade Records and recorded the A Distant Thunder album produced by Bill Metoyer. The band subsequently toured with acts such as Yngwie Malmsteen, Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus and Armored Saint as openers. In 1989, the band released Nosferatu, which many fans consider their greatest album. It was based on the early Dracula film and contained spoken sound bites from the 1979 adaptation. Shortly after a tour of the album, the band recorded a four-song demo which did not gain interest from labels. Andre' Corbin, Frank Ferreria and Larry Barragan left the band in 1990 to pursue other interests, essentially ending the group for the time being. =Demos, Multiples of Black and hiatuses (1990‚Äì2000)= Between 1990 and 1993, Helstar released a few demos that failed to receive great recognition. In 1995, Helstar released a new studio album entitled Multiples of Black, but did not achieve the quality from earlier albums and fans consider it their worst release. The members of Helstar namely James Rivera cooperated in other bands between 1993 and 2002, Seven Witches for a short time in 1993, Distant Thunder in 1995 and Destiny's End. This was a super group put together by James Riviera that released two studio albums, Breathe Deep the Dark in 1998 and Transition in 2002. =Reunions (2001‚Äìpresent)= Helstar went through several reunions starting in 2001. These reunions were primarily organized by James Rivera and longtime bassist Jerry Abarca. Several live albums came out of this period, but the band was unable to produce any new material. In 2006, for the first time in over 15 years, James Rivera and Larry Barragan reunited and Helstar were officially declared musically active again. Along with Abarca, Rivera and Barragan, also reunited with the Remnants of War album were guitarist Rob Trevino and Eternity Black drummer Russell De'leon. This lineup has since released Sins of the Past, \\"a greatest hits collection\\" of re-recorded songs. A new album was released with the Remnants of War line-up in 2008 titled The King of Hell. In 2013, Helstar announced that bassist Jerry Abarca would take an extended break from the band due to a stomach related illness. Mike Lepond and Garrick Smith took on live bass duties for upcoming shows. Helstar released their ninth studio album This Wicked Nest on April 25, 2014. Andrew Atwood joined as second guitarist in 2016 and contributed to their latest album, Vampiro, released later that year. A new album is in the works, due for release in 2021.

In Illinois, the lieutenant governor and governor run on a joint ticket and are directly elected by popular vote. Candidates for lieutenant governor ran separately in the primary from candidates for governor until 2014, when the system was changed to allow the gubernatorial nominee of a party to select the nominee for lieutenant governor. When the Governor of Illinois becomes unable to discharge the duties of that office, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor. If the Governor dies, resigns or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Under the Illinois Constitution, the Attorney General is next in line of succession to the Governor's office after the lieutenant governor, but does not succeed to the Lieutenant Governor's office. From the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich in 2009, until the inauguration of Sheila Simon in 2011, Attorney General Lisa Madigan would have become Governor if Pat Quinn had vacated the office. Historically, the lieutenant governor has been from either the Democratic Party or Republican Party. The current lieutenant governor is Democrat Juliana Stratton. Duties The lieutenant governor of Illinois handles a variety of responsibilities which have been delegated to the office via statute. These duties include serving as Chairman of the Governor's Rural Affairs Council, Chairman of Rural Bond Bank of Illinois, head of the Illinois Main Street Program, and Chairman of the Illinois River Coordinating Council. In addition to these duties, the lieutenant governor can take on other duties as assigned by the governor or initiate duties of his or her own. An example of this is work by former Lt. Gov. Corrine Wood on women's health issues. The lieutenant governor also serves as a surrogate speaker for the governor around the state and as a representative for state government. The lieutenant governor is a member of the National Lieutenant Governors Association. Prior to the adoption of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, the lieutenant governor also served as the President of the Senate. Losing this position made the lieutenant governor's job less significant, and contributed to the \\"boredom\\" cited by Jim Thompson's first lieutenant governor, Dave O'Neal, who resigned from the office in 1981. Under the Illinois state Constitution Article V section 7. \\"If the Lieutenant Governor fails to qualify or if his office becomes vacant, it shall remain vacant until the end of the term.\\" Illinois thus had no Lieutenant Governor during the two-year interim between Pat Quinn's elevation to the Governor's office upon Rod Blagojevich's impeachment conviction, and Sheila Simon's election and inauguration as Lieutenant Governor. Like the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor has suites of offices in both Springfield and Chicago. Qualifications The Lieutenant Governor of Illinois serves four-year terms. Inauguration takes place on the second Monday in January following a gubernatorial election. A lieutenant governor is *required to be at least twenty-five years old, *required to be a United States citizen, *required to have been a resident of Illinois for the three years previous to election, *barred from other government positions during the term.

The parish is adjacent to another parish in the neighbouring municipality of Santa Cruz to the south, which is also named Santo Ant√≥nio da Serra. The population in 2011 was 1,617,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 8.62 km¬≤.Eurostat History Historical implements seen at the Apple Festival in Santo da Serra The parish name originated from the local adoration of Saint Anthony, and the name usually shortened to Santo da Serra in conversation. Settlement of this region happened late, owing to most settlers' preference for coastal lands rather than the rugged interior.Junta Freguesia (2010) It is likely to have occurred during the 16th century, beginning in the area of the parochial church, and progressed to a point where Gil de Carvalho ordered the construction of two chapels for the resident population. During this century, a primitive temple located on the site of the main church existed, under the jurisdiction of the vicar of Machico. After the 17th century, a dispute arose between the vicars of Machico, Santa Cruz and √Ågua de Pena over their jurisdictions: consequently the Bishop of Funchal, Louren√ßo de T√°vora, in order to resolve the dispute, took the chapel (and its associated lands) under his protection, and therefore, episcopal jurisdiction (which it continues to fall, under the Mitra do Funchal). The bishopric governor, Ant√≥nio Alfredo de Santa Catarina, in 1836, annexed the parish of √Ågua de Pena to Santo da Serra, transferring the ecclesiastical seat to the latter, under the parish of Santo da Serra e de √Ågua de Pena. But, Santo da Serra was eventually restored by regal charter in 1848, taking with it the locality of Achada do Barro, and making it an autonomous parish of Machico. In 1852, certain areas of the municipality Machico, specifically lands in Santo da Serra, were annexed to the municipality of Santa Cruz, provoking protests. Under the initiative of the Sectary General of the District, Ant√≥nio Lopes Barbosa de Albuquerque, who reunited the respective representatives of the \\"warring\\" groups at Casa dos Romeiros in Santo da Serra, where an accord was brokered that divided Santo da Serra between the two municipalities of Machico and Santa Cruz. During the reign of Queen Maria I, the monarch established lands to be used for the inhabitants of Porto Santo: these tracts were to be distributed freely to those who wanted to leave the island. This followed an economic crisis on the island in the 18th century, putting many in a state of poverty and malnutrition. By regal decree, dated 18 December 1768, the lands were referred to as the Aldeia da Rainha (), and many tried to adapt to the new environment. But, the climate (both humid and cold) forced many to abandon the colony, resulting in it being reverted to the jurisdiction of Machico. In the 19th century, Santo da Serra was a ferment of religious agitation, instigated by the Scottish physician Robert Kalley, who opened a medical practice in the parish, providing counselling free of charge to the residents. At the same time that he treated his patients, the doctor proselytized his Protestant Calvinist ideals and religion, creating conflict within the community, reaching as far as the municipalities of Machico and Santa Cruz. Consequently, this tumult caused the authorities to establish processes against individuals preaching new doctrines or religious ideals in the community, sending many to prison and forcing Dr. Kalley to leave the island. Geography The parish of Santo Ant√≥nio da Serra, located in the interior of the southern coast of Madeira, pertains to the municipality of Machico, confronted in the north and east by the parish of Porto da Cruz, west by the municipality of Santa Cruz, and by extent 20 kilometres from Funchal, the regional capital. It is situated in rough plateau, around 700 metres altitude, overlooking Machico, characterized by forest vistas of chestnut, acacia and elderberry trees that were acquired by many English to construct farms during settlement. The principal places () in the parish are: Ribeira de Machico, Igreja, Faj√£ dos Rolos, Faj√£ das Vacas, Marga√ßa, Lombo das Faias, Lamaceiros and Achada do Barro. Economy The main activity is predominantly agricultural, and specifically the raising of dairy or beef cattle.

The Hypophrygian (deuterus plagalis) mode, literally meaning \\"below Phrygian (plagal second)\\", is a musical mode or diatonic scale in medieval chant theory, the fourth mode of church music. This mode is the plagal counterpart of the authentic third mode, which was called Phrygian. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance this mode was described in two ways: the diatonic scale from B to B an octave above, divided at the mode final E (B‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìE + E‚ÄìF‚ÄìG‚ÄìA‚ÄìB); and as a mode with final E and ambitus from the A below to the C above. The note A above the final (the tenor of the corresponding fourth psalm tone) had an important melodic function . The melodic range of the ecclesiastical Hypophrygian mode therefore goes from the perfect fourth or fifth below the tonic to the perfect fifth or minor sixth above. Ancient Greek Hypophrygian octave species on E (the barline marks the beginning of the enharmonic tetrachord, conjoined to a second tetrachord) The name Hypophrygian originates in an octave species of ancient Greek music theory. According to Aristoxenus, this octave species was originally described around the year 400 BC by the Harmonicist school of Eratocles in terms of the enharmonic genus of the tetrachord: a series of rising intervals of two quarter tones followed by a ditone, together spanning a perfect fourth. The Dorian octave species begins with this tetrachord, which is followed by a whole tone and another tetrachord to complete the octave with a pattern of ¬º, ¬º, 2, 1, ¬º, ¬º, and 2 tones. This pattern is rotated downward one degree for the Hypolydian, and one more for the Hypophrygian, for an octave species of 2, 1, ¬º, ¬º, 2, ¬º, and ¬º tones . The name was appropriated by Ptolemy of Alexandria for one of his seven tonoi, or transposition keys. Ptolemy's system differed from the earlier Aristoxenian model, which had thirteen transpositional levels each a semitone from its neighbours. Ptolemy substituted a diatonic sequence of seven transpositions pitched either a whole tone or a semitone apart. The entire double-octave scale system was then transposed onto each of these relative pitch levels, requiring (in modern terms) a different key signature in each case, and therefore a different sequence of whole and half steps in the fixed central octave span. The Hypophrygian transposition was the second-lowest of these, a whole tone above the Hypodorian. A whole tone higher was the Hypolydian, followed a semitone higher still by the Dorian, then after another whole tone by the Phrygian, and so on (; ). Four centuries later, the term was taken from Ptolemy in exactly the same sense by Boethius, who described these seven names as \\"toni, tropi, vel modi\\" (tones, tropes or modes) in the fourth book of his De institutione musica. In the late 9th century, in the Carolingian treatises Alia musica and in a commentary on it called the Nova expositio, this set of seven terms, supplemented by an eighth name, \\"Hypermixolydian\\", was given a new sense, designating a set of diatonic octave species, described as the tonal embodiments of the eight modes of Gregorian chant . Missa Mi-mi (Missa quarti toni) by Johannes Ockeghem is a well-known example of a work written in the Hypophrygian mode.

The mission of the ICH is to promote public health by achieving greater harmonisation through the development of technical Guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration. Harmonisation leads to a more rational use of human, animal and other resources, the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development, and availability of new medicines while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, efficacy, and regulatory obligations to protect public health. As per the public health ICH must include the professional qualifications in their requirements on the aspect of pharmacists must be qualified and organisations must be included only pharmacist related of all health organisation. History In the 1980s the European Union began harmonising regulatory requirements. In 1989, Europe, Japan, and the United States began creating plans for harmonisation. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) was created in April 1990 at a meeting in Brussels. ICH had the initial objective of coordinating the regulatory activities of the European, Japanese and United States regulatory bodies in consultation with the pharmaceutical trade associations from these regions, to discuss and agree the scientific aspects arising from product registration. Since the new millennium, ICH's attention has been directed towards extending the benefits of harmonisation beyond the founding ICH regions. In 2015, ICH underwent several reforms and changed its name to the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use while becoming a legal entity in Switzerland as a non-profit association.ICH Makes Organizational Changes, Zachary Brennan, 26 October 2015, Regulatory Affairs Professionals SocietyICH is now International Council for Harmonisation ‚Äì a Legal Swiss Entity, James Lind Institute The aim of these reforms was to transform ICH into a truly global initiative supported by a robust and transparent governance structure. The ICH Association established an Assembly as the over-arching governing body with the aim of focusing global pharmaceutical regulatory harmonisation work in one venue that allows pharmaceutical regulatory authorities and concerned industry organisations to be more actively involved in ICH‚Äôs harmonisation work. The new Assembly met for the first time on 23 October 2015. Structure The ICH comprises the following bodies: # ICH Assembly # ICH Management Committee # MedDRA Management Committee # ICH Secretariat The ICH Assembly brings together all Members and Observers of the ICH Association as the overarching governing body of ICH. It adopts decisions in particular on matters such as on the adoption of ICH Guidelines, admission of new Members and Observers, and the ICH Association‚Äôs work plans and budget. Member representatives appointed to the Assembly are supported by ICH Coordinators who represent each Member to the ICH Secretariat on a daily basis. The ICH Management Committee (MC) is the body that oversees operational aspects of ICH on behalf of all Members, including administrative and financial matters and oversight of the Working Groups (WGs). The MedDRA Management Committee (MC) has responsibility for direction of MedDRA, ICH‚Äôs standardised medical terminology. The MedDRA MC has the role of managing, supporting, and facilitating the maintenance, development, and dissemination of MedDRA. The ICH Secretariat is responsible for day-to-day management of ICH, coordinating ICH activities as well as providing support to the Assembly, the MC and Working Groups. The ICH Secretariat also provides support for the MedDRA MC. The ICH Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The ICH WGs are established by the Assembly when a new technical topic is accepted for harmonisation, and are charged with developing a harmonised guideline that meets the objectives outlined in the Concept Paper and Business Plan. Face-to-face meetings of the WG will normally only take place during the biannual ICH meetings. Interim reports are made at each meeting of the Assembly and made publicly available on the ICH website. Process of Harmonisation ICH harmonisation activities fall into 4 categories: Formal ICH Procedure, Q&A; Procedure, Revision Procedure and Maintenance Procedure, depending on the activity to be undertaken. The development of a new harmonised guideline and its implementation (the formal ICH procedure) involves 5 steps: =Step 1: Consensus building= The WG works to prepare a consensus draft of the Technical Document, based on the objectives set out in the Concept Paper. When consensus on the draft is reached within the WG, the technical experts of the WG will sign the Step 1 Experts sign-off sheet. The Step 1 Experts Technical Document is then submitted to the Assembly to request adoption under Step 2 of the ICH process. =Step 2a: Confirmation of consensus on the Technical Document= Step 2a is reached when the Assembly agrees, based on the report of the WG, that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the technical issues for the Technical Document to proceed to the next stage of regulatory consultation. The Assembly then endorses the Step 2a Technical Document. =Step 2b: Endorsement of draft Guideline by Regulatory Members= Step 2b is reached when the Regulatory Members of the Assembly further endorse the draft Guideline. =Step 3: Regulatory consultation and discussion= Step 3 occurs in three distinct stages: regulatory consultation, discussion, and finalisation of the Step 3 Expert Draft Guideline. * Stage I - Regional regulatory consultation: The Guideline embodying the scientific consensus leaves the ICH process and becomes the subject of normal wide-ranging regulatory consultation in the ICH regions. Regulatory authorities and industry associations in other regions may also comment on the draft consultation documents by providing their comments to the ICH Secretariat. * Stage II - Discussion of regional consultation comments: After obtaining all comments from the consultation process, the EWG works to address the comments received and reach consensus on what is called the Step 3 Experts Draft Guideline. * Stage III - Finalisation of Step 3 Experts Draft Guideline: If, after due consideration of the consultation results by the WG, consensus is reached amongst the experts on a revised version of the Step 2b draft Guideline, the Step 3 Expert Draft Guideline is signed by the experts of the ICH Regulatory Members. The Step 3 Expert Draft Guideline with regulatory EWG signatures is submitted to the Regulatory Members of the Assembly to request adoption at Step 4 of the ICH process. =Step 4: Adoption of an ICH Harmonised Guideline= Step 4 is reached when the Regulatory Members of the Assembly agree that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the draft Guideline and adopt the ICH Harmonised Guideline. =Step 5: Implementation= The ICH Harmonised Guideline moves immediately to the final step of the process that is the regulatory implementation. This step is carried out according to the same national/regional procedures that apply to other regional regulatory guidelines and requirements in the ICH regions. Information on the regulatory action taken and implementation dates are reported back to the Assembly and published by the ICH Secretariat on the ICH website. Work productsGuidelines= The ICH topics are divided into four categories and ICH topic codes are assigned according to these categories: * Q : Quality Guidelines * S : Safety Guidelines * E : Efficacy Guidelines * M : Multidisciplinary Guidelines ICH Guidelines are not mandatory for anybody per se but the strength of the ICH process lies in the commitment for implementation by ICH Regulatory Members using appropriate national/regional tools. =MedDRA= MedDRA is a rich and highly specific standardised medical terminology developed by ICH to facilitate sharing of regulatory information internationally for medical products used by humans. It is used for registration, documentation and safety monitoring of medical products both before and after a product has been authorised for sale. Products covered by the scope of MedDRA include pharmaceuticals, vaccines and drug-device combination products. Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© ICH.

Biography Kornai studied philosophy for two years at the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University (now the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University) in Budapest. He gained his knowledge in economics on his own, and holds a candidate degree in the field from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He wrote that he chose to become an economist after reading Marx's Das Kapital. Fran√ßois Fejt≈ë, \\"Les M√©moires politiques et intellectuels d'un grand √©conomiste hongrois\\", Soci√©tal, Q1 2008, p.110 ff. He started working on Szabad N√©p, the Hungarian Communist Party newspaper, and rose to the rank of editor of news related to the economy, but after a few years, he was fired for lack of Communist convictions in April 1955. From 1958 onward, Kornai received many invitations to visit foreign institutions, but he was denied a passport by the Hungarian authorities and not allowed to travel until 1963, after political restrictions had begun to ease. From 1967 until 1992 he was a Research Professor at the Institute of Economics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He became a corresponding member (1976), then a full member (1982) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Kornai joined the faculty of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, in 1986 and was named the Allie S. Freed Professor of Economics in 1992. He retired from Harvard in 2002. In the same year, he became a Permanent Fellow of Collegium Budapest, Institute for Advanced Study. He is a Distinguished Research Professor at Central European University, and since 2011 also as a professor emeritus at the Corvinus University of Budapest. He was a Member of the Board of the Hungarian National Bank (central bank) until 2001. He has authored many economics-related books and papers. Work In the late 1950s, he was among those who initiated the use of mathematical methods in economic planning. He elaborated the theory of two-level planning with Tam√°s Lipt√°k and directed the first large-scale, economy-wide, multi-level planning project. Professor Kornai's early work Overcentralization (1953) created a stir in the West and conveyed for the first time his disillusionment with communist central planning. His 1971 book Anti-Equilibrium criticizes neoclassical economics, particularly general equilibrium theory. His 1980 book Economics of Shortage is perhaps his most influential work. It argues that the chronic shortages seen throughout Eastern Europe in the late 1970s and continuing in the 1980s were not the consequences of planners' errors or wrong pricing, but of systemic flaws. In his 1988 book The Socialist System, The Political Economy of Communism, he argued that the command economy based on unchallenged control by a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist communist party leads to a predominance of bureaucratic administration of state firms, through centralized planning and management, and the use of administrative pricing to eliminate the effects of the market. This brings individual responses to the incentives of the system, culminating in observable and inescapable economic phenomena known as the shortage economy. Kornai remains highly skeptical of efforts to create market socialism. His later works, including The Road to a Free Economy (1990), Highway and Byways (1995), Struggle and Hope (1997) and Welfare in Transition (2001), deal with macroeconomic aspects and the interaction between politics and economic policy in the period of economic transition in the post-Soviet states. He later led a comprehensive research project, Honesty and Trust in the Light of Post-Socialist Transition at Collegium Budapest. Kornai is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 2016 he was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences.. In 2007 Kornai published a book of memoirs, By Force of Thought, covering his research and the social and political environments in which he did his work. A new ten- volume edition of Kornai's major works began to appear in Hungarian from a Bratislava publisher in 2012.Bal√°zs H√°mori: \\"J√°nos v√°logatott m≈±vei sorozat a pozsonyi Kalligram kiad√°s√°ban\\" (Series of selected works by J√°nos Kornai published by Kalligram of Bratislava).

Roh is perhaps best known for his 1925 book Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europ√§ischen Malerei (\\"After expressionism: Magical Realism: Problems of the newest European painting\\") he coined the term magic realism. Roh was born in Apolda (in present-day Thuringia), Germany. He studied at universities in Leipzig, Berlin, and Basel. In 1920, he received his Ph.D. in Munich for a work on Dutch paintings of the 17th century. As a photographer and critic, he absolutely hated photographs that mimicked painting, charcoal, or drawings. During the Nazi regime, he was isolated and briefly put in jail for his book Foto-Auge (Photo-Eye); he used his jail time he used to write the book Der Verkannte K√ºnstler: Geschichte und Theorie des kulturellen Mi√üverstehens (\\"The unrecognized artist: history and theory of cultural misunderstanding\\"). After the war, in 1946, he married art historian Juliane Bartsch. He died in Munich. Roh and magic realism Roh is perhaps best remembered as the critic who coined the term magic realism. But, though the lineage is direct, his magic realism has a very different meaning from the one used to describe the work of writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende that dominates our current understanding of the term. Roh, celebrating the post-expressionist return of the visual arts to figural representation, utilized the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger to emphasize that \\"the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.\\" Roh was, then, emphasizing the \\"magic\\" of the normal world as it presents itself to us (i.e., how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic) and not the world of magic (in which objects are literally transformed into something fantastic) that the literary school emphasizes. Roh himself, writing in the 1950s and perhaps already seeing the confusion his term had caused in this regard, emphasized that his use of the word magic was, \\"of course not in the religious-psychological sense of ethnology.\\" Roh's magic realism, though not often written about in recent years, is nonetheless an important contribution to a phenomenological or existential theory of aesthetics. This link is emphasized by the fact that it was the Spanish phenomenologist Jos√© Ortega y Gasset's disciple Fernando Vela who translated Roh's essay into Spanish, thereby setting the stage for its appropriation by the literary movement.

These were mainly rural homes, used by local farmers, during the settlement of the island, with white-painted walls, red doors and windows with blue trim. Most of the surviving buildings are tourist attractions, and maintained (for example, the straw roofs are replaced every four to five years). Economy A tourist-themed park was constructed to exhibit examples of the island's early history and culture; the Madeira Theme Park is an ample area, on of land, where visitors re-discover the cultures of Madeira and Porto Santo. This includes exhibits on the island's history, artifacts used in daily life and cultural presentations, in a scenic environment.

The show then ran on NBC Television from 1956 to 1960 and on ABC Television from 1960 to 1964.The New York Times Encyclopedia of Television by Les Brown (Times Books, a division of Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company, Inc., 1977), , p. 348 The show became popular enough that NBC increased its running time from 30 to 45 minutes to sell more commercials, at a then-premium rate of $4,000 per minute.  Format  The show opened with host Jack Bailey asking the audience‚Äîmostly women‚Äî\\"Would YOU like to be Queen for a day?\\" After this, the contestants were introduced and interviewed, one at a time, with commercials and fashion commentary interspersed in between. Each contestant was asked to talk about the recent financial and emotional hard times she had been through. The interview would climax with Bailey asking the contestant what she needed most and why she wanted to win the title of Queen for a Day. Often the request was for medical care or therapeutic equipment to help a chronically ill child, or might be for a hearing aid, a new washing machine, or a refrigerator. Many women broke down sobbing as they described their plights. The winning contestant was selected by the audience using an applause meter; the harsher the contestant's situation, the likelier the studio audience was to ring the applause meter's highest level. The winner, to the musical accompaniment of \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\", would be draped in a sable-trimmed red velvet robe, given a glittering jeweled crown to wear, placed on a velvet-upholstered throne, and handed a dozen long-stemmed roses to hold while her list of prizes was announced. The prizes began with the help the woman had requested, and included a variety of extras, many of which were donated by sponsoring companies, such as a vacation trip, a night on the town with her husband, silver-plated flatware, an array of kitchen appliances, or a selection of fashion clothing. The losing contestants were each given smaller prizes. Bailey's trademark sign-off was: \\"This is Jack Bailey, wishing we could make every woman a queen, for every single day!\\" Reception The show was not without its critics for exploiting people's hardships for profit.This 1950s game show profited from the poverty of a new woman every dayby Stephanie BeckTimeline Veteran television writer Mark Evanier has called the program \\"one of the most ghastly shows ever produced.\\" He further described it as \\"tasteless, demeaning to women, demeaning to anyone who watched it, cheap, insulting and utterly degrading to the human spirit.\\"  Broadcast history  Radio = Ken Murray hosted the original radio version of the show on the Mutual‚ÄìDon Lee Radio Network. When the series began, in New York City on April 30, 1945, it was titled Queen for Today. A few months later, the show moved to Hollywood and acquired the more familiar title Queen for a Day. with Jack Bailey, a former vaudeville musician and World's Fair barker, as host. The show aired five days a week, during the daytime. = Film = In 1951, a fictional comedy-drama film adaptation of the show was released by United Artists. Titled Queen for a Day, it purported to be a behind-the-scenes look at the show while at the same time spoofing the show's basic premise. The movie starred Bailey as the host and featured Darren McGavin, Phyllis Avery, and Leonard Nimoy, among others. = Television = Bailey stayed on as host as Queen for a Day jumped from radio to television. With the addition of a visual component, the fashion aspect of the show expanded and each episode featured three to five young women modelling the upscale apparel that would be given away to contestants. Other visual stunts, such as a circus-themed episode featuring ponies and clowns from Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus, helped bring the show into the television era. Through all of these changes, however, Bailey remained the interviewer who, over and over again, brought the contestants‚Äîand the live female audience‚Äîto tears. The first televised episode, a rebroadcast of an earlier radio episode, featured Pearl Stevens of Claremont, California. Live remote broadcasts and unscripted interviews added to the show's believability. One of the show's telecast locations was the Earl Carroll Theatre on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, renamed the Moulin Rouge in 1953. During each episode, the cameras panned over the audience as the women waved and cheered. From 1948 through 1955, the show was simulcast on radio and television. Both versions aired locally in the Los Angeles market on the Don Lee network. NBC picked up the show for national broadcast from January 3, 1956 to September 2, 1960, and aired it live across the nation (1:30 PST in Los Angeles and 4:30 EST in New York). It proved to be very popular and Bailey and the program were featured on the cover of TV Guide for the week of June 22‚Äì28, 1957. ABC broadcast the series nationally from September 5, 1960, until the end of the run on October 2, 1964. = Possible Revival = In 1987, Barry & Enright Productions in conjunction with Fries Distribution attempted to revive Queen for a Day with Monty Hall as host for the Fall of 1988 but with no success. = Revivals = On September 8, 1969, after a five-year hiatus, a new version of the show debuted in syndication with Dick Curtis as host. The premise remained largely the same; however, this version only ran until September 18, 1970. Viewers turned away from the format when it was revealed that, unlike the radio and earlier television versions, the new show was rigged and the \\"winners\\" were apparently paid actresses chosen to \\"win\\" the prizes prior to the start of each taping. On May 27, 2004, (originally May 24, 2004) after being off the air for more than 34 years, it was revived as a one-time special airing on cable network Lifetime with actress and comedian Mo'Nique as host. Judges for this version were Joely Fisher, Meshach Taylor, and Dayna Devon. The only difference between this version and the original was that the winner was not determined by audience applause. = Musical = In 2012, a musical was made based on the show called Queen for a Day: The Musical, starring Alan Thicke as Jack Bailey The outspoken and strong-willed Claribel Anderson (played by Blythe Wilson) finds herself along with fellow waitress Lana Beutler (played by Marisa McIntyre) at the glamorous Moulin Rouge Theatre, where the hit show tapes daily. Here the girls meet the quirky and charismatic host Jack Bailey and a colorful cast of Hollywood players who are ready and willing to build the Queen for a Day dream. Bailey sees the women, listens to many stories, dries many tears - but only one can be queen. Eventually Claribel lands as a contestant on the show. Her 15 minutes of fame send her down a road of self- discovery, forcing her to question her dream of being the perfect 50's housewife.  International versions  Australia = An Australian version aired in Melbourne on station HSV-7 from 1960 to 1962. = Brazil = The Brazilian version was hosted by Silvio Santos and aired on The Globo in 1972 under the title Boa Noite, Cinderella (Good Night/Evening, Cinderella). This version awarded gifts for children (mainly little girls) instead of housewives. Years later, when the channel changed from TVS to SBT, it aired the program in the afternoons, dropping \\"Good Night\\" in its title and renaming it Cinderella, until it was cancelled in 1987. = Spanish = In Mexico, an Aztec TV version, also called Reina Por Un D√≠a (Queen for One Day) was produced. It was originally hosted by Ingrid Coranado and then by Raquel Bigorra. It premiered in 2011. In the winter of 2011, a Spanish-language revival was hosted by Tom√°s Ramos (better known as The Red Shadow animator) aired on Univision in Puerto Rico under the name Reina Por Un D√≠a (Reina for a Day). The panel consisted of Amos Morals and Moraima Oyola. In Spain, the show was also called Reina Por Un D√≠a (Queen for One Day) hosted by Jos√© Luis Barcelona and Mario Cabr√© aired on TVE from 1964 until 1966. It was mostly broadcast weekly on Sunday afternoons.  Ownership rights  In 2008, RDF USA obtained the rights to the show with plans to pitch an update version to broadcast and cable networks. Seven episodes are currently licensed by the Peter Rogers Organization.PRO QFAD Page  Similar shows  Queen for a Day shared much in common with two other shows of its era, Strike It Rich (on radio and television from 1947 to 1958) and It Could Be You (on television from 1956 to 1961). A third similar show was On Your Way (on the DuMont Television Network and ABC from 1953 to 1954), which also used contestants with unfortunate stories, giving them transportation tickets as a reward for correct answers to quiz questions. The major difference between Queen for a Day and these other \\"sympathy shows\\" was that they asked their poverty- stricken contestants to win prizes within a conventional quiz show format,This Midcentury Show Turned Unhappy Housewives into TV Royalty - HISTORY with the winner essentially earning the prizes through his or her cleverness. Queen for a Day, on the other hand, dispensed with the quiz-show format entirely: All the contestants were women, and the only way a woman could win was by sincerely touching the heart-strings of the live female audience, who would then award her the greatest volume on the \\"applause meter.\\" Prizes were sponsored by industry leaders in appliances, home goods and apparel; such as the famed Spiegel Catalog, who offered each guest a credit allowance to spend from their catalog of more than 30,000 items.  Episode status  Recordings of the series are believed to have been destroyed, as per network practices of the era. Twelve episodes are held at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, including two from the Don Lee network era: the August 21, 1953, radio episode simulcast on television in Los Angeles and the July 4, 1955, show with Adolphe Menjou guest-hosting to crown a king instead of a queen (as was done about once or twice a year). The latest episode held at the archive is from July 13, 1964, near the end of the show's run on ABC.UCLA Film and Television Archive Catalog Two kinescoped episodes from 1956 exist in the J. Fred & Leslie W. MacDonald Collection of the Library of Congress. These include a 45-minute installment from February 2, 1956, and a half-hour installment from October 25, 1956. In 2005, First Look Media released a three-disc DVD set of seven episodes transferred from their original kinescope elements plus rare footage of an additional five episodes; the total runtime is 210 minutes.

He was a councillor in Scarborough from 1994 to 1997 and then served as a Toronto City Councillor from 1999 to 2006 representing Ward 43 in the western half of the Scarborough East riding. He was a candidate for Mayor of Toronto in the 2014 election. Background Soknacki graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1976. In 1978, he received his MBA degree from the University of Western Ontario. He moved to eastern Scarborough in 1963, and founded the Densgrove Park Community Association. Politics He ran for Scarborough city council in 1991, but lost to Frank Faubert. When Faubert ran for the mayor's job in 1994, Soknacki tried for the seat again. This time he was successful, defeating Glenn De Baeremaeker and Zephine Wailoo. When Scarborough was amalgamated with the City of Toronto and four other municipalities in 1997, ran for a seat on the new Toronto city council, but came in third, losing to Faubert and Ron Moeser. In June 1999, Faubert died of cancer and a by-election was called to replace him. Soknacki won by a considerable margin in a field of seven candidates. During his first term on city council, one of his accomplishments was the creation of a position of poet laureate for the city. He was seen as a centre-right member of city council, but also had links to the left. Unusually for a conservative, he was endorsed by the left-leaning NOW magazine in the 2003 municipal election, and was appointed to the important position of budget chief by mayor David Miller in 2003, despite Soknacki's support for Miller's rival John Tory in the mayoral election. In his second term on council, Soknacki served as the Chair of the Budget Committee, a position often referred to as the 'budget chief'. During this term he continued to write a column on municipal politics for the Scarborough Mirror. On August 22, 2006, Soknacki announced that he was retiring from politics. He gave no reasons for leaving city council but said he was returning to run his spice importing business. He gave his retirement date as the end of the council term on November 30, 2006. On June 4, 2007, Soknacki was appointed Chairperson of the federal Crown Corporation Parc Downsview Park Inc for a five year term. The major objective of the term was to develop and obtain agreement from all levels of government for a financially self-sustaining park. Not without controversy, Toronto Council, local community associations and other levels of government approved the Downsview Area Secondary Plan in 2012. One of the themes of Soknacki‚Äôs 2014 candidacy for mayor was the reform of the Toronto Police Service. On February 16, 2016 Soknacki was appointed to the Toronto Police Transformation Task Force, which issued its Final Report on January 26, 2017. 2014 mayoral campaign On September 30, 2013, he announced that he would run for Mayor of Toronto as a fiscal conservative against incumbent mayor Rob Ford. He registered on January 6, 2014. Soknacki positioned himself as a centre-right candidate, but unlike the right-wing incumbent mayor Rob Ford, Soknacki promised to replace the Scarborough RT with light rail transit rather than the proposed subway. Soknacki had been treated as a mainstream candidate by the media, despite early polls consistently showing he was last among the five major contenders. A Forum Poll conducted in June showed Soknacki at 8% support, ahead of rival Karen Stintz putting him in fourth place among the top five mayoral contenders. After polling in single digits since the official start of his campaign, he announced on September 9, 2014 that he was withdrawing his candidacy. In 2017, Soknacki was one of the applicants for appointment to city council to succeed the late Ron Moeser in Ward 44.\\"Former councillor David Soknacki seeks council appointment for Scarborough East\\" .

Lab notebooks in general are used by scientists, engineers, and technicians to document research, experiments, and procedures performed in a laboratory. A lab notebook is often maintained to be a legal document and may be used in a court of law as evidence. Similar to an inventor's notebook, the lab notebook is also often referred to in patent prosecution and intellectual property litigation. Electronic lab notebooks offer many benefits to the user as well as organizations; they are easier to search upon, simplify data copying and backups, and support collaboration amongst many users. ELNs can have fine- grained access controls, and can be more secure than their paper counterparts. They also allow the direct incorporation of data from instruments, replacing the practice of printing out data to be stapled into a paper notebook. Types ELNs can be divided into two categories: * \\"Specific ELNs\\" contain features designed to work with specific applications, scientific instrumentation or data types. * \\"Cross-disciplinary ELNs\\" or \\"Generic ELNs\\" are designed to support access to all data and information that needs to be recorded in a lab notebook. Solutions range from specialized programs designed from the ground up for use as an ELN, to modifications or direct use of more general programs. Examples of using more general software include using OpenWetWare, a MediaWiki install (running the same software that Wikipedia uses), as an ELN, or the use of general note taking software such as OneNote as an ELN. ELN's come in many different forms. They can be standalone programs, use a client-server model, or be entirely web-based. Some use a lab- notebook approach, others resemble a blog. A good many variations on the \\"ELN\\" acronym have appeared. Differences between systems with different names are often subtle, with considerable functional overlap between them. Examples include \\"ERN\\" (Electronic Research Notebook), \\"ERMS\\" (Electronic Resource (or Research or Records) Management System (or Software) and SDMS (Scientific Data (or Document) Management System (or Software). Ultimately, these types of systems all strive to do the same thing: Capture, record, centralize and protect scientific data in a way that is highly searchable, historically accurate, and legally stringent, and which also promotes secure collaboration, greater efficiency, reduced mistakes and lowered total research costs. Objectives A good electronic laboratory notebook should offer a secure environment to protect the integrity of both data and process, whilst also affording the flexibility to adopt new processes or changes to existing processes without recourse to further software development. The package architecture should be a modular design, so as to offer the benefit of minimizing validation costs of any subsequent changes that you may wish to make in the future as your needs change. A good electronic laboratory notebook should be an \\"out of the box\\" solution that, as standard, has fully configurable forms to comply with the requirements of regulated analytical groups through to a sophisticated ELN for inclusion of structures, spectra, chromatograms, pictures, text, etc. where a preconfigured form is less appropriate. All data within the system may be stored in a database (e.g. MySQL, MS-SQL, Oracle) and be fully searchable. The system should enable data to be collected, stored and retrieved through any combination of forms or ELN that best meets the requirements of the user. The application should enable secure forms to be generated that accept laboratory data input via PCs and/or laptops / palmtops, and should be directly linked to electronic devices such as laboratory balances, pH meters, etc. Networked or wireless communications should be accommodated for by the package which will allow data to be interrogated, tabulated, checked, approved, stored and archived to comply with the latest regulatory guidance and legislation. A system should also include a scheduling option for routine procedures such as equipment qualification and study related timelines. It should include configurable qualification requirements to automatically verify that instruments have been cleaned and calibrated within a specified time period, that reagents have been quality- checked and have not expired, and that workers are trained and authorized to use the equipment and perform the procedures. Regulatory and legal aspects The laboratory accreditation criteria found in the ISO 17025 standard needs to be considered for the protection and computer backup of electronic records. These criteria can be found specifically in clause 4.13.1.4 of the standard.\\"ISO/IEC 17025:2005 - General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories.\\" ISO - International Organization for Standardization. Web. 16 Nov. 2011. . Electronic lab notebooks used for development or research in regulated industries, such as medical devices or pharmaceuticals, are expected to comply with FDA regulations related to software validation. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure the integrity of the entries in terms of time, authorship, and content. Unlike ELNs for patent protection, FDA is not concerned with patent interference proceedings, but is concerned with avoidance of falsification. Typical provisions related to software validation are included in the medical device regulations at 21 CFR 820 (et seq.)United States. Food and Drug Administration. Department of Health and Human Resources. 1 Food and Drugs - Subchapter H Medical Devices - Part 820 System RegCode of Federal Regulations - Title 2ulation. FDA.gov, 7 Oct. 1996. Web. . and Title 21 CFR Part 11.United States. Food and Drug Administration. Department of Health and Human Resources. Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21 Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures. FDA.gov. Authority: 21 U.S.C. 321-393; 42 U.S.C. 262., 20 Mar. 1997. Web. 16 Nov. 2011. . Essentially, the requirements are that the software has been designed and implemented to be suitable for its intended purposes. Evidence to show that this is the case is often provided by a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) setting forth the intended uses and the needs that the ELN will meet; one or more testing protocols that, when followed, demonstrate that the ELN meets the requirements of the specification and that the requirements are satisfied under worst-case conditions. Security, audit trails, prevention of unauthorized changes without substantial collusion of otherwise independent personnel (i.e., those having no interest in the content of the ELN such as independent quality unit personnel) and similar tests are fundamental. Finally, one or more reports demonstrating the results of the testing in accordance with the predefined protocols are required prior to release of the ELN software for use. If the reports show that the software failed to satisfy any of the SRS requirements, then corrective and preventive action (\\"CAPA\\") must be undertaken and documented. Such CAPA may extend to minor software revisions, or changes in architecture or major revisions. CAPA activities need to be documented as well. Aside from the requirements to follow such steps for regulated industry, such an approach is generally a good practice in terms of development and release of any software to assure its quality and fitness for use. There are standards related to software development and testing that can be applied (see ref.).

Majority of the Armenian settlements and churches outside Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic have been destroyed including those in Nakhichevan. Australia In Australia, the government requires operators of mining towns to remove all traces of the town when it is abandoned. This has occurred in the case of Mary Kathleen, Goldsworthy and Shay Gap. Some towns have been lost or moved when dams are built. Belarus In 1988, two years after the Chernobyl disaster, the Belarussian government created the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve, a exclusion zone to protect people against the effects of radiation. 22,000 people lived there in the 96 settlements that were abandoned, including Aravichy and Dzernavichy, and the area has since been expanded by a further . Belgium In 1968 in the town of Doel, a building ban was implemented so that the port of antwerp could expand. Then an economic crisis occurred and this plan for expansion was halted. Then in 1998 another plan for expansion for the port of antwerp was released and most of the inhabitants left. Cyprus Villages have been abandoned as a result of the Cyprus dispute. Some of these are reported to be landmined.Cyprus, Landmine Monitor Report 1999 France A number of villages, mainly in the north and north western areas of the country, were destroyed during World War One and World War Two. A percentage of them were rebuilt next to the original sites, with the original villages remaining in a ruined state. Germany Winnefeld church ruin There are hundreds of abandoned villages, known as W√ºstungen, in Germany. Geographer Kurt Scharlau categorized the different types in the 1930s, making distinctions between temporary and permanent W√ºstung, settlements used for different purposes (farms or villages), and the extent of abandonment (partial or total).K. Scharlau, Beitr√§ge zur geographischen Betrachtung der W√ºstungen, Badische Geographische Abteilungen Vol. 10, Freiburg i. Br. 1933. His scheme has been expanded, and has been criticized for not taking into account expansion and regression. A distinction is commonly made between Flurw√ºstungen (farmed areas) and Ortsw√ºstungen (sites where buildings formerly stood) by archaeologists. The most drastic period of abandonment in modern times was during the 14th and 15th centuries ‚Äì before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this had been reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. As in Britain, the Black Death played a large role in this, as did the growth of large villages and towns, the Little Ice Age, the introduction of crop rotation, and war (in Germany, particularly the 30 Years War). In later times, the German Empire created a number of training grounds for the military that were eventually abandoned. Hong Kong Many villages in remote parts of the New Territories, Hong Kong, usually in valleys or on islands, have been abandoned due to inaccessibility. Residents go to live in urban areas with better job opportunities. Some villages have been moved to new sites to make way for reservoirs or new town development. See also walled villages of Hong Kong and list of villages in Hong Kong. Hungary Hundreds of villages were abandoned during the Ottoman wars in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16‚Äì17th century. Many of them were never repopulated and generally left few visible traces. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day Hungary, except the abandoned villages of Derenk (left in 1943) and Nagyg√©c (left in 1970). Due to the decrease of rural population beginning in the 1980s dozens of villages are now threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as \\"died out\\" was Gy≈±r≈±f≈± in the end of the 1970s but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Sometimes depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts like K√°n, Tornak√°polna, Szanticska, Gorica and R√©vfalu. India About ten million people, approximately one-third of the population of the affected area, are estimated to have died in the Bengal famine of 1770. Regions where the famine occurred included especially the modern Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, but the famine also extended into Odisha and Jharkhand as well as modern Bangladesh. Among the worst affected areas were Birbhum and Murshidabad in Bengal, and Tirhut, Champaran and Bettiah in Bihar. A partial shortfall in crops, considered normal, occurred in 1768 and was followed in late 1769 by more severe conditions. By September 1769 there was a severe drought, and alarming reports were coming in of rural distress. These were, however, ignored by company officers. By early 1770 there was starvation, and by mid-1770 deaths from starvation were occurring on a large scale. There were also reports of the living feeding on the bodies of the dead in the middle of that year. Smallpox and other diseases further took their toll of the population. Later in 1770 good rainfall resulted in a good harvest and the famine abated. However, other shortfalls occurred in the following years, raising the total death toll. As a result of the famine, large areas were depopulated and returned to jungle for decades to come as the survivors migrated en masse in a search for food. Many cultivated lands were abandoned ‚Äì much of Birbhum, for instance, returned to jungle and was virtually impassable for decades afterwards. From 1772 on, bands of bandits and thugs became an established feature of Bengal, and were only brought under control by punitive actions in the 1780s. Ireland Several villages in Ireland have been abandoned during the Middle Ages or later: Oliver Goldsmith's poem \\"The Deserted Village\\" (1770) being a famous commentary on rural depopulation. Notable deserted villages include: *Cannakill, County Offaly *Clonmines, County Wexford *Kilcornan, County Galway *Port, County Donegal *Rindoon, County Roscommon *Scattery Island, County Clare *Slievemore, Achill Island, County Mayo *Tonaroasty, County Galway Smaller rural settlements, known as clachans, were also abandoned in large numbers during the Great Famine (1845‚Äì50). Territory of the former British Mandate of Palestine including territory of Palestinian Authority and Gaza As a consequence of the 1948 Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Palestine war, around 720,000 Palestinian Arabs were displaced, leaving around 400 Palestinian Arab towns and villages depopulated in what became Israel. In addition, several Jewish communities in what became Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip were also depopulated. In August 2005, Israel evacuated Gush Katif and all other Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. Some structures in these settlements, including greenhouses and synagogues, were left standing after the withdrawal. Malta Ruins of Tal-Baqqari, an abandoned village near ≈ªurrieq Many small villages around Malta were abandoned between the 14th and 18th centuries. They were abandoned for several reasons, including corsair raids (such as the raid of 1429 and that of 1551), slow population decline, migration to larger villages as well as political changes such as the transfer of the capital from Mdina to Birgu in 1530, and to Valletta in 1571. Many villages were depopulated after a plague epidemic in 1592‚Äì93. Of Malta's ten original parishes in 1436, two (ƒ¶al Tartarni and Bir Miftuƒß) no longer exist, while others such as Mellieƒßa were abandoned but rebuilt at a later stage. The existence of many of the other villages is known only from militia lists, ecclesiastical or notarial documents, or lists of lost villages compiled by scholars such as Giovanni Francesco Abela. The villages usually consisted of a chapel which was surrounded by a number of farmhouses and other buildings. In some cases, such as ƒ¶al-Millieri and Bir Miftuƒß, the village disappeared but the chapel still exists. North Africa Oases and villages in North Africa have been abandoned due to the expansion of the Sahara desert. Romania Many Saxon villages in Transylvania became depopulated or abandoned when their German- speaking inhabitants emigrated to Germany in the 1990s. Russia Narmeln, the westernmost point of Russia, was a German village on the Vistula Spit until it became depopulated in 1945 during World War II. The Vistula Spit was split between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war, with Narmeln as the only settlement on the Soviet side. Narmeln was never repopulated as the Soviet side was made into an exclusion zone. Spain The abandoned village of Merades, Spain; part of the northernmost section of the ruins. Large zones of the mountainous Iberian System and the Pyrenees have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century. In Spain there are many ghost towns scattered across mountain areas especially in Teruel Province.Pueblos deshabitados - Collado de la Grulla (Teruel) The traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing on which the village economy was based were not taken over by the local youth after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century. The exodus from the rural mountainous areas in Spain rose steeply after General Franco's Plan de Estabilizaci√≥n in 1959. The population declined steeply as people emigrated towards the industrial areas of the large cities and the coastal towns where tourism grew exponentially.Despoblaci√≥n en Aragon The abandonment of agricultural land use practices drives the natural establishment of forests through ecological succession in Spain.Keenleyside, C., & Tucker, G.

Regarding biodiversity loss, The risk, research findings from Mediterranean showed that this is very site dependent. More recently, the abandonment of land is also discussed by some as an opportunity for rewilding in rural areas in Spain. Syria The Dead Cities are a group of abandoned villages in Northern Syria dating back to the times of Late Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire. They are a World Heritage Site.  Turkey Ukraine Following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a zone of exclusion was created and the entire population was evacuated to prevent exposure to radiation. Since then, a limited number of people have been allowed to return: 197 lived in the zone in 2012, down from 328 in 2007 and 612 in 1999. However, all of the villages and the main city of the region, Pripyat, are falling into decay. The only lived in settlement is Chernobyl which houses maintenance staff and scientists working at the nuclear power plant, although they can only live there for short periods of time. United Kingdom Many villages in the United Kingdom have been abandoned throughout history. It could be the result of natural events, such as rivers changing course or silting up, or coastal and estuarine erosion. Sometimes villages were deliberately cleared; the Harrying of the North caused widespread devastation in the winter of 1069‚Äì1070. In the 12th and 13th centuries, many villages were removed to make way for monasteries, and in the 18th century, it became fashionable for land-owning aristocrats to live in large mansions set in large landscaped parklands. Villages that obstructed the view were removed, although by the early 19th century it had become common to provide replacements. In modern times, a few villages have been abandoned due to reservoirs being built and the location being flooded. These include Capel Celyn in Gwynedd, Wales, Mardale Green in the English Lake District and two villages ‚Äì Ashopton and Derwent ‚Äì drowned by the Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire. In other cases, such as Tide Mills, East Sussex, Imber and Tyneham, the village lands have been converted to military training areas. Villages in Northumberland have been demolished to make way for open cast mines. Hampton-on-Sea was abandoned due to coastal erosion thought to have been exacerbated by the building of a pier. =Deserted medieval villages= In the United Kingdom, a deserted medieval village (DMV) is a settlement that was abandoned during the Middle Ages, typically leaving no trace apart from earthworks or cropmarks. If there are three or fewer inhabited houses, the convention is to regard the site as deserted; if there are more than three houses, it is regarded as shrunken. The commonest causes of DMVs include failure of marginal agricultural land and clearance and enclosure following depopulation after the Black Death. The study of the causes of each settlements desertion is an ongoing field of research. England has an estimated 3,000 DMVs. One of the best-known is Wharram Percy in North Yorkshire, where extensive archaeological excavations were conducted between 1948 and 1990. Its ruined church and former fishpond are still visible. Some other examples are Gainsthorpe in Lincolnshire, and Old Wolverton in Milton Keynes.The sequence leading to Old Wolverton's abandonment is given at History of Milton Keynes United StatesSee also *Ghost town *Ghost estate *Land recycling *Modern ruins *Medieval demography *Old field (ecology) References * Further reading *Beresford, Maurice (1954) The Lost Villages of England.

NLBS is intended for applications with relatively small data sets that rarely change (one example would be web pages), and do not have long-running in-memory states. These types of applications are called stateless applications, and typically include Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and virtual private networking (VPN) servers. Every client request to a stateless application is a separate transaction, so it is possible to distribute the requests among multiple servers to balance the load. One attractive feature of NLBS is that all servers in a cluster monitor each other with a heartbeat signal, so there is no single point of failure. In its current incarnation in Windows Server 2003, NLBS does not support automatic removal of a failed server from a cluster unless the server is completely offline, or if its NLBS service is stopped. For example, if a web server is returning an error page instead of correct content, it is still perceived as \\"alive\\" by NLBS. As such, a monitoring script is typically required on every participating node, which checks the correctness of local web page delivery, and calls the nlb.exe utility to add or remove itself from the cluster as needed. Configuration Tips: *The network load balancing service requires for all the machines to have the correct local time. Ensure the Windows Time Service is properly configured on all hosts to keep clocks synchronized. Unsynchronized times will cause a network login screen to pop up which doesn't accept valid login credentials. *The server console can't have any network card dialogue boxes open when you are configuring the \\"Network Load Balancing Manager\\" from your client machine. *You have to manually add each load balancing server individually to the load balancing cluster after you've created a cluster host. *To allow communication between servers in the same NLB cluster, each server requires the following registry entry: a DWORD key named \\"UnicastInterHostCommSupport\\" and set to 1, for each network interface card's GUID (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\WLBS\\\\Parameters\\\\Interface\\\\\\\\{GUID}) *NLBS may conflict with some Cisco routers, which are not able to resolve the IP address of the server and must be configured with a static ARP entry. History Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) is a feature of Windows NT that provides load balancing and clustering for applications. WLBS dynamically distributes IP traffic across multiple cluster nodes, and provides automatic failover in the event of node failure. WLBS was replaced by Network Load Balancing Services in Windows 2000. Auto fail over is also a part in this frame.

Initially known as Site 5, the township was renamed Masiphumelele by its residents, which is a Xhosa word meaning \\"let us succeed\\". About 400-500 people first settled in the area in the 1980s. During apartheid residents were continually removed to the suburb of Khayelitsha, over 30 km away, but the numbers began to grow as apartheid began to unravel from 1990. In 1990, about 8000 residents lived in the area, mostly in shacks, but by 2005, over 26000 people lived there, many in brick homes. In 2010, the population was estimated at 38000. Many are from the old Ciskei bantustan in the Eastern Cape. Amenities are scarce, with an overcrowded school, no police station, and an understaffed day clinic, while it's estimated that 30-40% of the community are infected with HIV and/or TB. SHAWCO, the University of Cape Town Student's Health And Welfare Centres Organisation, runs weekly supplementary clinics from the Masiphumelele clinic. History Masiphumelele has been the site of numerous protests over the years. Most of the protests have been connected to service delivery and anger over corruption in government housing projects. On May 12, 2008 a series of riots started in the township of Alexandra (in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg) when locals attacked migrants from Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Many African nationals were threatened, assaulted and displaced in the wave of Xenophobic violence that swept through South Africa, and in the following weeks the violence spread to Cape Town. Thousands of foreigners were displaced from Masiphumelele in the attacks of May 2008, most landing up at Soetwater refugee camp. Several days after immigrant-owned shops were looted and foreigners attacked, Masiphumelele residents publicly apologised and asked them to return. On May 2, 2011 a fire that started around 1 am engulfed and burned down an estimated 1500 informal and formal residences. The fire killed one and displaced an estimated 5000 people.

The publication of Darwin's theory brought into the open Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection, the culmination of more than twenty years of work. Thoughts on the possibility of transmutation of species which he recorded in 1836 towards the end of his five-year voyage on the Beagle were followed on his return by findings and work which led him to conceive of his theory in September 1838. He gave priority to his career as a geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, and to publication of the findings from the voyage as well as his journal of the voyage, but he discussed his evolutionary ideas with several naturalists and carried out extensive research on his \\"hobby\\" of evolutionary work. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when he received an essay from Alfred Russel Wallace who was in Borneo, describing Wallace's own theory of natural selection, prompting immediate joint publication of extracts from Darwin's 1844 essay together with Wallace's paper as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection in a presentation to the Linnaean Society on 1 July 1858. This attracted little notice, but spurred Darwin to write an \\"abstract\\" of his work which was published in 1859 as his book On the Origin of Species. Background Darwin's ideas developed rapidly from the return in 1836 of the Beagle survey expedition. By December 1838 he had developed the principles of his theory. At that time similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob. He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing. While he continued with research as his \\"prime hobby\\", his priority was an immense amount of work on geology and analysing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition. This was repeatedly delayed by illness. Natural history at that time was dominated by clerical naturalists whose income came from the Established Church of England and who saw the science of the day as revealing God's plan. Darwin found three close allies: Charles Lyell, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Huxley. Books by the eminent geologist Charles Lyell had influenced the young Darwin during the voyage, and he then befriended Darwin who he saw as a supporter of his ideas of gradual geological processes with continuing divine Creation of species. By the 1840s Darwin became friends with the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, who had followed his father into that science, and after going on a survey voyage used his contacts to eventually find a position. In the 1850s Darwin met Thomas Huxley, an ambitious naturalist who had returned from a long survey trip but lacked the family wealth or contacts to find a career and who joined the progressive group around Herbert Spencer fighting to make science a profession, freed from the clerics. Darwin made attempts to open discussions about his theory with his close scientific colleagues. In January 1842 Darwin sent a tentative description of his ideas in a letter to Lyell, then prepared a \\"Pencil Sketch\\" of his theory. He worked up his \\"Sketch\\" into an \\"Essay\\" in 1844, and eventually persuaded Hooker to read a copy in January 1847. His geology books and publication of Beagle findings were completed in 1846, when he began what became eight years of research into classification of barnacle species, exploring the immense amount of variation in nature. In September 1854 Darwin had the last of his barnacle monographs ready for publication, and he turned his attention fully to questions about how species originated. He freely discussed his intention to write a book on the subject, and planned avenues of research with other scientists. He went over his previous notes and writings on the topic, and drew up proposals for investigations and research into the implications of his theory. One topic was explaining geographical distribution of organisms; he got information from international correspondence, and experimented on the viability of methods of dispersal. He widened his investigations into variability in nature, and experimented on plant hybridisation and cross-fertilisation. Variation under domestication became a major topic of research: in 1855 he began to develop a web of contacts, both in the UK and worldwide, to get information on the origins and variation of domesticated animals, particularly poultry, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons. He got extensive information, specimens and ideas from Edward Blyth in India, who put him in contact with Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa. At the suggestion of William Yarrell, Darwin began pigeon breeding at Down House to investigate varieties of domestic pigeons, and gained access to the expertise of William Bernhard Tegetmeier who was glad to research aspects of interest to Darwin. From March, he also got information and specimens from his relative William Darwin Fox who bred poultry and ducks at his rectory in the parish of Delamere, Cheshire. In 1856 he was gradually bringing his friends round towards accepting evolution as a process, but was far from convincing them about the mechanism, when Wallace's entry into the discussion brought a new urgency to publication. Wallace Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist working as a specimen collector in Borneo, spent Christmas 1854 visiting Sir James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak, then during the ensuing rainy season lived alone in a little Dayak house, with only one Malay servant as cook. He recalled, \\"during the evening and wet days, I had nothing to do but look over my books\\". He had already read Lyell's Principles of Geology which opposed Lamarck by arguing that the fossil record showed no progress. Wallace had also read the 1845 second edition of Darwin's Journal of Researches which hinted at evolution by describing the \\"wonderful relationship in the same continent\\" between fossil and extant species, which would \\"throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts\\". In it, Darwin had described how species unique to the Gal√°pagos Islands \\"all show a marked relationship with those of America\\" despite its distance. ‚Äì the first edition called the relationship the \\"law of the succession of types\\"; Wallace had also been impressed by Pictet's studies of palaeontology, and was now annoyed by a recent article by Edward Forbes which dismissed evolutionary ideas and instead proposed that species were created in a pattern showing a divine plan of polarity. In February, Wallace completed his paper \\"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\\" which was published in September 1855 in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. This \\"Sarawak paper\\" countered Forbes, and showed Wallace's opinions. He incorporated points from Lyell, Darwin, Pictet and others, including Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. It combined these with Wallace's own observations to support his conclusion that \\"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\\". This was a theory of a succession of species, but referred to \\"creation\\" rather than explicitly proposing an evolutionary mechanism [in 1905 Wallace recalled that he left descent to be inferred]. Brooke read it as either a series of creations or one species growing into another, and in 1856 told Wallace he had no objection to the latter. Wallace had told him that the paper was to \\"feel the pulse of scientific men\\" about the hypothesis, and Brooke was indignant at the suggestion that \\"bigotry & intolerance\\" would be aroused by novel views: this would explain Wallace's ambiguity.Brooke, James. (1856), [WCP3073.3041: Letter from Brooke, James to Wallace, Alfred Russel, Sarawak, dated 4 July 1856]. In : Beccaloni, G. W. (Ed.). Wallace Letters Online, accessed 20 December 2016 Lyell's resistance to Darwin's evolutionary ideas was shaken by the paper; in November 1855 Lyell began writing species notebooks, starting with a note about Wallace. On 8 December Edward Blyth wrote from Calcutta to ask Darwin for his views on the paper. Blyth thought it \\"Good! Upon the whole!\\" and said \\"according to his theory, the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species.\\" It is not known when Darwin read this letter. During December 1855, Darwin extended his research into variation under domestication with letters to nearly 30 people around the world, requesting their help in obtaining specimens of \\"Any domestic breed or race, of Poultry, Pigeons, Rabbits, Cats, & even dogs, if not too large, which has been bred for many generations in any little visited region.\\" As Blyth had suggested earlier, Darwin wrote on 9 December to Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa, and said that he was \\"collecting all the facts & reasoning which I could, in regard to the variation & origin of species\\", particularly pigeons. On 24 December Darwin wrote to the diplomat Sir Charles Murray in Persia, similarly saying he had \\"for many years been working on the perplexed subject of the origin of varieties & species, & for this purpose I am endeavouring to study the effects of domestication\\". Letters also went to Brooke, and to Wallace via his agent Samuel Stevens. In August 1856 Wallace told Stevens that specimens for Darwin were included in a shipment. In November Darwin wrote to tell William Bernhardt Tegetmeier that a box of Persian poultry specimens from Murray had arrived, and \\"Mr Wallace is collecting in the Malay Archipelago\\". Wallace's \\"Sarawak paper\\" was included in the July‚ÄìDecember 1855 volume of the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Darwin jotted comments in his copy of this volume: \\"Laws of Geograph. Distrib. nothing very new\\", and \\"Uses my simile of tree‚Äî It seems all creation with him\\", but \\"he puts the facts in striking point of view\\". He noted Wallace's point that geological knowledge was imperfect, and commented \\"put generation for creation & I quite agree\\". In December 1857 Darwin still thought Wallace was proposing creation as an explanation, and told him \\"I believe I go much further than you\\". \\"Natural Selection\\" When Lyell and his wife visited the Darwins at Downe from 13 to 16 April 1856, Darwin explained his theory to Lyell, who then wrote up notes headed \\"With Darwin: On the Formation of Species by Natural Selection\\", with pigeons as one example. At another Down House party on 26‚Äì27 April, Darwin had long discussions with his guests Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston. Lyell subsequently heard that they \\"ran a tilt against species farther I believe than they are deliberately prepared to go. ... I cannot easily see how they can go so far, and not embrace the whole Lamarckian doctrine.\\" On 1 May Lyell wrote to urge Darwin to establish priority: \\"I wish you would publish some small fragment of your data pigeons if you please & so out with the theory & let it take date‚Äî& be cited‚Äî& understood.\\" Darwin replied on 3 May: \\"With respect to your suggestion of a sketch of my view; I hardly know what to think, but will reflect on it; but it goes against my prejudices. To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for every proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were to do anything it could only refer to the main agency of change, selection,‚Äî& perhaps point out a very few of the leading features which countenance such a view, & some few of the main difficulties. But I do not know what to think: I rather hate the idea of writing for priority, yet I certainly shd be vexed if any one were to publish my doctrines before me.\\" On Thursday 8 May, while in London for meetings, Darwin visited Lyell. In a letter to Hooker the next day, Darwin said he \\"had good talk with Lyell about my species work, & he urges me strongly to publish something. I am fixed against any periodical or Journal, as I positively will not expose myself to an Editor or Council allowing a publication for which they might be abused\\". If he published, it could only be \\"a very thin & little volume, giving a sketch of my views & difficulties; but it is really dreadfully unphilosophical to give a resum√©, without exact references, of an unpublished work\\". Lyell appeared to think it could be done \\"at the suggestion of friends\\" as Darwin had \\"been at work for 18 years, & yet could not publish for several years\\". Hooker's response encouraging publication was welcomed by Darwin, who thought his suggestion \\"that the Essay might supersede & take away all novelty & value from my future larger Book, is very true; & that would grieve me beyond everything. On the other hand, (again from Lyell‚Äôs urgent advice) I published a preliminary sketch of Coral Theory & this did neither good nor harm.‚Äî I begin most heartily to wish that Lyell had never put this idea of an Essay into my head.\\" On 14 May 1856 Darwin noted in his journal that he had begun his \\"species sketch\\". By July, Darwin had decided to produce Natural Selection as a full technical treatise on species. Lyell seemed to be coming round to Darwin's ideas, but in private was agonising over the social implications if humans had animal ancestry, particularly now that race was becoming an issue, with Robert Knox describing races as different species and warning of racial wars. Hooker's verdict on the growing manuscript was \\"incomparably more favourable\\" than Darwin had anticipated, while Darwin tried to put over the point that \\"external conditions do extremely little\\", it was the selection of \\"chance\\" variations that produced new species. Darwin's experiments on how species spread were now extended to considering how animals such as snails could be carried on birds' feet, and seeds in birds' droppings. His tenth child, Charles Waring Darwin was born on 6 December apparently without his full share of intelligence, renewing fears of inbreeding and hereditary defects, a topic that he covered in principle in his book. Darwin's cousin William Darwin Fox continued to give hims strong support, warning him against overworking on his huge book and recommending a holiday, but Darwin was immersed in his experiments and his writing. \\"I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could set less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than I do, but not, I think, to any extreme degree; yet, if I know myself, I would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my Book wd be published for ever anonymously\\". On 23 February 1857 the Darwins were visited for lunch by Robert FitzRoy, who had been the captain of HMS Beagle during Darwin's voyage, together with his second wife, his first wife and his only daughter having died. =Struggle for existence= Alfred Tennyson wrote his great poem \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" which introduced the phrase \\"Nature, red in tooth and claw\\", and Darwin worked on The Struggle for Existence. A discussion with Thomas Huxley on how jellyfish might cross-fertilise got the witty response that \\"the indecency of the process is to a certain extent in favour of its probability\\". In July 1856 Darwin passed Huxley's remark on to Hooker with the comment, \\"What a book a Devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low & horridly cruel works of nature!\\", apparently a reference to the nickname given to the Radical Revd. Robert Taylor who had visited Cambridge on an \\"infidel home missionary tour\\" when Darwin was a student there (though the term goes back to Chaucer's Parson's Tale). Darwin pressed on with writing his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, overworking, until in March 1857 illness began cutting his working day \\"ridiculously short\\". Eventually, he took a fortnight's water treatment at the nearby Moor Park spa run by Edward Lane, and this revived him. Wallace had been working for Darwin, sending domestic fowl specimens from Indonesia, and a letter he had written in October reached Darwin at the spa. On 1 May Darwin replied, agreeing with Wallace's 1855 paper \\"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\\": \\"I can see that we have thought much alike & to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. ... This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first-note-book, on the question how & in what way do species & varieties differ from each other.‚Äî I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years.\\" He agreed with Wallace that \\"climatal conditions\\" had little effect, and wrote \\"It is really impossible to explain my views in the compass of a letter on the causes & means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct & tangible idea.‚Äî Whether true or false others must judge\\". Darwin returned home in early May, but a cold and social pressure set him back. He had to return to the spa, finishing \\"variation\\" in July and posting pages to Huxley for checking. Working class militants were seizing on the popularity of gorillas (which were now appearing in travelling menageries) to trumpet man's monkey origins. To crush these ideas, Richard Owen as President-elect of the Royal Association announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains showing that humans were not just a separate species, but a separate sub-class. In July 1857, Darwin commented to Hooker, \\"Owen's is a grand Paper; but I cannot swallow Man making a division as distinct from a Chimpanzee, as an ornithorhynchus from a Horse: I wonder what a Chimpanzee wd. say to this?\\". = Asa Gray and the young guard = Others helped with providing information, including Asa Gray on American plants. Darwin wrote to Gray on 20 July 1857 saying that after 19 years of work on the question of whether species \\"have descended from other species, like varieties from one species\\" and \\"that species arise like our domestic varieties with much extinction\\", he had \\"come to the heteredox conclusion that there are no such things as independently created species ‚Äì that species are only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make you despise me. ‚Äì I do not much underrate the many huge difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false.\\" An intrigued Gray admitted to his own notion that there was some law or power inherent in plants making varieties appear, and asked if Darwin was finding this law. Realising that Gray had not grasped what he was suggesting, Darwin sent him a letter on 5 September outlining the difficulties involved. He enclosed a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas on natural selection and divergence, copied out by the schoolmaster to make it more legible.. Gray responded, questioning his use of the term \\"natural selection\\" as an agent. In his reply Darwin said that he had to use this shorthand to save incessantly having to expand it into a formula such as \\"the tendency to the preservation (owing to the severe struggle for life to which all organic beings at some time or generation are exposed) of any the slightest variation in any part, which is of the slightest use or favourable to the life of the individual which has thus varied; together with the tendency to its inheritance\\". He asked Gray to maintain secrecy. The young guard of naturalists were now putting the \\"mode of creation\\" openly on the agenda, even in addresses to the Geological Society, but Darwin wanted his case to be fully prepared. Joseph Dalton Hooker, John Tyndall and Thomas Huxley now formed a group of young naturalists holding Darwin in high regard, basing themselves in the Linnean Society of London which had just moved to Burlington House, Piccadilly, London, near the Royal Society. Huxley had not yet understood natural selection despite Darwin's hints about pedigree and genealogical trees. Huxley's attention was focussed on defeating the dominant orthodoxy of the arrogant Owen.  The country squire  Darwin's attention turned from pigeons to seedlings, experimenting with subjecting plants to conditions which might produce variation. His family helped with this and with tracking bees, experimenting (unsuccessfully) to try to find out what would influence their flight path. His wife Emma Darwin was now known throughout the parish for helping in the way a parson's wife might be expected to, and as well as providing nursing care for her own family's frequent illnesses, she gave out bread tokens to the hungry and \\"small pensions for the old, dainties for the ailing, and medical comforts and simple medicine\\" based on Robert Darwin's old prescription book. Charles Darwin also took on local duties, increasing his social standing by becoming a Justice of the Peace and a magistrate. To accommodate the needs of his large family and accommodate visiting cousins further house extensions got under way. In November 1857 he escaped the worries for a week's recuperation at Lane's Moor Park spa.  Human origins, Wallace encouraged  During his research in 1856, Darwin noted his intention to publish his views on human racial ancestry: by early September of that year while drafting his book on Natural Selection he began collecting notes for Chapter 6 on the topic of sexual selection. This would cover humans as well as birds and fishes. By 31 March 1857 he had drafted five chapters with the sixth under way, and he wrote out a table of contents. In the following months he completed ten pages of Chapter 6, some 2,500 words, and pencilled in the heading \\"Theory applied to Races of Man\\". At this stage he regarded sexual selection as due to a \\"struggle for supremacy\\" between males, and did not yet think of female choice as significant. He then apparently dropped the whole topic for some reason, possibly Charles Lyell's caution: the brief abstract Darwin sent to Asa Gray on 5 September made no mention of sexual selection or human evolution. Wallace, responding to Darwin's 1 May letter, discussed his own theorising. Darwin replied on 22 December that he was \\"extremely glad to hear that you are attending to distribution in accordance with theoretical ideas. I am a firm believer, that without speculation there is no good & original observation\\", and added that \\"I believe I go much further than you; but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative notions.\\" He also said \\"You ask whether I shall discuss 'man';‚ÄîI think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist.\\" Huxley used his March 1858 Royal Institution lecture to claim that structurally gorillas are as close to humans as they are to baboons. He added \\"Nay more I believe that the mental & moral faculties are essentially & fundamentally the same kind in animals & ourselves\\". This was a clear challenge to Owen's lecture claiming human uniqueness, given at the same venue. In a subsequent lecture Huxley stated that if there was a solution to the problem of species, it \\"must come from the side of indefinite modifiability\\", an indication that he was moving towards Darwin's position. In June he used his lecture at the Royal Society to attack Owen's \\"etherial archetype\\". Having gained a foothold in science with the aid of the Westminster Review group led by John Chapman and Herbert Spencer, Huxley was out to dislodge the domination of science by wealthy clergymen‚Äì led by Owen‚Äì instead wanting to create a professional salaried scientific civil service. To Spencer, animal species had developed by \\"adaptions upon adaptions\\". Huxley was using arguments on origins to split science from theology, arguing that \\"it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt\\". =Forestalled= Darwin was throwing himself into his work and his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection was well under way, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace. It enclosed about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, an unexpected response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell. Shocked that he had been \\"forestalled\\", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,Ball, P. (2011).

A new theory to explain the receipt of Wallace's Ternate Essay by Darwin in 1858. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01808.x with a letter: There were differences, though these were not evident to Darwin on reading the paper. Wallace's idea of selection was the environment eliminating the unfit rather than cut-throat competition among individuals, and he took an egalitarian view of the Dayak natives he was among, while Darwin had seen the Fuegians as backwards savages, albeit capable of improvement. It had come at a bad time, as his favourite retreat at Moor Spa was threatened by Lane being put on trial accused of adultery, and five days later Darwin's baby Charles Waring came down with scarlet fever. Darwin's first impression had been that though it meant losing priority, it would be dishonourable for him to be \\"induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace is in the field\\", but Lyell quickly responded strongly urging him to reconsider. Darwin's reply of 25 June was a plea for advice, noting that the points in Wallace's sketch had been fully covered in his own Essay of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and that he had also set out his ideas in a letter to Asa Gray in 1857, \\"so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself that I can do so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit\\". He added a request that Hooker be informed to give a second opinion. Darwin was overwrought when baby Charles Waring Darwin died on 28 June, and the next day acknowledged Hooker's letters saying \\"I cannot think now on the subject, but soon will.\\" That night he read the letters, and to meet Hooker's request, though \\"quite prostrated\\", got his servant to deliver Wallace's essay, the letter to Asa Gray and \\"my sketch of 1844 solely that you may see by your own handwriting that you did read it\\". He left matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker, writing \\"Do not waste much time. It is miserable in me to care at all about priority.\\"  Publication of joint paper  Lyell and Hooker agreed on a joint paper to be presented at the Linnean Society ‚Äì Lyell, Hooker and Darwin were all fellows of the society and council members, and Hooker had been closely involved in reviving the fortunes of the society and running its journal. Other venues were either inappropriate, or in the case of the Zoological Society of London, potentially hostile under the leadership of Richard Owen. It was now time for the summer break but, as they knew, its meeting had been postponed due to the death of former president Robert Brown on 10 June 1858, and the council had arranged an extra meeting on 1 July. At the last minute, late in the evening of 30 June, Lyell and Hooker forwarded the Wallace and Darwin papers to the Secretary John Joseph Bennett, to be read at the meeting the next day. Mrs. Hooker had spent the afternoon copying out extracts from the handwritten documents Darwin had sent with his letter of the previous night, presumably chosen by Hooker to suit the verbal presentation, and Lyell and Hooker wrote a short introductory letter. The papers entitled respectively On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, incorporated Wallace's pages; and extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray. At the meeting the Secretary read the papers out, before going on to six other papers, and there was no discussion of them at the end of the meeting, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with including an obituary notice for Robert Brown given by Lyell, or possibly due to reluctance to speak out against a theory supported by the eminent Lyell and Hooker. Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition, presided over the meeting. He apparently disapproved, and in his annual presidential report presented in May 1859 wrote that \\"The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear\\". However, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.. As might be expected, the joint paper alerted those subscribers who met the argument for the first time in print, and whose minds were prepared by prior struggles with the species question. Alfred Newton, who held the chair in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge from 1866 to 1907, wrote this: \\"I sat up late that night to read it [the Linnean Society paper]; and never shall I forget the impression it made upon me. Herein was contained a perfectly simple solution of all the difficulties which had been troubling me for months past. I hardly know whether I at first felt more vexed at the solution not having occurred to me than pleased that it had been found at all\\" (he was not alone in that thought!‚Äîsee T.H. Huxley). Newton remained a Darwinian for the rest of his life. (Wollaston 1921 p112; see also Newton 1888) While the meeting took place, Darwin was attending his son's funeral. His family moved to his sister- in-law's in Sussex to escape the fever, which eventually killed six children in the village of Downe. It had been a frightening and miserable fortnight, but he was \\"more than satisfied\\" with the outcome of the meeting. He then took his children to the seaside at the Isle of Wight and pushed ahead with an \\"abstract\\" of Natural Selection which again began growing to book size. He returned to the Moor Park spa with stomach ailments. Wallace's reaction, delivered in January 1859, was that he was gratified to have spurred Darwin into making the announcement and that it would have caused him \\"much pain & regret\\" if his papers had been published on their own, without Darwin's papers. Darwin was still sensitive on the point, and assured Wallace that he \\"had absolutely nothing whatever to do with leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought was a fair course of action\\". He responded to Wallace's enquiry about what Lyell thought of the theory by saying that \\"I think he is somewhat staggered, but does not give in and speaks with horror [of] what a job it would be for the next edition of \\"The Principles\\" [of Geology] if he were \\"perverted\\". But he is most candid and honest, and I think he will end up by being \\"perverted\\".\\" Lyell was still struggling to come to terms with the idea of mankind, with immortal soul, originating from animals, but \\"Considering his age, his former views and position in society, I think his conduct has been heroic on the subject.\\"  Publication of the \\"Origin of Species\\"  Darwin was now working hard on an \\"abstract\\" trimmed from his Natural Selection, writing much of it from memory. The chapters were sent to Hooker for correcting as they were completed, which led to a minor disaster when a large bundle was put by accident into the drawer Hooker's wife used to keep paper for the children to draw on. Lyell made arrangements with the publisher John Murray, who had brought out the second edition of The Voyage of the Beagle. Darwin fretted, asking \\"Does he know all the subject of the book?\\", and saying that to avoid being more \\"un-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable\\" he did not discuss the origin of man, or bring in any discussion about Genesis. Unusually, Murray agreed to publish the manuscript sight unseen, and to pay Darwin two-thirds of the net proceeds. He anticipated printing 500 copies. Title page of the first edition of On the Origin of Species Darwin had decided to call his book An Abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties through Natural Selection, but with Murray's persuasion it was eventually reduced to the snappier On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection. The full title reads On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, with races referring to varieties of domestic and wild organisms and not to human groups. By the end of May, Darwin's health had failed again, but after a week's hydrotherapy he was able to start correcting the proofs. He struggled on despite rarely being able to write free of stomach pains for more than twenty minutes at a stretch, and made drastic revisions which left Murray with a huge ¬£72 bill for corrections. Murray upped the print run to 1,250 copies, with a publication date in November. A copy was sent to Lyell, with a \\"foolishly anxious\\" Darwin hoping that he would \\"come round\\". An eager Lyell gave Darwin \\"very great kudos\\", though he was still concerned that \\"the dignity of man is at stake\\". One of Lyell's relatives commented that it was \\"sure to be very curious and important... however mortifying it may be to think that our remote ancestors were jelly fishes\\". Darwin was \\"sorry to say that I have no 'consolatory view' on the dignity of man. I am content that man will probably advance, and care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a remotely distant future.\\" On 1 October Darwin finished the proofs, suffering from fits of vomiting. He then went off for a two-month stay at Wells House, a hydropathic establishment in the town of Ilkley. He was joined by his family for a time of \\"frozen misery\\" in the unusually early winter. Darwin wrote \\"I have been very bad lately, having had an awful 'crisis' one leg swelled like elephantiasis ‚Äì eyes almost closed up ‚Äì covered with a rash & fiery Boils; but they tell me it will surely do me much good ‚Äì it was like living in Hell.\\" On 2 November he was pleased to receive from Murray a specimen copy bound in royal green cloth, priced at fifteen shillings. Presentation copies were sent out by Murray, and on 11 and 12 November, still at the spa, Darwin wrote notes to go with these complimentary copies. He disarmingly anticipated their reactions: to Asa Gray \\"there are very many serious difficulties\\", to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow \\"I fear you will not approve of your pupil\\", to Louis Agassiz \\"[not sent in] a spirit of defiance or bravado\\" and to Richard Owen \\"it will seem 'an abomination'.\\", amongst others. For Wallace's copy he wrote \\"God knows what the public will think\\". =Origin of Species goes on sale= On the Origin of Species was first published on 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, 1,192 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book would be widely circulated. By then the novelist Charles Kingsley, a Christian socialist country rector, had sent Darwin a letter of praise (dated 18 November) regarding the presentation copy he had received: it was \\"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development...as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made.\\" In the second edition Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \\"a celebrated author and divine\\".

They were soft caps, shaped like a squat cylinder or close fitting like a knit cap, and usually heavily embroidered with a tassel on top. They were originally worn for warmth, but continued with their new use after improvements in Victorian heating. They were popular in the period 1840-1880, and usually used by gentlemen in the privacy of their homes. The need for smoking caps, and smoking wear generally, arose from the social more of not smoking in front of women, and not smelling of smoke when one returned to their presence. They were often a gift from females, who made them themselves to give to male partners. They were often worn with a smoking jacket, but while the jacket was more or less de rigueur, the cap was optional. Neither was worn by everyone, as smoking was not as popular as it became in the twentieth century,Christopher Hibbert, The Horizon Book of Daily Life in Victorian England, p. 14, American Heritage Publishing Company, 1975 . although they could also be worn as part of a man's loungewear outfit with no connection to smoking.

The rising scale for the octave is a single tone followed by two conjoint tetrachords of this type. This is roughly the same as playing all the white notes of a piano from A to A: A  B C D E  (E) F G A.

Charenton was first under monastic rule, then Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul took over the asylum after their founding. Although the town itself was the location of the headquarters of the French Huguenots in the 1500s and 1600s, the founders of Charenton were Catholic. At the time, many hospitals and asylums were Catholic institutions after the Council of Trent and the counter reformation. Charenton was known for its humanitarian treatment of patients, especially under its director the Abb√© de Coulmier in the early 19th century. He showed a remarkable aptitude for understanding Psychoanalytic theory. He used the technique of art therapy to help patients manifest their madness through physical art forms. Now permanently closed, the psychiatric hospital is known as the Esquirol Hospital ( or '), after Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol who directed the institution in the 19th century. The 1845 structure's architect was √âmile Gilbert.  History  Charenton was founded as a hospital for the poor in 13 September 1641 by the Fr√®res de la Charit√© after receiving a donation from S√©bastien Leblanc, an advisor to Louis XIII. Initially the hospital consisted of a single house containing 5 beds. Starting September 1660 the mentally ill were required to be cared for in hospitals as per a government mandate. Care at Charenton shifted to reflect this change, prioritizing care for more privileged members of the population with mental symptoms. Demand for care grew throughout the 18th century and the Fr√®res de la Charit√© acquired additional land, including the area of Charenton Saint-Maurice, to ensure there was sufficient space for more patients. In 1804 Fran√ßois Simonnet de Coulmiers became the director of the asylum, which was named the \\"Maison Nationale de Charenton\\" at the time. Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol became the chief physician of the hospital in 1826.  Practices  Later on in the 18th century, hospitals and asylums shifted away from brutal treatments to more humane solutions, later including psychotherapy. In 1804, after the Marquis de Sade was transferred from the Bastille, director Fran√ßois Simonnet de Coulmier, a Catholic priest, employed the use of psycho-drama therapy by allowing patients to organize and act in their own plays.De Saussure, Raymond. \\"Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences.\\" Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 3, no. 3, 1948, pp. 452‚Äì452. Coulmier was known for using this and other forms of psychotherapy rather than the inhumane treatments exhibited at other facilities to encourage alternative forms of expression. However, his psychodrama therapy came under fire by Esquirol and others who criticized him for employing a fruitless treatment and turning the patients into an exhibit to the public. Despite the tendency to use more humane therapies, not all patients necessarily lived pleasant lives in the asylum. Hersilie Rouy, a thirty-nine-year old French musician, was admitted to Charenton and complained of the subpar living conditions and \\"tortuous therapy\\" that also made women more vulnerable to the mismanagement by the institution.  Famous prisoners  Famous prisoners were held in the Charenton asylum including Jean Henri Latude, the Comte de Sanois and the Marquis de Sade (from 1801 until his death in 1814 at the age of 74). De Sade was arrested for his works Justine and Juliette, and was later transferred to Charenton without a trial after his opponents declared him insane. Pierre Gaveaux was a French operatic tenor and composer who was sent to Charenton in 1819 until his death in 1825. The noted Belgian-born musicologist and composer J√©r√¥me-Joseph de Momigny also died at the Charenton asylum, in 1842. The caricaturist Andr√© Gill died there in 1885. Poet Paul Verlaine was interned in 1887 and again in 1890. Artist Charles Meryon died at the asylum in 1868. Composer Fran√ßois Devienne died in the asylum in 1803. The mathematician Andr√© Bloch spent the last three decades of his life there, and mathematician Joseph-√âmile Barbier also stayed there before being found and brought back into academia by Joseph Bertrand. At the time, many believed that with a degree of insanity came the ability to be more creative and have \\"access to greater truths.\\"  Significant Physicians of Charenton  Antoine Laurent Jess√© Bayle, a French physician who practiced at Charenton, researched using postmortem evidence which concluded in 1822 that general paresis of the insane, or GPI, resulted from chronic inflammation of a brain area. This challenged the established belief at the time that the mental and physical symptoms, such as paralysis, were present before the inflammation, not as a result of a larger disease.Nitrini, Ricardo. \\"The Cure of One of the Most Frequent Types of Dementia: A Historical Parallel.\\" Ovid. N.p., July 2005. Web. 1 March 2017. The physician Jean-√âtienne Dominique Esquirol used leeches, tepid baths, emetic purging, laxatives, and exercise at Charenton, in addition to psychotherapy. Louis-Florentin Calmeil, who succeeded Esquirol as director, also used leeching as a way to treat monomania.  Marat/Sade  The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis Sade, which is usually simplified to Marat/Sade, is a play written by Peter Weiss in which de Sade directs a play featuring the inmates as actors. During his time at Charenton, de Sade did direct plays at the facility. Marat/Sade depicted the controversy surrounding de Sade, in which French officials criticized the asylum for giving him an elevated status though a lunatic and prisoner. These plays were considered a form of treatment thought to help patients get better by learning new ways to express suppressed feelings. Despite being a subject of controversy, the practice spread from Charenton to other asylums in Europe. The play has been reprised in many forms and forums. The 1967 film adaptation featured many of the original players, and utilized the long version of the play's name in its opening credits, although this was frequently shortened to Marat/Sade in publicity materials. The screenplay was written by Adrian Mitchell. Peter Brook directed a cast that included Ian Richardson, Patrick Magee, Glenda Jackson, Michael Williams, Freddie Jones and Clifford Rose.

The Ni√±os H√©roes are a key part of Mexico's patriotic lore, now commemorated by a national holiday on September 13. Several modern Mexican historians contend that parts of the narrative are not factual.inter alia, Villalpando, Jos√© Manuel; Ni√±os H√©roes, M√©xico DF: Planeta, 2004; Hern√°ndez Silva, HC: \\"¬øQui√©n avent√≥ a Juan Escutia?\\", La Jornada, December 13, 1998; Rosas, Alejandro \\"Una historia mal contada: Los Ni√±os H√©roes\\", Relatos e Historias en M√©xico, year II No. 13, September 2009. The narrative of the Ni√±os Heroes has played an important role in shaping historical memory in Mexico since 1847, a source of pride at the bravery of the martyred boy cadets in defending Mexico's honor, but in the mid-twentieth century, they have also been a means by which the Mexican and U.S. governments have come to a more harmonious relationship.Van Wagenen, Michael Scott. Remembering the Forgotten War: The Enduring Legacies of the U.S.-Mexican War. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press 2012, pp. 138-152. The Battle of Chapultepec Built in the eighteenth century by a viceroy, Chapultepec Castle did not serve as a residence until the late nineteenth century. After independence it served as the Military Academy, training officers for the Mexican Army. At the time of the U.S. invasion, it was defended by Mexican troops under the command of Nicol√°s Bravo and General Jos√© Mariano Monterde, including cadets from the academy. Bravo gave Santa Anna the assignment to defend this strategic location defending Mexico City. Two thousand soldiers were needed, but Santa Anna could only commit 832, most of whom were from National Guardsmen and not the regular army.DePalo, William A., Jr. The Mexican National Army, 1822‚Äì1852. College Station, TX: Texas A&M; University Press, 1997, pp. 137‚Äì38 The number of cadets present has been variously given, from 47 to a few hundred. The greatly outnumbered defenders battled General Winfield Scott's troops for about two hours before General Bravo ordered retreat, but the six cadets refused to fall back and fought to the death. Despite the castle's position 200 feet above ground level, there were not enough men to defend it. Legend has it that the last of the six, Juan Escutia, leapt from Chapultepec Castle wrapped in the Mexican flag to prevent the flag from being taken by the enemy. According to the later account of an unidentified US officer, \\"about a hundred\\" cadets between the ages of 10 and 19 were among the \\"crowds\\" of prisoners taken after the Castle's capture. The cadets Monument to the Ni√±os H√©roes in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Juan de la Barrera was born in 1828 in Mexico City, the son of Ignacio Mario de la Barrera, an army general, and Juana Inz√°rruaga. He enlisted at the age of 12 and was admitted to the Academy on 18 November 1843. During the attack on Chapultepec he was a lieutenant in the military engineers (sappers) and died defending a gun battery at the entrance to the park. Aged 19, he was the oldest of the six, and was also part of the school faculty as a volunteer teacher in engineering. Juan Escutia was born between 1828 and 1832 in Tepic, now the capital of the state of Nayarit. Records show he was admitted to the Academy as a cadet on 8 September 1847‚Äîfive days before the fateful battle‚Äîbut his other papers were lost during the assault. He is often portrayed as a second lieutenant in an artillery company. He is the cadet who is said to have wrapped himself up in the Mexican flag and jumped from the roof to keep it from falling into enemy hands. Francisco M√°rquez was born in 1834 in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Following the death of his father, his mother, Micaela Paniagua, remarried Francisco Ortiz, a cavalry captain. He applied to the Academy on 14 January 1847 and, at the time of the battle, belonged to the first company of cadets. A note included in his personnel record says his body was found on the east flank of the hill, alongside that of Juan Escutia. At 13 years old, he was the youngest of the six heroes. Agust√≠n Melgar was born between 1828 and 1832 in Chihuahua, Chihuahua. He was the son of Esteban Melgar, a lieutenant colonel in the army, and Mar√≠a de la Luz Sevilla, both of whom died while he was still young, leaving him the ward of his older sister. He applied to the Academy on 4 November 1846. A note in his personnel record explains that after finding himself alone, he tried to stop the enemy on the north side of the castle. It also explains he shot and killed one and took refuge behind mattresses in one of the rooms. Grievously wounded he was placed on a table and found dead beside it on 15 September, after the castle fell. In 2012, a statue honoring him was erected in Chihuahua.[https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205225/https://larednoticias.com/noticias.cfm?n=87681 \\"Recuerdan gesta heroica del cadete Agust√≠n Melgar\\" 29 August 2012, accessed 4 May 2020 Fernando Montes de Oca was born between 1828 and 1832 in Azcapotzalco, then a town just to the north of Mexico City and now one of its boroughs. His parents were Jos√© Mar√≠a Montes de Oca and Josefa Rodr√≠guez. He had applied to the Academy on 24 January 1847, and was one of the cadets who remained in the castle. His personnel record reads: \\"Died for his country on 13 September 1847.\\" Vicente Su√°rez was born in 1833 in Puebla, Puebla, the son of Miguel Su√°rez, a cavalry officer, and Mar√≠a de la Luz Ortega. He applied for admission to the Academy on 21 October 1845, and during his stay was an officer cadet. A note in his record reads: \\"Killed defending his country at his sentry post on 13 September 1847. He ordered the attackers to stop, but they continued to advance. He shot one and stabbed another in the stomach with his bayonet, and was killed at his post in hand-to-hand combat. He was killed for his bravery, because his youthfulness made the attackers hesitate, until he attacked them.\\" File:Juan de la Barrera.jpgJuan de la Barrera File:Juan escutia.jpgCadet Juan Escutia File:Francisco Marquez.jpgCadet Francisco M√°rquez There were 40 cadets who survived the attack and were taken prisoner. One, Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez Arangoity, designed the 1881 cenotaph commemorating the cadets. Two of them, Miguel Miram√≥n and Manuel Ram√≠rez de Arellano, went on to become generals in the Mexican army. Both collaborated with the French Intervention in Mexico 1862‚Äì1867.DePalo, William A., Jr. The Mexican National Army, 1822‚Äì1852. College Station TX: Texas A&M; University Press, 199. pp. 137‚Äì38. Memorials and historical memory The narrative of the Ni√±os H√©roes became a way that Mexico could begin to grapple with the country's defeat in the U.S. invasion, but monuments to the boy martyrs were not built until Mexico had fought the War of the Reform (1857-69) and expelled the French Second Mexican Empire (1862-67). A group of former cadets formed the Association of the Military Academy and succeeded in 1881 in erecting a cenotaph of modest size (pictured) at the foot of the hill on which Chapultepec Castle sits. This monument, known as the Obelisco a los Ni√±os H√©roes, was the main monument to the boy martyrs in Mexico City until the mid- twentieth century, when the Monumento a los Ni√±os H√©roes was inaugurated at the entrance to Chapultepec Park in 1952. The cenotaph had the names of the fallen cadets and those who were captured and became a site of commemoration by the association that erected it as well as for Mexican officials and ordinary citizens. On March 5, 1947 U.S. President Harry S. Truman placed a wreath at the cenotaph and stood for a few moments of silent reverence. Asked by American reporters why he had gone to the monument, Truman said, \\"Brave men don't belong to any one country. I respect bravery wherever I see it.\\"McCullough, David (1993) Truman. New York: Simon & Schuster.David McCullough's account of Truman's visit to the monument in 1947. As the centennial of the war approached, there were calls to recover the remains of the cadets, so that a memorial that was also a burial site could honor their bravery. The 1881 cenotaph honored them, but did not have the significance of a burial site. The Mexican government acceded to the request of the Mexican Army and the Military Academy to find the remains, but work did not begin until after President Truman's 1947 visit. The concerted search for the bones was no easy task. During the war, the dead were quickly buried for sanitary reasons, near where they fell, so that there were the remains of around 600 in Chapultepec Park. Several sites were excavated. A mass grave was found on the southern hillside of Chapultepec Hill. Six bodies were officially identified as belonging to the six deceased cadets of 1847, but a later investigation \\"alleged that the sappers found numerous skeletons but removed only the smallest from the soil.\\"Wagenen, The Forgotten War, pp. 145-46 Mexico City newspapers proclaimed that the bodies of the cadets had been found, but the Mexican government convened a panel of scientists to confirm the identities of the bones. There was tremendous pressure on them to validate that these were indeed the remains, which was done. The remains were placed in gold and crystal urns, and moved the Military Academy.Wagenen, The Forgotten War, pp. 146-47. A plaque was placed at the site. Mar√≠a Herrera Sobek called the identification \\"the biggest blow to the credibility of the boy heroes\\" a 2009 report of INEHRM (National Institute for the Historic Study of Mexico's Revolutions): (Spanish) On September 27, 1952, after many public ceremonies, a monument was inaugurated in the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n (Z√≥calo) with an honor guard from the several military academies of the Americas. The six cadets are honored by an imposing monument made of Carrara marble by architect Enrique Arag√≥n and sculptor Ernesto Tamariz at the entrance to Chapultepec Park (1952). At the castle itself, in 1967 Gabriel Flores painted a large mural above the stairway depicting Escutia's leap from the roof with the Mexican flag. The 5000-peso banknote (1987 series) commemorated the battle. The cadets are shown and named on the front of the banknote, and the Chapultepec castle is on the reverse. Starting in 1993, this banknote was retired in favor of the 5 nuevos pesos coin, and there is no analogous banknote in the 1996 series. The cadets appear on a N$50 coin minted from 1993; it is rare compared to the N$50 banknote. The name Ni√±os H√©roes, along with the cadets' individual names, are commonly given to streets, squares and schools across Mexico. Metro Ni√±os H√©roes is the name of a station on the Mexico City Metro, as well as a station on the Monterrey Metro. Streets in the Condesa neighborhood adjacent to Chapultepec Castle bear the names of each cadet who took part.

Before Trajan's construction, an altar existed there, on the walls of which were inscribed the names of the 3,000 legionaries and auxilia (servicemen) who had died \\"fighting for the Republic\\". (Latin: Tropaeum from Greek: Tropaion, source of English: \\"trophy\\"). Trajan's monument was inspired by the Augustus mausoleum, and was dedicated to Mars Ultor in AD 107/108. On the monument there were 54 metopes depicting Roman legions fighting against enemies; most of these metopes are preserved in the museum nearby. The monument was supposed to be a warning to the tribes outside this newly conquered province.F.B Florescu Das Siegesdenksmal von Adamclisi: Tropaeum Traiani (1965) By the 20th century, the monument was reduced to a mound of stone and mortar, with a large number of the original bas-reliefs scattered around. The present edifice is a reconstruction dating from 1977. The nearby museum contains many archaeological objects, including parts of the original Roman monument. Of the original 54 metopes, 48 are in the museum and 1 is in Istanbul. Trophy The monument was dedicated with a large inscription to Mars Ultor (the avenger). The inscription has been preserved fragmentarily from two sides of the trophy hexagon, and has been reconstructed as follows: > MARTI ULTOR[I] > IM[P(erator)CAES]AR DIVI > NERVA[E] F(ILIUS) N[E]RVA > TRA]IANUS [AUG(USTUS) GERM(ANICUS)] > DAC]I[CU]S PONT(IFEX) MAX(IMUS) > TRIB(UNICIA) POTEST(ATE) XIII > IMP(ERATOR) VI CO(N)S(UL) V P(ater) P(atriae) > ?VICTO EXERC]ITU D[ACORUM] > ?---- ET SARMATA]RUM > \\\\----]E 31. The inscription, which calls Trajan Germanicus from his previous victories in Germany and Dacicus for his new conquest of Dacia, can be translated: > To Mars Ultor, > Caesar the emperor, son of the divine Nerva, > Nerva Trajan Augustus, Germanicus, > Dacicus, Pontifex Maximus, > Plebeian tribune for the 13th time, > [proclaimed] Emperor [by the army] for the 6th time, > Consul for the 5th time, Father the Fatherland, > Conquered the Dacian and the Sarmatian armies ... > Image:Tropaeum Traiani from the North.jpgThe reconstructed trophy Image:TropaeumTraianiTropy.JPGthe original trophy Image:TropaeumTraianiTropyDetail.JPGDetail of the trophy: Head of Medusa Image:TropaeymTraianiTrophydetail.JPGDetail of a falx on the trophy Image:AdamclisiRoofTile.jpg Roman roof stone tile used for the monument =Metopes= On the monument was a frieze comprising 54 metopes. 48 metopes are hosted in the Adamclisi museum nearby, and one metope is hosted by Istanbul Archaeology Museum, the rest having been lost (There is a reference from Giurescu that two of them fell into Danube River during the transport to Bucharest).

History Reconstruction of the Tropaeum Traiani In ancient times, a Roman castrum named Civitas Tropaensium was settled here and in 109 AD a monument named Tropaeum Traiani was built to commemorate the Roman Empire's victories over the Dacians. Colonized with Roman veterans of the Dacian Wars, the city was the largest Roman city of Scythia Minor and became a municipium in the year 170. Destroyed by the Goths, it was rebuilt during the rule of Constantine the Great with better defensive walls, which defended the city successfully until the Avars sacked it in 587. After that moment, it ceased to be among the important cities of Dobrogea and was no longer mentioned for seven hundred years. During the Ottoman rule, the village was re-founded by Turkish settlers. After Dobruja was awarded to Romania, in 1878, the Muslim population left for Turkey, leaving the village deserted. However, in 1880 - 1881, the village was re-settled with Romanians from Transylvania and Teleorman.

Sears Point in 1983. Starting his career in sports cars toward the end of the 1970s, Adam drove as a privateer, winning a Canadian championship before being hired professionally. Invited to join the factory backed Group 44 race team in 1980, he spent time co-driving with Bob Tullius in the Triumph TR8 in the IMSA series and had GTO class victories at the 12 Hours of Sebring, Road Atlanta, Mosport, and Road America, as well as a victory at Daytona where he drove alone. In mid-1982, the team unveiled its Prototype Jaguar GTP racer, and it finished 3rd at its first race ever at Road America. In the 1983 season, Adam and Tullius led almost every race but the car proved fragile, although it they did win Road Atlanta, Lime Rock, Mosport and Pocono races. In 1985, Adam joined Conte Racing, co driving with John Paul, Jr. in the factory-backed March GTP racer. Power came from a factory engine program at Buick, a V-6 turbo motor that put out in excess of 1000HP. Unfortunately, the power of this engine was more than the chassis could handle and it led almost every race, but broke down in almost every race. Following years were spent with Bayside Racing from Seattle, Washington in their Porsche 962 GTP racer, as well as the Hendricks Motorsport Chevrolet Corvette GTP racer. 1986 & 1987 were also spent in the Rothmans Porsche Cup in Canada with numerous victories as well as winning a prestigious Porsche Cup award, something given out to the world's top Porsche racers. At the 1987 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving a Porsche 962C for Porsche Canada/Brun Motorsport, Adam teamed with Scott Goodyear and Richard Spenard, running as high as 5th overall before stopping with engine problems. One season was spent with the Protofab race team, racing a factory backed effort in both Camaro and Corvette race cars before spending a few years out of motorsport. 1994 saw Adam return to racing, driving the Champion Racing Porsche. Along with co-drivers including John Paul, Jr., Juan Manuel Fangio II, Brian Redman, and Thierry Boutsen, he had a second-place finish at the Sebring 12 Hour with Hans-Joachim Stuck in 1995 and second place at Watkins Glen International. He would return in 1996 with Stuck to win the 12 hour Sebring GT1 class. In 1997, he placed 2nd in class, again with Stuck and Boutsen, at the 24 Hours of Daytona. In 2002 Adam drove two races of the Porsche Supercup at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on United States Grand Prix weekend, placing 11th and 13th. The following year he was driving the number 23 Porsche 911 twice, in the Grand-Am Motorola Cup. He qualified the car 2nd on the grid at Mont Tremblant. Recently, Adam has been racing an Audi R8 (chassis 405) in the Historic Sports car Racing series, winning the Daytona WSC Enduro race in November 2005. In 2008, Bill Adam, driving for Jim Rogers, won the overall HSR Championship, placing first in four races and second in the other three in which he partook. In 2010, Adam continued driving for Jim Rogers in a \\"new\\" Audi R8. This car, chassis 607, was unraced and used as a showcar by Audi, before being completely gone over by ex Champion crew chief Bobby Green. Teamed with Butch Leitzinger, Adam won the opening HSR race at Sebring for the team's first victory with this car. Road Atlanta and the \\"Mitty\\" followed, where teamed with Andy Wallace, they placed 2nd. The rest of the year was complete domination by the Adam/Wallace team as they won at Road America, Wisconsin and followed with pole positions AND wins at Road Atlanta (September), Homestead Miami Speedway, and the Sebring finale, winning the HSR Championship.

The ashram is the international organizational headquarters of Swami Satchidananda's documented teachings and is located in Buckingham County, Virginia. The primary goal of guru Yogiraj Sri Swami Satchidananda (1914-2002) was interfaith understanding as a vehicle to world peace. To this end, the LOTUS (Light Of Truth Universal Shrine) was constructed and inaugurated in 1986. Swami Satchidananda was living in Yogaville at the time of his death, though he was visiting Madras (city now known as Chennai), in South India at the time. The property in rural Virginia, along the James River, was identified for the community from the air as the swami flew over, looking for land farther south than his ashram in Pomfret, Connecticut. Swami Satchidananda acquired 600 acres in 1979 to form his town, financing it by selling property in Falls Village, Connecticut that had been given to him by Carole King. As of 1986, when the LOTUS was dedicated, around 120 people were living on a total of 750 acres. Reports cited plans to eventually house a population between 600 and 1,000. The ashram in Yogaville maintains a large kitchen and dining room for residents and guests. In 1996 a book of favorite ashram recipes was published and is now in its 9th printing. According to the official website, there are around 200 residents as of 2015. In May 2016 Yogaville received Landmark Status. In addition to the Virginia and Connecticut ashrams, Yogaville-West was founded in Seigler Springs, California in 1972. LOTUS Costing $2 million (financed through donations and tithes) and dedicated on July 20, 1986, the shrine is the centerpiece of Yogaville. The structure is shaped like a lotus flower, features a gold-leaf dome, and houses 12 altars representing Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Shinto, Tao, Buddhist, Islam, Sikh, Native American, and African religions. Blue neon tubes extend from each altar up along the spines of the vaulted ceiling.

They inhabited the region of Mygdonia before the Macedonians drove them out.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 2.99. After that, they settled in the region of Edonis which was named after them. There were a number of Edonian cities in the Classical era, including Drabeskos and Myrkinos. History The strategically important Athenian colony of Ennea Hodoi (\\"Nine Ways\\", later Amphipolis) was taken by the Edonians shortly after the Persian Empire was driven from the area.Thuc. 4.102 The Edoni and the nearby Thracians defeated a massive Ionian invasion led by Athens 32 years later. The Athenians and their allies advanced far up the Angitis valley toward Drabescus before they were cut off and completely destroyed, losing 10,000 killed in the disaster.Thuc. 1.100, 4.102.2 Athens wrested control of Amphipolis from the Edonians just prior to the Peloponnesian War.Thuc. 4.102.3 Brasidas liberated the city during that conflict and after a pro-Lacedaemonian coup d'√©tat the Edonians became his allies.Thuc. 4.107 They made up most of his army when he defeated Cleon's offensive.Thuc. 5.8-10 Mythology Lycurgus, son of Dryas, was a mythical king of the Edoni, who drove Dionysus into exile in the Cyclades but was ultimately overthrown and killed by his own people. The conflict began with Lycurgus' opposition to either the drinking of wine or the worship of the new god. Lycurgus was based at the mouth of the Strymon River around Amphipolis.Apollodorus 3.5.1 According to one version of the story, he was imprisoned at Mt. Pangaeum by the Edoni and then torn apart by his horses on Dionysius' orders.Apollodorus 3.5.1 The Edoni were celebrated for their orgiastic worship of Bacchus (Dionysus). In Latin poems, the term Edonis signified a female Bacchanal. The Peresadyes,The Cambridge Ancient History: The fourth century B.C. forerunners of the dynasty of Bardyllis that ruled over the Dardanii, were most likely Edones.

Kalisto and the Dreamcast Kalisto first entered into the Dreamcast scene on June 26, 2000 with the release of the title Evolution: The World of Sacred Device. By August 19, 2000, Kalisto had determined how to rip and redistribute Dreamcast GD-ROMs as CD-ROM ISOs without the need for a swappable \\"bootdisk\\" CD-ROM. A few weeks later, with their release of Ganbare! Nippon! Olympics 2000 on September 2, 2000, Kalisto claimed that Sega provided a financial incentive for them to stop releasing games for the Dreamcast platform: > Sega has offered us stock options to stop releasing DC, so this will be it, > our last release. Thanks to all who have supported us throughout our stay in > the DC scene. Take note this is NOT a joke. We are really stopping all DC > operations with this release. We will continue on with the PSX. Bye. While the claim of stock options was allegedly a joke, Kalisto ceased all releases for the Dreamcast shortly after and focused entirely on PlayStation games. (although Kalisto did return for one final rip and released the U.S. version of Shenmue on November 9, 2000) Immediately after, a new group called Echelon emerged on September 4, 2000, picking up the slack to later become the leading release group for the Dreamcast. At the time of this transition, there was much speculation that Kalisto and Echelon were one and the same. On September 19th, 2000 Echelon releases the Dreamcast Self-Booting Tutorial with which it was possible to make Self-boot Dreamcast disks that work on the Dreamcast without the need of the Utopia Boot-Disk.

The coup overthrew the democratically elected government of President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski and Prime Minister Wincenty Witos. A new government was installed, headed by Lw√≥w Polytechnic Professor Kazimierz Bartel. The events were partly inspired by the need for extraordinary measures in the face of newly emerging threats to the stability of Poland's independence by Pi≈Çsudski's own assessment of the foreign treaties signed by Weimar Germany with France in 1925 (fundamentally abandoning Poland) and with the Soviet Union in April 1926, to which Poland's representatives had not been invited. Initially Pi≈Çsudski was offered the presidency, but he declined in favor of Ignacy Mo≈õcicki. Pi≈Çsudski, however, remained the most influential politician in Poland, and became the \\"power behind the throne\\" until his death in 1935.  Buildup  In November 1925 the government of Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski was replaced by the government of Prime Minister Aleksander Skrzy≈Ñski, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski became the new government's minister of military affairs. However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, formed by Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" and Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm (Polish parliament) as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d'√©tat. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on October 16. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany.  Coup d'√©tat  On 10 May 1926 a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was \\"ready to fight the evil\\" of sejmocracy and promised a \\"sanation\\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities. The night of 11 May to 12 May a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembert√≥w, where they pledged their support to Pi≈Çsudski. On 12 May they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wis≈Ça River. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos' government declared a state of emergency. Pi≈Çsudski (center) on Poniatowski Bridge, Warsaw, 12 May 1926, during the May Coup d' √âtat. At right is Gen. Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Pi≈Çsudski met President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Pi≈Çsudski demanded the resignation of Witos' cabinet, while the President demanded Pi≈Çsudski's capitulation. With no result in this round of negotiations, fighting erupted about 19:00 hours. Next day a new round of negotiations was begun, mediated by Archbishop Aleksander Kakowski and Marshal of the Sejm Maciej Rataj. These negotiations, however, brought no change to the stalemate. On 14 May the Polish Socialist Party declared its support for the rebels and called for a general strike, supported by the Railwaymen's Union (ZwiƒÖzek Zawodowy Kolejarzy). The strike by socialist railwaymen paralyzed communications and prevented pro-government military reinforcements from reaching Warsaw. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, Wojciechowski and Witos resigned their offices. During these events, 215 soldiers and 164 civilians were killed, and some 900 people were wounded. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Pi≈Çsudski as minister of military affairs. On 31 May the National Assembly (Zgromadzenie Narodowe) nominated Pi≈Çsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mo≈õcicki became the new president; Pi≈Çsudski, however, wielded much greater de facto power than his military ministry nominally gave him.  Consequences  Pi≈Çsudski initiated a Sanation government (1926‚Äì39), directed at restoring moral \\"health\\" to public life. Although until his death in 1935 Pi≈Çsudski played a preponderant role in Poland's government, his formal offices ‚Äì apart from two stints as prime minister, in 1926‚Äì28 and 1930 ‚Äì were for the most part limited to those of minister of defense and inspector-general of the armed forces. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 (the April Constitution), tailored by Pi≈Çsudski's supporters to his specifications -- providing for a strong presidency -- came too late for Pi≈Çsudski to seek that office. But the April Constitution would serve Poland until the outbreak of World War II and would carry its Government in Exile through the war and beyond.

The city straddles the Ural River. Since this river is considered a boundary between Europe and Asia, Orsk can be said to lie in two continents. Population: . It lies adjacent to the Kazakhstan‚ÄìRussia border. Geography The city is located where the Ural River turns from south to west and where the Or River comes in from the southeast (hence the name). It was part of the Orenburg Line of forts. History Orsk was founded in 1735 in the process of the Russian colonization of Bashkiria and the Southern Ural region. The first settlement was founded by an expedition headed by Ivan Kirilov as a military fortification at the Mount Preobrazhenskaya on the left bank of the Yaik River (presently Ural River). Originally called Orenburg, its name was changed to Orsk in 1739. In 1743, the name of Orenburg was transferred to the town which is now known under this name; it is located west of Orsk. At its foundation it marked a southeastern projection of European Russia toward the steppes of Central Asia. It housed an exchange post and Russian customs that dealt with traders from Kazakhstan and Asia. From June 22, 1847 to May 11, 1848, the fortress of Orsk was home of the exiled Ukrainian poet and painter Taras Shevchenko. In 1861, the fortress was decommissioned and became a station of the Orenburg Cossack army. In 1865, Orsk was granted the city status and became the uyezd center in Orenburg Governorate. The city grew dramatically starting from the 1870s. The population was mainly occupied with trade in cattle and grain, reprocessing of agricultural products, and various arts and crafts. Many women were involved in the business of weaving famous Orenburg shawls. By 1913, the population of Orsk was over 21,000, and by 1917 there were eleven churches and minarets, and sixteen educational facilities of various types and levels. During the Russian Civil War, from 1918 to 1919, Orsk withstood a three-month-long blockade and then four times changed hands between warring sides. In the 1930s, the construction of large industrial enterprises, which drew their resources from the mineral rich soils of the region, started. One of the most notable stones excavated within the Orsk city line in the Mount Polkovnik is jasper. Orsk jasper is revered for its variety of natural designs and colors. All colors except for blue are represented in this stone. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eight rural localities, incorporated as the City of Orsk‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #1370/276-IV-OZ As a municipal division, the City of Orsk is incorporated as Orsk Urban Okrug.Law #2367/495-IV-OZ Economy Orsk is the most important industrial center of Orenburg Oblast. The main industries are metallurgy, machine building, petroleum chemistry, food and light industries. Most important enterprises are Yuzhuralnikel, Orskneftetorgsintez, and Yuzhuralmashzavod. During post USSR time chronic under-investment, sanctions and lack of reforms lead to loss of 50,000 jobs and 30 plants, Forbes.com reported. =Transportation= Orsk railway station The city is served by Orsk Airport. Education and culture A branch of Orenburg State Institute of Management (OSIM) operates in the city. Other than that, there is one major institute in Orsk: Orsk' humanitary-technological institute. There are also a number of different schools and colleges, State Drama Theater, Museum of Local History, Laboratory of Archeological Studies, Children's Art Gallery, Children's Folk Theater \\"Blue Bird\\" and a municipal brass band. Some of the peculiar landmarks of industrial Orsk are forty archeological monuments including ancient settlements, mass and single grave sites. Those that have been excavated became famous in the scientific world. For instance, grave sites in Kumak, that date back to the Bronze Age provide convincing evidence to the hypothesis of Eastern European roots of Indo- European peoples. In the grave sites that date back to the early Iron Age (7th‚Äì6th centuries BCE) left by \\"savromatian\\" or \\"sormatian\\" tribes scientists found many ancient items including a clay vessel bearing the name of the Persian ruler Artaxerxes I, the sixth such vessel found in the world.

The term is also used for their dialect, one of the three dialects of the Western Apache language (a Southern Athabaskan language). The Chiricahua living to the south called them Ben-et-dine or binii?e'dine' (‚Äúbrainless people‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople without minds‚Äù, i.e. \\"wild\\", \\"crazy\\", \\"Those who you don‚Äôt understand\\").Etymology The neighboring Western Apache ethnonym for them was Koun'nde (\\"wild rough People\\"), from which the Spanish derived their use of Tonto (\\"loose\\", \\"foolish\\") for the group. The kindred but enemy Navajo to the north called both the Tonto Apache and their allies, the Yavapai, Dilzh º√≠ º din√© ºi º ‚Äì ‚ÄúPeople with high-pitched voices‚Äù). Grenville Goodwin in The Social Organization of the Western Apache (1942) divided the Tonto into two groups: the Northern Tonto and Southern Tonto. Many Western Apache reject such a classification. They prefer groupings based on bands and clans. The following Tonto Apache tribes are federally recognized: * Yavapai-Apache Nation of the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, Arizona * Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Arizona\\"Tribal Governments by Area: Western.\\" National Congress of American Indians. Retrieved 7 March 2012. * Tonto Apache Tribe of Arizona Together with other groups of the Western Apache they form the additional federally recognized tribes: * White Mountain Apache Tribe of the Fort Apache Reservation, Arizona * San Carlos Apache Tribe of the San Carlos Reservation, Arizona Ethnonym The name DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√© is a Western Apache name that may mean 'people with high-pitched voices', but the etymology is unclear. The Dilzhe‚Äôe Apache refer to themselves (autonym) as DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√©, as do the San Carlos Apache. The Western Apache from Bylas use the word DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√© to refer to both the San Carlos and Tonto Apache groups. The White Mountain Apache use the term DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√© to refer to the Bylas, San Carlos, and Tonto Apache. The name Tonto is considered offensive by some, due to its etymology and meaning in Spanish, although that usage was derived from their learning the names by which neighboring groups referred to the Dilzhe‚Äôe. The name Tonto Apache has been widely used by most people outside the Western Apache communities. The term Tonto is encountered the more frequently in anthropology literature, especially older works, than Dilzhe‚Äôe. History Interaction with neighboring Yavapai = The Tonto Apache lived alongside the Wipukepa (‚ÄúPeople from the Foot of the Red Rock‚Äù) and Kewevkapaya, two of the four subgroups of the Yavapai of central and western Arizona. The Tonto Apache territory stretched from the San Francisco Peaks, East Verde River and Oak Creek Canyon along the Verde River into the Mazatzal Mountains and to the Salt River in the SW and the Tonto Basin in the SE, extending eastwards towards the Little Colorado River in the U.S. state of Arizona. The DilzhƒôÃÅ‚Äô√© Apache (Tonto Apache) lived usually east of the Verde River (Tu Cho n'lin ‚Äì ‚Äúbig water running‚Äù, or Tu'cho nLi'i'i ‚Äì ‚Äúbig water flowing‚Äù),The Verde River: Jewel of the Southwest and most of the Yavapai bands west of it. The Wipukepa tribal areas in the San Francisco Peaks, along the Upper Verde River, Oak Creek Canyon and Fossil Creek overlapped with those of the Northern Tonto Apache. Likewise the Kwevkepaya shared hunting and gathering grounds east of the Verde River, along Fossil Creek, East Verde River, Salt River and in the Superstition Mountains, Sierra Ancha and Pinaleno Mountains with Southern Tonto Apache and bands of the San Carlos Apache. Therefore they formed bilingual mixed-tribal bands,Timothy Braatz: Surviving Conquest: A History of the Yavapai Peoples, 2003, University of Nebraska Press, whose members could not be readily distinguished by outsiders (Americans, Mexicans or Spanish) except by their languages. The Apache spoke the Tonto dialect of the Western Apache language (Ndee biyati' / Nnee biyati) and the Yavapai spoke the Yavapai language, a branch of Upland Yuman. Living together in common rancherias, whether they considered themselves to be Apaches or Yavapais, depended on their ‚ÄúMother tongue‚Äù as the origin of the matrilineal society, directed by the mother. Most of them spoke both languages, and the headman of each band usually had two names, one from each tradition. The ethnic Europeans referred to the Yavapai and Apache together as Tonto or Tonto Apache. The peoples raided and warred together against enemy tribes such as the Tohono O'odham and the Akimel O'odham. Scholars cannot tell from records whether the writers of the time, when using the term Tonto Apache, were referring to Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. In addition, the Europeans often referred to the Wipukepa and Kwevkepaya incorrectly as the Yavapai Apache or Yuma Apache. To further confusion, the Europeans referred to the Tolkepaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples) as Yuma Apache or Mohave Apache. Ethnological writings describe some major differences between Yavapai and Tonto Apache peoples. Yavapai were described as taller, of more muscular build, well-proportioned and thickly featured while the Tonto Apaches were slight and less muscular, smaller of stature and finely featured. The Yavapai women were seen as stouter and having \\"handsomer\\" faces than the Yuma in the Smithsonian report. Another difference, which could probably not have been noticed at long range, was that the Yavapai were often tattooed, while Apaches seldom had tattoos. Painted designs on faces were different, as were funeral practices. In clothing, Yavapai moccasins were rounded, whereas the Apaches had pointed toes. Both groups were hunter- gatherers, but were so similar here that scholars are seldom able to distinguish between their campsites.THE APACHES AND YAVAPAI, CRUCIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM = Relations with Apache and other tribes = The Western Apache groups, adjacent Tonto Apache bands and Chiricahua bands lived in relative peace with each other. There were occasional mutual raids, especially against the southern bands of the Chiricahua. The close connection with the Yavapai may have helped inform the dialect Tonto Apache, which is most distinct from the other two Apache dialects. The Tonto Apache competed more with the Navajo (in Apache Y√∫dah√° ‚Äì 'Live Far Up' ‚Äì 'Those who live up north') and the Enemy Navajo (Nda Yutah√° ‚Äì 'Navajo White Man' or 'Navajo who live like white men'), and the peoples engaged more in open conflict. From their sheepraising, the Navajo were able to acquire more European goods in trade, such as blankets, foods, and various tools, which the Tonto lacked. In addition, \\"Enemy Navajo\\" often served as scouts against the Tonto Apache for the hostile tribes and Europeans. Sometimes the Apache exchanged the stolen cattle and horses they had acquired in raids for the prestigious Navajo blankets, while maintaining peace with the Navajo. Typically hunter-gatherers, the Tonto Apache hunted (antelope, deer, birds, bush rats, etc.) and collected (agave, berries, wild plants, seeds). The women also cultivated watermelons, pumpkins, corn, later grain, etc. When stocks were running low and the stored food supplies were depleted, it was common that a respected woman (so-called 'woman chief' or elder) brought public attention to the plight. The woman asked the leaders of the rancheria to go on raids against other Indians and European-Americans to raid to acquire what was needed. The Western Apache raided over an area from the Colorado River in western Arizona, to the Zuni (Nashtizh√© ‚Äì 'black-dyed eyebrows') and Hopi (Tseka kin√© \` ‚Äì 'people who dwell in stone houses') in the north, to the later Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Durango in the far south. Reservation lifeYavapai-Apache Nation Indian Reservation= After being relocated to the Camp Verde Reservation, on the Verde River near Camp Verde, the Yavapai and Tonto Apache began to construct irrigation systems (including a five-mile (8 km) long ditch).Pritzker, p. 104 These functioned well enough for them to reap sufficient harvests, making the tribe relatively self-sufficient. But, contractors who worked with the United States government to supply the reservations were disappointed, and petitioned to have the reservation revoked. The government complied, and in March 1875, the government closed the reservation. They forced the residents to travel by foot in winter to the San Carlos Reservation. More than 100 Yavapai died during the winter trek.Salzmann, p. 59 By the early 1900s, the Yavapai were drifting away from the San Carlos Reservation. They requested permission to live on the grounds of the original Camp Verde Reservation. In 1910, the US government set aside as the Camp Verde Indian Reservation, and in the following decade added in two parcels, which became the Middle Verde Indian Reservation. These two reservations were combined in 1937, and the people formed the federally recognized Camp Verde Yavapai-Apache Nation.Braatz, p. 221 Today, the reservation spans , in four separate locales. Tourism contributes greatly to the economy of the tribe. Their reservation has many significant historic sites which have been preserved, including the Montezuma Castle National Monument. The Yavapai-Apache Nation is the amalgamation of two historically distinct tribal people; the Yavepe (Central Yavapai), Wipukepa (Wipukapaya) (Northeastern Yavapai) and Kewevkapaya (Southeastern Yavapai) People and the Tonto Apache (Dilzhe‚Äôe Apache), each of whom occupied the Upper Verde prior to European invasion.Part Two ‚Äì Arizona Indian Tribes Preserved Their Identities The Tonto Apache, calling themselves Dilzhe'e, utilized the lands to the north, east and south; while the various Yavapai bands were using country to the north, the west and the south. They overlapped in the Upper Verde.Yavapai- Apache Nation , ITCA =Fort McDowell Yavapai Reservation= The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation is located within Maricopa County, Arizona, approximately 20 miles from Phoenix. The reservation was authorized by President Theodore Roosevelt from the former Fort McDowell in 1903.Hoxie, p. 457 By 1910, the Office of Indian Affairs was trying to relocate its residents to open up the area for development and enable other interests to use its water rights. A delegation of Yavapai testified to a Congressional Committee against this action, and won. Today, the tribal community consists of 900 members, 600 of whom live on the reservation. The Guwevka'ba:ya or Southeastern Yavapai on Fort McDowell Reservation call themselves Aba:ja (‚Ä≥The People\\"). The population of Fort McDowell consists mostly of the Guwevka'ba:ya Yavapai as well as other Yavapai groups. = Tonto Apache Reservation = The Tonto Apache Reservation, located south of Payson, Arizona (in Apache: Te-go-suk ‚Äì ‚ÄúPlace of the Yellow Water‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlace of the Yellow Land‚Äù) in ancestral territory of one of the principal Dilzhe'e Apache clans ‚Äì the ‚ÄúPeople of the Yellow Speckled Water‚Äù, was created in 1972 within the Tonto National Forest northeast of Phoenix. It consists of 85 acres (344,000 m¬≤). With the smallest land base of any reservation in the state of Arizona, it serves about 100 tribal members of the 140 total; 110 are enrolled tribal members. The reservation is located adjacent to the town of Payson, in northwestern Gila County, approximately 95 miles northeast of Phoenix and 100 miles southeast of Flagstaff. The Tonto Apache are the direct descendants of the Dilzhe'e Apache who lived in the Payson vicinity long before the arrival of Europeans. During the first reservation era, they were moved to the large Rio Verde Reserve, near Camp Verde, which was established in 1871 for the Tonto and Wipukepa or Northeastern Yavapai. The Reserve was dissolved in 1875 and the peoples forced to relocate to the San Carlos Reservation. Some Tonto Apache gradually returned to Payson after 20 years of exile to find white settlers had taken much of their land. Today, legislation is pending to provide them with trust title to the land on which they reside. The majority of the Tonto Apache, however, had decided to return together with their Yavapai allies and relatives to the Camp Verde Reservation to form the Yavapai-Apache Nation of today. = Western Apache Indian Reservations = Because of their forced relocation in 1875, today some Tonto Apache live in two reserves dominated by other Western Apache groups, the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation and Fort Apache Indian Reservation.  Socio-political organization  Like the other Western Apache groups, the Tonto Apache were not centrally organized. The smallest social unit was the matrilocal and matrilineal family living in one wickiup (kowa or gowa); each wife lived with her children in a separate wickiup. Some kindred families lived together as an extended family (so-called gotah) in a rancheria together. Several gotah (extended families) formed local groups. Together, these claimed hunting and gathering areas. The highest organizational unit was the group or band, which are usually composed of several smaller local groups; it was organized mostly for military purposes and for common defense. (Band organization was strongest in Chiricahua society). The Tonto Apache were divided into the following bands: Northern Tonto (inhabited the upper reaches of the Verde River and ranged north toward the San Francisco Mountains north of Flagstaff, because they shared hunting and gathering grounds with Wi:pukba/Wipukepaya bands of the Yavapai they formed bilingual mixed-tribal Northern Tonto Apache-Wi:pukba/Wipukepaya bands with common headmen, both the band/local group or its headman usually had two names, one was Apache (Southern Athabascan) the other Yavapai (Upland Yuman).) * Bald Mountain band, in Apache: Daszin√© Dasdaay√© Indee (‚ÄòPorcupine Sitting Above People‚Äô) or in Yavapai: Wiipukepaya local group (‚Ä≤Oak Creek Canyon People‚Ä≤); in English often known as Bald Mountain band (Apache)or as Oak Creek Canyon band (Yavapai). Lived mainly around Bald Mountain or Squaw Peak, on the west side of the Verde Valley, southwest of Camp Verde. They lived entirely by hunting and gathering plant foods. * Oak Creek band, in Apache: Ts√© Hichii Indee (‚ÄòHorizontal Red Rock People‚Äô) or in Yavapai: Wiipukepaya local group (‚Ä≤Oak Creek Canyon People‚Ä≤); in English often known as Oak Creek band (Apache) or as Oak Creek Canyon band (Yavapai). Lived near today¬¥s Sedona, along Oak Creek, Dry Beaver Creek, Wet Beaver Creek and southward to the west side of the Verde River between Altnan and West Clear Creek, eastward to Stoneman's and Mary's Lakes, and northward to Roger's Lake and Flagstaff. * Fossil Creek band, in Apache: T√∫ Dot≈Ç ºizh Indee (‚ÄòBlue Water People,i.e. Fossil Creek People‚Äô) or in Yavapai Matkitwawipa band (‚Ä≤People of the Upper Verde River Valley (in Yavapai: Matk ºamvaha)‚Ä≤) Lived along and had a few tiny farms on Fossil Creek, Clear Creek and-a site on the Verde River below the mouth of Deer Creek, they hunted and gathered west of the Verde River, northwest to the Oak Creek band territory and northeast to Apache Maid Mountain. * Mormon Lake band, in Apache: Dot≈Ç ºizhi Ha ºit ºIndee (‚ÄòTurquoise Road Coming Up People‚Äô) Lived east of Mormon Lake near the head of Anderson's Canyon and ranged up to the southern foot of the San Francisco Mountains, at Elden Mountain near Flagstaff, around Mormon, Mary's, Stoneman's and Hay Lakes, and at Anderson and Padre Canyons. Because they were exposed to the hostile Navajo on the north and east, they depended entirely on hunting and gathering wild plant foods for sustenance. Only the Mormon Lake band was composed entirely of Tonto Apache. Southern Tonto (lived in the Tonto Basin from the Salt River in south northward along and over the East Verde River, including the Sierra Ancha, Bradshaw Mountains and Mazatzal Mountains ‚Äì like the Northern Tonto Apache with the Wi:pukba/Wipukepaya ‚Äì they formed with the Guwevkabaya/Kwevkepaya bands of Yavapai bilingual mixed-tribal Southern Tonto Apache- Guwevkabaya/Kwevkepaya bands with common headmen.) * Mazatzal band, in Apache: Ts√© No≈Çt≈Ç ºizhn (‚ÄòRocks in a Line of Greenness People‚Äô) or in Yavapai by two names: Hakayopa clan or Hichapulvapa clan Lived mainly in the eastern slopes of Mazatzal Mountains. ** Ts√© No≈Çt≈Ç ºizhn' (Apache name) or in Yavapai: Hakayopa clan (‚ÄöCottonwood People‚Äò);the Guwevkabaya/Kwevkepaya were the only Yavapai who had clans, the clans were probably taken over through contact with their Southern Tonto and San Carlos Apache neighbors and kin in English simply known as Mazatzal band (Apache). Claimed the area around the community Sunflower Valley, the Mazatzal Mountains south of its highest peak, Mazatzal Peak (2.409 m), and to the east in the area around the former Fort Camp Camp Reno in the western Tonto Basin (also called Pleasant Valley). ** Ts√© No≈Çt≈Ç ºizhn' (Apache name) or in Yavapai: Hichapulvapa clan (‚Äöbunch-of-wood- sticking-up People‚Äò); in English simply known as Mazatzal band (Apache).

This type of visual attention problem is one of three major components (the others being optic ataxia and optic apraxia) of B√°lint's syndrome, an uncommon and incompletely understood variety of severe neuropsychological impairments involving space representation (visuospatial processing). The term \\"simultanagnosia\\" was first coined in 1924 by Wolpert to describe a condition where the affected individual could see individual details of a complex scene but failed to grasp the overall meaning of the image. Simultanagnosia can be divided into two different categories: dorsal and ventral. Ventral occipito-temporal lesions cause a mild form of the disorder, while dorsal occipito-parietal lesions cause a more severe form of the disorder. Description Patients with simultanagnosia, a component of B√°lint's syndrome, have a restricted spatial window of visual attention and cannot see more than one object at a time in a scene that contains more than one object. For instance, if presented with an image of a table containing both food and various utensils, a patient will report seeing only one item, such as a spoon. If the patient's attention is redirected to another object in the scene, such as a glass, the patient will report that they see the glass but no longer see the spoon. As a result of this impairment, simultanagnosic patients often fail to comprehend the overall meaning of a scene. In addition, patients note that one stationary object may spontaneously disappear from view as they become aware of another object in the scene. Simultanagnosic patients often exhibit a phenomenon known as \\"local capture\\" where they only identify the local elements of stimuli containing local and global features. However, recent studies have demonstrated that implicit processing of the global structure can occur. With the appropriate stimulus conditions, explicit processing of the global form may occur. For example, a study performed with Navon hierarchical letters, which are large letters composed of smaller ones, revealed that the use of smaller and denser Navon letters biased the patient towards global processing. Diagnosis There are currently no quantitative methods for diagnosing simultanagnosia. To establish the presence of simultanagnosic symptoms, patients are asked to describe complex visual displays, such as the commonly used \\"Boston Cookie Theft\\" picture, which is a component of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination.K. Dalrymple. Personal interview. 21 September 2009. In the picture, the sink in the kitchen is overflowing as a boy and a girl attempt to steal cookies from the cookie jar without their mother noticing. Patients take a clearly piecemeal approach to interpreting the scene by reporting isolated items from the image. For instance, a patient may report seeing a \\"boy,\\" \\"stool,\\" and a \\"woman.\\" However, when asked to interpret the overall meaning of the picture, the patient fails to comprehend the global whole. Another picture used to assess visual impairments of patients with simultanagnosia is the \\"Telegraph Boy\\" picture. Upon examination of higher nervous system functions, patients display no general intellectual impairments. Classification Simultanagnosia can be divided into two different types: dorsal and ventral, with each taking its name from the dorsal and ventral circuits concerned with the perception of objects' shapes and locations, respectively. These two forms of simultanagnosia are associated with different symptoms as well as damage to separate areas of the brain. =Dorsal simultanagnosia= Dorsal simultanagnosia results from bilateral lesions to the junction between the parietal and occipital lobes. Here, perception is limited to a single object without awareness of the presence of other stimuli. Thus, being able to see only one object at a time, a patient may collide with various objects in a room being unaware of them. Additionally, objects in motion appear more difficult to perceive. =Ventral simultanagnosia= Ventral simultanagnosia results from damage to the left inferior occipito-temporal junction. Ventral simultanagnosic patients are able to see several objects at once, but their recognition of objects is piecemeal, or limited to one object at a time. Thus, individuals with ventral simultanagnosic symptoms are capable of navigating through a room without bumping into furniture. Causes Simultanagnosia results from bilateral lesions to the junction between the parietal and occipital lobes. These lesions could result from a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It is also possible for simultanagnosic symptoms to develop from degenerative disorders. For example, one study found that four patients with progressive dementia eventually developed symptoms of simultanagnosia as well as components of Gerstmann's syndrome and transcortical sensory aphasia. In addition, patients with Huntington's disease have been found to exhibit visual impairments similar to those of simultanagnosia. Proposed theories for mechanism of action It is likely that damage to any of several cognitive mechanisms could result in simultanagnosia. Several theories have been proposed to account for simultanagnosic symptoms, and while some focus on the disruption of a specific process, such as the speed of attentional processing, others focus on the disruption of a representational structure. =Restricted visual attention= In 1909, Rezs≈ë B√°lint published one of the earliest descriptions of simultanagnosia. He studied a patient who easily identified single objects, regardless of size, but claimed that he could only see one object when presented with a complex display of numerous items. This patient also exhibited ocular apraxia, an impairment of voluntary eye movements despite intact oculomotor reflexes, and optic ataxia, or the impairment of visually guided hand movements. This collection of symptoms would later be called B√°lint's syndrome. Because the size of the object did not affect his patient's ability to perceive an item, B√°lint argued that his patient did not have a narrowing of the sensory field. Therefore, B√°lint concluded that the patient's attention would always be as narrow as the size of the item being observed. In other words, the attentional window of a simultanagnosic patient is limited to one object. In contrast to B√°lint's hypothesis, Thaiss and De Bleser studied a patient who had a physical restriction of her attentional window. The patient's ability to perceive multiple objects and identify global structures significantly improved as the size of the presented image decreased. Thus, complex stimuli could be processed as wholes so long as they occupied a small visual angle. =Disengagement difficulty= Another theory to account for simultanagnosia involves deficits in \\"attentional disengaging,\\" and this impairment affects shifts of attention in any direction. When confronted with several objects, the patient's attention becomes \\"locked\\" onto one object, and he has difficulty disengaging his attention from this object to another one. As a result of this \\"sticky fixation,\\" patients with simultanagnosia can perceive only one object at a time. =Slowed visual attention= Other studies have proposed that simultanagnosia results from slowed attentional processing. According to this view, attention is seen as filter through which one percept at time passes, and the speed with which an individual's attention can filter percepts is much slower for a patient with simultanagnosia than a person without the disorder. People without simultanagnosia are able to perceive numerous objects at once because they can shift their attention rapidly enough between stimuli so that percepts are integrated before they decay from short-term memory. However, those with simultanagnosia are incapable of shifting their attention quickly enough from one object to another, and thus, they only perceive one object at a time. In one study patients were required to read one word and then read a second word that followed the first in rapid succession. While individuals could identify the first word relatively quickly, they had significantly greater difficulty identifying the second word. Furthermore, if the second word was shown after a long delay following the first word, identification of the second word was easier. These results indicate that patients with simultanagnosia have difficulty processing objects presented in rapid succession, and the patient is unable to shift his attention rapidly enough between successive stimuli since a certain amount of time is required for the patient to shift his attention from the first word in order to be able to identify the second word. =Spatial mapping deficits= It is also possible that impairments in mechanisms that register spatial locations lead to simultanagnosia. According to the feature-integration theory of attention, features of the visual scene, such as color and orientation, are registered early and in parallel across the visual field. These features are represented by separate maps that are later integrated to form a master map of locations that specifies where things are but not what they are. In order to identify objects, focused attention is required to bind perceptual representations of objects being viewed with features in their proper locations. Parietal lesions damage the master map of locations, and as a result, a variety of deficits can occur, including simultanagnosia. If space is necessary to distinguish objects, then deficits in explicit access to spatial information located in the master map leads to the inability to perceive more than one object at a time. One study developed a computer model of high-level visual processing, which contrasts with low- level visual processing in that it involves the use of previously stored information to identify objects and navigate. When the spatiotopic mapping subsystem of the model was partially damaged, simultanagnosic symptoms resulted. In the model simulation of simultanagnosia, the same location was assigned to all stimuli, therefore preventing the model from identifying multiple objects at once. Either the model \\"locked\\" onto the first object and was unable to disengage attention, or once recognition of the first object was completed, it \\"disappeared\\" from sight to be replaced by the second object. Coslett and Saffran studied one patient who was unable to maintain location information for more than one shape. Since only a single explicit binding could occur between spatial and shape information, the patient was incapable of perceiving more than one object at a time. =Deficient pattern analysis= Another theory to account for simultanagnosia states that patients have difficulty analyzing shapes. Bilateral lesions to the parieto-occipital junction may cause the ventral circuit to slow down; as a result, patients with simultanagnosia have difficulty discriminating among visual features. According to this theory, \\"feature degradation\\" or increased \\"noise\\" occurs in the perceptual system. One study analyzed how well patients could process targets based on a feature salient from the background; it found that processing of targets was significantly impaired even though the targets were markedly different from the background. The results suggest that impairments in parsing, such as the process by which important regions are extracted from the retinal image, or difficulty in discriminating elementary visual features led to simultanagnosia. =Spatial indexing deficits= Finally, simultanagnosia may result from deficits in spatial indexing. Several studies have noted that a pre-attentive stage of processing exists during which visual features are obtained from the visual field in parallel. Once these features have been extracted, they can be indexed, which allows them to function as anchor points for additional visual routines; visual routines are sequences of elemental operations, such as visual search or texture segregation, which define the spatial relationships among objects as well as their properties. Saliency of a feature facilitates the ease with which it can be indexed. For example, the greater the difference between a specific feature and surrounding ones, the more easily it can be indexed. The indexed features, or anchor points, can serve as a \\"spotlight\\" that directs focal attention to certain objects, which can then channel visual information to specialized systems for space and shape analysis. Deficits in the spatial indexing mechanism would result in symptoms of simultanagnosia because interpretation of a complex scene requires rapid shifting of attention to various elements, and impairments in spatial indexing lead to the inability to index multiple visual features rapidly. In addition, perception is slowed, and low-level visual processing is disrupted since the patient would not be able to extract and index salient features. Treatment Currently, there is no treatment available for patients with dorsal simultanagnosia, and it is likely that the bilateral lesions resulting in simultanagnosia will not heal. However, a recent study demonstrated that recovery may be related to finding ways to expand the restricted attentional window‚Äîtheir global gestalt perception‚Äîthat characterizes the disorder. In another study a participant showed an improvement 18 months after stroke induced ventral simultanagnosia, this \\"represents the usual partial recovery from an early ventral simultanagnosia/pure alexia\\".

In fact, Pippin took the stronghold but not Hunald. Hunald I, also spelled Hunold, Hunoald, Hunuald or Chunoald (died 756), was the Duke of Aquitaine from 735 until 745. Although nominally he was an officer of the Merovingian kings of Francia, in practice Aquitaine was completely autonomous when he inherited it. His dukeship corresponds with the lowest point of the Merovingian monarchy, when the kingdom was in fact ruled by the mayors of the palace. Hunald was forced at the outset of his reign to accept the authority of the mayor of the palace Charles Martel, but he tried three times to throw it off in open revolt (736, 742 and 745). He was unsuccessful, although he did manage to retain Aquitaine undiminished. In 745, he retired to a monastery, giving power to his son Waiofar. He later went to Rome, where he died during an attack on the city. In spite of the opinion of certain historians that Hunald left his monastery to lead Aquitaine again in 768, Hunald I seems to have been a different person from the Hunald II, probably his grandson, who led the revolt that followed the death of Waiofar. Succession Hunald succeeded his father, Duke Odo the Great, after the latter's death in 735. His brother Hatto seems to initially have acted alongside him. Hunald, like his father, brother and son, possessed a name of Germanic origin. The Aquitanian province that he inherited had been enlarged by his father (and possibly earlier ancestors also) to include territory along the Loire that had once been Neustrian and the Auvergne region that had been Austrasian. Relations with Charles Martel In 735, Charles Martel led an expedition into Aquitaine. He marched the breadth of the country and occupied the well-fortified city of Bordeaux. He is not recorded as having met any resistance. The purpose of this expedition seems to have been to take advantage of the death of Odo to alter the constitutional status of Aquitaine in the Frankish kingdom by forcing Hunald to recognise his lordship and to remit taxes (munera) to the royal government. The show of force worked. The Annales Mettenses priores record that Charles gave the duchy (ducatus) of Aquitaine to Hunald and made him and his brother Hatto give a \\"promise of faith\\" (promissio fidei) to him and his sons, Carloman I and Pippin III, and promise to remit taxes. Following this success, Charles did not retain Bordeaux or any other part of Aquitaine, including those that had been added to it by Odo. The Vita Pardulfi, the late 8th-century life of Pardulf (died 737), records that Hunald succeeded his father as princeps, a term with royal connotations, and later served Charles as legatus. Despite their promise of faith, Hunald and Hatto rebelled against Charles in 736. After considerable fighting, Hatto was captured by Charles's forces and handed over to Ainmar, bishop of Auxerre. Hatto subsequently escaped from prison, and Charles deposed Ainmar and had him imprisoned. He was later killed attempting to escape from prison. Hatto was betrayed by his own brother. Hunald invited him to a meeting at Poitiers, where he blinded him and imprisoned him in a monastery. The betrayal of Hatto was probably the price exacted by Charles in exchange for allowing Hunald to keep his duchy. The peace between Hunald and Charles seems to have persisted until Charles's death in 741, although there is some evidence of low-level conflict. In 736‚Äì39, Charles Martel and his brother, Childebrand I, led several expeditions against the Umayyad forces occupying parts of Septimania and Provence. The Annals of Aniane, writing about a later date, record that Hunald's son Waiofar harassed the forces of Charles's son Pippin the Short during the latter's siege of Narbonne in 752‚Äì59 \\"as his father had done Charles Martel\\", implying that Hunald had harassed Charles's forces during the southern campaigns of 736‚Äì39. Despite achieving a crushing victory over the Umayyads at the battle of the River Berre in 737, Charles never besieged Narbonne, possibly because Hunald was threatening his lines of communication. Rebellion of 742 The most serious of Hunald's revolts was that of 742. This was undertaken in alliance with the dukes of Bavaria and Alemannia. All three dukes sought to regain their old autonomy following the death of Charles Martel. This also coincided with an interregnum, since no king had been appointed to succeed Theuderic IV after his death in 737. Having raised an army, the brothers crossed the Loire at Orl√©ans and proceeded to sack the city of Bourges and the fortress of Loches. In the words of the Chronicle of Fredegar: > [T]he Gascons of Aquitaine rose in rebellion under Duke Chunoald, son of the > late Eudo. Thereupon the princely brothers Carloman and Pippin united their > forces and crossed the Loire at the city of Orl√©ans. Overwhelming the Romans > they made for Bourges, the outskirts of which they set on fire; and as they > pursued the fleeing Duke Chunoald they laid waste as they went. Their next > objective, the stronghold of Loches, fell and was razed to the ground, the > garrison being taken prisoner. Their victory was complete. Then they divided > out the booty among themselves and took off the local inhabitants to > captivity [and] got home about the autumn of the same year. . . The reference to Gascons (that is, Basques) probably indicates that Hunald had Gascon allies, since Gascony was a distinct land from Aquitaine at that time. Before leaving Aquitaine, Carloman and Pippin met at Vieux-Poitiers to agree on a division of Francia between them, having imprisoned their illegitimate half-brother Grifo. This division did not include Aquitaine in recognition of its continuing autonomy. In the autumn of 742, after Carloman and Pippin had left, Hunald crossed the Loire in support of Duke Odilo of Bavaria's ongoing revolt. He sacked the city of Chartres, where he is said to have burnt the church of Saint Mary to the ground. This is the earliest mention of the church of Chartres which was to become the cathedral. There is no record of Hunald meeting any opposition. In early 743, Carloman and Pippin placed a king on the throne, Childeric III, ending a six-year interregnum. This was probably in response to the poor defence put up by the counts against the invasion of Hunald. The ability to do so in the name of the king would increase the brothers' authority. Final submission, retirement and death In 745, Carloman and Pippin invaded Aquitaine again to punish Hunald for the raid of 742. According to the Annales Mettenses priores, Hunald knew that he could not resist and so swore an oath to obey their \\"every will\\" (omnem voluntatem), gave hostages and remitted the taxes owed. This was a humiliation for him and he soon retired to a monastery on the √éle de R√©. In the words of the Annales Mettense, he, \\"taking off the crown on his head and swearing a monk's vow, entered the monastery that is on the isle of R√©\\". He was succeeded by his son Waiofar. About 752, Hunald went to Rome, where he joined one of the suburban monasteries attached to Saint Peter's Basilica. In 756, Rome was attacked by the Lombard king Aistulf. The suburbs were undefended and Hunald died in the fighting. Probably, as an experienced war leader, he had taken charge of the defence of Saint Peter's, although he may have been stoned to death. Hunald was probably the inspiration for the character Huon de Bordeaux of the eponymous twelfth-century chanson de geste.

Honda's production lines of these models were in Spain, Belgium and Sweden. Both the Honda MB road-model and the Honda MT offroad-model motorcycles were released in Europe and South Africa. The MB was made from 1979 to 1987 in Europe and in the U.S. up until 1982. In Europe however the MT50 production would last until 1997. Both models came in 2 versions; 80 and 50 cc, two-stroke. Honda left its four-stroke program temporarily because it was aimed at the European and South African moped markets for 16-year-olds, the legal age at which someone could ride a 50 cc motorcycle in South Africa and most European countries. The MB model was standard equipped with a speedometer, rpm counter, front disc brake and Honda Comstar wheels. Because of its success Honda released the MT series, a naked off-road version, on the European and South African markets. The result of this move was that sales in Europe and South Africa greatly increased. The MT series earned its popularity because of the large numbers of original and imitation parts that were available as well as its off road ability due to high ground clearance. In parallel with the MB and MT series, Honda released air-cooled MBX and MTX 50 & 80 cc models. Unlike the MT50 which had a 5 speed gearbox, the MTX50 had a six speed 'box plus a HERP chamber on the exhaust. In 1983, Honda released a water-cooled successor to both the MB/MT and air-cooled MBX/MTX series, the MTX50/80RFD and the MBX50/80. In 1985, the MTX50/80RFD was revised cosmetically into the MTX50/80RFF. This, in turn became the MTX50/80RII, a motorcycle based around the existing MTX125/200R motorcycles. The MVX250 was clearly the big brother of the MBX series, with the added 'V' in the name highlighting the use of a V3 engine Because of important law and insurance changes the sales in these types of light motorcycles decreased enormously. As a result, production in Spain and Belgium came to a standstill in 1992. MBX production lasted another year and stopped in 1993. Only in Scandinavia a limited production for the local market lasted until 1997. After that Honda's M productions came to an end. There were 50, 80, 125 variants of both the MBX and MTX as well as a 200c version of the MTX - all two-stroke singles - and the related MVX250 water-cooled two-stroke V3. The MTX125/200R started life in 1983 as RFD models and were ungraded in 1985 into the RFF. Changes includes dropping the drum brake at the front and replacing with a disc, bigger forks, revised graphics, a revised rear shock, revised CDI and, in the case of the 200, a new swingarm. The 125 cc motorcycle come in both restricted and de- restricted form. The de-restricted version and the 200 cc version had ATAC chambers operated by a piston valve attached to a mechanical governor.

Early 19th century maps highlighted it as Marabella Junction because of the Railway intersection to Williamsville and other central areas. Originally a separate town, it was incorporated into the City of San Fernando in the 1990s. Marabella was home to the Union Park Turf Club (a horse racing venue) later converted to the Manny Ramjohn Stadium, one of the five major stadiums in Trinidad and Tobago, the others being the Ato Boldon, Larry Gomes, Hasley Crawford and the Dwight Yorke Stadium. Nicknamed \\"The City That Never Sleeps,\\" the city is always active as its nightlife of food vending and bars goes almost 24/7. Marabella provides a melting pot for the wide ethnic groups to \\"lime\\" and \\"ole talk\\". Marabella's location near the Solomon Hochoy highway and Southern Main Road makes accessibility to all parts of Trinidad easy. This accessibility combined with its commercial infrastructure makes Marabella a prime residential area. Today it is referred to as the 'Commercial Hub of Southern Trinidad'. Marabella is home to several hot spots such as Mona roti shop, Belair store, the Southern Marines Pan-Yard, Morris Chang Grocery (now Chang Brothers Liquor Store), Trinpad, Hobosco Theater (unoccupied), Glasses Rum Shop, JTA Supermarket, the Marabella Market, Carrat Shed and the green house in Marabella since the St. Romain family have been painting it green since the 1980s etc. Marabella, like many other areas in Trinidad, has a large population living below the poverty line in areas such as Bay Road and The Old Train Line. Marabella is also known for its highly skilled sports personnel such as Raphick Jumadeed (West Indies Cricketer), Lloyd John (Cyclist), Patricia Cheryl Dyette, Horace Tuitt (Track & Field), Richard Quanchan (National Footballer and Hockey Player), Don Smith, Fitzroy Guiseppi, Roy Harry, Johnny DePeiza (boxers). It was home to several Steel Orchestras such as Southern Marines, Scarlet Symphony, Joylanders, Avalons and Combos such as Ancil Wyatt, Magnets, Silhouettes, Jerry Stewart and Psychedelic Sounds.

It connects the High Street to the west with The Plain, now a roundabout, to the east.  Antecedents This point of the Cherwell has been used for crossing since ancient times. The first known reference to a bridge goes back to 1004 and originally it was probably a wooden trestle construction or a drawbridge.Jaine, T.W.M. (1971). The building of Magdalen Bridge, 1772‚Äì1790 (PDF), Oxoniensia xxxvi, p.59. By the 16th century a late medieval stone bridge had replaced the wooden one. This bridge was about long and was formed by 20 arches.Steane, John (1997). Medieval Bridges in Oxfordshire , Vale and Downland Museum, Wantage, UK. Local History Series, p.5. By the 1770s, the stone bridge was too narrow for the increasing traffic, as it did not allow two vehicles crossing safely. In addition to this, the structure was becoming unsound due to the combination of two factors: a generalized lack of maintenance and the negative effects of regular flooding. Eventually some of the arches of the western side collapsed during the floods of February 1772, making the bridge irreparable.Jaine, T.W.M. (1971). The building of Magdalen Bridge, 1772‚Äì1790 (PDF), Oxoniensia xxxvi, p.60&61. The new bridge Upstream view of the central area of the bridge, including the elliptical arch. The present stone bridge was designed by John Gwynn of Shrewsbury with a similar length to the previous one. It has a total of 11 arches of different dimensions distributed as follows. For each of the two branches of the river there are three large semicircular arches plus two smaller ones at each side of the river, originally designed for the towpaths. A central elliptical arch, the only existing in the long central area across the island, completes the structure. This arch only conveys water when the island gets submerged. The original plans of the bridge are in the British Library, 1802 c.17, vol.2, and King's Maps xxxvi, 33 (1).Colvin, Howard (2008). A biographical dictionary of British architects, 1600-1840, Yale University Press, p.461, . The bridge, built between 1772 and 1790 by John Randall, originally had a width of , which accommodated a single roadway and two pavements. Although the bridge was opened to traffic by the end of 1778, a new scheme for the balustrade and the completion of the south western corner were not finished until 1782 and 1790 respectively.Jaine, T.W.M. (1971). The building of Magdalen Bridge, 1772‚Äì1790, Oxoniensia xxxvi, p.70. Gwynn's original design included an extravagant decoration for the balustrade with sculptures and sphinxes that were commissioned to Henry Webber in 1778 but eventually abandoned in 1782.Jaine, T.W.M. (1971). The building of Magdalen Bridge, 1772‚Äì1790, Oxoniensia xxxvi, p.69. According to Pevsner, the bridge has \\"good sturdy balusters\\", although these have been replaced over the years because of degradation due to pollution.Sherwood, Jennifer and Pevsner, Sir Nikolaus B.L. (1974). The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire, Penguin Books, p.311, . Despite opposition from University members, the bridge was widened in 1882 to accommodate a four-foot gauge track for the tramway.Skinner, Annie (2005). Cowley Road. A history, Signal Books, p.61. .

The bridge is the scene of large crowds every 1 May early in the morning for the traditional May Morning celebrations in Oxford. There has been a recent tradition of students to jump off the bridge, despite the danger of injury due to low water levels in the Cherwell. In some years many jumpers have been injured and, in order to avoid this, the bridge is now routinely closed on May Morning.

The village sits at the end of the M√∏rsvikfjorden arm of the Nordfolda fjord. The European route E6 highway passes through the village. The lakes M√∏rsvikvatnet and Sildhopvatnet are located northeast of the village. M√∏rsvikbotn has a school, a grocery shop, M√∏rsvikbotn Chapel, an aquaculture co-op, and a few camping sites. The village is centered around the farm M√∏rsvik at the end of the fjord, known as M√∏rsvikbotn, so the larger village area is also known as M√∏rsvikbotn. The local name in the Lule Sami language is for the farm and is the name for the end of the fjord and the greater village area. HistoryWorld War II POW camp= View of the POWs building a railway About north of M√∏rsvikbotn, near the lake M√∏rsvikvatnet at \\"M√∏rsry\\", the German Army had a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. The German Army soldiers serving here were from Austria, housing mostly Russian POWs. They were building a railway, which was intended to be a link between Fauske and Narvik. This was to be the so-called \\"Polarbanen\\" (). Some ruins of the camp, the foundations of the causeway for the railway, a tunnel, and roads can still be observed in the area. A small cemetery for fallen Russian soldiers is located close to the camp. The Camp Commander was considered by the locals to be quite \\"humane\\". Only a very few Russian POWs were shot or died of exhaustion during the five years of the war. The small camp cemetery was emptied of corpses shortly after the war. Their remains now rest with about 8,000 other POWs at the large war cemetery at Tj√∏tta, south of Sandnessj√∏en. Escapes Some escapes are known by the Norwegian population living close to the camp. The first escape was from the small subsidiary camp at Sildhopen. The local German guard trusted the Red Army POWs. Late one evening, after some alcohol consumption, one of the Russians used an axe on the guard's head. Thereafter, the POWs escaped east over the mountains. For unknown reasons they went the wrong direction after the climb over first mountain, and headed south down to the lake Kobbvatnet. There, they were recaptured. They were brought back to M√∏rsry, and executed while standing with their backs to a large stone. There were bullet marks for many years after the war on this stone. (This stone is located at the end of the road that goes north of M√∏rsvikvatnet, about into the woods on the left side.) Another escape by Polish workers (not POWs) from the nearby camp, T√∏mmernesset, escaped to Sweden via M√∏rsvikvatnet. Some say the two young Poles came from the camp at M√∏rsry. They were helped by a local, Alfred M. Iversen, who happened to meet them in the area. He promised he would meet them at the shores of a small lake the following Sunday. This was \\"Lisjvatnet\\", a small lake in the same valley as Sildhopvatnet. So the following Sunday he met them there bringing equipment (skis and clothes) and a bottle of vodka. Giving them a good description of how to find their way to Sweden. He also gave them his address, so that they could \\"send him a postcard from Sweden\\", which they did after the war. One of them, Aleksander Robaszkiewicz, then living in Australia, visited M√∏rsvikbotn in the late 1990s. But did not meet his helper Alfred M. Iversen, as he died some years before. There was also another escape from the camp in M√∏rsry, or possibly an escape from a labor team. The POW was recaptured somewhere north of Tennvannet / Tennvasskollen, and was shot nearby on the northwest shore of that lake. This was observed by Reidar Kirkfjell and his wife Ninni who lived nearby.

Life Thomas Fitzgerald was born in London in 1513, the son of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare and his first wife Elizabeth Zouche, who was a distant cousin of Henry VII.Jones, Michael and Underwood, Malcolm. The King's Mother. Cambridge University Press, 1992. In February 1534, his father was summoned to London and appointed the 21-year-old Thomas (by then Lord Offaly) deputy governor of Ireland in his absence. In June 1534 Thomas heard rumours that his father had been executed in the Tower of London and that the English government intended the same fate for himself and his uncles.\\"The Fitzgeralds of Kildare\\", Ask About Ireland Kildare rebellion (1534‚Äì1535) Dress of gallowglasses c. 1521. Many fought on Fitzgerald's side. He summoned the Council to St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, and on 11 June, accompanied by 140 armoured gallowglasses with silk fringes on their helmets (from which he got his nickname), rode to the abbey and publicly renounced his allegiance to his cousin King Henry VIII, Lord of Ireland.Webb, Alfred. \\"Silken Thomas Fitzgerald, 10th Earl of Kildare\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin, M.H. Gill & Son, 1878 The Chancellor, Archbishop John Alen, attempted to persuade him not to commit himself to such a rash proceeding; but the young lord's harper, understanding only Irish, and seeing signs of wavering in FitzGerald's bearing, commenced to recite a poem in praise of the deeds of his ancestors, telling him at the same time that he lingered there over long. Roused by this he threw down the sword of state and rushed from the hall, followed by his adherents. The council sent an order for his immediate arrest to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who, however, had not sufficient force at his disposal. The Earl of Desmond and many of his father's oldest and best friends reasoned with him; but he was not to be turned from his purpose. As Vice-Deputy, Kildare had under his control most of the Pale fortresses, and large government stores. Dublin Castle alone held out for the King of England. Lord Offaly called the lords of the Pale to the siege of the Castle; those who refused to swear fidelity to him he sent as prisoners to his Maynooth Castle. Goods and chattels belonging to the King's subjects he declared forfeited, and he announced his intention of exiling or putting to death all born in England. He sent messengers to his cousin and friend Lord Butler, son of the Earl of Ormond, offering to divide the kingdom with him if he would join his cause, but Butler refused. Several children of the citizens of Dublin in different parts of the Pale were seized as hostages for the good behavior of the city. In July, he attacked Dublin Castle, but his army was routed. He was, rightly or wrongly, judged to be responsible for the execution at Artane of Archbishop Alen, who had tried to mediate; this lost him support from the clergy. According to a long-established tradition, the killers, John Teeling and Nicholas Wafer, misunderstood his order, given in Irish, to \\"take this fellow away\\" as an order to kill Alen.Ball, F. Elrington History of the Parishes of Dublin Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1917 Vol.5 p.64 By this time his father had taken ill and died in London, and he had technically succeeded as 10th earl, but the Crown never confirmed his title. He retreated to his stronghold at Maynooth Castle, but in March 1535 this was taken by an English force under Sir William Skeffington by bribing a guard, while Thomas was absent gathering reinforcements to relieve it. The surrendered garrison was put to death, which became known as the \\"Maynooth Pardon\\". Thomas had wrongly assumed that his cause would attract overwhelming support, in particular from Catholics opposed to Henry VIII's English Reformation. But Henry's new policy also outlawed Lutheranism, and so Henry was not finally excommunicated until 1538. In July, Lord Leonard Grey arrived from England as Lord Deputy of Ireland; Fitzgerald, seeing his army melting away and his allies submitting one by one, asked pardon for his offences. He was still a formidable opponent, and Grey, wishing to avoid a prolonged conflict, guaranteed his personal safety and persuaded him to submit unconditionally to the King's mercy. According to the Irish Tree Council, legend has it that Silken Thomas played a lute under the boughs of the now oldest planted tree in Ireland, the Silken thomas Yew Tree, the night before he surrendered to King Henry VIII. in the 1500s.In October 1535 he was sent as a prisoner to the Tower. Despite Grey's guarantee, he was executed with his five uncles at Tyburn on 3 February 1537. According to G. G. Nichols, the five uncles were \\"...draune from the Tower in to Tyborne, and there alle hongyd and hedded and quartered, save the Lord Thomas for he was but hongyd and hedded and his body buried at the Crost Freeres in the qwere...\\"Nichols, G.

The Attainder of the Earl of Kildare Act 1536 was passed to permit his execution and the confiscation of his property. The 1536 Act remained law until it was repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005. Silken Thomas's revolt caused Henry to pay more attention to Irish matters, and was a factor in the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1541. In particular the powers of the lords deputy were curbed, and policies such as surrender and regrant were introduced. To provide for greater security the Royal Irish Army was established as a standing army.

Retaining many of the features of the smaller aircraft, such as twin radial engines, high wings with underwing floats, retractable landing gear and a large straight tail, the company built 59 Mallards between 1946 and 1951. Unlike the smaller aircraft, the Mallard featured tricycle gear, stressed skin, a two-step hull and wingtip fuel tanks. Operational history Northern Consolidated Air G-73 Mallard (Katmai National Park & Preserve) The Mallard prototype first flew on 30 April 1946, with the first production aircraft entering service in September of that year. While the Mallard was designed for regional airline operations with two pilots and ten passengers, especially aimed at harbor-based, city-to-city hops on the eastern seaboard, postwar surplus aircraft sales and the availability of smaller airports limited market potential. A number of smaller air carriers did use the Mallard in its intended role, notably Tahiti-Hawaii Airlines and Pacific Western Airlines (Canada). However, most of the 59 Mallards delivered were for corporate use. A prominent user in the United States was Roy Fruehauf and the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation. Fruehauf owned and operated a fishing camp, Killarney Lodge at Georgian Bay, Canada, and ferried customers there from Detroit. Another, Detroiter, William Packer of General Motors, also owned a Mallard, which he often flew to Killarney.The Fruehauf Trailer Historical Society another Mallard was purchased in the early 1950s by the Aga Khan.

Having studied at Jena and Helmstedt, in 1801 he made his way on foot to Paris, where he was commissioned by the comte de Choiseul-Gouffier, late ambassador to Constantinople, to edit the works of Joannes Laurentius Lydus from a manuscript given to Choiseul by Prince Mourousi. Hase thereupon decided to devote himself to Byzantine history and literature, on which he became the acknowledged authority. In 1805 he obtained an appointment in the manuscripts department of the royal library; in 1816 he became professor of palaeography and modern Greek at the √âcole Royale, and in 1852 professor of comparative grammar in the university. In 1812 he was selected to superintend the studies of Louis Napoleon (afterwards Napoleon III) and his brother. His most important works are the editions of Leo Diaconus, the De velitatione bellica, and other Byzantine writers (1819), and of Johannes Lydus, De ostentis (1823), a masterpiece of textual restoration, the difficulties of which were aggravated by the fact that the manuscript had for a long time been stowed away in a wine-barrel in a monastery. He also edited part of the Greek authors in the collection of the Historians of the Crusades and contributed many additions (from the fathers, medical and technical writers, scholiasts and other sources) to the new edition of Stephanus Byzantinus's Thesaurus. Hase likely forged a work later known as the Fragments of Toparcha Gothicus and passed them off as real to one of his patrons, Nikolay Rumyantsev, causing a period of confusion among Byzantine scholars over the origin of this work.Ihor ≈†evƒçenko, \\"The Date and Author of the So-Called Fragments of Toparcha Gothicus,\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers, vol. 25, (1971), pp. 115-188 Hase died in Paris.

They view China as a country that harbors historical grievances for political gain, rather than accepting Japan's apologies. They express strong patriotic pride and stress Japan's international role. They view the North and South Korean-Japanese relationship as no longer particularly special, but rather desire to rebuild it as a \\"normal relationship\\"--one in which Japanese war guilt is no longer a factor in bilateral negotiations. Accordingly, they also support changing the Japanese constitution, especially Article 9 which is viewed as obsolete, so as to make progress towards \\"normalizing\\" Japan's status (that is to enable the country to re-arm to the level of most other countries). The neoconservatives generally eschew traditional party-line factionalism, form alliances with lawmakers connected to defense, and create their own study committees. The bipartisan \\"Young Lawmaker's Group for Establishing Security in the New Century\\", founded in 2001, is the crux of the neoconservative group within the Japanese Diet. Note that the \\"Young\\" in the title is relative - being in their 40s and 50s, they are younger than the majority of powerful politicians who are in their 60s and 70s.  Neoconservatives  The neoconservatives are a group of \\"younger\\" politicians, in their 40s and 50s. Notable neoconservatives often include: *Shinzo Abe, current Prime Minister of Japan, the successor of Junichiro Koizumi, an anti-North Korea hardliner *T≈çru Hashimoto, mayor of Osaka *Takashi Kawamura (politician), Mayor of Nagoya *Shigeru Ishiba, Former Minister of State for Defense and major proponent of Japan's involvement in the US-initiated War in Iraq *Shintaro Ishihara, former governor of Tokyo, and co-author of the controversial essay, \\"The Japan That Can Say No\\" *Seiji Maehara, a hardliner and former Minister for Foreign Affairs *Shoichi Nakagawa, Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) *Keizo Takemi, an LDP member and head of the \\"Young Lawmaker's Group\\" *Ichita Yamamoto, head of the LDP team studying sanctions on North Korea  Allies  Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister preceding Shinzo Abe, is a conservative in the foreign policy arena, and receives support from the neoconservative legislators, but is not himself considered a neoconservative.
