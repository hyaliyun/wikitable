Emery and written by John Pappas and Robert J. Emery. It was filmed entirely on location in Cleveland, Ohio, and originally opened in Cleveland under the title Sign of Aquarius, alternately titled Love Commune. Shortly thereafter, the film was retitled Ghetto Freaks and edited to include two additional minutes of footage showing a young, handsome black man performing a blood ceremony with a group of robed young women. The Ghetto Freaks version was marketed as a blaxploitation film, despite almost all the film's actors, including the male and female leads, being white. The film has also been distributed under the titles Wages of Sin and The Aquarians (not to be confused with the 1970 television film The Aquarians starring Ricardo Montalb√°n). Plot The film is largely plotless, following the daily activities of a group of hippies living in a communal apartment in Cleveland, Ohio. The hippies encounter hostile police at a peaceful gathering in a park, get arrested and spend a night in jail. They earn money by panhandling and selling copies of an underground newspaper on the street. They stage a protest march against the Vietnam War on Cleveland's Public Square, discussing their viewpoints with random passersby. For recreation, they attend a rock concert at a club, and frequently use marijuana and LSD. Under the influence of LSD (illustrated by the filmmakers using various psychedelic effects), the hippies engage in nude dancing and uninhibited sex, and one girl experiences a bad trip. A rudimentary plot concerns the hippies' handsome, womanizing leader, Sonny (Paul Elliot), becoming attached to Donna (Gabe Lewis), a naive young girl who runs away from her parents' home to join the commune after a chance meeting with Sonny at the rock club. Sonny and Donna's newfound happiness is threatened by Billy, a violent drug dealer, who pressures Sonny to push drugs for the local rackets. Sonny refuses, leading to a tragic conclusion in which Donna is killed. Cast * Paul Elliot as Sonny * Gabe Lewis as Donna (aka Diane) * Mickey Shiff as Halo * Jim Coursar as Mousey * Nick Kleinholtz III as Stringbean * Toni Ceo as Marla * Tom Baker as Cleaver * Virginia Morris as Girl on bad trip * Bob Wells as Donna's father Production In 1969, John Pappas, a rock impresario and nightclub operator from Cleveland, announced that he would be producing \\"the world's first rock musical on film\\" entitled The Sign of Aquarius on a budget of approximately $100,000, later increased to $250,000, to be distributed in selected cities by Crown International Pictures. Cinar Productions later committed to distribute the film nationally. Pappas compared his film to the then-current musical Hair and it was described as being set in a Greenwich Village commune. Pappas saved money by writing the script himself and hiring most of the actors from the Cleveland area, with one exception being lead actor Paul Elliot, who reportedly had a \\"sizable list of Broadway credits\\" and was flown in daily from Cincinnati, where he was appearing in a play at night. Director Robert Emery was from the East Coast and recommended by Cinar. Cult film critic Michael J. Weldon, who later started Psychotronic Video magazine, was a teenager living in the Cleveland area at the time and responded to a casting call for the film, but failed the audition. The film was shot on location in Cleveland, Ohio. Nineteen different locations were said to be used, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Central Police Station, Public Square and the surrounding downtown area, University Circle, and the Detroit-Superior Bridge. Interiors were filmed in the 1614 Building near Playhouse Square. Pappas said that the Cleveland Police \\"have been especially helpful to us from the first day of shooting\\". Bob \\"Hoolihan\\" Wells, who in 1970 was well known in Cleveland as a television weather presenter under the name \\"Hoolihan the Weatherman\\" and as co-host of the late-night movie and comedy program The Hoolihan and Big Chuck Show, appears briefly in the film as the father of a runaway girl who joins the hippies. The dance scenes were choreographed by Jeff Kutash, a dancer on the locally produced TV series Upbeat. Reception The film premiered in Cleveland in June 1970 under the title Sign of Aquarius, being billed as the \\"first tribal rock flick\\" and a \\"tribal rock folk opera\\". Following the premiere, Cleveland Plain Dealer film critic Emerson Batdorff wrote that Sign of Aquarius was better than two previous films made in Cleveland, Uptight (1968) and Double-Stop (1968), but was still \\"amateur in the extreme\\", with \\"five or six separate plot lines put together with bubble gum\\", one of which \\"resolves itself into a killing which is summarily reversed so everyone can dance in some street garbage for a finale.\\" Gene Siskel later wrote that the original version of the film, which according to him was called The Aquarians, \\"did no business\\", leading to \\"a title change and hot, but misleading, advertising\\". The film was retitled Ghetto Freaks and a drugged orgy scene where Sonny seduces Donna was modified by adding approximately two minutes of footage showing \\"the black leader of a kinky love cult\\" and his female followers performing a blood ritual with a knife. The film was retitled Ghetto Freaks and a new advertising campaign was developed, marketing it as a miscegenation-themed blaxploitation film. Jet and Ebony magazines denounced Ghetto Freaks as being a hastily made attempt to capitalize on the popularity of \\"black films\\" such as Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970) and Shaft (1971). Although the Ghetto Freaks version of the film had engagements during the 1970s in major cities including New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., the film received few reviews, and those it did get were generally negative. Siskel, reviewing the Ghetto Freaks version, called the production \\"technically inept\\" and \\"shot on a frayed shoestring\\", and observed that despite \\"being billed as a black film ... the title characters are almost without exception middle class white kids who have left home and let their hair and paranoia grow.\\" The Cleveland African-American newspaper Call and Post panned the film as \\"one degree higher than a home movie\\" and said, \\"There is no plot in this crazy mixed-up film which lacks anything else. If you like garbage, you will find Ghetto Freaks to be a groovy flick because it stinks!\\" In 1972, while the Ghetto Freaks version was playing the Hippodrome Theater in Cleveland, Allen Johnson II, a Cleveland man described as an amateur actor, sued the Hippodrome for $100,000 for showing a movie which he said was \\"derogatory of him as a black American and insulting to black Americans in this community\\". Johnson charged that he appeared in the film without his consent. Michael Weldon, in his Psychotronic Video Guide, later described the film (under the title Love Commune) as an \\"embarrassing, plotless hippie/drug movie with imitation Hair songs\\". A Turner Classic Movies review summarized it as \\"an impressive compendium of hippie clich√©s and kitsch that are belabored into a fine pulp of unfocused tedium.\\" Despite its bad reviews, director Quentin Tarantino is reportedly a fan of the film, and Ghetto Freaks was selected as one of 16 films from Tarantino's private collection to be screened at the second Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in 1998. Entertainment Weekly listed Ghetto Freaks as one of the \\"highlights\\" of the festival, and the then- managing director of the Austin Film Society said of the film and others selected, \\"Quentin loves them, and the film geeks love them, but most people‚Ä¶‚Äù Home media Something Weird Video released the original version of the film on VHS as Love Commune in the 1990s, and released the later Ghetto Freaks version in the 2000s as both a digital download and a special edition DVD also featuring the 1966 drug addiction film Way Out. Soundtrack Original music and songs for the film were composed by Al Zbacnic and Tom Baker, the music director of the Upbeat show. One song, \\"I'm Gonna Dodge the Draft\\", appeared in the initial Sign of Aquarius release, but was then cut from the film. The original movie soundtrack album was released in 1970 under the title Sign of Aquarius on the Adell label (ASLP 216) and contains thirteen songs, including \\"I'm Gonna Dodge the Draft\\". Although some critics have dismissed the songs as imitative of Hair and \\"bad faux-rock music\\", others have praised the music, including Batdorff, who panned the acting, writing and dancing but said the film had \\"some awfully good music by Al Zbacnic and Thomas Baker\\", and Patrick Lundborg, who reviewed the soundtrack in his book The Acid Archives.

The show aired Monday through Friday nights at 8:30 PM. Produced by Siddharth Kumar Tewary of Swastik Pictures, the series covers the life journey of Karna, one of the great archers and a prominent character from the Mahabharata.The show starred Gautam Rode (adult Karna), Vishesh Bansal (young Karna) and Basant Bhatt (teenage Karna) as the lead character at various stages of his life. Premise The story revolves around the ace archer of Mahabharata, Karna and tells the Mahabharata from his point of view. The show covers the life journey of Karna on his way to becoming a great warrior. He was the son of Surya and Kunti. He was born to Kunti before her marriage with Pandu. Kunti thus abandoned him. He was then saved by Adhirath, who was a charioteer. Karna since his childhood only decided to become an archer. He learnt archery from Lord Parshurama and lied him about his identity of being a brahmin. But his lie was soon discovered and Parshurama cursed him. After that Duryodhana made him the king of Anga and befriended him. Later, he along with Shakuni, devised a plan to insult Draupadi, wife of Pandavas. They arranged a gambling where Yudhishthir lost all of his properties including Draupadi. Duryodhana asked Dushasan to disrobe her but failed as Lord Krishna saved her dignity. Pandavas and Draupadi were sent for an exile of 13 years. This sowed the seeds of Mahabharata war. Indra, in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Later, he came to know about his true identity of Kunti and Surya's son but he decided to fight for Duryodhana blaming Yudhishthir for owing Draupadi. Mahabharata war resulted in the death of Karna, Bheeshma, Drona, Kauravas. Thus, Pandavas won the war. Yudhishthir was made the king of Hastinapura. Gandhari cursed Krishna for destroying Kuru Vansh. Her curse showed result after 36 years and Krishna's dynasty also got destroyed. A hunter named Jara killed Krishna mistakenly. Thus, Pandavas decided to go to heaven where they met Kauravas and Karna. The show ended with Krishna's blessings to everyone.

It is considered the first amphibious landing in history involving the use of tanks and massive seaborne air support.Douglas Porch, \\"Spain's African Nightmare,\\" MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History (2006) 18#2 pp 28‚Äì37. The operations consisted on disembarking a force of 13,000 Spanish soldiers transported from Ceuta and Melilla by a combined Spanish-French naval fleet. The commander of the operation was the then dictator of Spain, general Miguel Primo de Rivera, and, as the executive head of the landing forces at the beach of Alhucemas bay, general Jos√© Sanjurjo, under whose orders were the columns of the chief generals of the brigades of Ceuta and Melilla, Leopoldo Saro Mar√≠n and Emilio Fern√°ndez P√©rez, respectively. Among the participating officers, there was the then colonel Francisco Franco who, for his leadership of the Spanish Legion troops, was promoted to brigadier general. Background After the Battle of Annual in July 1921, the Spanish army was unable to regain lost territory. It undertook a containment policy aimed at preventing the expansion of the rebel zone, executed by limited military actions of local nature. In parallel, the Minister of War ordered the creation of an inquiry commission, led by General Juan Picasso Gonz√°lez, which developed the report known as Expediente Picasso. Political forces, public opinion, and the army were divided between supporters of leaving the Protectorate and advocates of restarting the military operations as soon as possible. In September 1923, the coup of general Primo de Rivera occurred, who at first supported the abandonment of the Protectorate. In 1924 and after new attacks by Abd el Krim, which caused a Spanish retreat to the areas of Tetuan, Ceuta and Melilla, he changed to strongly supporting an offensive to defeat the Riffian leader and restore Spanish authority in the Protectorate. Planning In April 1925 a crucial event occurred: Abd el-Krim, confident of his success against the Spanish, attacked the French zone of the Protectorate. This opened the doors for a Spanish-French agreement to make a common front against the Riffians. To this end, in June 1925 the Madrid Conference took place, which set out the necessary actions. Among the agreements reached there were the plan for a Spanish landing on the Alhucemas bay, with the cooperation and support of a combined air and naval Spanish-French force. Alhucemas, home of the kabyle (tribe) of Beni Ouriaghel, to which Abd el Krim belonged, was the focus of the ongoing Rif rebellion. All Spanish land operations, included the Disaster of Annual in 1921, aimed at the occupation of Alhucemas, but all of them failed, mainly due to too long resupply lines. The operation initially proposed the landing of 18,000 men, although 13,000 would eventually be landed, to build-up a base of operations in the area of Al Hoceima and deal with an estimated force of 11,000 Riffians. This operation was the first amphibious action that involved Spain in the modern era which posed a concern to the Spanish authorities. As if it was not enough, the terrain presented difficulties in performing the landing, besides being a well-known area for the Riffians. Aware of the risk, Primo de Rivera carefully planned the landing. The probable knowledge of the planned landing prompted Abd el Krim to fortify the area, placing artillery and mines. These circumstances forced the Spanish command to change the landing site, choosing Cebadilla Beach and Cala del Quemado, west of the Bay of Al Hoceima. The first major effort to seize the beachhead would be exercised in those beaches; once the landing would be successfully achieved, the second effort would be either in some of the adjacent creeks or a deepening and expansion of the initial beachhead, depending on the circumstances.

Biography Wrigley was born at Oxhey, Denshaw, Saddleworth, on 10 October 1861, in a poor working family. His father was a mill worker, and he had one younger brother, Charles. The family moved to Castleshaw and he attended school there but started half-time mill work at the age of nine, and worked in local woolen mills all his life. He married Emily Hudson in 1890 and died on 31 August 1946. At his request his ashes were scattered around the Dinner Stone, a rock formation on Standedge, on the moors above Saddleworth. Work Wrigley published many works of poetry and local history. His first financially successful publication was in 1910. His second book in 1912 was supported by public subscription and on its publication he was presented with a cheque for 100 guineas (¬£105) and his wife received a watch. He illustrated some of his works, and Saddleworth Museum holds two of his seascapes and several other paintings and drawings. The poet Glyn Hughes described Wrigley as \\"didactic and sentimental\\", and in discussing Hughes' book William Atkins refers to Wrigley as \\"Saddleworth's poet laureate\\" and says of him that he \\"saw the moor as an enemy to be vanquished ‚Äì a glowering menace, forever threatening to retake the cultivated land\\".Listing of Saddleworth Museum holdings (pdf), Retrieved 4 March 2015 Legacy The Ammon Wrigley Fellowship Society was formed on 27 August 1931 at a meeting held in Austerlands, to honour the poet during his lifetime. It held meetings until 1982, and its papers are held by Saddleworth Museum. Wrigley's manuscripts and related papers, including papers of the Ammon Wrigley Fellowship, are held by Saddleworth Museum.Listing of Saddleworth Museum holdings (pdf) Retrieved 4 March 2015 Plaques on Millstone Edge where Wrigley's ashes were scattered He is commemorated by a bronze statue in Uppermill by Manchester sculptor James Collins, commissioned as part of the 1991 Saddleworth Festival for the Arts. There are also commemorative plaques on the rocks of Millstone Edge, Standedge, where his ashes were scattered. The Pennine Way National Trail passes this spot, which is near a trig point at an elevation of 1470 ft (448m). Alfred Wainwright in his 1968 Pennine Way Companion describes Ammon Wrigley as a \\"much-revered writer and poet whose love of the country around his native Saddleworth shone in all his works\\" and mentions an annual commemorative ceremony at the memorial stone; he includes a sketch of \\"The Ammon Wrigley Memorial Stone\\" showing the plaques.

It started on February 25, 2015 and finished on February 27, 2015. The exercise was notable for using a full scale mock-up of an American aircraft carrier as a target.  Exercise description The exercise was conducted by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and began by an order from Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, chief commander of Iranian Revolutionary Guards, with different naval units of IRGC On February 25, 2015. The ceremony kicking off the maneuver included Iranian senior officials including Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the IRGC chief commander; Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the IRGC Aerospace Force commander; Ali Fadavi, the IRGC Navy commander; Mohammad Pakpour, the IRGC land forces commander; Brigadier General Hossein Salami, IRGC‚Äôs second-in- command; plus Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani and film director Ebrahim Hatamikia attended to kicking off the maneuver ceremony. The Great Prophet IX war games goal was to show IRGC‚Äôs missile and rocket-armed speedboats combat power to trans regional powers as well as to enhance the defense capabilities of IRGC‚Äôs operating units and test modern military tactics and equipment. Major General Jafari explained about the aim of the maneuvers. He said the drill aim is creation of security and peace in the Persian Gulf region and the IRGC's naval forces control of the Sea of Oman, the strategic Strait of Hormuz, and the Persian Gulf. The exercise practiced an attack against an enemy's aircraft carrier, the first time such an attack was practiced in an Iranian war game. This included an attack on a 1:1 replica of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, which was made completely of metal and designed to not get sunk after being hit by rockets fired from Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (IRGCN) rocket-armed speedboats. After getting hits from speedboats, Sepah Navy Special Force (SNSF) Takavar members boarded it, firing at simulated enemies, then conducting a clear-and-hold mission, finally leaving it abandoned. Media reaction The building of the mock-up aircraft carrier before the war game was announced sparked media frenzy in US and Israel, which noticed its construction through satellite images and were unaware of Iranians' agenda. It was labeled as a \\"symbol of mistrust\\" by a CNN article and \\"black propaganda\\" by Israeli-based Ynet, speculated by analysts that it is being built \\"for propaganda purposes\\", and was described to be part of \\"military deception tactics\\", as a movie prop, or for training purposes. A US official, while admitting that he doesn't know the purpose of its construction, said the Iranians are \\"up to no good\\", while a US-based analyst said that the \\"fake aircraft carrier\\" will \\"make the Iranians look pretty silly\\". An RT.com article criticized Western media for their judgments, while an article from Iranian-based Alef called it another \\"excuse\\" found by Western media to present \\"a bad picture of Iran\\".

Caricature by the opposing Lantern newspaper in 1879 Patrick McLoughlin (also McLaughlin; 1835‚Äì1882) was an influential newspaper editor of the British Cape Colony, in what is now South Africa. Early life and education Born in Ireland, McLoughlin emigrated to the Cape Colony in 1861, as a sergeant in the 59th regiment, until he was discharged after suffering an injury that seriously damaged his sight. He moved to Cape Town and founded a school on Boom (modern Commercial) street, in a part of Cape Town that was a slum at the time. Being intensely reflective and literary however, he soon became known for his remarkable letters to the Cape's leading newspapers (always under the pen-name \\"Scotus\\"). He went on to edit three newspapers in his career. Throughout his career, his writings and his editing were distinguished by their liberal and inclusive ideology and their concern over the rights of the Cape's Black African citizens. While this made him very popular in the relatively liberal 1870s, it caused him a great deal of controversy as popular opinion became more reactionary and pro-imperialist in the early 1880s.DP McCracken: Irish journalists in South Africa: Imperial running dogs or wild geese reporters? Historia 58, 1. 2013. pp 122-138. The Cape Argus (1871-1879) His free-lance writings came to the attention of the Cape Argus as early as 1861, and he soon became a printer's reader for that paper's parent company, Saul Solomon & Co., from where he rapidly rose in position. In 1871 he was appointed editor for the Cape Argus, taking over from Thomas Ekins Fuller. He continued to do a great deal of the writing, and his humble manner and direct style of writing made him hugely popular. He was also known for his unpretentious manner and his \\"genuine journalistic faculty of mingling freely with his fellow men\\".Cape Town's Oldest Daily. The Cape Argus, 13 December 1913. However, he was openly partisan on political issues. Whilst editor, he \\"was greatly in the confidence of the Premier of the time, Sir John Molteno, and vigorously supported him\\". Both he and the Argus therefore came to be seen as supporters of the Molteno government. McLoughlin also continued to espouse liberal views that, while relatively popular at the time, were still controversial and were to make him unpopular in later, more conservative, years. =The \\"Pro Bono Publico\\" trial (1878/9)= A change came about in 1878 when the British Colonial Office overthrew the elected Cape government and a new bout of imperial expansion began in southern Africa, under the reactionary new government of Gordon Sprigg. Against the background of its frontier wars, the new regime began to move against its opponents. The Sprigg government targeted the Argus first, arranging that its government contracts were abruptly cancelled. McLoughlin was next, and the attack, when it came, focused on his private writings. McLoughlin had supposedly authored a pamphlet named \\"Pro Bono Publico\\" (\\"For Public Good\\"), privately and anonymously, during the 1878/9 Legislative Council elections. In addition to several other anonymous papers which criticised leading figures of the British and Settler establishment, these writings were held to constitute libel. Although it was never proven that McLoughlin did indeed author these papers, the \\"Pro Bono Publico\\" trial went badly, McLoughlin's continued position became untenable, and he was forced to resign. This was in spite of strong support from his liberal friends, and from Saul Solomon himself who, in a personal letter to McLoughlin (30 June 1879) admitted that he found the termination \\"especially painful because it is occasioned by your having been placed in a position which I feel that, as an innocent man, you ought not to occupy\\". The Cape Post (1879-1880) Lantern newspaper, in support of Attorney General Thomas Upington (right). The liberal alliance are depicted as bandits (including McLoughlin, Dormer, Merriman and Solomon). With support from several powerful admirers (including John X. Merriman and the retired former Prime Minister John Molteno) he founded the Cape Post newspaper in 1879, and co-edited it with Francis Reginald Statham. One of the intended purposes of the Cape Post was to encourage a coming-together of the peoples and states of southern Africa in an organic and locally-driven process. This was in order to counter the influence of the British Colonial Office and the Confederation plan that it was attempting to impose on the subcontinent at the time. =The \\"Fiat Justitia\\" trial (1879-1880)= The unusually liberal Cape Post was controversial, among other reasons, for highlighting cases of violence and discrimination against Black African people in the rural areas of the Cape. Chief among these, were the notorious \\"Koegas (or Kougas) murders\\", which led McLoughlin publicly to accuse the Attorney General Thomas Upington of racism. The Cape Post was joined in this campaign by Cape Town's other liberal newspaper at the time, Saul Solomon's Cape Argus, with its new editor Francis Dormer. Specifically, McLoughlin and Solomon accused the Attorney General and his colleagues in the Sprigg government of allowing white juries to acquit whites who had killed blacks. They called for the Attorney General's resignation and for an all-round condemnation of the verdict. The Sprigg government accused McLoughlin and Solomon of libel and responded with several lawsuits that culminated in what became known as the \\"Fiat Justitia\\" trial. In addition, a reactionary campaign arose in support of the Sprigg government's policies, led by publications such as the Lantern.V.Bickford-Smith: Ethnic Pride and Racial Prejudice in Victorian Cape Town. Cambridge University Press, 2003. In 1880 McLoughlin was therefore forced to close the Cape Post due to financial difficulties. Oudtshoorn and death Later he moved to the small town of Oudtshoorn in the Karoo, where he edited and wrote for the Oudtshoorn Tribune for a year, in effective exile, until he shot himself on 30 June 1882. He was survived by his wife and several children.F. R. Statham, My life's record: A fight for justice. Gibbings & co. 1901. p.69 Patrick McLoughlin was an extremely diligent and skilled writer, but he was even more known for his thoughtful and empathetic nature. His undoing was his unwillingness or inability to compromise on his feelings and principles, at a time when dissidence was dangerous. Historian Alexander Wilmot summed up McLoughlin as \\"the very clever, but not, perhaps, sufficiently scrupulous man of letters\\".A.Wilmot: The History of Our Own Times in South Africa, Vol.1, p.268, Vol.2, p.304.

To this end he settled in Sydney where he studied as an evening student at a commercial college. From 1885, he contributed both stories and verse to magazines, including The Bulletin, The Lone Hand, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Catholic Press, being encouraged by the founder of The Bulletin, J.

Today, power integrity plays a major role in the success and failure of new electronic products. There are several coupled aspects of PI: on the chip, in the chip package, on the circuit board, and in the system. Four main issues must be resolved to ensure power integrity at the printed circuit board level: # Keep the voltage ripple at the chips pads lower than the specification (e.g. less than +/-50 mV variation around 1V) # Control ground bounce (also called synchronous switching noise, simultaneous switching noise, or simultaneous switching output (SSN or SSO)) # Control electromagnetic interference and maintain electromagnetic compatibility: the power distribution network is generally the largest set of conductors on the circuit board and therefore the largest (unwanted) antenna for emission and reception of noise. # Maintaining a proper DC Voltage level at the load at high currents. A modern processor or field- programmable gate array can pull 1-100 Amps at sub-1V VDD levels with AC and DC margins in the tens of millivolts. Very little DC voltage drop can thus be tolerated on the power distribution network. Power distribution network Power Distribution Network The current path from the power supply through the PCB and IC package to the die (consumer) is called the power distribution network. Its role is to transfer the power to the consumers with little DC voltage drop, and to allow little ripple induced by dynamic current at the consumer(switching current). The DC drop occurs if there is too much resistance in the plane or power traces leading from the VRM to the consumer. This can be countered by raising the voltage on the VRM, or extending the \\"sense\\" point of the VRM to the consumer. Dynamic current occur when the consumer switches its transistors, typically triggered by a clock. This dynamic current can be considerably larger than the static current (internal leakage) of the consumer. This fast current consumption can pull the voltage of the rail down, creating a voltage ripple. This change in current happens much faster than the VRM can react. The switching current must therefore be handled by decoupling capacitors. The noise or voltage ripple must be handled differently depending on the frequency of operation. The highest frequencies must be handled on-die. This noise is decoupled by parasitic coupling in on the die, and capacitive coupling between metal layers. Frequencies above 50-100 MHz must be handled on the package, this is done by on package capacitors. Frequencies below 100 MHz are handled on the PCB by plane capacitance and using decoupling capacitors. Capacitors work on different frequencies depending on their type, capacitance and physical size. It is therefore necessary to utilize multiple capacitors of different sizes to ensure a low PDN impedance across the frequency range. The physical size of the capacitors affect its parasitic inductance. The parasitic inductance creates impedance spikes at certain frequencies. (Physically) Smaller capacitors are therefore better. The placement of the capacitors is of varying importance depending on its frequency of operation. The smallest value capacitors should be as close as possible to the consumer to minimize the AC current loop area. Larger capacitors in the micro Farad range can be placed more or less anywhere. =Target impedance= The target impedance is the impedance at which the ripple created by the dynamic current of the specific consumer is within the specified range. The target impedance is given by the following equation In addition to the target impedance, it is important to know which frequencies it applies, and at which frequency the consumer package is responsible (this is specified in the datasheet of the specific consumer IC). :\\\\Z_{Target}= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta V}{\\\\Delta I} [\\\\Omega] One usually use some form of simulation when designing the PDN to ensure that the PDN meets the target impedance. This can be done by SPICE simulation, chip vendor tools, capacitor venor tools, or by tools embedded in the EDA software.

Biography Hamza Bey first appears in 1421, when his brother, Bayezid Pasha, tried unsuccessfully to stop Mustafa √áelebi from taking Edirne. Their troops defected to Mustafa, and Bayezid was executed; Hamza was spared because Junayd of Aydƒ±n took pity on his youth. Hamza avenged his brother when he was appointed Beylerbey of Anatolia in 1424: he defeated Junayd, occupied his domains, seized Junayd and his family, and had them executed. Hamza Bey came to prominence, as a commander in Murad II's fleet, during the siege of Thessalonica, which in 1430 was ultimately successful. In 1453 Hamza Bey was made commander of the Ottoman fleet during the Conquest of Constantinople; replacing Suleiman Baltoghlu, when Baltoghlu failed to stop the escape of three Genoese galleys and a Byzantine ship through the Ottoman blockade of the city. In the final assault on the city, in order to prevent defenders from the reinforcing the critical northern and western parts of the wall, Hamza and the Ottoman fleet was to provide diversionary attacks against the sea walls of Constantinople in the south, on the Sea of Marmara; and against the dam across Golden Horn in the east. On the day of the assault, May 29, Hamza's forces were unable to force the Byzantine defences, with those troops which managed to gain a foothold being easily repulsed. However, overall the Ottoman assault was successful. Hamza Bey was to remain Commander of the Ottoman fleet until 1456. After the capture of Constantinople, the Ottoman fleet was tasked with the conquest of the islands of the Aegean; and Imbros, Lemnos and Thasos fell to the Ottomans. However, stalled by the Knights of Rhodes, Hamza was unable to take the remainder of the Aegean, leaving Christian forces astride the Ottoman route from their new capital to the Mediterranean proper. In 1460, as Bey of Nicopolis, Hamza was at the head of an army, tasked to protect an embassy to the Wallachians. En route back he and his army were ambushed by Vlad the Impaler. Together with his men, Hamza was impaled by Vlad, being given the honour of having the highest stake in deference to his rank. Monuments Hamza's body was recovered by his sons, and was buried in a complex that he had built in Bursa. The complex, which still exists today, consists of a mosque and a number of tombs, including that of Hamza and his family. For his part in the taking of Thessalonica in 1430, the Hamza Bey Mosque, was built there in his name. Following the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the mosque fell out of use as a place of worship. After being used for various commercial undertakings, most notably as a cinema, the mosque was bought by the Greek state in 2006 for restoration. In popular culture In the movie Dracula Untold by Gary Shore, Hamza Bey was portrayed by Ferdinand Kingsley.

It is mainly used in the Northern Basque Country. The currency was created on the 31st of January 2013.  Features  The smallest value of the eusko is the one eusko format, so it can not be separated in less than that amount. The eusko has a value that is equal to the euro, so the price of an article can be totally paid in euskos, but if the article doesn't have a round price, the difference will be paid in cents. (Example: if an article costs 3,50 euros, it can be paid with 3 euskos and 50 euro cents) Its motto is \\"Euskoa denen esku\\", which means \\"The eusko in the hands of everyone\\". = Format = The eusko has a note based format that enables the user to trade with values that go from the one eusko note to the twenty eusko note. The appearance of the notes varies according to the value of the note: *The one eusko note is blue, and has an image of a txalaparta on it *The two eusko note is red, and has a scene of a folk dance on it *The five eusko note is grey, and has a countryside scene on it *The ten eusko note is yellow, and has an image of a blackboard with the Basque verbs form \\"Nor-Nori-Nork\\" *The twenty eusko note is purple, and has an image of an industrial port that shows some cranes Several security systems protect the notes from forgery, similar to the ones euro has. Those include: *A complex filigree *A heated gold mark *Off set marks for blind people to identify note value  Aims  The aim of the eusko is to encourage the community to buy from local traders. This potentially strengthens the local economy and reduce ecological damage caused by long supply chains. Additionally, it aims to promote solidarity.  History  = Predecessors = The idea of the eusko starts when the AMBES (from French Association pour la cr√©ation d‚Äôune Monnaie locale Basque, Ecologique et Solidaire) took the example of another currency that was running in France, and thought that could be profitable and applicable to the Basque country. The choice of the name came up when the AMBES asked citizens to choose a name for their optimal currency. = Getting started = The eusko gave its first steps the 31st of January 2013, with the initial number of 126,500 eusko copies. From the very beginning the eusko was accepted in all the establishments that were associated. According to the creators of the eusko, 310 businesses and enterprises accept the eusko as a form of paying, and the eusko has spread to more than 1500 users. The AMBES said that eusko would have a credit card system in 2015.

It is a low, bushy shrub with crowded, grey-green leaves, corky bark and a profusion of creamy-yellow flowers on the sides of the branches. Description Melaleuca apodocephala sometimes grows to a height of but often much less. It has grey-green, glabrous, linear leaves which are mostly long, wide, arranged alternately on the stems. The ends of the leaves are pointed without being prickly. The flowers are creamy-white with yellow stamens, arranged in roughly spherical clusters along the branches. Each cluster is up to in diameter and contains up to 15 individual flowers. The stamens are in five bundles around the flower and there are 6-13 stamens per bundle. The main flowering season is in summer and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, arranged in nearly spherical clusters around the stem. Over time the clusters become embedded in the corky branches. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca apodocephala was first formally described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la classe physico-mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint- Petersburg\\". The specific epithet (apodocephala) is from the latinised Greek apodus meaning \\"sessile\\" and -cephalus meaning \\"headed\\", referring to the sessile fruiting capsules.

She is a former research professor at New York University, now retired. She is a pioneer in the development of natural language processing for computers. Early life and education Sager was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1927. In 1946 she earned a bachelor of philosophy degree from the University of Chicago. She obtained a bachelor of science in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 1953. Career After graduating from Columbia, Sager worked for five years as an electronics engineer in the Biophysics Department of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York City. In 1959 she moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where she worked on natural language computer processing. She was part of the team that developed the first English language parsing program, running on the UNIVAC I. Sager developed an algorithm to deal with syntactic ambiguity (where a sentence can be interpreted several ways due to ambiguity in its structure) and to convert sublanguage texts into suitable data formats for retrieval. This was \\"one of the first major practical applications of sublanguage analysis.\\" This work formed the basis for a PhD thesis, and in 1968 she was awarded a PhD in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her work in linguistics led her to New York University, where she collaborated with James Morris and Morris Salkoff to develop a parsing program based on natural language processing. In 1965 NYU launched the Linguistic String Project under Sager's leadership. It was aimed at developing computer methods to access information in the scientific and technical literature, based on linguistic principles. In particular, the team drew on Zellig Harris's discourse analysis methodology to develop a system for computer analysis of natural language.Sager, Naomi, and Nhan, Ngo Than, \\"The computability of strings, transformations, and sublanguage\\", pp. 78-120\\\\. Chapter in The Legacy of Zellig Harris, Vol. 2, ed. by Bruce Nevin and Stephen M. Johnson, John Benjamins Publishing Co. (2002) Sager managed the project for 30 years until her retirement in 1995. At NYU she taught classes in natural language processing and advised doctoral students, many of whom (such as Jerry Hobbs and Carol Friedman) are now leaders in the field of natural language processing.

It was founded in 2010 by Lauren Mackler. Graphic designer and curator Lauren Mackler moved from the east coast to L.A. to open Public Fiction in 2010. Public Fiction resides in an unmarked storefront in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Neither a commercial gallery nor a not-for-profit organization, the space hosts exhibitions for three months on a theme, within which are staged solo shows, group shows, performances, artist talks, screenings, and dinners, connected to that theme, all of it culminating into a publication. The publication, inspired by other artist multiples such as Aspen, Semina by Wallace Berman and Vision magazine, includes a record of everything that happened within the series, but also presents new and additional content. Though the space had already hosted several one night events, Public Fiction's first official exhibition, \\"Public Records,\\" transformed the gallery into a \\"record\\" store, with a play on words between \\"collecting\\" and \\"archiving\\". The show centered on music, archives, and collections. For \\"The Free Church,\\" its second show, artists turned the space into different iterations of a spiritual space for worship. The third iteration of the project was called the Manifest Destiny / Gold Rush series and addressed the impulse to move West, ambition and the economy. For this three-month period, one month was dedicated to a show of California artists on Entrepreneurialism, the second staged a functioning Hotel for east coast artists to come work west and the third presented a solo installation by artist David Hendren depicting a post-earthquake interior. The fourth Public Fiction series was held at the MoCA Geffen contemporary and was called \\"The Club\\". Mackler created a space and organized events addressing of social clubs, night clubs, and art clubs. Laura Owens did the poster for the series. The fifth series, was called \\"Theatricality and Sets\\" where for three months Public Fiction hosted an exhibition of artist using props, creating sets or staging a theater. The publication for this issue was called \\"The Lost Issue\\" and made jointly with \\"Lost In LA\\" a show curated by former Palais de Tokyo director Marc-Olivier Wahler. For the following \\"Foreign Correspondent\\" series, the whole space was turned into an anonymous office. In this presentation, the journal came out as a broadsheet, one week at a time, as Dispatches, the broadsheets each presented an artist on one side and a writer on the other, the participants included Camille Henrot, Charlie White, Jonathan Lethem, Neil Beloufa, Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer and more. In 2012, writer Andrew Berardini and Mackler the curated ‚ÄúTreating Shadows as Real Things,‚Äù in Torino at the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, Artists for this exhibition included Lucas Blalock, Anthony Lepore, Sarah Cain, Andrea Longacre-White, Giorgio de Chirico, Carlo Mollino, Samara Golden, Ry Rocklen, Mark Hagen. The Exhibition was presented as a tangent to the Artissima art Fair. Mackler and Berardini also organized \\"Set Pieces\\" at Milan gallery Cardi Black Box, including and inspired by the work of William Leavitt. In 2013, \\"The Stand In\\", an exhibition inspired by the surrealist model of the \\"exhibition as a medium\\", re-exhibited the same artists three times, for one month each. This was a collaboration with Alexandra Gaty. For the 2014 Frieze Art Fair in New York, Public Fiction and Allen Ruppersberg reinvented \\"Al‚Äôs Grand Hotel\\", a project initially created by Ruppersberg in 1971 in Los Angeles. The hotel originally was open for six weeks and acted as a site for happenings, parties, performances and a place to sleep. Al‚Äôs Grand Hotel was restaged as a fully functioning hotel installed within the fair, with two rooms, and a lobby. Visitors could become guests of the hotel and were allowed to book rooms to spend the night. Public Fiction was included in the 2014 Made in LA Biennial at the Hammer Museum, curated by Michael Ned Holte and Cornelia Butler. Mackler co-organized a double exhibition, within the main exhibition, titled \\"A Public Fiction\\" and \\"Tragedy + Time\\" with writer / curator Sarah Lehrer- Graiwer. The duo created a multifaceted and episodic series with revolving exhibitions taking place at the Hammer, Public Fiction's store front, and within a publication.

Background State Approving Agencies were created during the early days of the World War II ‚ÄúGI Bill of Rights‚Äù. In 1948, the State Approving Agencies gathered to form the National Association of State Approving Agencies in order to coordinate their efforts nationwide. The NASAA assisted states in their efforts to do a better job for veteran-students and served as a tool to resolve mutual problems. NASAA and SAAs represent a State- Federal partnership that allows Federal interests to be pursued at the local level while preserving the identity, interests and sovereignty of States‚Äô rights in education. NASAA also has increased its influence in the realms of education and veterans benefits over the years, playing major roles in creation of new programs, such as the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Members NASAA is made up of more than 50 state agencies nationwide that oversee education and training programs for veterans in their respective states. Some states have separate SAAs for different types of training, however most states have a single agency to evaluate, approve, and monitor education and training programs for use by GI Bill-eligible students. State Approving Agencies The State Approving Agencies (SAA) are authorized by Title 38 of the United States Code.

The game was released on January 29, 2016 for Microsoft Windows. The game runs on Unreal Engine 3. Plot The game allows the player to control Shelly \\"Bombshell\\" Harrison, a Colonel in the Global Defense Force. Her career is abruptly brought to an end after an event titled \\"the Washington Incident\\", which caused her to lose her arm and her team. Shelly is then offered a new contract by a private military contractor and offered a second chance and a new mechanical arm. Development The game was conceived during Gearbox Software's lawsuit against Interceptor regarding the video game Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction, as they did not authorize any new development. Interceptor was working on the game for the PlayStation 4 and PC; however, due to a lawsuit by Gearbox Software, who owns the right to the Duke Nukem franchise, the game's name was changed to Bombshell and the main character was changed to Shelly Harrison, who was originally meant to play a supporting role in the Duke Nukem game. In April 2014, a website NoGumNeeded.com was launched by Interceptor Entertainment that showed a countdown. The game was revealed with the title Bombshell in development for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on May 14, 2014 along with a trailer and was scheduled to be released in 2015. Some details about the gameplay and the protagonist Shelly \\"Bombshell\\" Harrison were revealed in the announcement. It was also announced that the game utilised the Unreal Engine and it will launch with modding tools. Due to the negative reception to the trailer, 3D Realms started the development of the game from scratch. The gameplay trailer was released on March 2, 2015 during Game Developers Conference. The E3 2015 trailer was released on June 25, 2015. On July 23, a ten-minute long video showing gameplay of the game was released during QuakeCon 2015. On August 27, a game trailer of the boss battle against \\"Zeroth Guardian\\" was released during PAX Prime 2015. In January 2016, the game's voice cast was announced, including Valerie Arem as Bombshell and Duke Nukem voice actor Jon St. John as Professor Jadus Heskel. The release of the Windows version of the game was delayed to January 29, 2016 so as to give additional time for the developer to fix bugs. Reception GameSpot awarded it a score of 2.0 out of 10, calling it a \\"buggy, bland game with some of the worst writing you‚Äôre likely to hear in some time.\\" Hardcore Gamer rated the game a 2 out of 5 saying \\"What once began as something that had potential to become a so-stupid-it's-awesome classic ended up being merely... well, it isn't even really that stupid as a whole, just dull.\\" PC Gamer awarded it 30%, saying \\"An [action role-playing game] with weak combat and too many bugs, Bombshell isn't worth your click- click-clicks.\\" IGN rated the game 6.9 out of 10 saying the game \\"Bombshell is a fast-paced, energetic, deliberately absurd action shooter that's mostly competent at everything it tries to do\\". Leo Espada of GoneWithTheWin rated it 6/10 and stated, \\"Bombshell features a solid core of combat mechanics, visual design, and a genius soundtrack. It is light on the RPG side, with little depth to sink your teeth into\\". It has a score of 44% on Metacritic. Prequel A prequel for Harrison's story, entitled Ion Fury was developed by Voidpoint and released in 2019 by 3D Realms. It uses an updated version of the original Build engine.

Background As part of the US-Vietnamese combined action plan for 1967, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines was scheduled to assume the defense of ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï District from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 4th Battalion, 4th Regiment 2nd Division which would concentrate on pacification. Operation A-4 Skyhawk making a bombing run on a Viet Cong position On 27 January, Company L 3/7 Marines and Battery I, 12th Marines were deployed by helicopter to N√∫i ƒê√†ng. The following morning Companies I and M 3/7 Marines were landed by helicopter north of N√∫i ƒê√†ng and moved west and east to secure the adjacent villages of Vinh Binh (1) and Truong Sanh (). On occupying Truong Sanh villagers informed the Marines that a large Vietcong force had abandoned the village and moved north to Tan Tu (2)(). As Company M advanced on Tan Tu (2) they were hit first by sniper fire and the automatic weapons fire from entrenched Vietcong in the village, the Marines withdrew, called in artillery and airstrikes and attacked again, but were again driven back by heavy fire and so withdrew to a night defensive position. On the morning of 29 January Companies I and M assaulted Tan Tu (2), despite suffering casualties from long-range sniper fire the village was barely defended and the Marines secured it by 13:30. On 30 January after preparatory artillery fire, Company I moved east towards the village of Hai Mon () where they were met with intense small arms fire, airstrikes were called in followed by helicopter gunships. One of the UH-1E gunships was hit and had to make an emergency landing. The Vietcong defenses were well- constructed and the Marines soon found themselves caught in a crossfire in the paddyfields west of the village. At 16:55 Company I was ordered to withdraw to the west and Company M was sent in to help them disengage under the cover of artillery and airstrikes, due to the intense fire the withdrawal and evacuation of casualties wasn't completed until 22:00. On 31 January a massive artillery bombardment was directed against Hai Mon. That night the 3/7 command post was hit by Vietcong mortar fire then attacked by an estimated 20 Vietcong. The attack was defeated with 2 Vietcong killed and 14 Marines wounded. On 5 February the Marines launched a fresh assault against Hai Mon. Reconnaissance had indicated that the Vietcong defenses faced west and so it was decided that Companies L and M would be deployed by helicopter east of the village. As artillery hit Hai Mon helicopters from HMM-262 deployed the Marines who were quickly able to overcome the defenses with supporting fire. A Vietcong force was observed escaping north by sampan across the Song Tra Cau and airstrikes were directed against them. On searching Hai Mon the Marines found a network of well-constructed tunnels and bunkers and engineers used over 3600 lbs of explosives to destroy them. Operation Desoto continued throughout February with the Marines searching numerous villages meeting minimal opposition but suffering steady attrition due to mines and sniper fire. On 16 February 1st Battalion 4th Marines launched Operation Deckhouse VI at Sa Hu·ª≥nh 18 km southeast of N√∫i ƒê√†ng, after securing the area and establishing a supply base 1/4 Marines were to move north to support 3/7 Marines and conduct search and destroy operations in the ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï/M·ªô ƒê·ª©c Districts. 1/4 Marines uncovered numerous Vietcong stores and bunkers and suffered 6 killed and 61 wounded while the Vietcong lost 201 killed before arriving at positions near Nui Dau () on 25 February. Deckhouse VI continued until 3 March. Operation Desoto continued into March with numerous small skirmishes with the Vietcong. On the early morning of 24 March the Vietong hit the 3/7 Marines base with mortar and recoilless rifle fire killing 3 Marines and igniting a 70,000-gallon fuel storage dump. On 27 March the Vietcong fired 18 recoilless rifle rounds at the 1 km from the mouth of the Song Tra Cau causing no damage to the ship. Also on 27 March Company K 3/7 Marines conducted a search operation near Nui Dau and Vietcong were observed to be escaping the area and hiding in a nearby swamp; helicopter gunships attacked the swamp killing 23 Vietcong while another 49 were captured. On 5 April a patrol from Company G 3/7 Marines triggered a mine near their night defensive position southeast of Nui Dau. A medical evacuation of the two wounded Marines was requested and a UH-1E gunship #151852 from VMO-6 arrived to pick up the wounded; the helicopter was instructed to hover over the landing zone in case there were any more mines, but as it did so a command-detonated mine made from a 250 lb bomb was detonated destroying the helicopter and a further mine was detonated as Marines rushed to assist, killing all 4 helicopter crew and 8 Marines and Navy corpsmen. Aftermath Operation Desoto concluded on 7 April, the Marines had suffered 76 dead and 573 wounded and claimed the Vietcong 383 killed.

It was founded in 1979 and has never been officially dissolved, but lost any political significance in 2001 when it was abandoned by its long-term leader Samak Sundaravej.  History  The Thai Citizen Party was founded in 1978 by Samak Sundaravej who had been the main representative of the Democrat Party's right wing until then. It was officially registered in 1979 when a new constitution lifted the ban of all political parties. With the TCP, Samak created a competition for the Democrat Party in its traditional stronghold Bangkok. The party failed, however, to extend its appeal to constituencies outside the capital. In the 1979 general election, TCP won 32 of 301 seats: almost all of the Bangkok constituencies, but only three outside the capital. In 1983, it increased its number of seats to 36 of 324 (24 of which were elected in Bangkok), and became part of Prem Tinsulanonda's government coalition. In the 1986 election, the TCP lost 12 seats (most of them went to the reinvigorated Democrats) and went into opposition. In the 1988 snap election, the party recovered 31 of now 357 seats. It was included in Chatichai Choonhavan's government coalition from 1990 to 1991. In the March 1992 election, TCP lost most of its seats, dropping to 7 of 360, faced with the competition of the new Palang Dharma Party which attracted a majority of the Bangkok middle-class electorate. However it was provided with positions in Suchinda Kraprayoon's pro-military cabinet that was confronted with civic mass protests during \\"Black May\\". After the government's resignation, fresh elections in September 1992 brought the party's utter defeat, as it was associated by the urban middle class with the old government's attempt to violently suppress the popular uprising. It dropped to only 3 seats. It could recover a little, winning 18 of 55 seats in Bangkok's city assembly in 1994. One year later it also regained some strength on the national level, winning 18 out of a total of 391 seats, mostly due to the rival Palang Dharma Party's loss of popularity in Bangkok. It joined Banharn Silpa-archa's coalition government. In the snap poll of 1996, its number of seats remained the same, and it continued to be part of the government, now under Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. When the parliament unseated Chavalit in a vote of no confidence at the peak of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the party split: 12 of its 18 members of parliament (MPs)‚Äîthe so-called \\"Cobra faction\\"‚Äîsupported the new government of Chuan Leekpai, defying a party board resolution not to do so, and were therefore expelled from the party. The Constitutional Court was invoked and decided that MPs were allowed to keep their seats and to join another party after being expelled from their original party. In 2001, TCP founder and long-term leader Samak abandoned his party after he had been elected Governor of Bangkok on a nonpartisan platform.

The labellum is sharply curved near its middle, often has a wavy edge and is covered with a raised callus. Flowering occurs from January to March and unlike many others in the genus, does not require fire the previous summer in order to flower. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1922 by Richard Sanders Rogers and given the name Prasophyllum frenchii var. tadgellianum from a specimen collected on Mount Hotham by Alfred James Tadgell. The description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The following year, Rogers raised the variety to species level. The specific epithet (tadgellianum) honours Alfred James Tadgell. In 1944, Herman Rupp described P. tadgellianum as a synonym of P. alpinum in his book Orchids of New South Wales but in 1996, David Jones reinstated P. tadgellianum as a common species found in south-eastern Australia and described P. alpinum as a species restricted to Tasmania. Distribution and habitat The alpine leek orchid grows in grassy alpine and subalpine grassland and woodland, often in moist or wet areas, in areas above . It is found south of the Brindabella Range in New South Wales and Victoria. In Tasmania it is found only near Cradle Mountain and near Bastion Bluff in the Great Western Tiers. Conservation This orchid is listed as \\"Rare\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

Description Prasophyllum alpinum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf, long and wide. The leaf has a white base and its free part is long. Between five and fourteen flowers are arranged along a flowering spike long. The flowers are green to greenish-brown, long and sometimes some of them do not open. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are joined along their sides and the petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide. The labellum is egg-shaped to broad lance-shaped, long, about long and white or greenish.

The piece was completed December 29, 2013, and premiered October 9, 2014, in Avery Fisher Hall, New York City.Rouse, Christopher. Thunderstuck: Program note by the composer. 2014. Retrieved March 4, 2015. The premiere was performed by conductor Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic, and the work is dedicated to both. Composition =Styles and influences= The style of Thunderstuck celebrates rock and roll music of the 1970s. In the program notes, Rouse called the work \\"a nine-minute concert opener that reflects my continuing love of the popular music of my younger years. Rock music has had an influence on several of my works, but none more so than this one.\\" Its conception is similar to that of Rouse's 1988 percussion ensemble piece Bonham, a tribute to rock drummers and named after Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. Thunderstuck directly references the 1978 Jay Ferguson song \\"Thunder Island\\", which partially inspired the work's title. David Allen of The New York Times has also compared the piece to the music of Jefferson Airplane. =Instrumentation= Thunderstuck is scored for three flutes, three oboes, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, timpani, percussion (three players), and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Reviewing the 2014 premiere of Thunderstuck, music critic Lewis M. Smoley lauded the work, saying, \\"Permeated with syncopated and chugging rhythms, brash outbursts and colorful orchestration, the music splashed across the sonic spectrum, energized by youthful vigor, and at times evocative of the music of Aaron Copland or Roy Harris.\\" Despite criticizing the premiere performance, David Allen of The New York Times also praised the piece, saying, \\"It's designed to be a fun concert opener, and it is.\\" Eric C. Simpson of the New York Classical Review was slightly more critical, saying, \\"Rouse says the work is meant to be 'engaging and fun.' It is both those things to some degree, though it is also completely out of left field, both in general and for Rouse specifically.

It considers itself a part of the alt-right movement. Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013, as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website Total Fascism, which had focused on his own long-form essays on fascism, race, and antisemitic conspiracy theories. In contrast, The Daily Stormer relies heavily on quoted material with exaggerated headlines. The site is known for its use of Internet memes, which have been likened to the imageboard 4chan and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience. While some white nationalist authors have praised The Daily Stormers reach, others have taken issue with its content and tone, accusing Anglin of being an agent provocateur, used to discredit true white nationalism. The Daily Stormer orchestrates what it calls the \\"Troll Army\\", which is involved in Internet trolling of figures with whom Anglin disagrees politically. In August 2017, after causing outrage by insulting the victim of a car-ramming homicide at the far-right Unite the Right rally, the website was rejected by several domain registrars. In August 2019, the site went offline temporarily when their service provider, BitMitigate, was cut off by their cloud infrastructure provider; the site found another provider. In June 2019, a federal judge ordered Anglin to pay $4.1 million to comedian Dean Obeidallah, whom Anglin had falsely accused of orchestrating the Manchester Arena bombing. In July 2019, a federal magistrate recommended that Anglin pay $14 million to Tanya Gersh, a woman from Whitefish, Montana whom Anglin had organized a targeted harassment campaign against.  Management  =Founder= Andrew Anglin was born in 1984, and grew up near Columbus, Ohio. According to both Anglin and his childhood classmates, he was liberal as a youth. He attended the Linworth Alternative Program and the Worthington Kilbourne High School from 1999 to 2003, where he was remembered as a dreadlocked vegan. His friends in high school report that his behavior changed during his sophomore year at Linworth, where he exhibited self-harming behavior, and began promoting conspiracy theories. After high school, Anglin took classes at Columbus State Community College in 2003, and studied English at Ohio State University for one semester in 2004. In 2006 Anglin launched a conspiracy theory website, Outlaw Journalism, which was modeled after the works of Alex Jones and Hunter S. Thompson, whom Anglin admired. In 2008, after posting on Outlaw Journalism that the only way for humanity to survive was to return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, Anglin began traveling around Southeast Asia, eventually ending up in Davao City, in the Philippines. In 2011, he spent several weeks with a Tboli village in southern Mindanao, where he initially intended to stay permanently, selling some of his possessions to raise money for a dowry to marry two local Muslim women. In 2012, Anglin wrote that he found the locals to be \\"a civilized, non-aggressive and industrious people\\" but he eventually came to consider them too \\"primitive\\", became lonely and only wanted to associate with members of his own race, and \\"By the Grace of God, I found Adolf Hitler\\". In 2012, Anglin launched another website, Adventure Quest 2012, which discussed conspiracy theories such as the existence of reptilian humanoids. He described the aim of the site as seeking to \\"mend the wounds produced by modern society ... and [help] the reader transcend these physical bonds and reach total ascendancy. To mend these wounds, the world must learn to embrace diversity and color.\\" In 2014, he stated that although he agreed with the central tenets of Nazism, he had reservations over reintroducing all aspects of Hitler's regime. A self- proclaimed \\"troll\\", Anglin stated that he was introduced to Nazism on the online imageboard 4chan. Later in 2012, he launched his first neo-Nazi website, Total Fascism. Feeling that Total Fascism was not appealing to a younger demographic and had articles that were too long, Anglin launched The Daily Stormer on July 4, 2013, with shorter articles and a more provocative style. Anglin said in March 2014 he spends 70 hours a week writing for the website. Anglin's location is not known. An investigative article by The Huffington Post in November 2016 analyzed his social media and FBI sources, and concluded that he was living in Germany. Rumors have also claimed that he is residing in Russia. In July 2017, Anglin told CNN he was residing in Lagos, Nigeria. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the site as being headquartered in Worthington, Ohio, with activity in several other states. The website is registered in the name of Anglin's father Greg, who runs a Christian-inspired counseling service in Worthington. = Finances = The Daily Stormer is primarily funded through donations which Anglin solicits regularly from site visitors. His father was protested against by Anti-Racist Action for receiving donations from the site's readers to pass on to his son. In February 2017, the website announced a corporate sponsor‚ÄîSmerff Electrical, owned by Simon Hickey of Brisbane, Australia, whose website contains images of alt-right meme Pepe the Frog. Anglin told Mother Jones that he received donations from Silicon Valley, and that Santa Clara County, California was the largest source of traffic to his website. The site is believed to have received over $200,000 in Bitcoin contributions since it began accepting the cryptocurrency in 2014. A current cryptocurrency wallet has consistently kept approximately $80,000 in Bitcoin on hand. Money entering and being spent by the accounts is publicly tracked by a Twitter bot. A Twitter account supportive of the Stormer announced that Coinbase was deleting accounts of persons attempting to send Bitcoin to them; Coinbase stated in general terms that it \\"prohibits use of an account which would abuse, harass, threaten, or promote violence against others\\". On August 20, 2017, for example, Anglin received a donation of 14.88 bitcoin, the number being a reference to Fourteen Words, and to Adolf Hitler (H is the eighth letter, so \\"88\\" = \\"HH\\" = \\"Heil Hitler\\"). At the time, it was worth $60,000, but had Anglin kept the entire amount, it would have been worth about $235,000 by the end of the year. The Daily Stormer is run through a company called Moonbase Holdings, with Anglin saying that he chose the name so that donors could avoid scrutiny from their credit card companies. The company made $3,400 per month on the alt-right crowdfunding website Hatreon, which ceased operations in February 2017. In his defamation lawsuit against Anglin, Muslim American radio personality Dean Obeidallah requested that Moonbase Holdings be scrutinized to find any other individuals with connections to the company. Content and reception The Daily Stormer is named for the Nazi tabloid alt=Black and white historical photograph of several men, some with Nazi armbands, reading a newspaper billboard. The Daily Stormer takes its name from the Nazi Party's tabloid newspaper Der St√ºrmer, known for its virulently antisemitic caricatures of Jews and semi-pornography involving Jews raping young Aryan girls. Its publisher, Julius Streicher, was executed after the Second World War for crimes against humanity. The Southern Poverty Law Center described the site as \\"the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web\\", which \\"has in the last six months [up to March 2015] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, Stormfront, in terms of reach and page views, based on Alexa data\\". Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors. The website is part of the alt-right movement, and it calls itself \\"The World‚Äôs Most Visited Alt-Right Website\\". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, \\"bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump and Britain's decision to leave the European Union\\", Anglin declared: \\"We won the meme war; now we've taken over the GOP, and we did this very, very quickly.\\" Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: \\"The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated\\". =Content and style= Anglin asserts that the purpose of The Daily Stormer is to provide \\"a means to propagandize people ‚Ä¶ to get them to look at the world in a certain way\\". Headlines include \\"All Intelligent People in History Disliked Jews\\", and \\"Adolf Hitler: The Most Lied About Man of All Time\\". The site bills itself as \\"America's #1 Most-Trusted Republican News Source\\". According to The Jewish Chronicle, The Daily Stormer \\"posts hundreds of racist articles targeting black people, Arabs and Jews\\". The website offers pro-separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Anglin considers \\"the correct moral position\\". The site promotes the conspiracy theory that Jews are shape shifting reptilians who rule the Earth, which Anglin had previously discussed on his web site Adventure Quest 2012. The SPLC stated that The Daily Stormer owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan becoming popular among racists, as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles. One meme the website has used is to overlay photographs of Taylor Swift with anti- Semitic quotations, including those by Hitler. The website puts triple parentheses around the names of Jews, a far-right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff. Jacob Siegel of The Daily Beast wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor, and was attracting activists of other anti-political correctness ideologies‚Äîsuch as Gamergaters, men's rights activists and opponents of social justice warriors‚Äîwho would not usually identify with fascism. The SPLC has also documented Anglin's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities. He has also said that \\"ridiculous\\" statements such as \\"gas the kikes\\", if repeated in media coverage, can work to desensitize the public to the Holocaust. He also believes that his extreme right-wing rhetoric can normalize less extreme right-wingers such as Trump. In December 2017, The Huffington Post leaked Anglin's 17-page style guide for the website, which included the guideline that articles must be so extremely hyperbolic that readers would be unsure whether the content is parody. The hacker and Internet troll known as \\"weev\\" (Andrew Alan Escher Auernheimer) wrote an article on the website after his release from prison in October 2014, espousing his recent conversion to Neo-Nazism and his opposition to Jews who had built \\"an empire of wickedness the likes the world has never seen\\". Fredrick Brennan, founder of the online community 8chan, wrote an article on The Daily Stormer encouraging eugenics, based on his own experiences of having brittle bone disease. Florida-based Jewish troll Joshua Ryne Goldberg, who encouraged a 2015 attack on a free speech exhibition in Garland, Texas, under the alias of a Muslim extremist, wrote white supremacist articles for The Daily Stormer under the pseudonym Michael Slay. The Daily Stormer accepts freelance work and pays $14.88 (a reference to David Lane's Fourteen Words and the Nazi slogan Heil Hitler) per article. The second-most prolific writer on the website goes by the pseudonym \\"Zeiger\\" and was unmasked in 2018 by the Montreal Gazette as Gabriel Sohier Chaput, an IT consultant from Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie, Quebec. Gabriel Sohier-Chaput was also a member of the now-defunct neo-Nazi online forum Iron March and was a supporter of the terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division writing articles promoting the group. Another notable prolific writer was Robert Warren \\"Azzmador\\" Ray, an East Texas-based neo-Nazi who gained national prominence from an appearance on a Vice News documentary by Elle Reeve about the Charlottesville riots where he complained that Charlottesville was run by \\"Jewish communists and criminal niggers\\". Ray is also the creator of The Krypto Report, the main podcast show of the Daily Stormer. A more recently-known associate/member of The Daily Stormer was Daniel Kenneth Jeffries from Granbury, Texas who goes by the nickname of \\"Grandpa Lampshade\\" (a reference to the World War II rumour that the Nazis made lampshades out of executed Holocaust prisoners) and hosts the \\"Thoughts on the Day\\" segment on the United Kingdom-based neo-Nazi radio network Radio Aryan founded by Steve \\"Sven Longshanks\\" Stone, Laurence \\"Max Musson\\" Nunn, and Jeremiah \\"Jez\\" Bedford-Turner of which the radio is prominently featured on The Daily Stormer. Some of Jeffries/Lampshade's posts were also shared by Robert Bowers, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and domestic terrorist. The Daily Stormer attracted media coverage when the SPLC stated that white supremacist spree killer Dylann Roof‚Äîwho on June 17, 2015, shot nine African Americans to death in the Charleston church shooting‚Äîmay have made several comments on the site. The SPLC found similarities between one user's comments and Roof's manifesto. The Daily Beast stated that Anglin \\"repudiated Roof's crime and publicly disavowed violence, while endorsing many of Roof's views\\". In October of that year, Anglin gave a positive reaction to an attempted assassination on Henriette Reker, a pro-immigration candidate to be mayor of the German city of Cologne, decrying her as a \\"feminist hag\\". In May 2017, weev set up the first non-English version of The Daily Stormer, El Daily Stormer in Spanish. It focused on news related to white nationalism in Spain and Latin America. El Daily Stormer was one of the sites where the identity of the victim of La Manada was spread. In December 2018, three admins of the site were arrested by the national police of Spain and a fourth member has been identified. =Support for Donald Trump= presidential campaign in 2016. Anglin officially endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to \\"vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests\\". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed \\"Heil Donald Trump ‚Äì The Ultimate Savior\\". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs. In The Daily Telegraph, Trump supporter Crystal Wright wrote that the candidate needed to separate himself from white nationalists such as The Daily Stormer, who were endorsing him ahead of other politicians they deemed \\"cuckservatives\\" for holding more liberal positions. Writing for The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf theorized that modern academia's focus on race rather than \\"color-blind\\" individualism was causing divisions and allowing white nationalist sites such as The Daily Stormer to gain an audience, and therefore become a \\"tiny but nevertheless alarming portion\\" of Trump's support. Al Jazeera writer Malcolm Harris analyzed the endorsement and predicted that a Trump presidency would strengthen organized racist groups and lead to civil war. After Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Anglin called on the site's readers to use non-violent intimidation to make \\"brown people\\" feel unwelcome in America, and to goad disappointed supporters of Clinton into committing suicide. In response to the bombing of the Syrian government's Shayrat Airbase in 2017, The Daily Stormer was one of several alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged the president could be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions. =Reaction from white nationalists= alt=Photographic portrait of a smiling man outside White nationalist websites such as Stormfront and Counter-Currents have taken issue with what they see as lowbrow coverage on The Daily Stormer, as well as Anglin's defense of Christianity and denunciation of the white supremacist group Christian Identity. Kyle Rogers of the Council of Conservative Citizens has also criticized the website for reprinting its material. Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website. Colin Liddell of AlternativeRight.com has criticized Anglin's beliefs and tone. Liddell, who believes that stopping migration and encouraging higher birthrates is more important for preserving the white race, condemned Anglin for writing that it was impossible for the race to survive without adopting his views on Jews, Hitler and the Holocaust. Liddell considered that Anglin was attracting poor whites with his provocative online persona in the same manner as monster trucks and professional wrestling, writing that \\"it is hard not to conclude that Anglin is a paid shill and agent provocateur, whose purpose is simply to infest and discredit White nationalism\\". Jared Taylor of American Renaissance criticized The Daily Stormer \\"extremely harsh, dismissive and insulting tone toward blacks\\", which he called unhelpful. Others, such as the Traditionalist Youth Network, have praised The Daily Stormer for its reach and influence. Anglin's extreme tone has led some white nationalists to suspect that he is an undercover Jew, an accusation he finds analogous to believing that Jewish LGBT activist Allen Ginsberg was an undercover Nazi. Activities =Harassment by the \\"Troll Army\\"= alt=Photographic portrait of a young woman with long dark hair Luciana Berger The Daily Stormer orchestrates what it calls a \\"Troll Army\\", involved in Internet trolling. It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger, a Jewish Member of Parliament. A member of neo-Nazi group National Action had been sent to prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter, and The Daily Stormer encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages, as long as they did not promote violence. It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create anonymous e-mail and Twitter accounts. Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week. The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament, where Speaker John Bercow deemed it \\"beneath contempt\\". The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam Veiszadeh, an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T-shirt bearing the Australian flag reading \\"If you don't love it, leave\\" be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths. A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages, and Anglin interpreted Veiszadeh's actions as curbing freedom of speech, which he believed \\"should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech\\". Alex Jones and Breitbart The \\"Troll Army\\" has also attacked right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for having a Jewish wife. In November 2015, they took part in \\"Operation: Kikebart\\", targeting conservative news website Breitbart News for opening an office in Israel. The aim was to post so much anti-Semitic content in the comments section that it would be unfeasible to moderate. Disqus, the comment platform used by websites including Breitbart, ended its service to The Daily Stormer as a result. Alison Rapp In 2016, The Daily Stormer took part in a Gamergate- related attempt to have Nintendo marketing officer Alison Rapp fired; Nintendo dismissed her and stated that it was unrelated to the controversy. Julia Ioffe Later in 2016, the site encouraged racially abusing Julia Ioffe, a Russian-Jewish journalist who had written a piece on Trump's wife, Melania Trump, in GQ magazine. Melania Trump and The Daily Stormer both found the piece too critical. Ioffe said that the abuse was unparalleled in her lifetime since leaving Russia to escape such prejudices 26 years earlier. Erin Schrode In June, users of the website revealed the personal details of Erin Schrode, a Jewish woman running for Congress in California, and sent her Holocaust-related messages. Tanya Gersh The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit in April 2017 on behalf of Montana Jewish resident Tanya Gersh, against Anglin and The Daily Stormer, alleging they had invaded her privacy and caused \\"intentional infliction of emotional distress\\" upon Gersh, and also violated Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act. The website initiated a \\"troll storm\\" in response to Gersh's alleged extortion of property belonging to the mother of white nationalist Richard B. Spencer. Gersh denies the allegations. The site crowdfunded $152,000 in legal fees from around 2,000 contributors and hired First Amendment lawyer Marc Randazza, whose previous clients include 8chan and right-wing author Mike Cernovich. The suit ran into difficulties because of Anglin's secrecy over his location. In November, a federal judge ruled that Gersh was not a public figure, that Anglin had intentionally incited his readers to harass Gersh, and that such harassment was not protected as free speech. Gersh testified in the lawsuit, as did her therapist, to describe the effects on her of the continued harassment of the \\"troll army\\". Anglin did not appear at a hearing, despite being ordered to do so by the trial judge, saying that he feared for his safety; he is presumed to be outside of the United States. By not appearing, he forfeited his legal right to defend his actions.Simon, Mallory and Sidner, Sara (July 12, 2019) \\"Jewish woman tells court how followers of a neo-Nazi targeted her\\" CNN On July 15, 2019, the federal magistrate overseeing the trial recommended that Gersh receive a default judgment of $14 million, $4 million in compensatory damages, and $10 million in punitive damages. The magistrate also recommended that Anglin be forced to remove the posts encouraging the harassment of Gersh from The Daily Stormer website.Simon, Mallory and Sidner, Sara (July 15, 2019) \\"Federal magistrate says Jewish woman should get $14 million from neo-Nazi who orchestrated troll-storm\\" CNN On August 8, the magistrate's recommendations were approved by a U.S. District Court judge. David Dinielli, the deputy legal director of the SPLC, said that the organization would \\"go to the ends of the earth to collect the judgment on behalf of our client, Tanya Gersh, whether it's cash, assets or intellectual property. ... We will employ various procedures to obtain any assets that can be seized, if Anglin does not pay the full $14 million judgment. And if his monetary and other hard assets are insufficient, we will go after his intangible property.\\" According to Anglin's lawyer at the time, who no longer represents him, Anglin is not now a U.S. resident.Simon, Mallory and Sidner, Sara (August 8, 2019) \\"Neo-Nazi website founder ordered to pay $14M for troll storm\\" CNN Dean Obeidallah In August 2017, Muslim American radio presenter Dean Obeidallah sued The Daily Stormer in an Ohio federal court. Anglin had published fake images which purported to show Obeidallah celebrating the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. The lawsuits cleared a longstanding hurdle in March 2018, when U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch declared that there was sufficient evidence of Anglin being domiciled in Ohio despite living abroad. In July, the court found in Obeidallah's favor, with neither Anglin nor his representatives present in court. Taylor Dumpson Taylor Dumpson, the first black student body president at American University, sued Anglin in May 2018 for organizing a racist and sexist trolling campaign against her. She alleges that Anglin posted her name, her picture, links to her Facebook page, and to the Twitter page of the university's student government, and urged his readers to \\"troll storm\\" her, which resulted in many hate-filled and racist online messages directed at her. Although Dumpson and Anglin have not reached a settlement, she settled in December 2018 with one of the people who harassed her, a man from Eugene, Oregon named Evan McCarty who was a neo-Nazi musician and former theatre actor known as \\"Byron de la Vandal\\" (named after Byron de la Beckwith, the assassin of Medgar Evans) who served as a member of the fascist Vanguard America and affiliated with the Daily Stormer. McCarty was required to apologize, to renounce white supremacy, to stop trolling and doxing online, and to provide information to and cooperate with authorities in the prosecution of white supremacists.Larimer, Sarah (December 21, 2018) \\"Man who harassed black student online must deliver ‚Äòsincere‚Äô apology, renounce white supremacy\\" The Washington Post The lawsuit that was brought on her behalf was led by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law which continues to use litigation as a tool to fight extremism and to slow the efforts of white supremacists. On August 9, 2019, a Federal judge awarded Dumpson a judgment of over $725,000, to be paid by Andrew Anglin, Brian Andrew Ade, and the shell company which owns The Daily Stormer. The defendants did not show up to contest the lawsuit, so a default judgment was entered against them, consisting of $101,429.28 in compensatory damages, punitive damages of $500,000 and attorney's fees and costs of $124,022.10. A restraining order was also handed down, as was an injunction not to publish anything more about Dumpson. The judgement comes only a day after Tanya Gersh was awarded a $14 million default judgment against Anglin.Keeley, Matt (August 9, 2019) \\"A Black Woman Was Awarded $725,000 In a Lawsuit Against A Neo-Nazi Who Led a Harassment Campaign Against Her\\" Newsweek = Distribution of propaganda = In 2016, The Daily Stormer and the hacker weev jointly took credit for sending copies of a racist, anti-Semitic flier to thousands of publicly accessible, Internet-connected printers throughout the country, many of them at universities. The flier urged the reader to visit the website and accompany it \\"in the struggle for global white supremacy\\". Anglin credited weev for the printer exploit, while one of The Daily Stormer crew composed the flier's text. On April 20 that year, Hitler's birthday, university printers in Germany were hacked to publish Nazi propaganda tracts including the website's name. That same year, The Daily Stormer expanded its activities to establish 31 \\"clubs\\".Mark Potok, The Year in Hate and Extremism: 2017 Spring Issue , Intelligence Report, Southern Poverty Law Center (February 15, 2017): \\"The Daily Stormer, the website whose chief came up with the term 'Our Glorious Leader' for Trump, expanded into real-world activism by starting 31 'clubs'.\\" The Daily Stormer capitalized on the popularity of the augmented reality video game Pok√©mon Go in mid-2016 to distribute racist flyers to children congregating in public to play the game, with Anglin explaining that \\"I have long thought that we needed to get pre-teens involved in the movement. At that age, you can really brainwash someone easily. Anyone who accepts Nazism at the age of 10 or 11 is going to be a Nazi for life.\\" On May 3, 2017, one day after a deadly stabbing attack at the University of Texas, racist flyers were posted across campus with the website address for The Daily Stormer, a caricature of a black person, and the line \\"... around blacks ... never relax!\\".  Site hosting issues after the 2017 Unite the Right rally  alt=Floral tributes on an empty street The Daily Stormer helped organize the Unite the Right rally, a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 11 and 12, 2017, in which a counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed in a vehicular ramming. Weev also called for readers of The Daily Stormer to locate and attend Heyer's funeral, calling her a \\"fat skank\\". Both Anglin and weev deny that Heyer died from vehicular impact, claiming instead that she was killed by a weight- related heart attack. On August 13, the website was informed by its domain registrar GoDaddy that it had violated the terms of service by mocking Heyer, and Anglin was given 24 hours to locate a new registrar for the site. The next day it moved to Google which almost immediately cancelled its registration for violation of terms, also terminating the website's YouTube account. The following day, the website registered with Tucows, who canceled it hours later for regularly inciting violence. On August 15, it was announced by weev that the site had moved to the dark web, and that it was now only accessible via Tor, while Facebook banned links to the site and Discord banned its server. On August 16, Cloudflare, the DNS provider and proxy service used to protect The Daily Stormer, also terminated their service. Cloudflare had traditionally refused to terminate sites based on their content, but CEO Matthew Prince made an exception, posting a public announcement and explanation on the company blog. The Daily Stormer now receives DDoS protection from a content distribution network set up in March 2017, BitMitigate. The company's founder, Nick Lim, said that he found The Daily Stormer to be \\"stupid\\" but believed in freedom of expression. Several Twitter accounts connected with The Daily Stormer were also suspended. On August 17, after a relocation to dailystormer.ru, the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor requested a shutdown of the domain. The Daily Stormer briefly returned to the clearnet with a .lol gTLD, dailystormer.lol, administered by Namecheap, but after two days, Namecheap canceled the domain. The company's CEO Richard Kirkendall stated that \\"the quality and context of the material, paired with the support for violent groups and causes passes from protected free speech into incitement\\", specifically quoting one published statement from The Daily Stormer: \\"It doesn't take a Ph.D. in mathematics to understand that White men + pride + organization = Jews being stuffed into ovens.\\" The site returned to the web as punishedstormer.com on August 24, hosted by DreamHost, whose other clients include the far-right National Vanguard and the Northwest Front. Denial-of- service attacks from Anonymous caused intermittent outages for all of DreamHost's sites, including those unconnected to white supremacist ideology. Within hours of the attack, DreamHost canceled the site's accounts for violating its terms of service, saying the host had already been kicked off the site years previously and was exploiting an automated sign-up process. Days later, The Daily Stormer was available under an Albanian .al ccTLD, dailystormer.al. Within four days, it was removed by registrar Host.al for breaking their content rules. In September, The Daily Stormer was briefly registered with a .at address from Austria, but this was removed by registrar nic.at when local politicians complained. Later that month, it reappeared on a .is domain from Iceland, a country known for its freedom of speech; Anglin said that the recent collapse of the Nordic island's government meant that politicians would be distracted from affairs related to his website. Before the end of September, ISNIC pulled The Daily Stormer because Anglin refused its standard condition of disclosing his address, fearing that the information would be passed to law agencies. From September 21 to October 6, The Daily Stormer was hosted on a .cat domain, exclusively reserved for websites promoting Catalan language and culture. It exploited weakened filters after the Spanish government raided the offices of registrar Fundaci√≥ puntCAT amidst a political crisis, and published several pieces in support of Catalan independence. In November 2017, The Daily Stormer was registered with a .hk domain from Hong Kong, which was revoked before the end of the month. On November 29, 2017, the site returned to the clear web yet again with a new .red domain name, registered through GKG.net. The domain kept the website online until it was seized by the registrar. Hours after the domain was seized, the site was registered on a new .top website, through the same registrar they has previously used for .red. The .top domain lasted just until February 2, 2018, when it was taken offline by the registrar. In February 2018, The Daily Stormer registered a new domain under the .name TLD with the Chinese-based internet company Eranet International Limited. =Reaction= The domain blocking by Internet providers has raised questions regarding the implications of domain registrants policing the Internet. The August 21 cancellation of The Rebel Media's registration on 24 hours' notice was compared to that of The Daily Stormer, as both had provided coverage sympathetic to Charlottesville protesters. The Electronic Frontier Foundation acknowledged that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but said that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other political views, including left-wing ones, could be denied legal protection. Several news outlets also published editorials discussing the free speech implications of the move. As of August 17, The Daily Stormer had returned to the dark web on the Tor network. This prompted an announcement from the Tor project team that they were \\"disgusted\\" by the website, but that they were powerless to intervene.

She studied under John Opie and exhibited her works at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1794 and 1797. Early life Jane Beetham was born about 1773 to Edward and Isabella Beetham. She was the granddaughter of William Betham of Little Strickland in Cumbria, England. Mary Matilda Betham was her cousin. Jane was the first of six children. Her brother, William was born in 1774. Her other siblings were Harriet, Charles, Cecilia, and Alfred. The Beethams first lived in Cow Lane, Clerkenwell, London and then Little Queen Street, Holborn, London. They moved to 26 and 27 Fleet Street in 1785. Her mother operated a silhouette portrait studio and her father sold his patented washing machines in the buildings that housed their residence. Education and career Jane Read, Unknown Gentleman Read painted portraits from the 1790s until 1815. She painted silhouettes, generally on glass, for her mother from the early 1790s until 1797. Read's work was influenced by her mother's style and was often framed in pearwood or papier-mache. Her name (Miss Beetham) appeared on the sixth of seven trade labels issued by Isabella's business. The sixth label was used in the 1790s. In the late 1790s, Jane developed her own business with her own trade label. She added brass or ormolu frames as her career progressed. Jane Read, Unknown Gentleman She studied painting under John Opie and was the only female student that he taught. He painted her portrait between 1790 and 1800. Using a painting made by Opie, Read painted a portrait of Dr. Priestly. They may have had a romantic relationship. It was a concern of her uncle, Rev. William Betham (1749‚Äì1839) who warned Isabella about Jane and Opie spending too much time together. His comments soured William's relationship with the Beetham's. Opie's wife, the former Mary Bunn, ran off with another man and the Opies were divorced on 23 December 1796. Opie was adamantly rejected when he asked Edward Beetham if he could marry Jane. Soon after, Jane married John Read. As she began painting miniature portraits, she developed her own personal style. She often framed sitter's faces with dark foliage of landscaped backgrounds. She used a combination of techniques to depict bone structure, used stippling and hatching to capture the subject's features, and used a combination of thick and thin paint brush strokes. Her tools included two sizes of needles, for details, and two sizes of brushes. Read also created works using her own aquatint method. Jane Read, Portrait painted on glass of Mrs. Maria Fitzherbert, a widow who married George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV). Read exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy of Arts for four consecutive years, from 1794 to 1797. A total of 15 paintings were shown, including Cordelia Angelica Read, A Lady Reading a Letter, Andromeda, Eloisa, and King Lear and Cordelia. Personal life She married John Read, a solicitor from London around 1797 or in 1798. He was much older, wealthy, and eccentric. They had a daughter, Cordelia Angelica Read and lived on Lamb's Conduit Street. Jane's father died in 1809 and his estate was divided equally amongst her mother and the six Beetham children. John died in 1847. Jane and Cordelia, known as the \\"old sisters\\" for their eccentric behavior, lived together in Stamford Street, London. The house was suggested to be haunted, according to newspaper articles. Cordelia remained single her entire life. Jane died in London on 16 January 1857. Upon her death in December 1871, Cordelia left her mother's pictures and a legacy of ¬£100,000 () to the Brompton Consumption Hospital, which was used to build an extension to the hospital. A memorial slab was laid in her honor under a central window. The hospital also received the Read's art collection which included a number of paintings by Opie and by Beetham. Cordelia had lived as if she was destitute and was negligent in the care of material items. Many of the paintings needed to be refurbished and preserved, which was funded by selling off some of the paintings.

It is situated about north East of Papunya and approximately north west of Alice Springs just off the Tanami Track in the central region of the Northern Territory. The property shares a boundary with Yunkanjini Aboriginal Land Trust to the south, the Yuendumu Aboriginal Land Trust to the east, the Mala Aboriginal Land Trust to the north and the Lake MacKay Aboriginal Land Trust to the west. The nearest leases are Newhaven to the south and Mount Denison to the east. Early history The Traditional Owners of the area are the Walpiri peoples who received recognition for their native title of the area in 2014. The initial application had been filed with the Federal Court in 2005 the later withdrawn in 2011 and filed again shortly afterward with recognition being awarded in 2013. The station was established by William Braitling, better known as Bill, and his wife Doreen Braitling in 1932. They acquired the lease after a few years working as drovers in the Territory. The property is named after Doreen. In 1945 Bill Braitling was charged with assault for tying an Aboriginal man to a tree, \\"thrashed him with four heavy mulga waddies\\". Braitling was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 1946 and unsuccessfully claimed improper police methods were used. Doreen Braitling applied for a mineral lease in 1947. Bill Braitling stood as the candidate for Stuart in the 1951 Northern Territory Legislative Cuuncil Election. In 1953, Braitling attempted to establish the Northern Territory's first Arab stud at Mount Doreen. Bill lived on Mount Doreen Station until his death in Alice Springs in 1959.  Recent history The property was put on the market in 2012 but was later withdrawn from sale. Matthew Braitling took over the station and 2013, he was charged with animal cruelty after an incident that had occurred in 2012 where he failed to alleviate the suffering of a cow with a deformed head and another that had an ingrown horn. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was later found guilty, but had no conviction recorded. Since 2007, it has been located with the locality of Lake Mackay.

Indian J Urol 2014;30:454-5. Carcinoma (from the Greek karkinos, or \\"crab\\", and -oma, \\"growth\\") is a type of cancer. A carcinoma is a cancer that begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer surfaces of the body, and that generally arises from cells originating in the endodermal or ectodermal germ layer during embryogenesis. Symptoms Symptoms vary between individuals and can be dependent upon the stage of growth of the carcinoma. Presence of the carcinoma can lead to be asymptomatic blood in the urine (hematuria), Hematuria can be visible or detected microscopically. Visible hematuria is when urine appears red or brown and can be seen with the naked eye. Other symptoms are not specific. Other inflammatory conditions that affect the bladder and kidney can create similar symptoms. Early detection facilitates curing the disease. Other symptoms can involve: *pain or burning on urination *the sensation of not being able to completely empty the bladder *the sensation of needing to urinate more often or more frequently than normal These symptoms are general and also indicate less serious problems.  Prognosis and treatment  Prognosis is highly variable and dependent upon a multitude of factors. Reoccurrence does occur. Treatment is determined on a case-by-case basis.

Work began on a completely new racing car that would be built using modern composites, be more rigid than any previous TVR and be CAD designed to reach speeds in excess of and be stable. The car itself would be a steel tubular frame with full roll cage forming the backbone to a full carbon fibre monocoque. By 2000 work was well under way on the carbon fibre, TuscanR GT car. History Typical of TVR there was to be a change of name during the early stages of the production run. Originally it began life as the TuscanR (A natural follow on from the infamous Tuscan Racers (TVR Tuscan Challenge) that the cars were to replace) but as TVR launched the T350 road car it was deemed that the racers should be referred going forward as T400R. At this same time a few cosmetic changes were made to the shell, most notably the design of the rear light cluster changed from a single top corner unit per side to a set of smaller, individual, circular lights down each side. Between 2000 and 2004 TVR built a total of 7 race cars. The first three race cars were of the TuscanR design but the last 4, (the 2 DeWalt cars delivered in 2003 and the 2 RSR cars in 2004) were T400R body shape (The difference being the rear light housings mainly). Earlier racers in some situations have the later rear, probably due to work after 'racing incidents'. Racing commenced in 2001 with the final T400Rs racing in the 2006 Le Mans Series season. The Race Cars The success of the Tuscan Racer series through the 90s had been highly beneficial to the company and their first attempt to build a GT1 class car and associated road cars, the Speed 12 project and the Cerbera Speed 12 project had introduced TVR to some modern composites and techniques but Wheeler had been experimenting with Kevlar and carbon fibre since the SEAC models of the late 1980s. The GT1 projects themselves did not succeed and in traditional TVR style, Wheeler announced that the 800BHP+ road cars would be too dangerous for normal customers. At the time this car was, on paper, the fastest production car in the world. All this work lead to the creation of the TuscanR, nee T400R, racing project. Between 2000 and 2004 TVR built 7 racing chassis that were campaigned right up until 2006 with great success considering the competition.http://www.thehedgegroup.co.uk/default.asp?id=63http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/cars/tvrt400.htm Most importantly, chassis' 1, 4 & 5 raced at Le Mans.

The Oakeley Arms Hotel is a Grade II listed hotel near Maentwrog in North Wales. The original building dates back to the 17th century, and was once part of the nearby Tan-y-Bwlch Estate. Although its principal use has been as an inn, historically it has also been used as a post office, makeshift court house, polling station and police station. History The Oakeley Arms Hotel was originally known as the Tan y Bwlch Inn, because it belonged to the nearby Tan y Bwlch Estate. Some local records claim that the hotel was built on the original site of the estate‚Äôs manor house (now located ¬º mile west and called Plas Tan-y-Bwlch). The inn was first built in the 1600s but was extended during the 1700s when it was owned by a local drover. In his 1778 book A Tour in Wales, it was described by writer and traveller Thomas Pennant as ‚Äúa very neat small inn, for the reception of travellers who ought to think themselves much indebted to a nobleman, for the great improvement it received from his munificence ‚Äù.A Tour in Wales, Thomas Pennant. 1778. Pub H.D Symonds Sometime during the early 1840s the inn was renamed as the Oakeley Arms, in honour of the family who owned the Tan-y-Bwlch estate. The Oakeley family were one of the richest families in the area, their wealth having come from the slate mines of nearby Blaenau Ffestiniog. In 1910 the Oakeley Arms Hotel was auctioned off from the estate and was bought privately. It was given a Grade II listing in 1954 because of its historical importance ‚Äúas a fine example of an estate-built inn (one of several associated with the major estates of north Wales) and strong architectural character consistent with this patronage, not least in the quality of the masonry‚Äù. In the nineteenth century, the Oakeley Arms was given its own crest. It means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cautious but I do not fear‚Äù. In 1940 the hotel was host to the Cottesmore School from Hove Sussex, evacuated from the south coast of England. The school later moved to a former workhouse in Cors-y-Gedol Hall, near Barmouth, until the end of the war. Today, the hotel is privately owned and has recently undergone a programme of intense renovation and refurbishment.

Usage and detection Scheme of VoIP call with SIM box and gateway The SIM box operator can route international calls through the VoIP connection and connect the call as local traffic, allowing the box's operator to bypass international rates and often undercut prices charged by local mobile network operators. This business model of operation is very common around the world and is usually legal, as it simply uses the internet to piggyback calls to a local area and using a private exchange to route the call back to the mobile network. However, many companies, such as Verizon, provide strong lobbying forces to local governments to ban the use of SIM pools. Another reason is the lack of control of the users, i.e. Knowing who called whom? Creating a serious privacy challenge to the users, where (local) governments want to know who made certain calls to whom and from where. One such example is the country of Ghana, where government has banned the use of SIM boxes.

Wrong knowledge is viparyaya; it is not supported by anything e.g. a mirage. Viparyaya is a thought pattern or modification of the mind; it is not a fantasy which is the creation of a crazy mind. Human thinking is largely based on viparyaya-vritti responsible for much of the misery in human life. Patanjali states:- : ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§•‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§§‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§Æ‡•ç  : \\"Viparyaya or Illusion is false knowledge formed of a thing as other than what it is.\\" - Yoga Sutras (I.8) Simply said this means ‚Äì \\"Viparyaya is knowing a thing different from what it really is\\" or viparyaya is incorrect cognition or wrong knowledge. Wrong knowledge causes five kle≈õas ‚Äì nescience, egoism, attachment, hate and fear of death, which kle≈õas are the impurities of the mind. \\"I-sense\\", which is unreal knowledge, is viparyaya which is rooted in avidya as are pramana (valid knowledge) and vikalpa (verbal construction). Patanjali defines avidya as the misidentification of the impermanent as permanent, impure as the pure. Vyasa states that erroneous cognition (viparyaya) is the cause of rebirth, when it has vanished no one is ever seen to be born anywhere; which means that our wrong identity with the body, sense-organs and the mind \\"rooted in spiritual ignorance functions through viparyaya\\". Yoga, the technique of controlling the body and the mind or Samadhi concentration, aims at controlling Viparyaya which is one of the five active and changeable citta-vrittis (modifications of the mind). Viparyaya can be replaced or corrected by valid cognition. ≈öobhƒÅkaramitra includes viparyaya as a type of figure in poetry which in combination with upameyopamƒÅ can occur when there is vƒÅkyabheda but he does not agree with Ruyyaka and rejects the idea that viparyaya can combine with upamƒÅna when vyatireka occurs. He explains that in viparyaya there is the mutual exchange of the qualified (dharmin) and the qualification (dharma) which holds true even when these roles are reversed, thus giving two varieties. Shankara states:- : ‡§∏‡§¶‡§æ ‡§§‡•ç‡§§ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ã‡§Ω‡§π‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞‡§æ‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§É  : ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§§‡§•‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§™‡§ø ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•á‡§£‡§æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§æ  : \\"And I am always the same to all beings, the Lord, for I am superior to, and higher than, the perishable and the imperishable. Though I have the highest Atman as my true nature and am non- dual, I am nevertheless covered with wrong knowledge which is nescience. \\" - Upade≈õasƒÅhasri (I.x.8) Here, Viparyaya is not synonymous with avidya but an aspect of avidya.

It tells of a young French man who falls for a fisherman's granddaughter ‚Äì the eponymous Graziella ‚Äì during a trip to Naples, Italy; they are separated when he must return to France, and she soon dies. Based on the author's experiences with a tobacco-leaf folder while in Naples in the early 1810s, Graziella was first written as a journal and intended to serve as commentary for Lamartine's poem \\"Le Premier Regret\\". First serialised as part of Les Confidences beginning in 1849, Graziella received popular acclaim. An operatic adaptation had been completed by the end of the year, and the work influenced paintings, poems, novels, and films. The American literary critic Charles Henry Conrad Wright considered it one of the three most important emotionalist French novels, the others being Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's novel Paul et Virginie (1788) and Chateaubriand's novella Atala (1801). Three English translations have been published: one by James Runnion in 1875, one by Ralph Wright in 1929, and one by Raymond N. MacKenzie in 2018Graziella -- University of Minnesota Press. Plot The eighteen-year-old narrator travels from his home in M√¢con, Burgundy, to Italy, staying first in Rome, then Naples. There he meets a young man named Aymon de Virieu, and the two decide to apprentice themselves to Andrea, a local fisherman. Although the first few months pass in contemplative tranquility and beauty, they are forced to take refuge at Andrea's home on Procida during a surging September storm, where they spend the night. Here the narrator first meets the fisherman's granddaughter, Graziella. The following morning, the narrator overhears Andrea's wife, criticising him for taking on the two \\"pagan\\" Frenchmen. However, Graziella comes to their defense, silencing her grandmother by pointing out the two young men's compassion and religious acts. The family and their apprentices go to recover the remnants of the destroyed boat. Soon afterwards, the narrator and Virieu go to the village, where they purchase a new boat and fishing supplies for the fisherman. When they return, Andrea and his family are sleeping, but are soon awoken and brought to the beach, joyously accepting the new vessel. Over the next several days, the narrator and Virieu enjoy an idyllic life, reading, walking, and enjoying the beauty, music, and dance of Procida. Graziella expresses interest in their reading, and thus the men read works by Ugo Foscolo and Tacitus to her and her family. Though these fall flat, all are interested in Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's romantic novel Paul et Virginie. Such is Graziella's fascination with the tale that she abandons all reserve and sits near the narrator, her breath on his hand, and her hair brushing his forehead. When it is over, she begs the narrator to reread the tale. The poor weather breaks on the ninth day, and Andrea takes the young men and his family to Naples. Virieu is recalled to France, and the narrator falls ill from sorrow over his friend's departure. He sends for Andrea, and Graziella rushes to his lodging, where she treats him. Their conversation, and Graziella's care, revives the narrator's spirits. Reinvigorated, the next day, he goes to Andrea's Neapolitan lodgings in Mergellina. Since coming to the city, he learns of their fortunes: Andrea and his wife are enjoying bountiful catches, while Graziella has taken up coral carving to earn extra money. When the narrator appears unhappy to leave, they ask him to lodge with them. Months pass, and the narrator considers Andrea's family to be his own. The narrator attempts to treat Graziella as a sister. He accompanies her to church and teaches her to read and write, and she insists that he spend more time with her, talking and learning to carve coral than futilely writing poetry. However, he realizes the extent of his affection for her when, days before Christmas, Graziella is arranged to be married to her cousin Cecco: \\"My life without her presence was nothing\\". The imminent loss of Graziella drives the narrator to abandon Naples and wander the surrounding area, returning only after the new year. Though Graziella accepts the proposed marriage on the day the narrator returns, she later escapes into the night, intent on joining a convent. The following day the family search for her in vain. Eventually, the narrator realizes that she must have returned to Procida and hurries there. In Andrea's home, he finds Graziella, who confesses her love for him, stating, \\"They wished me to take a husband‚Äîyou are already the husband of my soul\\". The narrator replies in kind, and they spend the night together, discussing their romance. When Graziella's family comes to get her, they decide that she need not marry Cecco. For three months, they enjoy their love, unknown to Graziella's family. However, she is pained at the thought of the narrator returning to France and by her social station, much beneath the narrator's own. When the narrator is recalled to France, Graziella collapses on the doorstep, and the narrator ‚Äì though downhearted ‚Äì cannot stay. Although they continue to exchange letters, once in French society, the narrator feels ashamed of his love for the poor fisherman's granddaughter. He only realizes his folly after learning of Graziella's death at age sixteen. The novel closes with a poem, \\"Le Premier Regret\\" (\\"The First Regret\\"), dedicated to her memory. Writing and publication Alphonse de Lamartine, the author, by Henri Decaisne Graziella was written by Alphonse de Lamartine, a French poet and novelist. As a young man, in 1812 Lamartine had visited Italy, travelling from his home near M√¢con to an abbey in Cluny, then onwards to Naples and Rome. During his time in Naples, Lamartine stayed with Darest de la Chavanne, who owned a cigar factory. There, he met a young woman from Procida, a tobacco-leaf folder with whom he began a relationship, and with whom he may have been intimate. The young woman died after Lamartine's return to France; the writer Agide Pirazzini suggests that he truly loved her only after her death and that thenceforth her image never left him. His experiences with the young tobacco-leaf folder were a potent inspiration for Lamartine; Pirazzini suggests that several works, including \\"Le Pass√©\\" ('The Past') and \\"L'Hymne au soleil\\" ('Hymn to the Sun'), were written in her memory. Lamartine's experiences also formed the basis of his poem \\"Le Premier Regret\\", a mournful elegy focusing on an overgrown tomb of an unnamed yet still beloved Italian woman. First published in his Harmonies po√©tiques et religieuses (1830), it was later included in the novel Graziella. Lamartine later wrote a journal describing his experiences in Italy, completing the tale in 1843, and was considering telling the tale of Graziella as commentary to \\"Le Premier Regret\\". In the early 1840s, Lamartine's friend Eug√®ne Pelletan visited the author in Ischia and was read several pages of the journal. Touched by the story, when Pelletan returned to Paris, he recommended that a French company publish the recollections, which he was certain would find popularity. The publisher agreed, and although the financially troubled author at first refused, when faced with selling his family home Lamartine agreed to publish. Les Confidences, based on Lamartine's journal, was serialized beginning on 2 January 1849 in La Presse. The girl with whom Lamartine was smitten in Italy was presented through the character of Graziella. The author depicted as working in coral, hoping to \\"avoid the degrading association which an open avowal of her employment [as a tobacco-leaf folder] would suggest\\". He would, however, later regret this change. Graziella's story in Les Confidences, which consisted of half its length, was collected and published in a separate edition beginning in 1852. The novel was a popular hit upon its release. By 1853 a Spanish-language edition was being advertised; several other translations in that language were published before 1919. By 1875 James Runnion had translated it into English; this translation was published by the Chicago-based A. C. McClurg and Company under the title Graziella: A Story of Italian Love. Another edition, titled simply Graziella, was translated by Ralph Wright and published by Nonesuch Press of London in 1929. This version included 30 illustrations. Analysis In 1871, a writer in the Westminster Review described the change from the tobacco-leaf folder to coral carver as the \\"sole deviation from fact\\" in Graziella. Four years later, Runnion described the novel as \\"a leaf torn from [the author's] personal memoires\\". Pirazzini, writing in 1917, noted inaccuracies, such as Lamartine's age during the trip to Italy (eighteen in the novel, early twenties in reality), but considered them of little relevance, as his memories were \\"surrounded with light and poetry\\". Since then, Henri Guillemin of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica finds Les Confidences to mix reality and imagination, and the writer Terence Cave has described the work as only \\"remotely autobiographical\\". The beauty of Southern Italy was often shown in Lamartine's works, such as in Graziella. Pirazzini describes Lamartine's descriptions as \\"splendid ... like a hymn, though the form is prose\\". The writer Nathalie L√©ger finds a \\"homological relationship\\" between Graziella and Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie (1788). She suggests that the texts both resolve around tensions of island paradises and societal hell as well as a \\"professed pure, brotherly love\\", ending with the death of a character. She notes describes Paul et Virginie as appearing en abyme within Lamartine's novel, as it is Saint-Pierre's romance which, \\"awakens Graziella's passion\\". Reception The title character, as depicted by Jules Joseph Lefebvre (1878) =Critical= The American literary critic Charles Henry Conrad Wright, writing in 1912, considered Graziella the best of the episodes presented in Les Confidences. He thought it one of three novels that must be read to understand the development of emotionalism in French literature, together with Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie and Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand's novella Atala (1801). =Cultural= Graziella quickly became a part of the French popular culture. On 20 January 1849, librettists Jules Barbier and Michel Carr√© debuted their one-act adaptation of the story at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase in Paris. A reference to the ill-fated Graziella can be found in Jules-Romain Tardieu's 1857 novel Mignon, l√©gende, which features a sculptor's daughter named Graziella. The novel states that her father, Marx, took \\"his cue from one of Lamartine's most poetic stories\\" in naming her. The French poet Tristan Corbi√®re, having met a man who claimed to be the son of Lamartine and Graziella while in Italy in 1869, wrote a poem titled \\"Le fils de Lamartine et Graziella\\" ('The Son of Lamartine and Graziella'). The poem, published in Corbi√®re's 1873 collection Les amours jaunes, has been interpreted by Andr√© Le Milinaire as condemning the falsity of family life. Graziella title character was depicted by the French artist Jules Joseph Lefebvre in an 1878 oil painting on canvas. Commissioned by the art collector Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the work depicts Graziella sitting on a rock, fishing net in hand, gazing over her shoulders at a smoking Mount Vesuvius. The painting is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York. Another painting, Graziella di Lamartine, was completed by Neapolitan artist Ferdinando Ruggieri and a sculpture by Cesare Aureli, depicting a scene where Graziella cuts her hair as a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary is also recorded. Graziella has been thrice adapted to film. The first production, in 1917, was directed by Mario Gargiulo. The second, in 1926, was made by Marcel Vandal. The third was completed in 1954 by Giorgio Bianchi. This last production, which starred Maria Fiore in the title role and Jean-Pierre Mocky as the Frenchman Alphonse, was distributed by CEI Incom.

Together with St. Paul's Church in Burlington and St Mary's Church in West Burlington it forms Divine Mercy parish, which is a part of the Diocese of Davenport. The parish maintains the former parish church buildings as worship sites. St. John's was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History St. John the Baptist parish was started in 1852 to serve the town's growing German community. Father Reffe, who had previously been at St Paul's, was assigned as St. John's first pastor. A church was finished by 1856 when there were forty to fifty families in the parish. They were part of the large number of German immigrants who settled in Burlington in the 1840s and 1850s. A school building was completed the following year and the School Sisters of Notre Dame served as teachers. St. John's Academy was completed in 1875. By 1879 the parish had grown to 200 families, and by 1888 it had 2,000 individual members. Its growth reflected that by the 1880s, 60% of Burlington's population were ethnic Germans. with In 1876 Bishop John Hennessey of Dubuque gave the pastoral care of the parish to the Jesuits. They were later followed by Benedictines from St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, Kansas. Priests from the Davenport Diocese, which the parish became a part of in 1881, started serving the parish in 1990. The first merger of the Catholic Community in Burlington happened in the parochial schools. Both St. John's and St. Paul's operated parish-based high schools. Those separate operations merged in 1958 with the opening of Notre Dame High School on the city's west side. The two parishes continued to operate their own grade schools until the late 1970s when they were consolidated. St. Paul's School was the site for kindergarten through 4th Grade and St. John's housed grades five through eight. The school at Burlington's third parish, St. Patrick's, and the school at St. Mary's in West Burlington had both closed in 1969. In the 1990s a fund drive was held and a new grade school wing was added at Notre Dame. St. John's School was torn down to make room for more parking. The number of clergy in the Davenport Diocese has declined steadily since the 1960s. Demographics and religious practice in the Burlington Community also changed. Bishop Gerald O‚ÄôKeefe announced a plan in 1991 to consolidate parishes throughout the diocese, and the parishes in Burlington were part of that plan. In 1998 St. John's and St. Paul's were consolidated under the leadership of the Rev. John Hyland, who had been the pastor of both parishes. The new parish name was a combination of the two parishes: Saints John and Paul. St. Patrick's and St. Mary's consolidated at the same time to form their own parish. In 2017 Saints John and Paul parish and St. Mary and St. Patrick parish merged to form Divine Mercy parish. Architecture The current St. John's Church was built between 1883 and 1885. It was designed by Chicago architect Johann Dillenburg in the Gothic Revival style. The structure is built on a high basement of rough-hewn stone and the exterior walls are composed of brick. The gable roof is covered with slate. The church measures . The exterior features a tall central tower with two smaller towers flanking it on either side of the facade. The tallest tower rises . Lights were put on the church's tower in 2010. There are three entrances across the front of the building. Above each of the entrances is a lancet window. The side elevation of the church is seven bays wide. Each bay is divided by a three-stepped wall buttress. There is a paired lancet window in each bay that is set within an indented rectangular panel. Across the top of each panel is a course of dentils. A rounded apse dominates the rear of the church. The church was built at the top of a high bluff south of the downtown area, which gives the structure prominence. The interior is divided into three naves, which are divided by pillars. A tall wooden high altar fills the apse of the church. It was installed in 1893. A Eucharistic Chapel was constructed in the left side sacristy in the 1990s. An arched doorway was cut into the sanctuary wall leading to the chapel and allowing it to be visible from the main body of the church. All of the windows are filled with stained glass.

The exterior has a sober classical facade, while the interior has rich Baroque decorations. The church is dedicated to the Bishop and martyr St Vigilius; it now serves as the chapel for the University of Siena. It stands across the street from the Castellare Ugurgieri, and down the street from the Palazzo Bandini Piccolomini found on the junction with Via Sallustio Bandini. San Vigilio History The building was initially a parish church built by the Ugurgieri family. The structure was occupied by the 11th century with monks of the Camaldolese order, who had a convent adjacent to the church. That building burned in a fire in 1153, and was reconstructed by 1231. In 1420, the monks were expelled. In 1556, the church was ceded to the Jesuit order. They rebuilt the church in 1561, which they continued to refurbish until 1775. When the Jesuits were suppressed in 1759, the church was acquired by the Vallombrosan order, who had the facade rebuilt in the present brick form by the architect Antonio Matteucci. In turn when the Vallombrosan order was suppressed, in 1816, the Grand Duke of Tuscany gifted the church to the University of Siena. The interior is decorated with 15 canvases by Raffaello Vanni depicting The Last Judgement. The third chapel on the left has busts depicting Pietro De Vecchi and his wife Giulia Verdelli by Giuseppe Mazzuoli. The bronze crucifix is attributed to Pietro Tacca. The chapel also has a sepulchral monument to Antonio Rospigliosi, nephew of Pope Clement IX; the monument was sculpted by Giovanni Antonio Mazzuoli. The chapel of St Francis Borgia was painted by Dionisio Montorselli. In the chapel of St Anne a canvas was painted by Romanelli. In the chapel of the Taja family, bronze figures of St Ignatius, St Bernardino, and the Blessed Giovanni Colombino were completed by the studio of Gianlorenzo Bernini. The works were commissioned by Cardinal Flaminio Taja. The chapel of St Francis Xavier has canvases by Francesco Vanni, and Baldassare Franceschini. The chapel of the Madonna di Loreto is decorated with canvases by Francesco Vanni, depicting the Assumption of the Virgin and Translation of the House.Guida di Siena e dei suoi dintorni, Enrico Torrini, editor (1907) pages 103-104.

Prior to joining the Mint, Clark worked in commercial packaging design. In 2015 it was announced that Clark's anonymous submission to a design competition had been chosen to become the fifth definitive coin portrait of Elizabeth II to feature on British coins. Clark is the first employee of the Royal Mint in over one hundred years to have designed such a portrait of the monarch. At the age of 33 when his design was chosen, Clark was younger than any of the other four designers to have created portraits of Elizabeth II for British coinage at the time their design was chosen. Uniquely, Clark's portrait of the Queen was created using computer-aided design software to turn his initial sketches into the required low-relief model, with no manual sculpting being used. Production of coins bearing Clark's design began on 2 March 2015, and they appeared in circulation later in 2015. Personal life Clark is originally from the Lake District in Cumbria.

Made from natural materials such as recycled fur, soil, textiles, glass and marble, her sculptures and installations show an interest in mythology, anthropology and psychology, especially the Uncanny. Education and career Adeline de Monseignat obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Language and Culture from University College London in 2009, with an Erasmus year in 2007 spent studying Architecture and Design at Politecnico di Milano. She then completed her Fine Art Foundation Course at the Slade School of Fine Art in 2010 before graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree, with distinction, from the City and Guilds of London Art School in 2011. As a result of her degree show, curator Justin Hammond selected her to feature in the Catlin Guide, a book that features forty new promising graduate artists in the United Kingdom. She was thereafter shortlisted for the Catlin Art Prize, alongside nine other fellow artists including Julia Vogl, Jonny Briggs and Gabriella Boyd. She was awarded the Catlin Art Prize Public Vote Prize in 2012. That same year she was shortlisted for the Threadneedle Prize at the Mall Galleries and was the recipient of the Royal Society of Sculptors Bursary Award in 2013.Barton, Laura (18 January 2013). \\"Homes: Sculpture Club\\". The Guardian. In 2013, curator James Putnam brought Monseignat and artist Berndnaut Smilde together for her first show at Ronchini Gallery,The Uncanny. In 2014, Ronchini Gallery held a solo exhibition of the artist's work entitled Home. Art historian Jo Applin wrote a text for a catalogue which was published to accompany the exhibition. She was interviewed by the BBC World Service that year about her use of recycled fur in her work, which aired on The Forum and later on BBC Radio 4. In 2015, Monseignat did a mentorship with sculptor Gianpietro Carlesso who taught her stone carving. It is since then and since starting to spend time in Mexico in 2017 that she has made marble an integral part of her practice. Her 2018 solo show entitled O held at Ronchini Gallery features sculptural works as well as her film In The Flesh which she shot in 2016 in the marble quarries of Carrara. That year also marked the first time Monseignat ever shows work in Mexico, in a gallery called Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano which held the 1940 International Surrealist Exhibition curated by Andr√© Breton. The exhibition entitled Synergia, with regrouped works by Pablo de Laborde Lascaris, Samuel Zealey, James Capper, Luke Hart, Manuel Munoz G.G. and Amy Stephens attracted such attention that it was taken on the following year by Latin America's only museum dedicated to sculpture, Museo Federico Silva in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. In 2020, she showed extensively in Mexico, notably at Salon Acme, Zona Maco, Museo de Geologia UNAM, Studio Block M74 and Masa Galeria alongside artists such as Jose Davila, Perla Krauze, Gabriel Rico and Tezontle.

It was released on 26 February 1990 by 4AD. Produced by Cocteau Twins guitarist Robin Guthrie, Mad Love was composed of four tracks‚Äîincluding a rerecording of \\"Thoughtforms\\", a song from Lush's debut mini-album Scar (1989). In contrast to Scar, Mad Love features more polished production techniques and expansive music styles, including elements of jangle pop, post- punk and shoegazing. It was well received in the United Kingdom and the United States, with Mad Love being the band's first release to place in the mainstream UK Singles Chart and its opening track \\"De-Luxe\\" in the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. A minor success, it topped the UK Independent Singles Chart upon release. Background and recording Lush released their debut mini-album Scar in October 1989 to warm reviews. Scar was originally to be produced by Guthrie, but several scheduling difficulties occurred‚Äîincluding the sessions for the Cocteau Twins' album Heaven or Las Vegas and the birth of Guthrie's daughter‚Äîwhich led to the band choosing a different producer. In December 1989, Lush recorded Mad Love during sessions at Guthrie's own studio, September Sound, in southwest London and further sessions at the Church, a mid-range studio in north London. Vocalist-guitarist Miki Berenyi considered Guthrie's production on Mad Love \\"quite different\\" to John Fryers techniques on Scar, describing Guthrie's as \\"more commercial; it's not nearly as raw or rough\\". She said that the sound of Mad Love was more akin to how the band sounded live, with more emphasis on guitars but \\"not nearly as delicate\\", as the band had a reputation in the British music press for poor performances in their early career. Lyrics and music Mad Loves title is a rough translation of L'amour fou, a story by French writer Andr√© Breton (pictured in 1923) Mad Love features Lush's \\"trademark 4AD ethereal\\" sound, which was described by Melody Maker as \\"succulent, individual melodies\\" and \\"romantic student ditties\\" which were sung in \\"gossamer voices\\". In addition, the EP features heavily treated layers of texturised guitars, processed with various effects units. The overall sound of Mad Love drew comparisons to the jangle pop stylings of REM and indie pop band Marine Girls, but several critics noted that Lush's post-punk roots were still present on the EP, partially due to several songs' shifting time signatures. Several elements of dream pop are also discernible on Mad Love, such as vocal tracks deliberately placed low in the mix and indecipherable lyrics, which Berenyi said \\"exist in a vacuum\\" to avoid misinterpretation. \\"De-Luxe\\", in particular, has been noted for its \\"complex, folky harmonies\\". Title and packaging Mad Loves title is a rough translation of L'amour fou, the title of a 1937 photographic novel by French surrealist writer Andr√© Breton. Guitarist Emma Anderson suggested the idea for the title to Berenyi after the latter received a telephone call from 4AD co-founder Ivo Watts-Russell requesting a title for the record in less than an hour. Bassist Steve Rippon considered it a \\"heavy metal title ‚Ä¶ like Led Zeppelin\\", while Berenyi said it was reminiscent of the 1987 film Crazy Love. Mad Loves packaging was designed by Vaughan Oliver, with assistance from Chris Bigg, and features photography by Jim Friedman. All three had been involved in creation of the album sleeve for Lush's previous release, Scar. The run-out matrix codes on the groove of the 12-inch record pressing of Mad Love displayed two obscure messages: \\"Hey Hey Havanna\\" on side 1 and \\"What are you like?\\" on side 2. Similar messages were hidden on the LP pressing of Scar. Release and reception Lush (from left to right: Emma Anderson, Chris Acland, Miki Berenyi and Steve Rippon) performing in Rennes, France in April 1990 during the band's first-ever European dates Mad Love was released on 26 February 1990 by 4AD in the United Kingdom. It was issued as a 12\\", CD and cassette; it was later made available as a digital download. Upon its release, Mad Love entered the mainstream UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 55 in its first week, and reached the No. 1 position on the Independent Singles Chart. In the United States, \\"De-Luxe\\" was released as a promotional-only radio single on Reprise Records, and the song peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Two separate music videos were created for the song: \\"the 4AD version\\" in March 1990, and a version directed by Howard Greenhalgh in February 1991. A national tour in support of Mad Love began in March 1990, which was documented as part of Lush's debut British television appearance on Snub TV, and Lush performed their first-ever shows in Europe during a spring tour with Pale Saints. The band also recorded a radio session for John Peel, which was broadcast on BBC Radio around the time of Mad Loves release. Reviews of Mad Love ranged from mixed to positive. In Alternative Press Rachel Felder wrote how she \\"somehow expected more ‚Ä¶ than its fine (as in fine but no cigar) tracks deliver\\", but surmised that the EP was \\"a marvelous combination of simple pop and critically correct noises\\". NME referred to Mad Love as \\"at the mid-point of between the sombre gravity of rock and giddy levity of pop\\", while Melody Makers Steve Sutherland referred to it as a \\"beautiful, primitive record\\" in the same vein as the Cocteau Twins' Head over Heels (1983). A remastered version of \\"De-Luxe\\" was included on Ciao! Best of Lush, a compilation album released in March 2001. The song was also featured as a playable track in two titles of the Rock Band video game series: Rock Band 2 and Unplugged.

Document at Harvard Law (accessed 24.02.2015) is a decision by the U.S. district court for the District of Colorado from May 1, 1996. It is to be considered a landmark decisionSee Fred Chris Smith & Erin E. Kenneally in John J. Barbara (Ed.) Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence (2008 Humana Press) p 105) in terms of expert witness court testimony in questions of electronic evidenceIn most cases dealing with computer evidence, the term \\"electronic\\" may be more suitable than \\"digital\\". Although both are often used synonymously, their semantic content is different (for further details see Burkhard Sch√§fer & Stephen Mason in Stephen Mason et al. (eds.) The Characteristics of Electronic Evidence (Butterworth 2010), pp. 21‚Äì50). and digital forensics. In a nutshell, the decision states that the authenticityThis is just one of several criteria for evidence to be recognized as admissible in a legal proceeding. Namely the hearsay-rule often excludes even authentic electronic evidence's admissibility in trial. For further prerequisites particularly concerning electronic evidence see Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 554 (D. Md. 2007) and Jonathan D. Frieden & Leigh M. Murray \\"The admissibility of electronic evidence under the federal rules of evidence\\" (2011) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 2, 1 - 39 of electronic evidence is accepted by courts only if the party adducing the evidence complied with the newest technical standards of electronic evidence acquisition.Acquisition is the process of actually collecting electronic data. For example, seizing a computer at a crime scene or taking custody of a computer in a civil suit is a part of the acquisition process as well as the copying of a computer's hard drive (see Larry E. Daniel & Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell & Spielmann (eds.) Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals (2012 Elsevier) p 12) Moreover, U.S. magistrate judge Schlatter commented on the factors he considered relevant in the process of weighing the qualifications of digital forensics experts when those present contrary opinions or conclusions to the court. Hence, Gates v Bando has set legal standards for examining electronic evidence that have remained relevant to this day.Fred Chris Smith & Rebecca Gurley Bace A Guide to Forensic Testimony: The Art and Practice of Presenting Testimony as an Expert Technical Witness (2002 Addison- Wesley Professional) p 262; in the similar case of Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v Metro Mark Products, Ltd. 43 F. Supp.2d 951 (N.D. Ill. 1999), both opposing digital forensics experts applied the best practice methods as describes in Gates v Bando.  The facts of the case  Gates Rubber Company and Bando Chemical Industries were both involved in the manufacture of industrial belts as direct competitors. Several defendants aside from Bando were former employees of Gates, who had signed written non-competition agreements before they left the company. In 1989, Gates learned that the latter used a computer program highly similar to one of its own, so that Gates suspected its former employees had stolen, copied and used it for Bando. Accordingly, Gates filed several actions on the grounds of unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, infringement of copyright, and breach of contract.The facts have been shortened and summarized to a large extent in terms of the aspects relevant for the fields of electronic evidence and expert testimony. During the court proceedings, in 1992 Gates learned that N., one of its former employees, deleted a computer program from his computer at Bando, which Gates claimed to be an unauthorized copy of a copyright-protected software of his own. Furthermore, (and actually decisive as regards the influence of digital forensics in trial), N. also \\"deleted\\" several word-processing files on the same computer, testifying that he did not erase any materials relevant to the pending litigation. Consequently, Gates applied for disclosure, in order to examine whether or not the defendant had maliciously deleted files in an attempt to destroy evidence. The court granted Gates a court order that allowed Gates to copy the hard drive of Newman's computer in order to obtain as much information as possible from the \\"deleted\\", but reconstructible files. Gates then assigned the technician V. to execute the copying of the hard drive, whereas he subsequently also appeared as Gate's expert witness in the court procedure. In retrospect, the technical method V. applied to create a copy of the hard drive of N.'s computer as well as his formal professional qualification as a digital forensics expert (particularly in comparison to the expert witness summoned by the defendant) turned out to be the crucial aspects that were decisive for the outcome of Gates claims arising from Bando's alleged violation of disclosure obligations through spoliation.  Acquisition of electronic evidence  In the course of his examination, V. copied a software onto the hard drive of N.'s computer (which contained the evidentiary electronic files), in order to create a file-by-file copy of the hard drive. This conduct induced the court to extensively comment on the forensic methods that must be applied to electronic evidence to allow it to be used as a piece of evidence in court procedure: First, the court stated that - as a general rule - any digital forensic examiner shall be obliged to \\"utilize the method which would yield the most complete and accurate results\\"Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al. 167 F.R.D. 90 (D.C. Col. 1996) p 17 in order to comply with the legal prerequisites in regard to the admissibility of evidence in court procedure. As a result, several organizations started to continuously publish best practice literature for electronic evidence acquisition.See e.g. for public authorities in the U.S: John Ashcroft, Deborah J. Daniels & Sarah V. Hart Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement (2004 U.S. Department of Justice) accessed 26.02.2015; Paul Henry \\"Best practises in digital evidence collection\\" (September 12, 2009) accessed 26.02.2015; Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence SWGE Best Practises for Computer Forensics (SWGE 2014) accessed 26.02.2015; for crime investigators in the UK see: ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence (ACPO 2012) accessed 26.02.2015 However, it should be kept in mind that such a best practise prerequisite must be considered a dynamic procedural hurdle, as the technical requirements and possibilities in analyzing and copying digital data change with the underlying hard- and software, and consequently the technical procedures to be applied in order to create a legally permissible piece of electronic evidence may change in the future. Second, the judge held that the file-by-file copying procedure applied by Gates' forensic examiner fails to fulfil the court's \\"best practice\\" requirement. Instead, it had been necessary for a forensic investigation de lege artis to copy the hard drive by means of creating an image (or: mirror) copy: \\"Gates retained V. as its technician to do the copying, and he attempted to do this through the use of a program called Norton's Unerase. Proper use of the program could yield information, or partial pictures, about files which were once present on the computer's hard drive, but were deleted. Gates argued that V. did an adequate job of copying the Denver computer. W. (the defendant's expert witness, remark of author) persuaded me, however, that V. lost, or failed to capture, important information because of an inadequate effort. In using Norton's Unerase, V. unnecessarily copied this program onto the Denver computer first, and thereby overwrote 7 to 8 percent of the hard drive before commencing his efforts to copy the contents... Additionally, V. did not obtain the creation dates of certain of the files which overwrote deleted files. This information would have assisted in determining the deletion date of some files. W. pointed out that V. should have done an \\"image backup\\" of the hard drive, which would have collected every piece of information on the hard drive, whether the information was allocated as a file or not. Instead, V. did a \\"file by file\\" backup, which copies only existing, nondeleted files on the hard drive. The technology for an image backup was available at the time of these events, though rarely used by anyone... I find that the duty was on Gates, and not Bando, to utilize the best technology available.\\"Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al. 167 F.R.D. 90 (D.C. Col. 1996) p 16 f. The standards outlined above have become the general standards in computer forensic examination.Smith & Bace (n 4) p 7 According to these statements, electronic data, which is recovered from computer hard disk (or any other form of electronic storage unit for digital information) is permitted to be used in court procedures only, if the data is duplicated and verified in a forensically sound manner. The forensic examiner in Gates v Bando (V.) failed to create such a forensically sound duplication since the installation of the examiner's software could have overwritten existing files on the hard drive, this is the constitution of the evidence was altered even before the copy was made. Correct duplication, however, requires that any alteration of the data during the process of copying is reliably excluded. This requires that:see: Johnette Hassell & Susan Steen \\"Preserving and protecting computer evidence\\" (2005) Evidence Technology Magazine (accessed 25.02.2015) # The image is an exact, bit-by-bit duplicate of the original computer drive, # The image is taken in such a way as to guarantee that the original was not changed, # The image is examined in such a way as to guarantee that the image is not changed. In practise, proper duplication is usually warranted by write-blocking of the original storage device.see Larry E. Daniel & Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell & Spielmann (eds.) Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals (2012 Elsevier) p 29 (with further explanation) Correct verification means that the electronic evidence presented to the court must be provably identical to the one originally investigated, which usually is warranted by means of a hash value, an algorithm that calculated a number based on the content of the respective piece of electronic evidence.Larry E. Daniel & Lars E. Daniel in Maxwell & Spielmann (eds.) Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals (2012 Elsevier) p 30 In the present, compliance with this \\"best practise\\" requirement can usually be achieved by using a proprietary software for imaging, as this will admittedly preserve the evidential value of the electronic information recovered.James Tetteh Ami-Narh & Patricia A.H. Williams \\"Digital forensics and the legal system: a dilemma of our times\\" (2008) in Proceedings of the 6th Australian Digital Forensics Conference (Edith Cowan University 2008) p 5 (accessed 04.03.2015)  Assessment of evidential value in expert witness testimony of digital forensics experts  Expert qualifications are considered by both lawyers and experts to be very important, and in the case of Gates v Bando, the court reaffirms that widely accepted belief.Smith & Bace (n 4) Judge Schlatter stated in this context: \\"Bando's expert on matters associated with computer science was W., who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford. W.'s credentials, experience and knowledge were impressive, and I relied upon his opinions. Gates failed to obtain a similar expert in timely fashion. Gates did offer the testimony of V., the technician who was hired by Gates to copy the hard drive of the computer at Bando's Denver facility. His credentials, experience and knowledge were nowhere near those of W., and I placed much less weight on his testimony than on W.'s.\\"Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al. Loc cit p 15 The court strongly relied on the experts' formal professional qualification, as it was obviously the most distinguishable criterion in this case. However, most cases in litigation are not that unambiguous. Then, the factor of an expert's actual professional appearance - including but not limited to the ability to impart non-legal knowledge to the court, the thoroughness of the report and the traceability of the expert's inferences - will play a larger role. Additionally, a major practical issue for judges dealing with issues of electronic evidence remains in the lack of measurability of IT expertise, partly due to the absence of uniform formal professional qualificationMeanwhile, specific formal qualifications were introduced to certify a person's expertise in analyzing and creating reliable electronic evidence (e.g. the Certified Forensic Computer Examiner, the EnCase Certified Examiner, and the GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst). However, the variety of certificates available and the lack of their substantive conformity still make it hard for judges in practise to assess the actual expertise of a given expert witness as regards the broader field of IT in this field.For further details on this issue see: John J. Barbara in John J. Barbara (ed.) Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence (2008 Humana Press) p 25 ff.  Lessons for the future  The case of Gates v Bando surely highlights the necessity of selecting a given digital forensics expert carefully when it comes to civil litigation involving digital evidence issues, as such expert's opinion often turns out to be decisive for the outcome of a case. But the parties' due diligence in such cases even goes further: it is not only the selection of an expert witness in the litigation stage, but already in the pre-litigation phase attorneys and experts are obliged to ensure the correct acquisition of electronic evidence which is potentially relevant to their case. Moreover, they have to develop and apply an evidential reasoning that could both professionally withstand an opponent forensic expert's testimony and factually persuade the judge and/or the jury in the courtroom. Apart from that, the course of the court procedure has (relatively earlyFor an insight to the economically overwhelming significance of e-discovery in present litigation cases see: William P. Barnette \\"Ghost in the machine: zubulake revisited and other emerging e-discovery issues under the amended federal rules\\" (2012) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 3 1- 123) illustrated the potential economic impact of E-discovery issues on litigation: originally initiated as a secondary theatre of war in an IP litigation, these issues soon snowballed to a case of its own that finally achieved economically and temporally dimensions exceeding the original matter in dispute. Today, more than 90% of all corporate information is stored electronically.William P. Barnette \\"Ghost in the machine: zubulake revisited and other emerging e-discovery issues under the amended federal rules\\" (2012) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology Issue 3 Typically enough, digital forensics has become a big business with an estimated market value of 780 Mio. $ in 2011.John Salmons The Basics of Digital Forensics (Elsevier 2012) p 4 Generally speaking, the outcome of an increasing number of cases in all fields of law will depend on issues of digital evidence.See Paul W. Grimm \\"Authenticating digital evidence\\" (2014) 31 GP Solo Vol. 5 (accessed 26.02.2015) To the same extent which Gates v Bando illustrates the necessity for ligitation parties to carefully plan and execute a sophisticated strategy in terms of electronic evidence, however, it must be realized that it ultimately describes a recurrent practical problem: as IT and its relating tools and techniques will progress and the courts will (presumably) carry on to demand the application of the very best method available to warrant an electronic evidence's authentity, the absence of commonly court-accepted standards will emerge again and again. One potential solution for litigators to avoid the repeated occurrence of this issue might lie in entering into pre-trial agreements with their opponent, in which they agree upon certain conditions for the mutual recognition of their electronic documents' authenticity.See Zachary G.

On 18 July 1941, Fiegel was killed in action flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 during the Atlantic War in an attack on convoy OB 346. He targeted the 7,046-ton freighter Pilar de Larrinaga. However, the gunners shot his starboard wing off and he crashed into the sea, killing all on board. Early life and career Fliegel was born on 30 November 1907 in Wilmersdorf, a borough of Berlin, in the Kingdom of Prussia. He was the son of the son of geographer Gotthard Fliegel and his wife Anna Marie, n√©e Meyer. Fliegel, who had three sisters, won his first bicycle race in 1926. In 1929, he won the German amateur sprint championship at the velodrome in Stettin-Westend. That year, he also participated in the UCI Track Cycling World Championships held in Z√ºrich, Switzerland where he lost in the knockout stage to the Austrian August Schaffer.Illustrierter Radrenn-Sport, Berlin, 24 November 1929. p. 1323. Fliegel joined the military service in 1934 and transferred from the infantry of the Reichsheer (Army) to the newly emerging Luftwaffe (Air Force) of Nazi Germany a year later. Following his flight training, he served as flight instructor at the pilot schools A/B 42 in Salzwedel and A/B 113 in Br√ºnn. There he was promoted to Hauptmann (captain) on 1 March 1939. World War II World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces invaded Poland. Fliegel flew combat missions over Poland and received the Iron Cross 2nd Class () on 15 September 1939. In early May 1940 when I.

Clausen reported the sighting, which was relayed to KG 40 by Fliegerf√ºhrer Atlantik. On 9 February, KG 40 sent five Fw 200s to attack the convoy which was spotted at 4 pm roughly southwest of Lisbon. In the attack at , the Fw 200's managed to sink five ships (, , , and ), and Deptford damaged the Fw 200 piloted by Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Erich Adam, who managed to fly his aircraft to Spain. U-37 sank three further ships from HG 53\\\\. This achievement earned him his first mention in the Wehrmachtbericht, an information bulletin and element of Nazi propaganda issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. Fliegel was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross () on 25 March 1941. In mid-April 1941 he was appointed Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I. Gruppe of KG 40, replacing Major Edgar Petersen. He was mentioned a second time in the Wehrmachtbericht on 20 June 1941 after the number of enemy shipping destroyed by his Gruppe increased by a further 24 ships, reaching 109 enemy ships sunk. By early 1941 I. Gruppe of KG 40 had five holders of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross reflecting the success of the Condors in Atlantic Ocean operations. =Killed in action= On 18 July 1941, Fliegel and his crew‚Äîcopilot Leutnant (Second Lieutenant) Wolf-Dietrich Kadelke, first radio operator Oberfeldwebel (Staff Sergeant) Johannes Rottke, second radio operator Gefreiter (Airman) Karl Becker, flight engineer Unteroffizier (Sergeant) Johann Kothe and air gunner Unteroffizier Karl Meurer‚Äîwere reported missing in action over the Atlantic in the vicinity northwest of Ireland. Their Fw 200 C-3 \\"F8+AB\\" (Werknummer 0043‚Äîfactory number) was shot down in an attack on convoy OB 346\\\\. During the attack on the freighter Pilar de Larrinaga, the gunners onboard the freighter scored a hit on the Fw 200's starboard wing which tore it off. At the time of his death, Fliegel was credited with seven ships sunk plus further six damaged. He was promoted to Major (major) posthumously.

Formally launched at Heli-Expo in Orlando, Florida on 3 March 2015, it is intended to replace the AS365 and EC155 models in the firm's lineup. In June 2015, the first test flight took place; the first customer deliveries were expected in 2018 but have slipped to 2020.. Development Airbus Helicopters H160 mockup at the 2015 Dubai Airshow. The Airbus Helicopters H160 was first revealed to the public in 2011, at which point it was referred to by company representatives by the designation X4 ‚Äì a designation which implied it to be a follow-on from the Eurocopter X3, a high-speed hybrid helicopter technology demonstrator. Speaking in early 2011, Eurocopter (later renamed as Airbus Helicopters) chief Lutz Bertling declared that the X4 would be a \\"game changer\\", contrasting significance of the innovations it would feature with Airbus' development of fly-by-wire controls.Thisdell, Dan. \\"Eurocopter X4 promises technical tour-de- force.\\" Flight International, 1 March 2011. Early features alluded to include Blue Edge active tracking rotor blades, advanced pilot assistance functionality, and reduced vibration to \\"near-jet\\" levels of smoothness. The X4 was also described as having a \\"radically different\\" cockpit, Bertling stating that \\"The cockpit as we know it today will not be there\\". It was also announced that the X4 would be introduced in two stages: an interim model in 2017 with some of the advanced features absent, and a more advanced model following in 2020.Quick, Darren. \\"Eurocopter plans next-generation X4 helicopter.\\" Gizmag, 13 February 2012. The development program for the X4 cost ‚Ç¨1 billion ($1.12 billion), even after numerous cutting-edge features, including proposed highly advanced control systems, were toned down or eliminated as too risky or costly. On 3 March 2015, the X4 was formally unveiled under the H160 designation. It has been marketed as a successor to the company's existing Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and competes with the AgustaWestland AW139, Sikorsky S-76 and Bell 412; Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive, referred to the H160 as being \\"the AW139 killer\\".Perry, Dominic. \\"Airbus Helicopters targets AW139 with new H160\\" Flight International, 3 March 2015.\\"Airbus Helicopters H160: The Evolutionary Successor.\\" Seeking Alpha, 6 October 2015. The H160 began Airbus Helicopter's re-branded naming convention; starting 1 January 2016, helicopters in the same range shall bear the 'H' designation, resembling how Airbus names their commercial aircraft. A design emphasis was placed on using Airbus' production and support techniques as used for advanced fixed-wing aircraft such as the Airbus A350 passenger jet; accordingly, a pair of test rigs were built to separately test the dynamic and system elements respectively to speed up the design process. On 29 May 2015, the first H160 prototype was unveiled at Airbus Helicopters' Marignane facility in France.\\"Airbus Helicopters unveils H160 prototype.\\" Vertical Magazine, 1 July 2015. = Flight testing = On 13 June 2015, the first prototype performed its first flight from Marignane.

In March 2016, H160 program chief Bernard Fujarski stated that nearly all milestones set for 2015 had been achieved, save for the second prototype's first flight having being delayed to January 2016, and that the H160's aerodynamic configuration had been validated.Dubois, Thierry. \\"H160 Flight Testing Benefitting From New Tools.\\" AIN Online, 1 March 2016. Testing had revealed a need to relocate some electronics systems to the rotorcraft's nose from the rear portion of the main fuselage for center of gravity reasons, while the fenestron shrouded tail rotor had reportedly exceeded performance expectations. In 2015, Airbus estimated that there was a market for 120‚Äì150 airframes annually; the company intends to initially increase the manufacturing rate to roughly 50 aircraft per year. In July 2016, it was announced that the aeromechanical configuration of the rotorcraft had been frozen.Perry, Dominic. \\"H160 configuration frozen, but first delivery may slip.\\" Flight International, 28 July 2016. Manufacturing of the first production H160 is scheduled for 2017; the first delivery may take place in late 2018 or early 2019. A new production scheme, drawing inspiration from the automotive industry, is to be implemented in the H160's construction; it is a stated aim for the final assembly lead time of the new rotorcraft to be half of that of the preceding Dauphin. In March 2017, French defence minister Jean- Yves Le Drian announced at Marignane that the H160 was selected as the basis for its tri-service light rotorcraft replacement programme, the h√©licopt√®re interarm√©es l√©ger (HIL), with between 160 and 190 required from 2024 to replace 420 aircraft : French navy‚Äôs Alouette IIIs, SA 365 Dauphin and AS565 Panther, the French Air Force‚Äôs AS555 Fennec and SA330 Pumas; and the French army Pumas, SA341/SA342 Gazelles and Fennec. In May 2019, French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly christened this helicopter as H160M Gu√©pard. In October 2017, the initial pair of prototypes reached 500h of flight testing while the third should make its maiden flight, the entire flight envelope had been opened leaving hot weather, antennas, optional equipment testing and certification flights. In 2018, 10 pre-serial helicopters were assembled before certification and deliveries in 2019, production was looking to be increased to 50 per year. The first serial H160 made its maiden flight on 14 December 2018. Its Safran Arrano turboshaft received its type certificate during the June 2019 Paris Air Show, before EASA approval for the H160 planned for the fourth quarter before first delivery to a US customer for corporate transport in May 2020. After 1500 hours of flight tests and demo flights with three prototypes, the H160 was type certified by the EASA on 1 July 2020, before FAA certification and delivery to an US customer planned for the same year. Design H160 tail showing biplane stabiliser, canted fenestron and rotor tip H160 rotor hub and exhaust The Airbus Helicopters H160 takes advantage of several advanced manufacturing technologies and materials in order to produce a lighter, more efficient design. One weight-saving measure was the replacement of conventional hydraulic landing gear and brakes with electrical counterparts, the first helicopter in the world to do so; according to Airbus the elimination of hydraulic components makes the rotorcraft both lighter and safer. In 2015, Airbus claimed that the all-composite H160 would deliver the same basic performance as the rival AgustaWestland AW139 while being a ton lighter, having a lower fuel consumption and offering 15‚Äì20% lower direct operating costs. The composite fuselage also provided for greater design freedom of the rotorcraft's external styling. During the aircraft's development, features such as full de-icing equipment and a fly-by-wire control system, were deemed too heavy or costly for the benefits involved and were eliminated. The H160 is the first rotorcraft to feature the Blue Edge five-bladed main rotor. This incorporates a double-swept shape that reduces the noise generation of blade-vortex interactions (BVI), a phenomenon which occurs when the blade impacts a vortex created at its tip, resulting in a 3‚Äì4 dB noise reduction and raising the effective payload by compared with a scaled Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin rotor design.Skinner, Tony and Beth Maundrill. \\"Heli- Expo 2015: Introducing the H160.\\" Shephard, 3 March 2015. Aerodynamic innovations include a biplane tailplane stabiliser for greater low speed stability, and a quieter canted fenestron which combined produce an extra 80 kg of lift. The H160 is the first civilian helicopter to utilise a canted fenestron anti-torque tail rotor. The H160 will be powered by two Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines; a second engine, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210E, was to be offered as an alternative option, but this was eliminated due to insufficient power output and to reduce design complexity.Perry, Dominic. \\"Airbus Helicopters drops PW210 engine on 'repositioned' X4.\\" Flight International, 18 February 2015. A redundant backup for the gearbox lubrication system enables in excess of five hours of flight following a primary failure without causing mechanical damage. In early 2015, Airbus claimed that the H160 is intended to have a \\"day one\\" availability rate expectation exceeding 95 percent. The H160 features the Helionix avionics suite, the cockpit being equipped with a total of four multifunctional displays. Airbus Helicopters collaborated with Esterline CMC to develop portions of the avionics, such as the CMA-9000 Flight Management System and the CMA-5024 GPS landing system sensor, to automate the landing process.Bellamy III, Woodrow. \\"Airbus, Esterline CMC Avionics Power New H160.\\" Avionics Magazine, 5 March 2015. A full flight simulator has also been developed for the H160, in partnership with Helisim and Thales Group.\\"Airbus Helicopters selects Thales and Helisim for its H160 full flight simulator deployment.\\" Thales Group, 10 February 2016. The avionics provide a level of commonality with the company's earlier Eurocopter EC145 T2 and Eurocopter EC175 helicopters. Commentators have stated that this commonality to be similar to AgustaWestland's rotorcraft family concept.

The film focuses on Nan Willis, a wealthy heiress, who visits a seaside resort with her maid, Susan. The two decide to trade roles and Nan encounters a young lifeguard with whom she falls in love with. Susan plots against Nan to steal her valuables and orchestrates a plot with a lighthouse keeper to lock Nan in the tower for a share of the spoils. Nan's Newfoundland dog is sent on a rescue message and delivers a message to the lifeguard. He arrives and rescues Nan from her jailer before hurrying back to the hotel, catching Susan in the act. Nan decides not to only dismiss instead of punish her maid because she her new-found love more than compensates the hardships she went through. The cast and credits for the film are unknown. The film was released on November 11, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 5, 1910. It states: \\"Nan Willis is a wealthy young heiress who visits the fashionable seaside resort at which she is unknown. She is accompanied only by her maid, Susan, an envious woman, who bears her mistress no great love. Bored by the even tenor of her life, Nan decides to seek adventure by changing places with her maid, and thus escaping the restrictions of conventionality with which she has constantly been surrounded. She makes the acquaintance of a young lifeguard, Jim Holt, and accepts his offer to teach her to swim. A very real affection springs up between the two young people, and Nan is sure that Jim, unlike her other suitors, loves her for herself alone, as he thinks her only a lady's maid. While visiting an isolated lighthouse, Nan, accompanied only by Sue, is made a prisoner in one of the upper rooms of the structure. The plot is Sue's who hopes thus to be able to make her escape with Nan's jewels and other valuables. The rascal, a young keeper of the lighthouse, and his miserly old grandmother are made a party to the plot by accepting an offer to share in the spoils. Through her faithful Newfoundland dog, who braves an angry sea, Nan sends a message to her lifeguard sweetheart, who comes instantly to her aid. After a spirited encounter with the keeper of the light, who is also Nan's jailer, the young people make their escape in Jim's boat. They reach the hotel in time to confront Susan, who cringes with fear when caught red-handed with her mistress' belongings. Nan allows Susan to go unpunished, feeling that the happiness she has found in the proof of Jim's unselfish love more than compensates her for all the hardships she has endured.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. A special focus in the film was the Newfoundland dog who played the key role in foiling the plot and was promoted in advertising for the film. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 1, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, theaters advertising the film are known in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Indiana, and Montana. In 1917, years after its widespread release, the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures would approve it for viewing without modification. Walton of The Moving Picture News praised the film, \\"The theme is not new, but the way it is handled, in this case, gives it a new interest. A film that grips and by skillful presentation must be popular. The lighthouse scenes and the dog won deserved applause.\\" The Moving Picture World was more specific in its praise. The reviewer stated, \\"There is life and animation enough to suit the most exacting, with good acting and clear photography as features of the picture.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror contained a scathing review, \\"The young actress with the pretty face who played the part of the mistress in this impossible melodrama should learn to show us her back once in a while. Perhaps it is the director who is to blame; at any rate, this thing of constantly twisting the attitude so that one can face the front ruins the sense of reality that must be depended on to make motion picture acting effective, especially so in this film, which is so far-fetched in its melodramatic situations that no single element of the motion picture producing art should be dispensed with.\\" See also * List of American films of 1910  References  Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films Category:1910 lost films Category:Lost drama films ","title":"Mistress and Maid (1910 film)"},{"id":"45574983","text":"Jing Chunhua (; born February 1956) is a former Chinese politician who spent most of his career in Hebei province. Beginning in 2008, Jing served as the Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Communist Party Committee, in charge of coordination and implementation. Prior to that, Jing served as party chief of Hengshui, a prefecture-level city. He was investigated in March 2015 by the Communist Party's anti-graft agency, suspected of corruption. Biography Si was born and raised in Guangrao, Shandong province in 1956. Jing joined the Communist Party in 1976. He began work in 1973 as a labourer in a mine and a team leader of the youth group. He entered the mine's management office in 1978. In 1983, he became deputy head, then head of the organization department of the mine, in charge of human resources. He also earned a diploma part-time at Hebei Broadcasting and Television College in Chinese language. In 1987 he began heading the Communist Youth League (CYL) organization in the city, a position he stayed on for the next five years. He was then made deputy CYL Secretary in Hebei province while studying economics at the Central Party School. In 1995 he was again elevated to lead the CYL organization in the province, earning the rank equivalent to a provincial department director. He again took up part-time studies, this time studying global economics at Hebei University. In 1997 he was named deputy party chief of Chengde while maintaining his department director rank. He engaged in yet another study stint, this time in \\"scientific socialism.\\" In July 2001, he was named acting mayor of Chengde, and confirmed as mayor formally in March 2002. He served until 2006, during which time he attended Tianjin University to engage in further studies in \\"management science and engineering\\". He finally earned a full-fledged executive position as head of the party (the highest political office) in Hengshui in July 2006, at age 50. In October 2008 he became Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. The position is in charge of coordinating different individuals and organizations to implement party policy in the province. In January 2011 he entered the top ranks of the province by earning a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee. After Xi Jinping became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, a large campaign began emphasizing the \\"mass line\\". As part of this campaign, officials were expected to criticize themselves. Jing took part in democratic life meetings of the provincial party leadership. Jing said he \\"did not pay enough attention to detail,\\" and did not \\"uphold democratic centralism\\" because he didn't speak too often during standing committee meetings. In September 2013, Jing attended a democratic life meeting presided over by Xi Jinping himself, during which Jing said he had become \\"too pretentious and too prideful\\" over the years and often forgot that he was still a civil servant. In April 2014, Jing became the head of the provincial reform office, overseeing major reform initiatives, ostensibly a position of high responsibility, as \\"deepening reform\\" was high on the agenda of the Xi-Li Administration. On March 3, 2015, prior the opening of the annual \\"two sessions\\" conference in Beijing, state media announced Jing was undergoing investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Jing was the second official of provincial-level rank from Hebei province to fall from grace in Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive, after provincial party organization chief Liang Bin, who was detained in 2014. However, Liang's case is believed to be related to his term in office in Shanxi province, where he served prior to coming to Hebei. Jing, on the other hand, spent his entire political career in Hebei. The announcement to investigate Jing also broke an unspoken rule that investigations of high-ranking officials would not be announced during the annual convening of the Chinese legislature in March. On May 8, 2015, at the conclusion of the investigation by the CCDI, Jing was expelled from the Communist Party. The investigation concluded that Jing used his position of power to further the interests of others and promote associates in exchange for bribes, and that he committed \\"adultery.\\" He was indicted on charges of bribery and transferred to judicial authorities for prosecution. On December 23, 2016, Jing was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

She has received a number of awards, and her contributions to Austrian poetry, which both are considered particularly significant. Biography Born in Graz, M√ºhringer suffered a serious illness, when she was seven years old. After being bed-ridden for months, she had to learn how to walk again. During this period, she discovered the world of books, especially fairy tales, which provided her with exciting new experiences, often affecting her own poetry in later life. In 1929, the family moved to Vienna, where she completed various studies at the University of Vienna without graduating. After the war, M√ºhringer settled in Salzburg, where she made a living translating from English, and taking on secretarial work and proof reading for publishing houses. She met the writer Hans Weigel, who persuaded her to move to Vienna, and became her mentor. In 1954, he published some of her poems in his collection, Stimmen der Gegenwart (Voices from the Present). In 1976, she published her own rather different version of the fairy tale \\"Der Wolf und die sieben Gei√ülein\\" (\\"The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids\\") by the Brothers Grimm, as part of the children's book Neues vom Rumpelstilzchen und andere Haus-M√§rchen von 43 Autoren, compiled by Hans- Joachim Gelberg.Doris M√ºhringer: Der Wolf und die sieben Gei√ülein. In: Grimmige M√§rchen. Prosatexte von Ilse Aichinger bis Martin Walser. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt (Main) 1986, , S. 84‚Äì85 (zuerst erschienen in: Hans-Joachim Gelberg (ed.): Neues vom Rumpelstilzchen und andere Haus-M√§rchen von 43 Autoren. Beltz & Gelberg, Weinheim 1976, S. 197‚Äì198.). Shortly after publication of Stimmen der Gegenwart, she received the Georg Trakl Poetry Award (1954), soon to be followed by the Bertelsmann Poetry Prize (1956). She has received a number of other awards, including the Boga-Tinti Prize in 1972. In 2001, she was awarded the Austrian Prize for Children's and Young Adult Literature (√ñsterreichischer Kinder- und Jugendbuchpreis). A member of the international PEN Club, and of the Austrian PODIUM, she moved in literary circles, took part in open readings, and, in 1969, went on a lecture tour to the United States. Despite her relatively few publications, the Austrian writer Gerhard Ruiss commented that there was absolutely no doubt Doris M√ºhringer was one of \\"the most important contributors to Austrian poetry over the last few decades\\".

Together with the Church of St. John the Baptist in Burlington and St Mary's Church in West Burlington it forms Divine Mercy parish, which is a part of the Diocese of Davenport. The parish maintains the former parish church buildings as worship sites. St. Paul's Church and the rectory are contributing properties in the Heritage Hill Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places. St. Paul's School was also a contributing property in the historic district, but it has subsequently been torn down. History Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP With the establishment of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836, the town of Burlington was chosen as one of the temporary capitals of the territory. With the establishment of the Iowa Territory in 1838, the town became its first capital. Bishop Mathias Loras and the Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP, recognized the importance of the community. There were, however, few Catholics in the area when Mazzuchelli was dispatched to Burlington to buy land in 1839 and establish St. Paul's Church. A small brick church building was constructed 1840-1841. It was located where the back of the present church is located. The first church bell in Burlington arrived in 1842. The building was leased to the territorial legislature for 60 days for their use. As a way to strengthen Catholicism in the area Loras chose St. Paul's as the location for the ordination of the Rev. Anthony Godfert, whom Loras had recruited from France. It was also to Burlington that Loras fled when tempers flared between the Irish and German Catholics of Dubuque. He sent St. Paul's pastor, the Rev. John Healy, an Irish immigrant himself, to calm tensions, which he could not do. The Burlington area was served regularly by a visiting priest after Loras left town, especially the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourgues of St. Anthony's in Davenport. The Rev. John Alleman, arrived in 1847. The town by then had become a hotbed for anti-Catholic, anti-clerical, and nativist thinking. Many of the people who harbored these beliefs had moved to Burlington from the eastern United States where such thinking was rampant. Alleman stayed a couple of years until the arrival of the Rev. George Reffe, who started Burlington's first parochial school in the church basement in 1849. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary started teaching at St. Paul's in 1859. The parish's second church building, a brick English Gothic-styled structure, was completed in 1863. The present St. Paul's Church was designed by Chicago architect James J. Egan in the High Victorian Gothic Revival style. He had previously designed Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport, and St. Ambrose Cathedral in Des Moines. All three churches, while distinct, have many of the same features. The cornerstone was laid on October 23, 1892. The Rev. Bernard Mackin was the pastor at the time. St. Paul's was built by John Loftus and completed in 1895. It was dedicated on January 27, 1895. The church was damaged by a fire in 1946 and the interior had to be gutted and rebuilt. The first merger of the Catholic Community in Burlington happened in the parochial schools. Both St. Paul's and St. John's operated parish-based high schools. Those separate operations merged in 1958 with the opening of Notre Dame High School on the city's west side. The two parishes continued to operate their own grade schools until 1975 when they were consolidated. St. Paul's School was the site for kindergarten through 4th Grade and St. John's housed grades five through eight. The school at Burlington's third parish, St. Patrick's, and the school at St. Mary's in West Burlington had both closed in 1969. In the 1990s a fund drive was held and a new grade school wing was added at Notre Dame. The number of clergy in the Davenport Diocese has declined steadily since the 1960s. Demographics and religious practice in the Burlington Community also changed. Bishop Gerald O‚ÄôKeefe announced a plan in 1991 to consolidate parishes throughout the diocese, and the parishes in Burlington were part of that plan. In 1998 St. Paul's and St. John's were consolidated under the leadership of the Rev. John Hyland, who had been the pastor at both parishes since 1996. The new parish name was a combination of the two parishes: Saints John and Paul. St. Patrick's and St. Mary's consolidated at the same time to form their own parish. In 2017 Saints John and Paul parish and St. Mary and St. Patrick parishes merged to form Divine Mercy parish. Architecture St. Paul's Church is constructed of Bedford limestone and the exterior features a corner tower on the right side of the facade that rises to . The original church bell from 1842 is in the tower. The church is located on a corner lot at the top of an embankment, which gives it prominence. It also allows for the basement to be exposed in the back of the church building. The side bays of the church are separated by prominent buttresses. Three gables break up the roofline on the side elevations. Tracery and paired lancet windows alternate down the side elevations with the tracery windows in the bays with the gables. Above the main entrance is a tall tracery window that is flanked by two shorter lancet windows. The interior is a large open expanse without pillars. The pews are arranged in four sections across the interior. The vaulted ceiling is supported by heavy hardwood hammer beams. The altar is framed by a tall Pointed arch. It is flanked by alcoves that hold shrines. On the left side is the tabernacle with a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus above it. To the right is a shrine with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph. Above the altar are three stained glass windows. The taller central window features an image of St. Paul the Apostle. A pipe organ is located in the gallery in the back. St. Paul's Rectory, which is located next door to the church, was designed by Egan & Prindeville. Built between 1902 and 1904 in the Georgian Revival style, it is a two-story house that features a steeply pitched, multiple hipped roof covered in slate. Small dormers are located on all sides of the roof and modillion blocks are located under the eaves. Tall stone chimneys rise above the roofline. The exterior is covered with smooth-faced, coursed ashlar that alternates with a narrow course of rusticated ashlar. The structure is basically rectangular in shape, however, the north half of the main facade projects slightly from the rest of the house. The balustraded front porch is supported by three plain columns. A columned porch on the southeast corner of the house has been screened-in. A modern addition was added to the back of the house and extends the length of the back porch.

Biography The Don't Bite the Pavement series began in 1999 in Olympia, Washington and eventually became a project of the organisation ArtRod. Each installment was loosely focused around an idea or theme and showcased innovative work by artists from around the world within the field of video art, expanded media, microcinema, or installation art; providing a space for this work to be presented and creating dialogues between the site and the larger community. Around this time, artists and writers also began documenting and discussing this work in a reoccurring column likewise called Don't Bite the Pavement, which regularly featured interviews and articles in the journal Toby Room. With each installment of the video series, Don't Bite the Pavement sought to create exhibitions that \\"engaged and challenged the community\\", while providing space and resources where artists could exhibit new work and develop novel approaches and projects. Reception Artforum contributor Emily Hall wrote that the project was \\"pulling together some of the most challenging and interesting work happening around Seattle\\" adding: \\"Let that be a modest but powerful lesson to all the naysayers and whiners who complain that innovative work isn't happening here.\\" Artist Lauren Steinhart characterized the project as: :\\"Each gathering of Don't Bite the Pavement was a chance for artists and viewers to gather, interact, and to show and discuss their work both completed and in-progress.

Shortly after graduation, he moved to Humboldt, Nebraska where he held a number of elected positions including city mayor and Nebraska State Senator. Soon after his appointment to the Arizona court, Tucker faced allegations of wrongdoing that forced him to resign several months after joining the bench. Biography Tucker was born on May 13, 1856, to Pliny T. and Delia Ann (Stone) Tucker in Homer, New York. His family moved to Belvidere where the younger Tucker was educated in local schools. He also read law under a Wisconsin judge before graduating from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1878. Following graduation, Tucker worked briefly as a lawyer before moving to Humboldt, Nebraska in 1879. Tucker married Alfaretta Bristol of Rock Prairie, Wisconsin. The union produced two children: George Eugene and Blanche May. In Nebraska, Tucker became involved in Republican politics. Active locally, he was a police judge, city clerk, city and county attorney before serving one term as mayor of Humboldt. Tucker was a delegate to the 1900 Republican National Convention and was elected to the Nebraska State Senate. Fraternally, Tucker was a member of the Knights of Pythias and served the group as a chancellor commander. President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Tucker to replace Justice George Russell Davis on February 11, 1905. The nomination was based primarily upon a recommendation from United States Senator Elmer Burkett of Nebraska. While he was nominated to serve in the first district, a reorganization of the court in March 1905 moved Tucker to the newly created fifth district. He took his oath of office on April 1 with his court, which covered Gila and Graham counties, being located in Globe. Tucker wrote no opinions in the Arizona Reports as he did not hold office long enough to serve during a session of the territorial supreme court. He did however serve during a session of his district court. Shortly after he took the bench, the Department of Justice allegedly received a photograph showing the new justice smoking a cigar with his feet resting upon a bench while court was in session. In August 1905, the justice department began an investigation and a variety of allegations were made against Tucker. Unofficial reports indicate the investigation found sufficient evidence to recommend Tucker's removal. Senator Burkett tried to intervene on Tucker's behalf. This allowed the judge to finish the court session that was underway at the time the justice department recommended his removal. Tucker submitted his resignation on October 13, 1905. After leaving the bench, Tucker moved to Los Angeles. There he worked as a lawyer although records indicate he was not admitted to the California bar until November 27, 1911. In 1939, Tuckes wife died. Tucker died at his home in Culver City, California on December 28, 1942. He was the last Arizona Territorial Supreme Court justice to die and the oldest surviving member from the 1878 University of Wisconsin graduating class.

The Sports field was situated next door to the Convent and was vested in (and still is) in local trustees. The Congested Districts Board gave it to Bishop John Lyster, Fr. J O‚ÄôConnor Administrator and Mr. James Gordon, a local business man. It also included a cinder running track for cycling and many athletic meetings were held there.

Career  Carre√≥n's orchestras performed stock arrangements from Count Basie and other popular swing bands and performed custom arrangements that distinguished his orchestra in both swing and Latin jazz. The Latin jazz was essentially American big band swing-jazz fused with Afro- Hispanic music ‚Äî mambo and bolero, in particular. His band's Latin style became a popular trend with a few other notable Latin oriented Los Angeles big bands that influenced what became salsa. Carre√≥n's band performed in ballrooms around Los Angeles (including the Avadon Ballroom), the rest of the West Coast, the Southwest ‚Äî and as far as Texas (including Antonio Valencia's famous Patio Andatuz in San Antonio) and Louisiana ‚Äî in the 1950s. Several major jazz musicians, early in their careers, performed with his band, including a group of saxophonists that included Teddy Edwards, Herb Geller, Warne Marsh, and Herbie Steward. The legendary composer, Lennie Niehaus, who went on to write for Basie and the film industry, got his first professional job out of high school as a composer and saxophonist with Carre√≥n. Carre√≥n was a clarinet player; but as a band leader, he did not play an instrument. Notwithstanding the extant recordings of Carre√≥n's popular music, his legacy as the leader of an outstanding swing big band is chronicled but not audibly enshrined due either an absence of jazz discography or an absence of jazz recording sessions. Yet, a consensus of published acclaim by notable band alumni, entertainment peers, musicologists, and historians is that the swing aspect of Carre√≥n's big band was excellent. According to a 1998 interview with Don Tosti (1923‚Äì2004), early in his career, Carre√≥n worked for a Mexican- American jukebox industry entrepreneur Frank Navarro (n√© Francisco B. Navarro; 1895‚Äì1964), owner of Navarro Music Company, driving around Los Angeles replacing older albums with recent hit records.

It was first published in the 2003 collection Legends II. Plot summary Two years after the events chronicled in The Wishsong of Shannara, Kimber Boh finds Jair Ohmsford working in his parents' inn while they are away. She tells him of a dream that has been haunting Cogline where the shade of the fallen Druid Allanon comes to him and tells him that a page from the Ildatch was not destroyed, and that Jair must destroy it. Jair is unconvinced, but agrees to travel to Hearthstone with Kimber and meet with Cogline. The first night Jair is there the shade of Allanon visits him and tells him that he must travel to the lair of the Mwellrets, Dun Fee Aran, and destroy the remaining page of the Ildatch before its power grows. The three companions journey to Dun Fee Aran, and along the way encounter a peddler who warns them against going there. Jair struggles with his own fears of going back to that evil place where he was once imprisoned by the lizard-like Mwellrets, with their hypnotizing eyes. Once they arrive, Jair slips medication into Cogline and Kimber Boh‚Äôs ale, which causes them to fall into a deep sleep, so that he may enter the fortress alone, and spare them harm. Jair uses his Wishsong to disguise himself and gain entry to the fortress. He conjures up an illusion of Allanon which sends the Mwellrets into a panic, then follows one to the chamber where the remaining Ildatch page is guarded. He then tries to pick up the page, but it burns him and he howls, giving away his presence. The Mwellrets begin searching for him, but cannot find him as he is hidden by the Wishsong. They get close to him, and he conjures up an illusion of warriors, but the Mwellrets quickly see through that and in a panic he conjures up an illusion of the Weapons Master, Garet Jax, which he inhabits. This endows him with Garet Jax's fighting abilities, allowing him to slaughter the Mwellrets and destroy the Ildatch page. He then returns to himself and escapes the fortress, realizing that his Wishsong is much more powerful than he had realized. He can not only conjure up illusions, but he can inhabit those illusions, along with their powers.

Beginning his legal career overseeing pardon applications for the United States Department of Justice, he moved to Arizona Territory in 1901 and became an Assistant United States Attorney the next year. Campbell was appointed to the territorial bench in 1905 and served until Arizona gained statehood. Biography Campbell was born on September 19, 1869, in Tuscola, Illinois to William J. and Milla (Smith) Campbell. He attended public schools before graduation from Columbian University (now George Washington University) with a Bachelor of Laws in 1891 and a Master of Laws in 1892. While in college he worked for the United States Treasury Department. Campbell was admitted to the D.C. bar in 1892. Two years later, he joined the United States Department of Justice where he oversaw pardon processing. Campbell married Estelle Freet of Washington D.C. on April 15, 1890. The union produced three children: William, Helen, and Ruth. Moving to Arizona Territory in 1901, Campbell formed a partnership with Roscoe Dale based in Tucson. The next year he became an Assistant United States Attorney in Nogales. Campbell was a member of the Knights of Pythias and served as Grand Chancellor of Arizona. In January 1905, the 23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature sent a request to the United States House of Representatives requesting creation of a fifth judicial district within Arizona Territory. Congressional approval for a new judge on the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court came at the beginning of March. President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Campbell to be an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on March 15, 1905. While Campbell was nominated for the newly created fifth district, upon taking office he was assigned to replace George Russell Davis in the first district. Eugene A. Tucker in turn was assigned to the fifth district. President William Howard Taft nominated him for a second term on April 8, 1909. While serving on the bench, Campbell wrote close to fifty opinions. They tended to be concise, easily read, and well reasoned. His knowledge of business and commerce led to his writing a number of opinions in the area, including Valley Bank of Phoenix v. Brown, 9 Arizona 311 (1905), Friedman v. Suttle, 10 Arizona 57 (1906), and The Bank of Bisbee v. Graf, 12 Arizona 156. In Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway v. Hall, 13 Arizona 270 (1911), Campbell halved a $10,000 award that Hall had received after being injured while being required to ride a three- wheeled velocipede at as a condition of his employment. In City of Globe v. Slack, 11 Arizona 408 (1910), Campbell backed the rights of a group of land owners when the city tried to revive a plan to build a street on their property after having allowed the plan to die. Dealing with criminal matters, Campbell wrote opinions in Buffehr v. Territory of Arizona, 11 Arizona 165 (1907) which dealt with the theft of a fifty dollar gold certificate, the statutory rape case of Levy v. Territory of Arizona, 13 Arizona 425 (1911), and the attempted murder case of Williams v. Territory of Arizona, 13 Arizona 306 (1911). In Spence v. Territory of Arizona, 12 Arizona 20 (1910), Campbell ruled that testimony by an experienced big game hunter about the nature of inflicted wounds could be allowed during trial involving a right of self- defense argument. He also granted a retrial to a union organizer convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Ryan v. Territory of Arizona, 12 Arizona 208 (1909). In other matters, Campbell sided with the territorial medical board in Aiton v. The Board of Medical Examiners, 13 Arizona 354 (1911) when the doctor claimed his \\"mineral waters and preparations\\" had medicinal benefit in the treatment of \\"incipient tuberculosis, system catarrh, and catarrh of the head, Bright's disease, diabetes, rheumatism, and numerous other diseases\\". The justice found the territorial laws allowed a referendum on the prohibition of alcohol to be placed before the voters in Thalheimer v. Board of Supervisors of Maricopa County, 11 Arizona 430 (1908). Campbell also wrote opinion in Tribolet v. The United States, 11 Arizona 435 (1908), the only antitrust case to come before the territorial court. Arizona gaining statehood on February 14, 1912 marked the end of Campbell's time on the territorial bench. After leaving the bench, he partnered with Frederick S. Nave in Tucson to form the law firm of Nave & Campbell. Shortly afterward, Nave experienced a severe decline in his health and died in September 1912. Campbell's first wife, Estelle, died on October 17, 1910. He married his former partner's widow, Elise Wheaton Nave, on March 30, 1916. Campbell formed a law partnership with Samuel L Kingan in 1917. Attorney's such as Archie R. Conner, George R. Darnell, and Frederick G. Nave would later join the firm. At the firm, Campbell was known for representing the Arizona National Bank as well as a number of mining companies. In March 1919, Campbell was appointed to the Arizona Board of Regents. He remained a regent until his retirement in January 1927. Campbell died in Loma Linda, California on June 10, 1928. He was buried in Tucson's Evergreen Cemetery.

Shortly after graduation from law school, he moved to Arizona Territory for health reasons. There he was appointed to serve on a committee created to overhaul the territorial legal code. Nave then served as a county attorney and United States Attorney before being appointed an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. His health problems prompted an early resignation from the territorial bench and he practiced law for several years before his death at age 39. Biography Nave was born to Orville James and Anna Eliza (Semans) Nave in Lewis Center, Ohio on January 7, 1873. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1895 and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Nave then completed a law degree at Northwestern University in 1897 and was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. While studying law, he taught Greek and Latin at an academy affiliated with the university. Following graduation, Nave accepted a promising position with a law firm in Chicago. Suffering from tuberculosis, Nave moved to Arizona Territory in 1898 for health reasons. Settling initially in the Phoenix area, he was admitted to the Arizona bar on February 23, 1898. In March 1899, Nave was appointed as the clerk for a committee created to overhaul the territorial legal code. The commission's work served as the basis of the 1901 revision of the Arizona legal code. In 1900, Nave was elected Santa Cruz County attorney. About the same time he moved to Nogales. Nave was appointed as a United States Attorney on January 8, 1902. Nave married Elise Wheaton (Gill) Jones in Nogales on March 26, 1901. The couple had a son and an adopted daughter. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Nave to replace Eugene A. Tucker as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on November 8, 1905. He took his oath of office on November 17. As a justice, Nave wrote a number of opinions with significant impact. In addition to a number of cases dealing with mining concerns, Nave's opinion in Territory of Arizona v. Ruval, 9 Arizona 415 (1906) dealt with the issue of double jeopardy while Maxwell v. Territory of Arizona, 10 Arizona 1 (1906) considered degrees of a crime with respect to a convicted cattle rustler. Ford v. United States, 12 Arizona 23 (1908) was concerned with charges of conspiracy to commit adultery within a brothel. Eytinge v. Territory of Arizona, 12 Arizona 131 (1909) dealt with murder by chloroform while Molina v. Territory of Arizona, 12 Arizona 14 (1908) involved a murder charge reduced to manslaughter. Among his more unusual cases were Duffield v. Ashurst, 12 Arizona 360 (1909) which dealt with Ralph H. Cameron's right to collect tolls for use of the Bright Angel Trail. Nave found the court had no jurisdiction to determine which printing company would receive a contract from a county board of supervisors in Hammer v. Smith, 11 Arizona 420 (1908). The dual cases of Leatherwood c. Hill, 10 Arizona 16 (1906) and 10 Arizona 243 (1906) dealt with the Arizona Pioneer's Historical Society's efforts to compel the territorial auditor to release funds allocated by the territorial legislature of the society. The case of In Re By-a-lil-le, 12 Arizona 150 (1909) was a habeas corpus case dealing with an incident where the Federal government had rounded up a group of suspected troublemakers from the Navajo reservation and were holding them at Fort Huachuca. Nave also ruled that a municipal water supply could be established despite the protests of a private water company in Phoenix Water Company v. The Common Council of Phoenix, 9 Arizona 430 (1906). Health concerns prompted Nave to resign from the bench. The resignation was effective April 1, 1909. After leaving the bench, Nave opened a legal practice in Globe. From 1908 till 1909 he was an executive committee member for the National Irrigation Company. He served as president of the Arizona Bar Association from 1911 till 1912. Following Arizona statehood, Nave formed a legal partnership with John H. Campbell. Shortly thereafter, Nave's health took a significant downturn and he spent the summer of 1912 in Los Angeles trying to recover. Nave died at his home in Globe on September 27, 1912 as a result of his tuberculosis. He was buried in Glendale, California's Forest Lawn Cemetery. His widow married John H. Campbell, Nave's former law partner, on March 30, 1916.

Searches were also organised by public volunteers in areas including in Wharf Road in Fishponds, Trym Valley and Badock's Wood. Police made a public appeal for information regarding the movements of a black Vauxhall Zafira between 19 and 23 February. Initial inquiries focused on the belief that Watts had disappeared after leaving the family home, based on statements given by her step-brother Nathan Matthews and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, who were at the house at the time. They said they had not seen Watts but \\"heard the door slam\\" and assumed she had left. On 28 February, Matthews and Hoare were arrested in connection with Watts's disappearance. On 2 March, they were re-arrested on suspicion of murder. The following day, Watts's dismembered body was found at a property in Barton Court, Barton Hill. On 4 March, Matthews was charged with murder. On 6 March, four other people who had been arrested were charged with assisting an offender, having been accused of helping to hide or dispose of Watts's body. A 23-year-old man who had also been arrested was released without charge. On 22 June, Hoare, who was originally charged with perverting the course of justice, was charged with murder. Matthews and Hoare were also charged with conspiracy to kidnap, preventing the lawful burial of a body and possession of an illegal weapon. The couple were also charged with four unrelated counts of making indecent images of children. Matthews was also charged on unrelated counts of sexual assault and voyeurism. Watt's funeral took place at St Ambrose Church in Whitehall, Bristol, on 17 April 2015 and was described by her family as \\"an occasion to celebrate Becky's life\\". The service was followed by a private interment for her family and friends at Avon View Cemetery.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-32335353 Trial, verdicts and sentencing The murder trial began on 6 October 2015 at Bristol Crown Court. It was the prosecution's case that Watts was suffocated in her bedroom during a \\"sexually-motivated\\" kidnap plot carried out by Matthews and Hoare. According to the prosecution, after the killing, Matthews and Hoare put Watts's body into the boot of their car and stayed at the house for several more hours, during which time other family members arrived home. Later that day, they drove back to their own house, where over the next few days they dismembered her body using a knife and a circular saw and put the remains into bags and boxes, which were then hidden in a neighbour's shed. Matthews admitted killing Watts, but denied committing murder. He instead admitted manslaughter, telling the court that he had tried to kidnap his step-sister as a way of scaring her into changing what he perceived as her bad behaviour, but the plan went wrong and he accidentally killed her. Matthews insisted the killing took place while Hoare was in the garden, and that she was not involved. Hoare, who also denied murder, said she had no knowledge of the murder and had played no part in it, describing text messages she had exchanged with Matthews about kidnapping schoolgirls in the months before as \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"sarcastic\\". The prosecution claimed that the text messages between the two, as well as other content found at their home, suggested \\"a shared unnatural interest in attractive teenage females\\". The prosecution also relied on CCTV evidence of the movements of Matthews and Hoare on the day Watts was last seen alive, and in the days which followed. On 19 February 2015, before going to Crown Hill, they were seen in a Tesco supermarket buying batteries, which were allegedly needed for stun guns which they intended to use in the kidnap. Footage from the day after Watts was killed showed Matthews buying the circular saw that was used to dismember her body, and between 20 and 22 February, he and Hoare were captured shopping for cleaning products which was said they required to clean the bathroom where the dismemberment took place. DNA linked both Matthews and Hoare to items that were found in the shed alongside the remains, and an expert was called to give evidence who said it would be \\"easier\\" to carry out the dismemberment if more than one person was involved. On 11 November 2015, after 3 hours and 27 minutes of deliberation, the jury found Matthews guilty of murder and Hoare guilty of manslaughter. Both were also convicted of conspiracy to kidnap, perverting the course of justice, preventing the lawful burial of a body and possession of two stun guns. Two men, James Ireland and Donovan Demetrius, were cleared of assisting an offender, which related to the moving and storing of packages containing Watts's remains. Demetrius's brother Karl and his girlfriend Jaydene Parsons, who owned the shed where the remains were stored, had admitted the same charge at an earlier pre-trial hearing, though both insisted they did not know the true contents of the packages. On 5 February 2016, Karl was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment and Parsons was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment. On 13 November 2015, Mr Justice Dingemans sentenced Matthews to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 33 years and Hoare to 17 years in prison. In his sentencing remarks, the judge agreed with the prosecution's belief that the planned kidnap was for a \\"sexual purpose\\", telling Matthews he had \\"a fixation with having sex with petite teenage girls\\" and that he believed Hoare had been \\"persuaded to participate in this fixation.\\" He added: \\"Finally I should like to pay public tribute to the family of Becky for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves throughout these proceedings\\" and then continued: \\"Hearing the evidence during the trial has been difficult for anyone but it is plain that it has been an immense burden for the family.\\" Post-trial events In February 2016, a wooden bench was unveiled in Watts's memory, located in Goat's Field, close to her home. The bench, carved by Andy O'Neill, was funded by the Neighbourhood Watch Partnership. A painted mural was also erected in memory of Watts in a park close to where she lived, as well as a lamp that was funded by her former college. Becky's bench Back of Becky's bench In March 2016, Watts's father, Darren Galsworthy, released a memoir which described his daughter's life, her murder and the subsequent criminal trial of those responsible. Entitled Becky: The Heartbreaking Story of Becky Watts, the book was published by Harper Collins. It was later re-titled to The Evil Within when released in paperback. Matthews and Hoare lodged appeals against their convictions and sentences, but on 23 June 2016, the Court of Appeal rejected their applications, saying that there was \\"no reasonable argument that the convictions are unsafe or that the sentences were wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.\\" References Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2015 murders in the United Kingdom Category:2015 in England Category:2010s in Bristol Category:February 2015 events in the United Kingdom Category:History of Bristol Category:Murder in Bristol ","title":"Murder of Becky Watts"},{"id":"45575648","text":"300x300px Umberto Vergine is an Italian businessman.

It is also the name of both a nearby stream and one of two villages known during the historic period, residence of this native group, the other being Weekpink (variously Weekping, Weepinck, Wepink, etc.). Weekpink is also the name of a small run of water that empties into the South Branch of the Rancocas, and is also located within the historic bounds of the Coaxen Indian settlement. This settlement, and both streams, are now located in Southampton Township, New Jersey. Historical references The first mention of Coaxen comes from a 1691 colonial survey for 400 acres of land to Thomas Evans at the Indian Town of Quaexin on one of the branches of the Rancocas. An Indian village existed on Coaxen Run, now Little Creek, to the rear of the present-day Roberts farm. Coaxen is the accepted form for the past usages of Quaexin, Quakeson, etc. In the Lenape language, Coaxen means there are pine trees, and Weekpink refers to place of bast fibre, which is plant material used for mats and other handicrafts. Soon after the arrival of Quaker settlers in Burlington County they formed the Proprietors of West Jersey, who in turn, appointed commissioners to purchase lands from the indigenous Lenape. One of these commissioners was Daniel Wills, who eventually owned large tracts land in what was then Northampton Township, in the vicinity of Rancocas Creek. After his death in 1698, his son, John Wills, inherited much of his father's land, including 624 acres lying near the forks of the river at the South Branch. John Wills was a member of the colonial council, friend to Governor Robert Hunter, and also served as an Indian Commissioner. In 1713, he was responsible for fending off an Indian war over the fraudulent attempt by John Wetherill: MEHEMICKWON the Indian King who was Commonly by the English Called King Charles made his Complaint to me Several times That John Wetherill had a design to Cheat him of Some of his Land at a place Called Coerping [Coaxen]: I asked him wch way that could be, he Answered that he had made him Drunk and when So had made a writing and got him Set his hand to it And this is what he Affirmed at all times when we Discoursed on that Subject And further he told me that ye Said John Wetherill offered to give him more Drink next morning, the Indian Said he asked the said Wetherill for what he would give him Drink, the said Wetherill Answered do you not know for wt do you not Remember you Sold me the Land last Night, no said the Indian I knew nothing of it, for I was So Drunk last Night, that I knew nothing, not So much as where I was, And if you have done Any Such thing by me when I was in that Condition as to get my hand to A writing, you have Cheated me. Mehemickwon was known to the English settlers as King Charles, a reference to the then reigning monarch in England, King Charles II. He was the acknowledged leader of the Lenape living in the region of the Rancocas, stretching from Assunpink to Big Timber Creek along the New Jersey shoreline of the Delaware River. When Wetherill claimed Coaxen lands from Mehemickwon, the latter threatened retaliation, and Governor Robert Hunter was rightfully worried that a rupture with the Indians was imminent. He used the power of his office to convince Wetherill to destroy the fraudulent deed, and it was burned in the presence of the Indian leader. To prevent such occurrences from happening again, John Wills took the unique step of deeding the Coaxen lands to the Indians. By 1740, Mehemickwon was dead, and a new leader, King Ossolowhen, had replaced him, but he too, was deceased. Ossolowhen's brothers and relations were the recipient of John Will's deed: This Indenture made the Sixth day of October 1740 year of our Lord One thousand Seven hundred and Forty and in the Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Second over Great Britain France and Ireland King &c; Between John Wills of the Township of Northampton in the County of Burlington and province of New Jersey (Gentleman) of the one part and the Children of the late Indian King Ossolowhen late of the Township of Northampton in the County and province aforesaid deceased and his Two Brothers, called by the names of Teannis and Moonis Indians and Natives of the Westerly Division of the province of New Jersey. The deed provided a metes and bounds description of what was henceforth known as the Coaxen. The deed from Wills was transferred: Every part and parcel thereof with their and every of their Appurtenances unto the Children of the said Ossolowhen and to his Two Brothers Teannis and Moonis and their Progeny so long as the Water run in the River Delaware and Ancocas or Northampton River To their only proper Use Behoof of the Children of the said Ossolowhen and his Two Brothers Teannis and Moonis and their Generations of[f]spring Stock or Kindred and to such of them as the said Land may descend according to the Custom used amongst the said Indians for evermore... so long as the Water runs in the River Delaware and [R]Ancocas or Northampton river. Thus John Wills, member of the Society of Friends and New Jersey Indian Commissioner, used the form of English-style law to ensure that this land be held in perpetuity to the local Lenape community. His efforts were noted in Samuel Smith‚Äôs work, The History of Nova Cesaerea [New Jersey], published in 1765. He wrote of the remaining Indian lands in New Jersey: One of these in particular ought to be noted in this place, to the honour of John Wills, sometime one of the council, by whose advice the Indian sachem, called king Charles, laid an English right on a large plantation at Weekpink, containing a valuable tract of land, in the county of Burlington, which is so contrived as to remain unalienable from his posterity, who now enjoy the benefit of it. In 1761, there were approximately forty native residents at Coaxen. Coaxen and Brotherton By the 1750s, the remaining Lenape in New Jersey, also known as the Delaware Indians by this time, were experiencing ever-increasing pressure on their families and communities. Land frauds, dishonest traders, and loss of access to lands for hunting and fishing, combined with epidemics of disease and social ills (notably alcohol) led to an out-migration to western lands in Pennsylvania and the Ohio River Valley. A religious revival took hold in some Lenape communities, notably at the Forks of the Delaware (Easton, PA area) in the 1740s, under the missionary work of David Brainerd. By 1745, he established a Christian Indian mission at Crosswicks, New Jersey, which relocated to present-day Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey in 1746 at what was called Bethel Indian Town. David Brainerd died of tuberculosis in 1747, as did dozens of his converts, and he was replaced by his younger brother, John Brainerd. The younger Brainerd used Bethel as his base while he traveled in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, bringing Christianity to Indian communities, including Coaxen, Lenape settlements on the Susquehanna River, and to the Stockbridge Mohicans and Wappingers in Massachusetts. In 1749, Brainerd noted the following in reference to Coaxen: Aug. 30: Came to a number of Indians near Rancocas, where I had appointed my interpreter to meet me. I spent some time in private conversation with them, and afterwards called them all together, being about twenty-two in number, and preached to them. They attended on divine worship with seriousness and considerable decency. Sept. 1: Visited the Indians again. Spent some time in private discourse with them, and then gathered them all together and preached to them. They attended on the several parts of divine worship with seriousness and decency, and one or two seemed to be affected with divine truths...I called the Indians together in one place, and, after prayer, discoursed to them, suiting my discourse to their understanding and the occasion as well as I could; and when I had done speaking to the Indians, turned to the white people, a great number of whom were present, I believe at least one hundred and fifty or two hundred of all sorts,-and gave them a solemn word of exhortation Sept. 2: Visited the Indians, had considerable conversation with them in a more private manner; then retired a little while for prayer, and afterwards called the Indians all together and carried on public worship...These Indians (being near twenty in number) seem to be generally convinced of the truth of the Christian religion, and one or two seem to be concerned for their souls, and desire to go where they can have opportunity to hear the gospel. I encouraged their going to Bethel, the Christian Indian town, which I suspect a number will do; but others seem inclined to go over towards Susquehanna. May the Lord follow them, wherever they go, with his blessing, and make them savingly acquainted with his dear Son! Lord's day, Sept. 3: Went to the Indians about nine in the morning; attended divine worship with them, there being now about thirty persons more able to attend on religious worship. Sept. 4: Went to the Indians; spent some time in conversation, and then called them together and attended public worship; prayed, preached, &c.;, and after I had done, gave them a more particular account of the state of affairs among the Indians at Bethel, where I live, and advised them to come there. Just as I was about to take leave of them, there came a little boy of about ten or eleven years old, and hung about me and began to cry, upon which I inquired what he wanted. I soon understood that he wanted to go with me; so I asked his parents if they were willing. They said, \\"yes.\\" So I sent him along with an Indian who belonged to the place where I live. Another showed a very great desire to go, and cried heartily enough because he could not go then; and when I took my leave of them the most of them seemed to be sorrowful. May the Lord bless what has been spoken to them, and grant that the good impressions made on their minds may never wear off till they are brought to a saving acquaintance with himself! Medal issued by the Friendly Association for Regaining and Preserving Peace with the Indians by Pacific Measures in 1757 With the outbreak of the French & Indian War in 1755, the British colonies, including New Jersey, witnessed a violent wave of Indian attacks along the frontier. After Braddock's defeat in 1755, the Delaware Indian communities of the Susquehanna and Ohio river valleys openly allied with the French. In an effort to regain allegiance or at least neutrality of the Delaware, and their Algonquian relatives such as the Shawnee, British authorities directed that any outstanding Indian complaints be addressed. Two groups formed by Quakers, ‚ÄúFriendly Association for Regaining and Preserving Peace with the Indians by Pacific Measures‚Äù was established in 1756. and the New Jersey Association for Helping the Indians (1757) (Allison, p. 33), and William Johnson, Indian Agent for the Crown, worked towards settling Indian disputes, including confused land titles in New Jersey. Ownership of Coaxen, aka Weekpink, demonstrated both native traditions and practices of communal propriety of lands; individual small lot ownership had not yet been a legal practice assimilated by this Delaware Indians. From the time of the first negotiations with New Jersey colonial authorities in January, 1756 at the First Treaty of Crosswicks, the Delaware Indians of New Jersey and Pennsylvania held the Coaxen tract as part of their tribal lands: We have to complain to our Brethren, that ill minded Persons are apt to take Advantage of the Indians when they are Drunk, and buy their Lands for a trifle, and often from the Indians who does not own it. And we pray our Brethren, that for the future no Indian Deed or Lease may be allowed to be good, but what is made and Signed before the Governor, or two of his Council, who are to have a Certificate from six Indians, that the Indian who sells the Land, is Owner of it, under the Hand of some Magistrate, who sees the six Indians Sign it, and the Deed to have it wrote on the back, and signed by the Governor, or two of his Council, that they saw the Certificate of the six Indians, Signed by the Justice, and that the Indian who sells the Land, understood the Deed, and had a reasonable Price as common for it. As some bad People have got a long Lease from a Drunken Indian for the Indian Lands at Wepink, and for which they pay mostly, or all in strong Drink, we beg that they may be removed from that Land, and we hope care will be taken that no loose People to settle on our Lands, without buying them. To which the Indian Commissioners replied: As to your Lands at Wepink, we shall make a Report about it, and you may depend upon amble Justice being done to you. The Indian communities represented at this first conference at Crosswicks included Cranbury [Bethel Indian Town], Crosswicks, Pompton [Munsees] and the Southern Indians, which counted a Mullis among its number. Out of these efforts came the establishment of New Jersey's only Indian reservation, Brotherton, in present-day Shamong Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. Located only twelve miles from Coaxen, this reservation was an attempt to both satisfy Indian land claims, and to transform the native people into yeoman farmers. The site of Brotherton had been claimed by Jacob Mullis (Moonis in the 1740 deed) in 1758 in a list of disputed lands claimed by native owners. In Jacob Mullis‚Äô will, recorded in 1783, he was identified as a resident of Quoickson and he bequeathed the plantation to his wife and children. The proximity of Brotherton and its association with the Moonis/Mullis family demonstrated that both parcels of land were considered as joint possession by the local Delaware Indian community, which was administered by an Indian Board of Proprietors including Jacob Mullis and his son, Charles. In letters written in 1777, the local community signs itself as the Indians of Brotherton and Weekping. The issue of communal control over both Brotherton and Coaxen, aka Weekpink, was put to severe test in 1797, when the sole remaining New Jersey Indian Commissioner, Josiah Foster (son of William Foster, appointed Indian Commissioner in 1757, gained control of the Coaxen land through the will of Charles Mullis, son of Jacob Mullis. Charles Mullis was a named recipient of this parcel through the will of his father, Jacob, dated 1783. Contested ownership In September 1797, Charles Mullis was suffering an illness which took his life on February 10, 1798. On September 9, 1797, Josiah Foster called several neighbors to witness the will of Mullis. As the ill man lay in bed, Foster sat with the man and directed the witnesses to leave the residence. Shortly thereafter, the witnesses came back in and an unidentified person took Mullis‚Äô hand and made the sign of an X on the paper. Thus was the Coaxen parcel, formerly deeded to the offspring and relatives of Osollowhen forever, seemingly transferred to Foster. Mary Calvin and Bartholomew Calvin were members of the Brotherton ruling council, and Bathsheba Mullis was the wife of Charles Mullis. For the next twenty-one years, a legal battle over ownership of Coaxen was waged in county, state and federal court. Beginning in 1806, the State of New Jersey enacted a law to establish guardianship of the property for the Coaxen Indians, to oversee the property and to ensure that any profits arising from land leases for farming and timber be paid to them. Chapter CXVIII. An Act appointing commissioners to take in charge the Coaxen lands in the county of Burlington. WHEREAS the Coaxen Indians by their petition to the legislature have represented they claim right to a tract of land in said county, of which they and their ancestors have been in possession of upwards of sixty years, and at this time from a variety of causes are entirely incapable of managing the same to the best advantage; they therefore request the legislature to pass a law appointing commissioners to take charge of and improve the same; which appearing reasonable that the prayer of the petitioners ought to be granted, Passed at Trenton March 13, 1806. The action of Foster to acquire Coaxen for himself also set off a chain of events which included the decision on the part of many remaining Delaware Indians in New Jersey to leave the state. As early as the 1760s, Delaware Indians living in the Ohio Valley urged their relations in New Jersey to move west to join the main body. In 1775, New Jersey Delaware Indian leader Isaac Stille, personally led approximately sixty New Jersey Indians to the Ohio Valley. Yet many Delawares living at Brotherton and Weekping remained, even when John Brainerd left their mission by the time of the American Revolution. It was in 1802, after Foster's taking of the Coaxen tract, that many of the remaining Delawares in New Jersey signed a petition for the dissolution of Brotherton, opening the way for about eighty of them to move to New Stockbridge, New York. In 1817, these Delaware, now resident in New York, petitioned the New Jersey legislature: Than your petitioners, impressed with a deep sense of past favors received from your Honorable Body, having always looked up to the Governor & Legislature of the State of New Jersey while resident therein, as our fathers protectors & friends, would now (although in a different State) look up to you as such, & for important reason pray, that your Honorable Body would be pleased to pass a law, authorizing Messrs. Charles Ellis, William Stockton, & Joseph Budd Esqrs. to sell our right & title to the only remaining piece of land we have in New Jersey State, formerly the life estate of Charles Moolis an Indian deceased, & usually known there by the name of the Coaxen plantation. - For as it now is, we receive no profit from said land, & in consequence of Josiah Foster's claim it may so remain, although we are fully sensible that in the line of strict justice, he has no right to any part of said lands. A legislative committee reviewing the petition found that: With respect to the interest which the petitioners are entitled to in the property, were there no adverse claims, there has been laid before the committee no satisfactory evidence. There are numerous Indians in this state claiming a participation in the property. Their claims can only be correctly determined by such rules of evidence, as the judicial tribunal which may have cognizance of the same has established in such cases. By 1805, the organized body of New Jersey Delaware Indians had relocated out of state, with only a handful of families remaining to attend to the Coaxen lands. Among the claimants to this land was the son of Chief White Eyes of the Delaware, residing in the Ohio Valley. The wife of Jacob Mullis was the sister of White Eyes, and her son sought to claim the land, unsuccessfully. The Ohio Valley was too far distant for such a claim to be enforced, and occurred at a time when frontier violence in that area effectively prevented any meaningful chance for legal redress. By 1818, Josiah Foster instituted suit in federal district court to evict the tenant on the tract who was under contract with the Coaxen Commissioners. The federal court ruled on two questions: First, did the law recognize a will as a valid instrument if one of the parties was an Indian (the NJ Prerogative Court had affirmatively ruled on this issue in 1802 but was not enforced); and 2) if the answer to the first question is yes, does the plaintiff (Foster) have a right to eject the lessee then resident on the land. In October, 1819, the federal court found in favor of the first question, and Josiah Foster was awarded possession of Coaxen. The court did not consider the circumstances of the will, which had been found by the Burlington County Surrogate Court to be spurious. Foster's motive for manipulating Charles Mullis, and arguing against any Indian claims was expressed in a letter dated August 8, 1811 when he wrote: I never intend giving up my Right to the Land in Question which I think I shall have full Paid for having under the Law of New Jersey acted as Commitioner (after the death of my father) to the Indians at Edgpillock and Coaxen for Near thirty years without fee or Reward. Religious association 1749 was the first written record of Missionary John Brainerd visiting Coaxen. His surviving journals from 1761 and 1762 contain many references to his work at the site, located approximately twelve miles from Brotherton, where he served as both minister and Indian Guardian, the latter post an appointment by the Governor Hardy of New Jersey in 1762. In 1762, he worked with the Coaxen Indians and local white residents to construct a meeting house at Coaxen, and in 1775, he made passing reference to a need for more building materials to finish the project. In 1788, while on a fund-raising tour for the Indian community at Brothertown, New York, Mohegan cleric Samsom Occom visited both Coaxen and Brotherton, and preached at both places, including the Coaxen Meeting House. In 1794, a road was laid out leading from nearby Vincentown to the Coaxen Meeting House, which is today's Church Road and Village Lane in Southampton Township, Burlington County. (Brotherton book) The meeting house was disassembled in the early 1800s and subsequently used as a church in Vincentown until the 1830s, and then moved to Red Lion for use as a school, then a barn, and finally demolished in about 1916. Present day An 1818 resurvey of the Coaxen Place, as the lands deeded in 1740 were known, amounted to two-hundred and fifty-nine acres. This parcel was eventually purchased by General William Irick and remained in the Irick family until the 1939. Portions were sold off, however the core farm remained. In 2015 it is known as the Dolan Farm, named for its present owners. Michael Dolan is a professional builder and land developer and the site is now proposed as the location of a housing subdivision. Local advocates, including botanists, paleontologists, historians and environmentalists have brought forth documentation regarding unique resources present at the site. These include the Vicentown Formation, a geologic formation in New Jersey. It preserves fossils dating back to the Paleogene period; unique flora, including Dwarf Ginseng (Panax trifolium), American Bladdernut (Staphylea trifolia), the endangered Redbud (Cercis canadensis), and Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). These plants have a role in traditional native usage. The Dolan Farm contains prime agricultural farmland and the South Branch of the Rancocas falls within the riparian rights of the State of New Jersey. A Lenape burial ground is located on the property, near the site of the former William Irick mansion. Not all the Lenape Delaware left New Jersey, and some from the out-migration to New Stockbridge returned. As George Fleming, author of the seminal book on the Brotherton Reservation wrote, ‚Äúthere may yet come to light further information about the possible descendants of the natives who may have intermarried with the early settlers or were otherwise assimilated into the White man‚Äôs world.‚Äù The Nanticoke- Lenape of Bridgeton, New Jersey, and other individuals of native ancestry remain in the area and hold Coaxen as a sacred place. As of March 2015, a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places is being prepared.

It reported 1099 confirmed members . History St. John's Lutheran Church began in 1747, with its first building a log structure built in 1768 on North Lee Street, John Lewis Beard deeded the land on September 9 of that year for the \\"Evangelical Lutheran Congregation in the township of Salisbury\\" as well as ‚Äúthe High Church of England\\" (which became the Episcopal Church) and to ‚Äúthe Reformed Calvin ministers‚Äù (Presbyterian Church). Beard had buried his daughter on the land and was concerned something could happen to the land, so he gave it to the church, and a cemetery still occupies the site today. Michael Braun, Michael More, Caspar Guenther, and Peter Reeb were listed as trustees and might be thought of as the first church council. A second building was built by St. John's and the Episcopalians. In 1857 St. John's moved to a larger location at North Main and Liberty Streets. Plans for a new building were made starting in 1923, and groundbreaking took place in 1925. The 900-seat sanctuary in the church's current location on West Innes Street had its first worship service January 2, 1927. St. John's kindergarten began in 1946. Its goal was to help children who would soon start first grade, with a Christian emphasis. The education building and chapel were added in 1967, followed by a child development center in 1999. In 2006, St. John's paid $1.5 million for property on Fulton Street that included the former K-Town Furniture, which had closed in 2005 after 33 years in a former Winn Dixie building. Five years later, the church decided to tear down that building because getting there from the main building required crossing the street, and without an expensive upgrade, its foundation could not support youth activities and contemporary worship, both of which needed more space. Renovations were planned in the building that included the sanctuary and fellowship hall, and temporary locations for some activities and programs were needed. The church also voted to buy the Woodson Law Firm building at West Council and North Church Streets. Groundbreaking for a $5.9 million youth and contemporary worship center took place February 16, 2014. The building was first used in August 2015 and dedicated September 12. Included were the Faith Center, which seated 350 and had a screen. The high school space was called Fuel, named for a service station that once stood on part of the church site. The Well for middle school youth was at the site of a well in the center of the room.

He left home to attend primary school between the ages of 9 and 12, but after only one year in secondary school, his parents were unable to continue to afford his education. They were also concerned that further study might erode his alignment with their religion. However, by supporting himself as an assistant teacher, he was able, from the age of thirteen, to continue his education, learning Latin by helping others to learn it. At the age of seven, he recalled, he was \\"deeply stirred\\" by his father's fanatical religious condemnations and sought solace in his own company wandering in the forests. Strengthened from his dreams about \\"God's ways\\", he turned to science, particularly physics and astronomy, his favourite book being Lagrange's M√©canique analytique (1788). Soon he added ethnology and philology to his range of interests. However, after providing mathematical training to a philosophical writer, he read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and consequently embraced materialism and atheism.

Early life Pinney was born on June 2, 1837 to Nancy (Johnson) and Martin Pinney in Albion, New York. He was educated in public schools and, beginning in 1854, worked for two years on an enlargement project for the Erie canal. In 1856, Pinney moved to Chicago, Illinois where he worked at a variety of jobs including clerk and mail agent on the railroad between Indiana and Joliet, Illinois. While in Chicago, Pinney began a study of law. He was admitted to the Illinois bar in late 1862. After obtaining his law license, he practice law in Wilmington, Illinois for two years before moving to Joliet. In addition to his legal practice, Pinney ran a small farm a short distance from town. After his move to Joliet, he was elected to the first of four one-year terms as City attorney in 1864. In 1876, Pinney was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as an independent. As a member of the legislature, he supported David Davis candidacy for the United States Senate. He returned to his private legal practice after his term of office. Pinney was married twice. His first marriage came in 1865 to Mary A. Lee of Albion, New York. The couple had a son, William L., before her death in 1872. His second marriage, in 1874, was to Mary E. Bowman of Shawneetown, Illinois. This union produced three children: Harry Bowman, Sidney Breese, and Nannie E. President Chester A. Arthur nominated Pinney to replace DeForest Porter as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on June 14, 1882. The nominee received senate confirmation five days later. Pinney was assigned to the second judicial district, composed on Gila, Maricopa, and Yuma County, Arizona with Pinal county being added in 1885. He lived in Phoenix and traveled to locations in other counties when his duties called for it. While officially a Republican, Pinney actively avoided allowing political considerations to influence his decisions. His political neutrality resulted in his gaining admirers from across the political spectrum. About a dozen decisions by Judge Pinney have survived. His legal writings were brief, to the point, and dealt with common problems of the day. Both Tombstone Mill and Mining Company v. The Way Up Mining Company', 1 Arizona 426 (1883), Tweed v. Lowe, 1 Arizona 288 (1884) dealt with mine ownership disputes that had developed additional legal concerns. Dowling v. Hunt, 2 Arizona 8 (1885) was an early Arizona case involving bad checks while Bremen v. Foreman, 1 Arizona 413 (1883) was concerned with the limitations of a mechanic's lien. The inauguration of President Grover Cleveland marked the end of Pinney's time on the bench. Pinney wrote to President Cleveland, saying \\"I know you do not wish to do me a wrong. Can I have a hearing?\\" DeForest Porter, who at the time was the chairman of the local bar association, wrote to protest Pinney's removal. Despite this, William Wood Porter interrupted a court session on November 9, 1885 for the purpose of replacing Justice Pinney. After leaving the bench, Pinney initially practiced law in Phoenix. He lived in California for a year before returned to Illinois and settling in Chicago. There, he established a private legal practice. After President Benjamin Harrison took office, Pinney wrote him to ask for reappointment to the Arizona bench. His application letter was marked with \\"Mugwump\\" and nothing became of his request. A similar request following the 1897 inauguration of President William McKinley also resulted in no action. Pinney returned to Arizona in 1904 and 1905 to assist in efforts to block a joint statehood proposal that would have admitted Arizona and New Mexico Territory as a single state. During the 1912 United States Presidential Election, he was a Woodrow Wilson supporter. After retiring, Pinney moved to a farm near Lawrence, Michigan. Failing health however forced his return to Chicago. During his final eight months, he was bed ridden. Pinney died in Chicago on May 13, 1921. He was buried in Chicago's Forest Home Cemetery.

Early life Porter was born September 8, 1826, in Orange County, Virginia. His parents were George C. and Susan (Wood) Porter. His father owned cotton farms in Tennessee and the family moved there when Porter was an infant. The family moved to Mississippi while Porter was still a child. After studying law, Porter was admitted to the Mississippi bar. In his later years he was described as having a fair complexion, gray hair, blue eyes, and being of medium height. His most recognizable feature was his nose \\"which was of unusual size and prominence.\\" In 1850, Porter moved to California and two years later was elected county attorney for San Joaquin County. He was appointed to fill a vacancy as Judge of Calaveras County in 1855 and was elected to a four-year term on the bench the next year. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Porter returned to Virginia and became a captain in the Confederate States Army. Initially he served as an aid to General George B. Crittenden. He served with gallantry during the battles of Mill Springs, Shiloh, and Raymond. After honorable mentions in his commander's reports, he joined General Joseph E. Johnston's staff. His service earned Porter a recommendation for promotion shortly before the war's end. Following the war, Porter went to Mexico before returning to Jackson, Mississippi, in May 1866. There he practiced law. In 1866, Porter married Elizabeth Dabney. The union produced five daughters. Porter and his family moved to Merced, California, in 1872. They lived there briefly before making a permanent home in Santa Rosa, California. President Grover Cleveland gave Porter a recess appointment as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on October 23, 1885. Among the individuals recommending him for the appointment was United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field. Porter took office on November 9. The United States Senate refused to confirm the nomination in June 1886 and Cleveland resubmitted the nomination a month later. The Senate confirmed the second bid on July 27, 1886. While Porter's nomination was being confirmed, Chief Justice John C. Shields was fighting an unsuccessful bid for his own confirmation. In October 1886, Porter wrote to Attorney General Augustus Hill Garland asking for appointment as Chief Justice if Shield did not receive confirmation. Porter employed an easily comprehended writing style for the twenty opinions he authored on the territorial court. In United States v. Tenney, 2 Arizona 127 (1886), Porter wrote a dissent involving the prosecution of Mormons under the Edmunds Act. He also tended to draw cases with alluring backgrounds. In Shaw v. County of Pima, 2 Arizona 399 (1888), a disputed election resulted in one man taking office and accepting the accompanying salary. When it was determined his opponent had actually won the election, the new-found winner sued for the pay he would have received if he had taken office at the start of his term. Porter denied the claim. Hobson v. The New Mexico and Arizona Railroad Company, 2 Arizona 171 (1886), was a case where a worker had lost both of his legs while hauling railroad ties when a drunken railroad engineer had suddenly started a locomotive. An initial award of $30,000 had been cut in half by the district court. Porter's ruling upheld the reduced payment on the theory the worker had assumed all risks involved with his employment. In Stiles v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 2 Arizona 308 (1887), a banking institution based in Tombstone sent a telegraph to its office in Tucson instructing the branch office to stop paying out funds. The telegram was delayed, resulting in the loss of funds by the bank. Porter's ruling allowed for partial recovery of the lost funds under the theory the bank's employees would not have made any payments after the telegram was received. Western Mining Company v. Toole, 2 Arizona 82 (1886) was a case involving a forged check that had been presented to a bank and been pronounced genuine by the company's bookkeeper. A $1250.97 judgment against the company was upheld as the bank had previously used the bookkeeper's expertise to validate previous checks even though the bookkeeper lacked formal authority to grant such approvals. With Porter's term set to expire in another two days, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Joseph Henry Kibbey to be his replacement on August 5, 1889. After leaving the bench, Porter remained in Phoenix and practiced law. He requested to return to the Arizona bench after the resignation of Chief Justice Henry C. Gooding in May 1893 and in September 1893 as a replacement for Richard Elihu Sloan. Several years later, Porter moved back to Santa Rosa, California. He became seriously ill in the early 1900s but recovered partially. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake troubled him greatly and was listed as a contributing factor on his death certificate. Porter died in Santa Rosa on January 17, 1909. He was buried in Santa Rosa's Rural Cemetery.

Weber is a history of the part of Mexico's north and northwest that became part of the United States after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The book examines territories on the northern frontier of Mexico, including what is now Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, in the twenty-five years after Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Weber emphasizes the role of Mexicans in the region through this period of transition, particularly before and during the Texas war of independence, as well as exploring the region as a whole while acknowledging its distinct communities. This book won the Ray Allen Billington Prize from the Organization of American Historians in 1983. It also won the Westerners International Co-Founders Book Award for best nonfiction of 1982, the 1982 history award from the Border Regional Library Association, and the Presidio La Bahia Award from the Sons of the Texas Republic. Publication The book was published in 1982 by the University of New Mexico Press, as part of the Histories of the American Frontier series.Tyler, The Mexican Frontier, 1821‚Äì1846 In the introduction, Weber notes that the book is in large part a synthesis of works published by other historians. This work was supplemented by additional primary materials which he discovered in the archives that allowed him to delve further into certain areas. Summary The Mexican Frontier examines the southwestern United States, specifically the areas now known as Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, in the twenty-five years between Mexico's independence from Spain and the beginning of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. This resulted in the transfer of control of the border areas to the United States.Henson, p. 441. In the early days of the Republic of Mexico, these areas comprised its northern border, including the territories of Alta California and Nuevo Mexico, and the province of Texas. The northern frontier developed separately from the Mexican interior, due in part to its distance from the capital in Mexico City and its relative proximity to the United States frontier and settlement by numerous English- speaking Americans. Its peoples also had to deal with dangers from increasingly hostile Indian tribes. Weber's work follows events chronologically, examining the effects of the country's frequent shifts between federalism and centralism. Although there were many similarities among the borderlands areas, they developed independently, and the book relies on analysis of individual communities. Over time, the frontier provinces drifted further from the influence of Mexico City. Weber examines the collapse of the mission system, which caused significant social disorder in California and New Mexico. The decline of the presidio system left border residents with no protection from raids by hostile Indian tribes. Most communities reluctantly raised militias to fill the gap in defense.Henson, p. 442. Mexico continued the economic policies implemented by Spain, limiting production and import opportunities. This led to high prices and scarcities throughout the border regions, and, in part, sparked local rebellions against customs duties throughout the borderlands. The book describes the success that the United States had in steadily pushing its frontier westward, and how American immigration into these Mexico border areas further weakened the relationship with the Mexican central government. Mexico chose to allow foreigners to settle in the border areas to encourage their development. The immigrants often ignored Mexican economic laws and introduced the free trade to which they were accustomed.Henson, p. 443. Analysis The book's overriding theme is that Mexican frontier was largely neglected due to distance and the government's inability to understand how it differed from the interior. The frontier areas suffered severe economic hardship, which led border residents to embrace trade with the United States. Traditionally, historians had seen the Mexican loss of territory through the lens of American manifest destiny; Weber instead posited that Mexican neglect was the primary cause for its losing this territory. Weber was one of the first historians to analyze the northern Mexican frontier as a single entity; previous works had limited focus to a single territory or province.Virgil, \\"Review\\" In a departure from other histories, Weber also concentrated on the native Mexicans, rather than recounting the adventures of the United States immigrants who arrived much later. This book was one of the first to incorporate the Tejano perspective into an analysis of the Texas Revolution. Previous works had focused exclusively on the United States-born settlers in Texas and had failed to note that they were supported by many Mexican-born citizens. His work also, for the first time, linked the revolution with the settlers' dissatisfaction with the extremely unstable state of Mexican politics during that era.de la Teja (2013), p. 271. Reception The book was well received. In his review, historian Daniel Tyler noted that the book was \\"well-paced\\" and \\"established an excellent base for the study of this and other frontiers.\\" Margaret Swett Henson lauded the book for its \\"felicitous writing style\\", which she felt would be well received by scholars and the general public. Tyler pointed out Weber neglected to examine the lives of the Indians in the region. Ralph Vigil likewise criticized some of Weber's interpretations, including his categorization of peyote as a \\"'traditional' drug\\" and his classification of Jose Santos Gonzales as an Indian. Historian Jesus de la Teja in 2013 described The Mexican Frontier as \\"the seminal study that confirmed Weber's status as the leading representative of a new kind of borderlands history\\",de la Teja (2013), p. 270. and described it as \\"a game changer in the field of the history of the Southwest\\".de la Teja (2013), p. 267. The book was translated into Spanish and published in Mexico and Spain. As of 2013, it was still in print. The book won the Ray Allen Billington Prize from the Organization of American Historians in 1983, the Westerners International Co- Founders Book Award for best nonfiction of 1982, the 1982 history Award from the Border Regional Library Association, and the Presidio La Bahia Award from the Sons of the Texas Republic.

Garibaldi, however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war. Cavour's envoy, Giuseppe La Farina, was arrested and expelled from the island. He was replaced by the more malleable Agostino Depretis, who gained Garibaldi's trust and was appointed as pro-dictator.Agostino Depretis in Dizionario Biografico ‚Äì Treccani The dictatorial government ended November 4, 1860, when the annexation of the Kingdom of Italy was ratified by the popular plebiscite of October 21.

The game is part of the Xanadu series, and was developed out of Nihon Falcom's desire to create a game of a different type and setting than their other role- playing game franchises, The Legend of Heroes and Ys. The game was first released in Japan for the PlayStation Vita in September 2015, and worldwide in June 2017. An enhanced version of the game, Tokyo Xanadu eX+, was released in Japan for the PlayStation 4 in September 2016, and worldwide in December 2017, in addition to a Microsoft Windows version. Gameplay It is an action role- playing game with party-based real-time combat that features dungeon exploration, similar to the Persona series by Atlus, as well as Falcom's own Ys and Trails of Cold Steel franchises. Plot In an alternate reality, Tokyo was hit by a huge earthquake in 2005 that the city took 10 years to recover from. In 2015, Kou Tokisaka is a high school student who lives in Morimiya on the outskirts of Tokyo. He lives alone and has some part time jobs. One day after work, late at night, he sees his classmate Asuka Hiiragi is around some bad company. Kou follows them to a back alley. When he tries to get in between them, he is sucked into a vortex that brings him to the nightmare realm Eclipse. Afterwards Asuka explains to Kou she is a member of Nemesis, a group that tries to close the Eclipse vortexes for good. Development The developers took inspiration from real-world locations within Tokyo, such as the game's station plaza being modeled after the north exit of Tachikawa Station. Nihon Falcom announced the game on December 17, 2014. The company referred to the game as an \\"urban myth action rpg\\". They also emphasized that they wanted to create a game with a different feel than their other role-playing game franchises, such as the Ys, The Legend of Heroes, and Trails series. While being based on the Xanadu series, which includes Xanadu (1985) and Xanadu Next (2005), Falcom set out to create a game with a different feel than their other fantasy-based role-playing game franchises, with the game taking place in a fictional district of modern-day Tokyo called Morimiya City, incorporating the use of elements not seen in their other series, such as smartphones. Morimiya was based on actual locations near Nihon Falcom's head offices in Tachikawa. For example, the Morimiya Station Plaza, with its red arch monument, closely resembles the north exit of Tachikawa Station, which has a similar-looking blue arch monument. Falcom held promotional activities at various real-world locations in Tachikawa, including a Tokyo Xanadu-themed menu at the cafe in Books Orion, an actual Japanese bookstore chain with a location in Tachikawa that appears in-game. The game released for the PlayStation Vita in Japan on September 30, 2015. An English version of the game was not announced for almost a year after its initial Japanese release, leaving the game's fate in the West uncertain at the time. Journalists had considered it as a likely candidate for game localization by Xseed Games, due to their close relationship with Falcom from localizing entries in their Ys and Trails games. Other journalists mistook the Xanadu related trademark leaked in January 2015 as a sign of it being translated by XSeed, though this was actually in reference to Xanadu Next. USGamer described the game's chances of being localized as \\"extremely strong\\". An enhanced version of the game for the PlayStation 4, Tokyo Xanadu eX+, released in Japan on September 8, 2016. The PS4 version contains improved graphical fidelity and an improved frame rate, as well as additional story content in the form of extra side-stories and post-game content. It was released in Japan on September 8, 2016. In July 2016, Aksys Games announced that they would be localizing the Vita version of the game in English, which was later announced to be on June 30, 2017.https://www.destructoid.com/aksys- localizing-falcom-s-tokyo-xanadu-for-ps-vita-pc-372899.phtml Additionally, they contracted United Kingdom games publisher Ghostlight to help port eX+ to Microsoft Windows, where it was released on December 8, 2017. Reception Famitsu gave the game a review score of 32/40. The game sold a total of 88,879 retail copies within its first week of release in Japan, topping the software sales charts for that particular week, with over 112,000 being sold within three weeks.

It is located on the road between Huelgoat and Loqueffret. The parish close () contains the chapel of Saint-Herbot,, Chapelle Saint-Herbot the calvary, Calvaire and a small ossuary. History The chapel has no transept and is rectangular in shape with five traverses with aisles and a flat chevet. Sponsorship from Anne de Bretagne was behind the addition of the south porch in 1498-1509 and the bell-tower porch on the western side. This sponsorship also funded the building of the neighboring chapel of Sainte-Barbe. The Saint Herbot chapel was enlarged in 1545, the chevet wall was rebuilt in around 1550 and the ossuary added in 1558 and many other changes were made in the succeeding years. There is a gisant In the chapel dedicated to Saint Herbot. The chapel was built in around 1389 on the site where St Herbot had his hermitage and where he is thought to have been buried. It had served as a priory but the original building was destroyed during the French wars of succession and a replacement was constructed in the 14th century. The architectural style is Flamboyant Gothic and the chapel has many treasures including a superb stained glass window depicting the passion which dates to 1566 and two other windows one of which depicts St Yves. A stairway leading to the door on the north side of the church dates to the 14th century and the porch on the northern side is 16th-century. The chapel has a 30 metre high bell-tower, erected in the 15th century, rather too large in fact for the building. This tower was said to have been inspired by Quimper cathedral. A domed turret was added to the tower in 1697. Inside the church the choir is separated from the main body of the church by an oak railing topped by a \\"poutre de gloire\\" (\\"Rood screen\\") and on each side of the door in this railing is a granite table on which farm workers were able to put tuffs of hair from their cattle as offerings to Saint Herbot (see later note). Near the chapel are the ruins of an 18th-century fountain, there is a small ossuary built in the renaissance style attached to the church and the calvary which dates to 1575 and stands in the middle of a \\"plac√Ætre\\" (an area of grass) just by the chapel. The chapel's south porch is magnificent. The chapel holds statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Herbot and in various niches Saint Corentin, Saint S√©bastien, Saint Roch and a 16th- century Piet√†. Description of the Calvary All the Calvary's sculptures are grouped at the top of the cross' shaft. After the black death outbreaks of the 15th and 17th century, depictions of \\"bubons\\" were added to the shafts of the three crosses to ward off this dreadful disease. Bubons were the boil like sores which were one of the symptoms of the plague. The calvary dates to 1575 and is inscribed \\"Cest croix fut faicte l'an 1575 Mathieu Cravec PG\\". It bears the coats of arms of Kerlech Chastel and of Rusquec. The Calvary from the western side The calvary at Saint-Herbot chapel viewed from the western side Above the crucified Jesus we see a small angel who will carry off his soul and other angels collecting the blood from his wounds including those in his side. We see the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist's statues and the two robbers on their crosses. At the foot of the crucifixion cross, two angels stand placing a chalice on the head on a small figure. This figure is thought to represent Adam added to represent the human race and being the first to benefit from the shedding of Jesus' blood. Below is the resurrected Christ. We can see the wounds on his hands. On either side of him are angels and another two winged angels are seen below the figures of the Virgin Mary and Saint John. Beneath the \\"good\\" robber is another angel whilst beneath the \\"bad robber\\" is a demonic figure who has the head of another demon between his legs. The Calvary from the eastern side The Calvary from the eastern side The reverse or eastern side of the Calvary has a depiction of Saint Herbot on the central cross. He holds an open book and a pastoral staff. Beneath Saint Herbot is a piet√† and above him is an angel, her hands spread open. Below the piet√† is St Veronica between two angels. She wears a nun's whimple and is holding her veil bearing the image of Jesus' face. The angels hold some of the instruments of the Passion. One holds a hammer and the other a whip. Both hold nails. The Virgin Mary has one hand on the place where Jesus' side had been pierced by a lance during the crucifixion and bizarrely an animal, possibly a dog, appears to be licking Jesus' hand. The Virgin Mary has John the Evangelist on one side and Mary Magdalene on the other.. The south porch View of the south porch. Above the porch entrance voussoirs feature angels and the prophets including John the Baptist The arched porch, added between 1498 and 1509, is decorated with voussures depicting angels and saints. There are three voussoirs on the porch's entrance and two on the inner door leading into the chapel. Above the porch entrance is a sculpture depicting the Holy Father who is giving a blessing with his right hand and holding a terrestrial globe in his left hand. Two small angels are placed on either side of him. Then on each side of the entrance are sculptures of two further angels. They appear to be floating in the air. There are in fact twenty-six angels and sixteen saints depicted in the voussoirs. John the Baptist is one of the saints depicted. He carries a lamb in his arms and is dressed in an animal skin. Inside the porch are twelve statues depicting the apostles, each placed in elaborately decorated gothic niches. Each apostle wears a banderole on which is written the part of the credo associated with them. These statues lead to the entrance door to the church and over this door is a sculpture depicting Saint Herbot, inscribed with the date \\"1581\\". He carries an open book thus introducing the theme of evangelism, a theme repeated throughout the chapel.

The chancel also holds a frieze of panels separated by caryatids representing the twelve Sibyls and the twelve apostles. On either side of the chancel entrance which leads on to the choir are two granite tables on which worshippers could deposit their offerings to Saint Herbot (often tuffs of hair from their cattle). The choir itself has fifteen stalls dating from 1550 to 1570 each with misericords. These misericords have their own unique carvings. The sacristy dates to the 18th century. The chancel and rood screen The chancel. The oak rood screen separating the choir from the rest of the church. On the top of the screen is a depiction of the crucifixion The 16th-century chancel separates the choir from the rest of the church. The space inside the chancel is reserved for the clergy and that outside the chancel for the congregation. On each side of the entrance to the chancel are stone tables on which the congregation could place their offerings. Above the chancel grill is an inscription dating to 1659 with a verse from the Book of Jeremiah reading There is a decorated frieze on the outside of the choir and on the part of the frieze looking on to the nave are panels depicting the apostles presided over by Saint Herbot holding a baton and a book. The panels, from left to right, start with a depiction of St Peter with key, Andrew the Apostle and his cross, John the Evangelist with a chalice, and James the Greater with a hat and a stick. The two panels over the chancel entrance are larger than the others and in between them is a depiction of Saint Herbot on a dais. These larger panels hold two images, the first of Thomas the Apostle with a set-square and Philip the Apostle with a Latin cross and the second Bartholomew the Apostle with a knife and Matthew the Evangelist with a lance. The last four panels depict James the Lesser with a St Laurent's stick, Simon the Apostle with a saw, Matthew the Evangelist with a book and halberd and Judas Iscariot with an √©p√©e. Further panels include images of people playing the harp and viola or holding an anchor and another crossing water. On top of the rood screen is a depiction of the crucifixion. Jesus Christ is surrounded by the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist and below them are heaps of bones scattered on the ground to remind us of Golgotha. Mary Magdalene is shown kneeling, her arms around the base of the cross. Two angels are shown collecting the blood from Jesus' wounds. The good robber hangs from his cross looking towards Jesus whilst the bad robber is turning his head away. A pelican is added to the composition to remind the congregation that Jesus was sacrificed to save the human race. There are 15 oak stalls around the chancel. Each is decorated and has a misericord. They date from between 1550 and 1570. One of the fifteen stalls in the St Herbot chapel Stained glass The choir window and the window dedicated to St Yves both date to 1556 and are attributed to the Morlaix workshop of Thomas Qu√©m√©ner. The choir window includes the coats of arms of many local families and dignitaries. The windows were restored in 1716 by Claude Le Roux and in 1886 by Huchet et fils of Le Mans.

According to legend, he owned two white cows who had supernatural strength and enabled him to work at a miraculous rate. When he died he left the two cows to the local farm workers on condition that every evening they brought them to his tomb. The workers failed to follow his instruction and the two cows disappeared!

P Abdul Rahman) is a social worker, writer, orator and retired teacher living in the South Indian state of Kerala.  Early life  Rahman was born on 8 November 1950 in Kookkanam, a tiny hamlet of the Karivellur-Peralam Grama Panchayat in Kannur district. After receiving primary education at Olattu Aided Upper Primary School, he went on to study at Government High School at Karivellur (currently known as A.V. Smaraka Government Higher Secondary School), Government College at Kasaragod, Sree Narayana Teachers‚Äô Training Institute at Nileshwaram and Government Training College at Thalassery.  Teaching career  He began his career as a teacher at North Upper Primary School in Karivellur on 3 August 1970. Later, he served at Government Upper Primary School at Panappuzha (Kannur district), Government Lower Primary School at Mavila Kadappuram (Kasargod district), Government Upper Primary School at Padanna (Kasargod district), Government Fisheries High School at Cheruvathur (Kasargod district), Government High School at Kuttamath (Kasargod district) and Government High School at Pilicode (Kasargod district). In between, he worked as the Kasargod District Co- ordinator of the Total Literacy Campaign in 1990 that made Kerala the first Indian State to achieve 100 per cent literacy, Project Officer during the second phase of the literacy campaign, District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) trainer and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme officer in his 36-year long career.  Social service  It was in 1978 that Rahman became active in social service when he came up with a novel initiative to conduct night classes for the working class youth who could not continue formal education owing to their poor financial background. The night class helped the youngsters, who worked either as Beedi rollers or weavers during the day to earn a living, earn formal education and pass the Grade 7 and Grade 10 examinations. The first batch saw 23 students clearing the Grade 10 examination. The initiative continued till 1985, helping approximately 200 youngsters attain formal education. The concept created ripples in Kerala, even as many students went on to achieve higher educational qualifications. Many of the successful students are now working various central and state government departments. Inspired by the activities of P.N. Panicker, P.T. Bhaskara Panicker and K. Sivadasan Pillai, three prominent social workers in Kerala, Rahman became active functionary of Kerala Association for Non-Formal Education and Development (KANFED), a voluntary organisation that spearheaded literacy and library movements in Kerala. He led the organisation‚Äôs activities in Kannur and Kasargod districts. During this period, he successfully coordinated the ‚ÄòThree-month Literacy Programme‚Äô in Kinanur-Karindalam Panchayath and the Health and Education drive in the tribal hamlet of Badiyadukka. He launched People‚Äôs Association for Non Formal Training and Education (PANTECH) in 1996 with an aim to help unemployed youth to acquire technical skills in an informal way and earn a living. The organisation, based in Kasargod district, has been organising training in more than 40 vocational trades and helped more than 5,000 people to earn a living. Now, PANTECH volunteers work among the sex workers as part of Kerala State Aids Control Society‚Äôs Suraksha Project. The organisation also associates with Childline besides implementing a project for the migrant labourers. Rahman is a columnist with leading evening dailies in Kasargod district, including Latest, Karaval and KVartha. He also contributes articles for leading newspapers in Kerala, including Deshabhimani and Madhyamam.  Office-bearer  Rahman is currently the chairman of KANFED Social Forum and General Secretary of PANTECH.

She was given several awards for her support of arts and film in Chicago. Early life and education Sexton grew up in Queens, New York, and dealt with poverty at a young age. Her father died when she was four years old. Sexton stated that, \\"[When I was] 6, my mom said, 'You're old enough to take care of yourself.\\" Brenda Sexton began working at the age of eight, and by the time she was ten, she had her own bank account. She was the only one of her four siblings to finish high school.

In 2003, she was appointed to the position of managing director of the Illinois Film Office by Rod Blagojevich. Many people were skeptical of this decision, because Sexton did not have a strong background in the film business. Also, her ex-husband was a generous contributor to Blagojevich, donating $260,000 to his 2002 campaign. He recommended Sexton to Blagojevich. Before she took office, filmmakers were only spending $25 million in Illinois. Sexton was able to get major films to shoot in Chicago including, Ocean's Twelve, The Dark Knight, The Weatherman, and The Ice Harvest. Over one year, film-related revenues boosted to $62 million, a 147 percent increase. During her time in this position Sexton passed a tax credit bill that increased movie production in Chicago. This also created 15,000 jobs for crew and actors. In 2005, an estimated $90 million in revenue was expected thanks to several projects that were shot in Chicago including, The Break-Up and Prison Break. In 2007, she started the Chicago Link Productions LLC. The group arranges private screenings and movie-related events in Chicago, Sundance, and Los Angeles.

He qualified as an engineer and built a successful business career and property portfolio before retiring at the age of 50. He took over as chairman of Port Vale in 2013, having been a key figure in the boardroom as the club secured promotion out of League Two in 2012‚Äì13. He resigned as chairman following relegation back to League Two in 2016‚Äì17. He bought the Liberty Way stadium off Nuneaton Town in July 2018 and sold Port Vale in May 2019. Early life Smurthwaite was raised in Radford, Coventry, and bought his own home in the area at the age of 17 after receiving compensation from an industrial accident at Dunlop in 1977. He qualified as an engineer and inherited an engineering firm in Holbrooks at the age of 21 from a friend who was a \\"father figure\\" to him. He sold the business two years later and moved to Nottingham, where he bought a chain of estate agents that he later sold on to the Halifax. He went on to invest in dozens of properties and retired at the age of 50. His father and family are from the Sunderland area; he owned a business in the North East between 1999 and 2007 and was a season ticket holder at Sunderland for seven seasons. Ownership of Port Vale Smurthwaite was part of the investment group, led by Paul Wildes, that took Port Vale out of administration in November 2012. After promotion from League Two to League One was secured, Smurthwaite said that \\"I've never had any hobbies to speak of, but buying Port Vale has given me a passion. The club has reinvigorated me ‚Äì it has saved me really, given me a new purpose.\\" On 18 May, Paul Wildes made a shock decision to resign as chairman and sell his 50% stake to Smurthwaite, who became the club's chairman and sole owner; Wildes stated that \\"From many conversations with Norman, it's clear we have conflicting ideas on how to take Vale forward\\". It was revealed that Smurthwaite had funded the initial takeover, and that the pair had a disagreement following defeat to Bristol Rovers in March, with Smurthwaite insisting on a more public approach to take pressure off the manager and players. The Football League assigned Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston as his mentor. In October 2013 Smurthwaite controversially banned local newspaper The Sentinel from all press events after taking objection with the newspaper's reporting a lengthy delay in producing specially presented third-kit shirts to fans who had pre-paid for the items in May. Smurthwaite responded by stating that the newspaper had been banned for contacting him personally for comment on the story rather than the club's media team, and that he was also frustrated with a Sentinel reporter for attempting to report facts which Smurthwaite had disclosed to the journalist \\"in confidence\\". More worry came in December, when The Sunday People revealed that Smurthwaite had e-mailed agents pleading poverty over the club's finances. He later issued a statement saying that the wage bill budget set by the club in the summer was over- ambitious and that he had been forced to meet the ¬£1 million budget deficit out of his own pocket. The concern in January was over the future of manager Micky Adams, and the apparent reluctance of Smurthwaite to offer a contract despite the positive results on the field as the manager's contract came close to its expiry at the end of the season; once a contract was promised Adams stated that \\"He has talked about it, now he has to deliver. I have never expressed a desire to leave. If everything is right I don't see there being a problem, but once again Norman is talking about things instead of doing things.\\" PVFC Limited, the club's holding company, was hit with a winding-up order by HM Revenue and Customs in July 2014; Smurthwaite insisted this would not affect the club and that a funding error caused the problem and expected the order to be withdrawn. Smurthwaite continued to effect changes at the club, controversially axing the system of door-to-door lottery collectors and banishing the Port Vale Community Trust out of Vale Park. Smurthwaite invested ¬£500,000 into the playing budget in order to help Micky Adams strengthen the squad. Despite not wanting him to resign, once Adams left the club Smurthwaite initiated a policy of experimenting with young players in the hope of turning a profit from player sales in the future. He appointed Adams's former assistant Rob Page as first team manager in October. He later claimed that he had considered appointing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as manager, but decided against it partly because he believed that a racist minority of the club's supporters would make appointing a black manager a bad idea. Smurthwaite caused controversy by telling a reporter that supporters who only attended away matches (due partly to Vale Park's high ticket costs) \\"disgusted\\" him and that they should \\"go and support another club\\". In February, the home game with Doncaster Rovers was put into doubt after Smurthwaite refused to pay extra policing costs that Staffordshire Police had demanded following intelligence that there would be troublemakers instigating violence at the game. Smurthwaite denied Staffordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Ellis's claim that Smurthwaite threatened to close the club down during the dispute, but retracted his threat to bar police officers from entering the ground during the match. He further had to deny claims that he was picking the team, stating that first team matters were purely down to Rob Page. In April 2015 an email from his account was sent to a group of supporters stating that he wished to sell the club, though he denied sending the email, claiming that he had been hacked. Smurthwaite was rumoured to have planned to sack Page live on BT Sport if the club lost an FA Cup First Round replay to Maidenhead United, though he dismissed the rumour as untrue. There was controversy however following the club's defeat to mid-table League Two side Exeter City in the Second Round on 6 December 2015, after which Smurthwaite stated he felt \\"humiliated, ashamed and embarrassed\\" and said that plans to sign a striker in the January transfer window would be scrapped. The following day he officially put the club up for sale. He set an asking price of ¬£4.25 million, stating \\"I have never lost money on a transaction in my adult life and I am not starting now\\". He continued to reveal that he had been physically assaulted by three Vale supporters in April 2014, though Staffordshire Police could find no record of Smurthwaite's complaint. He also admitted that he had been planning on buying Torquay United before being told by the Football League that he would not be allowed to own two clubs. He was also criticised by Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion organisation, after admitting that he had denied Hasselbaink the opportunity of being Port Vale manager due to his concern that a black manager would be abused by some supporters. Some of the club's biggest name players rejected new contract offers and left Port Vale after Northampton Town paid compensation to Port Vale to sign Page as manager in May 2016; Smurthwaite claimed that he purposely set a low wage budget so as to drive Page and the players out of the club, thereby leaving room in the 2016‚Äì17 budget for a new manager to sign his own players. Smurthwaite renewed his dispute with The Sentinel by banning the newspaper from attending the club's press conference where the successor to Page was named. Upon appointing Portuguese manager Bruno Ribeiro, the club's first manager from outside Britain, Smurthwaite stated that: \\"It has been a long, extensive process but I'm absolutely certain we have the right man for the job.\\" Smurthwaite then improved the club's budget to allow over ten new, mostly foreign, signings, and stated that he expected Vale to be challenging for the top six and warned his staff that he would enact \\"plan B\\" if the club were not in the top six by Christmas. With Vale occupying 17th-place at Christmas, Smurthwaite declared that 'Plan B' had been triggered, meaning the signing of \\"seasoned, higher grade\\" players, whilst he admitted he felt \\"a little bit hoodwinked\\" as Ribeiro's friends in the game (Jos√© Mourinho, Aitor Karanka, and Carlos Carvalhal) had provided him with glowing references but had thus far failed to lend any of their players to the Vale. Ribeiro resigned as manager of Port Vale on 26 December, hours after witnessing his side lose 1‚Äì0 at home to Walsall; Smurthwaite put Michael Brown in temporary charge. He also installed Colin Garlick as the club's CEO, and in January stated that \\"I'm only really involved now when it comes to prising open the sweetie jar for the money\\". Two months later, Smurthwaite used the OneValeFan fansite to ask supporters to vote whether he should sell the club to one of two hedge funds that he said had met his asking price for the club. He later issued a statement to apologize for his decision to appoint Ribeiro and expressed regret with his own attempts to communicate with fans and \\"keyboard warriors\\" over social media. Brown remained as caretaker-manager for the rest of the season, but was unable to save the club from relegation back into League Two. Smurthwaite issued a statement on 2 May apologising for relegation, and stated that he would be stepping down as chairman and would no longer attend games as he looked to sell the club. Three days later he received a bid of ¬£1.25 million for the club, matching his original purchase price in 2012. A rival consortium also offered the same figure, but Smurthwaite rejected both offers. With Port Vale lying bottom of the English Football League, Smurthwaite sacked Brown on 16 September and claimed that he had been against giving Brown the job on a permanent basis in the summer but left the decision to Chief Executive Colin Garlick. Smurthwaite appointed Neil Aspin as the club's new manager on 4 October, and also brought in John Rudge in an advisory role. Aspin steered the club away from relegation by the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, and in June 2018 Smurthwaite revealed that he had rejected another offer to buy the club from an unnamed bidder. He bought the Liberty Way stadium off Nuneaton Town in July 2018 after the club entered financial difficulties. He returned formally to the role of Port Vale chairman the following month. He was hospitalised after being struck by a car whilst walking outside Vale Park on 25 January 2019. Aspin resigned five days later following a run of poor results. On 31 January 2019, Smurthwaite blamed \\"logistical challenges\\" for the deal to bring back former top-scorer Marc Richards breaking down; the club instead signed four youngsters despite having no manager. As the transfer window was closing, the Port Vale Supporters' Club unanimously gave a vote of no confidence in Smurthwaite and elected to begin formal protests against his ownership. During this time the club was serving players unsold pies from matchdays in order to save money. Smurthwaite went on to issue a statement to condemn \\"disgraceful abuse\\" he had received and to urge supporters to not to use \\"inappropriate language\\" during protests and to consider the effect of protests on the club and the players; he stated that he was only involved in \\"major\\" decisions at the club and left day-to-day decisions to CEO Colin Garlick. He went on to name John Askey as the club's new manager on 4 February. On 1 March, Synectics Solutions owners Carol and Kevin Shanahan revealed that Smurthwaite had rejected their improved offer of ¬£3.5 million for the club. When the couple told Smurthwaite they were planning to go public about their offer he texted them to say \\"sorry not interested. now please get back to your day job and continue the sterling work in the community.\\" He went on to claim that fans protests against him had cost the club a ¬£500,000 stadium sponsorship deal, that he had never received a \\"formal offer\\" for the club and that he would put the club into administration if no new owner was in place by 5 May. The sale of both the club and the ground to the Shanahan's was confirmed on 7 May, ending Smurthwaite's seven year reign. Later life Smurthwaite was reported to have made a bid for National League club Notts County in June 2019, but denied having done so. Two months later he was reported to have launched an unsuccessful bid to purchase crisis-hit club Bury. He enquired for a move for Wigan Athletic, a club in administration, in September 2020, but pulled out after judging it to be too big of a risk and seeing a negative reaction from fans.

PGI Management is the international branch of SAETDE/Grandvalira.  History  PGI Management began on 1 December 1957,\\"Ara fa 51 anys, al Pas de la Casa. with the official opening of the first ski lift in Pas de la Casa, in Andorra, near the border with France. The previous summer, PGI's founder Francesc Viladomat had begun to work on establishing the company Teleesqu√≠s Viladomat. From 1957 to 1967, the ski resort growth created by Mr. Viladomat was incorporating state-of-the art facilities in Pas de la Casa. On 22 November 1967, SAETDE (Societat An√≤nima d‚ÄôEquipament Tur√≠stic-Esportiu de la Parr√≤quia d‚ÄôEmcamp) was incorporated and began to run two ski lifts, Escola and Font Negre. On August 14, Francesc Viladomat and the Com√∫ of Encamp signed an agreement to merge the two firms. From 1967 to 2004, Pas de la Casa's Grau Roig developed more new facilities, including detachable 6-seat chair lifts, Funicamp (a 6.137 metre cable car), restaurants, FIS Stadium etc., converting the ski resort into one of the biggest in the Pyrenees. On October 2003, the new skiing domain of Grandvalira\\"Grandvalira Cumple 10 A√±os Liderando El Mercado De Los Pirineos \\"Turiski. Published 16 October 2013. became public as result of a commercial merger between Pas de la Casa-Grau Roig and Soldeu-el Tarter. In 2005, Joan Viladomat founded PGI Management to promote, advise on, and manage, ski and mountain projects. With PGI Management, Grandvalira/SAETDE leverages all knowledge acquired over 50 years.

genetically manipulated to develop a mammary tumor leading to distant focal lesions of mammary epithelium created by metastasis. Mammary cancers in mice can be caused by genetic mutations that have been identified in human cancer. This means models can be generated based upon molecular lesions consistent with the human disease. Breast cancer metastasis Metastasis is a process of migration of tumour cells from the primary cancer site to a distant location where the cancer cells form secondary tumors. Metastatic breast cancer represents the most devastating attribute of cancer and it is considered an advanced-stage event. Human breast cancer metastasizes to multiple distant organs such as the brain, lungs, bones and liver. =Genetic diversity between primary and metastatic tumor= The classical theory developed in the early 70's anticipated that metastasis is due to genetically determined subpopulations in primary tumours. The genetic variance between metastatic foci is significant for only particular locus and within specific cell populations or only one-cell population shows differences and some loci are divergent only in one cell subpopulation. This explains the concept of tumour heterogeneity and the order of genetic events during tumor evolution. Many of the genes driving the growth at primary site can determine the dissemination and colonization at the ectopic site. Breast cancer is consensually considered genetically and clinically as a heterogeneous disease, in that it reflects the heterogeneity of the normal breast tissue at its origin17873350. A number of discrete genetic events have to occur in order to enable individual tumor cells that have the capacity to grow at an ectopic site. The metastatic progression depends on the regulation of developmental programs and environmental events. The metastatic potential of sub populations within mouse mammary cells is now considered as relatively an early event and dissemination occurs at the same time of pre invasive or micro-invasive lesions. The genetic profiles of primary and metastatic lesions in breast carcinomas show a large extent of clonal pertinence between lesions. There are various patterns of prevalence of genetic mutations in the genomes of primary breast tumour and its metastases. It also confirms the genetic heterogeneity between the primary neoplasm of breast cancer patients and their respective metastases. =Genes involved in organ specific metastasis= Breast cancer phenotypes periodically express genes in metastasis that are indispensable for the metastatic process. Metastatic diversity is mediated by the activation of genes that act as coupling to organ-specific growth. The growth of lesions at the ectopic site depends on multiple complex interactions between metastatic cells and host homeostatic mechanisms. Lethal protein-protein interactions at the metastatic site aid the survival of adapted cells. Generating mouse models of breast cancer Targeted expression of oncogenes in mouse mammary epithelial cells is a way of modeling human breast cancer. Mutation or over expression of oncogenes can be kept under controlled expression in a very specific cellular context rather than throughout the organism. Another way to model human breast cancer is done through the targeted inhibition of a tumor suppressor gene.Gupta, PB; Kuperwasser, C. (2004). Disease models of breast cancer. Drug Discovery Today: Disease Models 1(1), 9-16. doi: 10.1016/j.ddmod.2004.05.001 =Mice in genetic research= * In 1909, Clarence C. Little developed the first inbred strain, the DBA (Dilute, brown non- Agouti) mouse. * In 1915, N.M Haldane identified first linkage in mouse between Albino mice and pink eye dilution on chromosome seven. * In 1921, C57BL became one of the most widely used mice in genetics and was the first strain to have its genome sequenced. * In 1982, Palmiter and Brinster implanted a foreign gene into fertilized egg, finally generating the first transgenic mice genetically engineered to express dominant oncogenes. * In 1982, the stimulation of expression from the MMTV-LTR (Mouse mammary tumor virus-Long terminal repeat) was done by multiple rounds of pregnancy and lactation to evaluate the relevance of a cellular proto-oncogene, c-myc. =Human and mouse: a genomic comparison= Genetic studies of common diseases in humans suffer significant limitations for practical and ethical reasons. Human cell lines can be used to model disease but it is difficult to study processes at the tissue level, within an organ or across the entire body. Mice can be a good representation of diseases in humans because:. * There are close similarities of physiology, development and cell biology between mice and humans. * Humans and mice both have around 30,000 protein-coding genes. The number of mouse genes without a corresponding human homologue is less than 1%. * 90% of the human and mouse genomes are syntenic. * 40% of both human and mouse genomes can be aligned at the nucleotide level. * Mice have relatively short gestation periods. * Mice take a brief time to reach sexual maturity. * Mice have large litter sizes. * The availability of hundreds of mutations affecting almost every tissue and aspect of development. Mice may not be an ideal model for breast cancer. This is mainly due to the lack of precision in many of the models. When looking at metastasis, it is difficult to determine the precise location as well as its frequency. Another issue revolves around the epithelial sub types and the inability to specifically target them when targeting a mutation. An example of this would be determining the development of tumors in K14-Cre BRCA2 mice. In a standard case, the excision of BRCA2 resulted in no tumorgenesis, but if p53 was mutated and inactivated, tumorgenesis would occur. Therefore, there is not a definitive answer in terms of the origin of the tumor, due to the extra mutation in p53.Wagner, KW. (2003). Models of Breast Cancer: quo vadis, animal modeling?

Nature. doi:10.1038/nature25465 =Simple tumor transplantation models= Transplantation of tumor cells into immunodeficient mice is a tool to study breast cancer and its metastatic effects. The transplantation occurs as either allotransplants or xenographic transplants. Commonly, human cells are inoculated in an immunocompromised murine recipient. Inoculating cells through intra ductal transplantations, by cleared mammary fat pad injections or by transplantations into the tail vein. Different organs can be seeded with breast cancer cells depending on the route of injection * Cardiac injection: Bone * Tail vein injection: Lung * Splenic injection: Liver * Carotid artery Injection: Brain = Tumor tissue transplant models = The specific immunodeficient mice that were used were the NOD/SCID mouse (non-obese diabetic/severe conditional immunodeficient). These mutations allow for the integration of new xenograft tissue. The mouse must first have their mammary fat pads humanized by injecting human telemorase-immortalized human mammary stromal fibroblasts(RMF/EG fibroblasts) into the mammary fat pads. Without this injection, the human mammary epithelial cells en-grafted onto the pad are unable to colonize and grow. The RMF/EG fibroblast must then be irradiated to allow the expression of key proteins and growth factors. After 4 weeks of development, the newly en-grafted human mammary epithelial cells expanded within the fat pad.Kuperwasser, C; Chavarria, T; Wu, M; Magrane, G; Gray, JW; Carey, L; Richardson, A; Weinberg, RA. (2004). Reconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissue in mice. Pnas 101(14), 4966-4971. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0401064101 =Genetically engineered mice to study metastasis= Genetically engineered mice are constructed to model human phenotypes and pathologies. Mutant mice may include transgenes using different delivery methods: * The use of bacteria-derived tetracycline-inducible system permitting the switching on or off (Tet-On/Tet-Off system) * Targeted mutations by knock in gene and knock out sequence by using Cre-Lox recombination system * Introduction of retro viral mutations * Introduction of chemically induced mutations Transgenic mouse models of breast cancer The mice undergoing the process of transgenesis are known as transgenic mice. A basic transgene has a promoter region, Protein coding sequence, Intron and a stop codon. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), is a retro virus that has been a known promoter to cause breast tumors once activated. MMTV is a heritable somatic mutagen whose target range is limited. It harbors a regulatory DNA sequence called the long terminal repeat (LTR), which promotes steroid- hormone-inducible transcription. Tumorgenesis that was induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus can also be done by integration of the viral genome. The sites of integration have been known to be critical genes for cellular regulation.Ross, RS. (2010). Mouse mammary tumor virus molecular biology and oncogenesis. Viruses 2(9), 2000-2012. doi: 10.3390/v2092000 Whey acidic protein (WAP), is another common promoter used to generate mouse mammary cancer models. For a list of other mammary gland specific promoters and mouse models see. Schematic representation of breast cancer metastatic study models MMTV-PyMT MMTV-PyMT is the model of breast cancer metastasis, in which MMTV-LTR is used to drive the expression of mammary gland specific polyomavirus middle T-antigen, leading to a rapid development of highly metastatic tumors. MMTV-PyMT is the most commonly used model for the study of mammary tumor progression and metastasis. MMTV-PyMT mice are then crossed bred with other genetically modified mice to generate various types of breast cancer models, including: * PI3K/Akt signalling in metastasis can be demonstrated in MMTV-PyMT; Akt1‚àí/‚àí mice. * Chemoattractive paracrine loop of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and EGF ligands between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells, and the lung metastasis can be studied by crossing MMTV-PyMT mice with Csf-1‚àí/‚àí mice. * The role of an innate and adaptive immune response to assist metastasis can be studied in MMTV-PyMT; Rag1‚àí/‚àí mice in which CD4+ T cells are selectively lost. Interleukin-4 (IL4) lacking model of MMTV-PyMT; IL4‚àí/‚àí mice. * Role of the adhesion molecule CD44 in lung metastasis. * Conditional ablation in MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cells has been done to reveal pro-metastatic actions of the angiogenic factors, Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). * The role of autocrine transforming growth factor beta 1(TGF-Œ≤1) signaling on motility and survival in PymT cells derived from an MMTV-PymT mouse mammary cancer. * Others are MMTV-PyMT; uPA-/- and MMTV-PyMT; MEKK1-/-. MMTV-HER2/neu The MMTV-LTR can also be used to promote receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB2 to transform the mouse mammary epithelium. ErbB2 is an oncogene amplified and overexpressed in around 20% of human breast cancers. The mice harbouring this oncogene develop multifocal adenocarcinomas with lung metastases at about 15 weeks after pregnancy. To create a more accurate representation of HER2 gene mutations, researchers have fused the mouse gene containing neu and a rat gene containing neu. This addresses the issue in terms of modeling the amplification of HER2 in mice development. In the non-fused mouse, the mammary gland would revert to a near virgin, but with this addition the mammary gland maintained the developed function.Fry, EA; Taneka, P; Inoue, K. (2016). Oncogenic and tumor-suppressive mouse models for breast cancer engaging HER2/neu. International Journal of Cancer 140(3), 495-503. doi:10.1002/ijc.30399 Bi-transgenic models Mouse models having two transgenes are called bi transgenic. To check the cooperation of two oncogenes, Tim Stewert and group made the first bi-transgenic mouse models in 1987, MMTV-Myc and MMTV- Ras mice were crossed with a resulting acceleration in tumorigenesis. Expression of TGFŒ≤ in the breast cancer cells of MMTV-ErbB2; MMTV-TGFŒ≤ double-transgenic mice can induce higher levels of circulating tumor cells and lung metastasis. Ras gene can be combined with rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) to generate bi-transgenic inducible mouse model through tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation e.g. mice carrying TetO-KrasG12D (TOR) and MMTV-rtTA (MTB), comes with the transgene expressing the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) in mammary epithelial cells. Tri-transgenic models Tri-transgenic mouse models constitute of more than two genes. Multiple combinations and genetic modifications are made in such a way that either one or all the genes are put into a continuously expressed status, or in a controlled fashion to activate them at different time points. For example, TOM( TetO-myc); TOR; MTB mice, where both the myc (M) and ras (R) genes are under the control of tetracycline operators. They can also both be activated or deactivated by adding doxycycline. Other combinations in this respect are TOM; Kras; MTB, where myc can be induced and uninduced at various time points while Kras is in continuous expressed state, and myc; TOR; MTB model is vice versa. Applications of genetically modified mice to study metastasis Metastatic cascade can be studied by keeping the gene activation under control or by adding a reporter gene e.g. Beta actin GFP (Green fluorescent protein) or RFP (Red fluorescent protein). =Identification of genes that regulate metastasis= By knocking in/knocking out specific genes by homologous recombination, the extent of metastasis can be measured and new target genes identification can be achieved e.g. a gene that consistently regulates metastatic behavior of cancer cells is TGF-Œ≤1. Acute ablation of TGF-Œ≤ signaling in MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor cells leads to a five-fold increase in lung metastasis. Certain enhancer regions can also be analyzed and can be determined to be a crucial part of cell proliferation e.g. an enhancing region that is associated with a cancer critical gene p53 which was determined via CRISPR-Cas9.Korkmaz, G; Lopes, R; Ugalde, AP; Nevedomskaya, E; Han, R; Myacheva, K; Zwart, W; Elkon, R; Agami, R. (2016). Functional genetics screens for enhancer elements in the human genome using CRISPR-Cas9. Nature Biotechnology 34, 192-198. doi: 10.1038/nbt.3450 =Lineage tracing in metastasis models= The quantitative lineage-tracing strategies have proven to be successful in resolving cell fates in normal epithelial tissues either using tissue ‚Äìspecific or stem-cell-specific transgenes. To conduct an inducible lineage-tracing experiment two components must be engineered into the mouse genome: a switch and a reporter. The switch is commonly a drug- regulated form of the bacterial enzyme Cre-recombinase. This enzyme recognizes specific sequences, called LoxP sites. Proteins that are capable of enhancing the identification of labeled cells or a specific population in unlabelled cells are encoded by the reporter transgenes. After harvesting all the ten mouse mammary glands from the transgenic mice, single cell suspension is usually made and transplanted either in tail vein of non transgenic recipient mice or in cleared fat pad of non-transgenic mice repopulating the mammary fat pad. These cells are then followed in the blood stream, lungs, bone marrow and liver to look for the favorable site of metastasis.these transgenic cells can be traced according to their special features of either fluorescence or induced by placing the recipients on doxycycline food. =Circulating tumor cells= Another tool to study breast cancer metastasis is to look for circulating tumor cells in transgenic mice e.g. MMTV-PyMT mice can respond to various therapies in shedding tumor cells in the blood leading to lung metastasis. Not only in blood but cells can be detected in bone marrow e.g. cytokeratin-positive cells in the bone marrow of MMTV-pyMT and MMTV-Neu transgenic mice were identified but not in the wild type controls. =Limitations= In the absence of specific markers for mammary cells, models with genetic marking of tumor cells gives the best experimental advantage, however the low volume of peripheral blood that can be obtained from live animals limits the application of this technique. In vivo imaging of metastatic mouse models Transgenic mouse models can be imaged by various non-invasive techniques. Bio luminescence Imaging =Bioluminescence imaging= Bioluminescence imaging relies on the detection of light produced by the enzymatic oxidation of an exogenous substrate. The substrate luciferin, is oxidized to oxyluciferin in the presence of luciferase and emits light, which can be detected using an IVIS system such as a Xenogen machine. Dissociated mammary cells from MMTV-PyMT: IRES: Luc; MTB (Internal ribosome entry site: Luciferin) animals (which were not exposed to doxycycline) can be injected into the lateral tail veins of immunodeficient mice on a doxycycline- free diet. No bioluminescence signal will be observed in the lungs of recipient mice until they are given doxycycline food. Bioluminescence can then be detected in the chest within 2 weeks of the start of doxycycline exposure. Luciferase is injected just before taking the images. = Fluorescent imaging = Intravital microscopy with multi photon excitation is a technique to visualize genetically engineered cells directly in vivo. Multi step metastatic cascades can be visualized by labelling with unique fluorescent colour under fluorescence microscope. = Radioisotopic imaging = Positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) have been used to compare the efficiency of these in vivo imaging for detecting lesions at an early stage and to evaluate the response to chemotherapy. = MRI Imaging = Magnetic resonance imaging requires the use of nano-particles(liposomes) and an MRI contrast agent called gadolinium. The particles were then placed in vesicles via a polycarbonate membrane filter. The nano-particles are injected into the metastases evolved mice, and left there for twenty-four hours. These mice are then scanned, and in the imaging software there are accumulations of these particles in certain areas where cells have metastasized.Goldman, E; Zinger, A; Silva, DD; Yaari, Z; Vardi-Oknin, D; Goldfeder, M; Schroeder, JE; Shainsky-Roitman, J; Hershkovitz, D; Schroeder, A; (2017).

He also performed in several Broadway plays. Stearns was best known for co-starring with his wife Mary Kay Stearns on television's first sitcom Mary Kay and Johnny. He was also known as one of the original producers of The Tonight Show Starring Steve Allen and Arthur Murray's Dance Party. For nearly 30 years, he was the host and producer of the public affairs television program Agriculture USA. Biography =Early life= Stearns was on October 13, 1916 in Billerica, Massachusetts to father Frederick Stearns and mother Edith Louise Bond (February 14, 1884-November 16, 1961). His mother was the founder of the Peterborough Players, a summer theater troupe in Peterborough, New Hampshire in which he was a member. Stearns had two older sisters; Isabell and Sally. =Stage= Stearns' career began as a stage performer at the age of 14 at the Mariarden Theater in Peterborough, NH. Soon after his engagement at Mariarden ended, he went to Broadway. His first Broadway performance was in the production of the play Night Music. He also was in the musicals One Touch of Venus with Mary Martin in 1943, On the Town in 1944 and Are You With It? in 1945. =Television= In 1947, Stearns and his wife Mary Kay whom he married the previous year, began doing a television show entitled Mary Kay and Johnny. The two played fictional versions of themselves; a newlywed couple living in an apartment in New York City trying to make it in life. The series was the first sitcom broadcast on television, the first to show a couple sharing a bed and the first to feature a pregnancy; the Stearns' real life son Christopher (born 1948). The Stearns' created the show and wrote all the scripts. The series originally aired on DuMont premiering on November 18, 1947 but moved to NBC then moved to CBS then back to NBC where it finished its run on March 11, 1950.

She has been instrumental in promoting art and art education in her country. Her work has been shown and collected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her work has been characterized as confident and complex. She lived and worked in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Life and education  B√°ez was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, to an upper-middle-class family and was one of five children. Her father, Enrique B√°ez was a civil engineer and her mother, America Gonzalez was a teacher and an independent and confident woman. B√°ez was strongly influenced by her mother. Her mother insisted that all of her children take classes in the arts and she exposed them to the theater and reading. B√°ez started painting classes at age nine. B√°ez was described as an intelligent and gifted child. She graduated from the Colegio Puertorriqueno de Ni√±as in 1947. B√°ez received a bachelor's degree in the sciences from the University of Puerto Rico in 1951. She was exposed to many cultural and artistic movements while at the University. There had been a migration of many Spanish intellectuals and artists to Puerto Rico at the time and many of them were active around the University. She began to develop ideas about issues surrounding Puerto Rican independence. She believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent country. B√°ez attended political rallies and cultural events. B√°ez supported the woman's rights movement and identifies as a feminist. B√°ez left for Spain, initially to study medicine but ended up completing studies on painting at the Royal Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. Before she arrived in Spain, she spent time in New York and Paris, immersing herself in the culture of both cities. In 1952, her passion for the arts led her to leave medical studies and pursue painting. She applied at the San Fernando Art Academy and was rejected, but she worked hard to build up her portfolio and was accepted in 1953. She received her master's degree in art from San Fernando Art Academy in 1957. Afterwards, she returned to Puerto Rico to study with graphic artist Lorenzo Homar at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture in San Juan. Later, she studied at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1969 to 1970. She died on September 24, 2018, following a heart attack, while in convalescence for a lung infection at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. Her family had her remains cremated.  Career and art  B√°ez's career started in 1957. She was a teacher of painting and drawing at schools in Puerto Rico between 1962 and 1987. From 1981 to 1987 she taught at the Art Students League in San Juan. B√°ez paints in both oil and acrylic. B√°ez's paintings are \\"softly painted\\" and \\"luminous.\\" Her prints, especially her collotypes, are \\"rich\\" in texture and color. Much of B√°ez's early art works, created during the 1960s, are described as \\"traditional images of Puerto Rico.\\" During her earlier period of work, she often portrayed images of \\"everyday life\\" for \\"Puerto Rico's working-class people.\\" She began to use more printmaking techniques, such as engraving and woodcuts. She later studied lithography and intaglio techniques with Dimitri Papagiourgi in Spain. She became influenced by impressionism, surrealism and abstract art, incorporating many of these aspects into her work. B√°ez became interested in working with collotypes in the 1970s. During this time, the political climate of Puerto Rico had shifted. Her work began to focus on the new middle class. Art critic Margarita Fern√°ndez Zavala identifies class struggles in B√°ez's work which often explores urban themes and an emerging Puerto Rican bourgeoisie. There is a sense of uneasiness where individuals depicted in her portraits of this period seem unsure of their new economic and social status. B√°ez creates a sense of dichotomy with these pictures where the individuals portrayed don't seem to completely fit-in with their surroundings. They seem both at-odds with their world and, yet her vivid sense of color lifts them out of the ordinariness of everyday life. The sense of space and how individuals fit into that created space is a trend that continues in her work. B√°ez creates multiple dimensions in her prints and paintings, using frames, reflections, pictures on walls and open windows to build layers of \\"unreal\\" space. B√°ez has been influenced by the works of European masters, but locates her classically derived figures in Caribbean settings. She references great masters and re-imagines famous female nudes with intent to both disguise the figures and reveal them. B√°ez's portraits continue to question the idea of the male gaze. She paints women from a female perspective or a personal sense of understanding and which still imply a strong sense of her own identity as a woman. Her figures have been considered part of the field of socially concerned figurative painting. B√°ez was one of the founding members of the Puerto Rican arts group, Hermandad de Artistas Gr√°ficos in 1981. This group was initially established to protest government intervention in cultural matters. B√°ez founded the fine arts program at the Sacred Heart University in Puerto Rico. Since 1988, she has been an artist-in-residence and is currently working there in an additional capacity as a professor. In 1983 B√°ez was included in the exhibition Images and Identities: Art and Artists of Puerto Rican Heritage at Paul Robeson Galleries, Rutgers University-Newark. = Awards and honors = In December 2014, the annual Campechada cultural and artistic festival in Old San Juan was dedicated to B√°ez's career and work. This was the first time a living artist and a woman was celebrated by the festival. * National Medal of Culture for Contributions in Art (1997) * Honoris Causa Doctored Degree in Art from Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n (2001)  Quotes  \\"I do not want to do landscapes for tourists nor make pictures of the sentimental, nostalgic or folkloric things that people in this country suffer from due to a lack of identity.

Development EPS set out to certify a new-design flat 8 engine, to replace existing general aviation gasoline engines, with the aim of reducing fuel costs by 45%. EPS started work on the design in 2006, a process that took five years. The engine was first flown in May 2014, first exhibited at the 2017 EAA AirVenture and FAA certification was expected at that time by the end of the year. Later in 2017 the testing progress was delayed by insufficient funding. By July 2018 it had completed 25 hours of flight testing on a Cirrus Aircraft airplane. At that point the company hoped to attract Fortune 500 investors and planned that a new demonstrator should be ready in the first quarter of 2019. The production version of the engine was shown at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2019 and work continued on environmental and block testing towards the goal of type certification. Unable to obtain the needed financing to continue operations, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2020.

That night she shares his camp, and in the dark of night Garet Jax awakens to a threatening feeling, only to find Lyriana already awake. Three masked men attack and Garet easily kills them. The next day they buy provisions for their 8 day journey and set off. When they arrive at the town Garet Jax is surprised by what he sees. Tajarin is a crumbling ruin. It looks deserted except for the guards, called Hets. He and Lyriana stay hidden, and enter a building where he witnesses Kronswiff sucking the souls out of his helpless victims. Garet Jax knows he should wait until Kronswiff and the Hets retire so as to attack unawares, but he cannot bear to watch one more person drained of their soul and thrown into a cart, a lifeless bit of sagging flesh. He silently kills two Hets, then throws a dagger into Kronswiffs heart. The dracul does not perish, and Garet Jax realizes that he must behead the monster. He attacks and kills the Hets, and while doing so feels Lyriana using magic to block their blows from him. He kills them all then swings a deadly blow at Kronswiff, taking off his hands and head in one foul swoop. Garet Jax and Lyriana then leave to free her captive people. He is disgusted to find them disfigured and sick, and demands to know what Kronswiff did to them. He realizes too late that they were already like that. Tajarin is a leper colony. Lyriana offers him gold for his service, but he says that he wants her. She says it can never be and reveals that she too is a leper. She has some magic that she uses to heal herself, but the sickness is getting worse. Her parents and brother were lepers and she had accompanied them to the colony to help care for them, but by the time they died she had contracted the disease. He kisses her and leaves in despair, but quickly forgets her as he looks for his next adventure, knowing that they could never have been.

Birth and origins Garret was a son of Sir Edward Moore of Mellifont and his wife Elizabeth Clifford. His father was a knight and owner of the former abbey of Mellifont in County Louth. Garrett's mother was daughter and co-heiress of Nicholas Clifford of Holme, Kent, and his wife Mary Harper. Elizabeth had already been married three times, and all her husbands belonged to the Anglo-Irish nobility: her first husband, Sir William Brabazon, had been Lord Justice of Ireland. Through this marriage Garrett was half-brother of Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee. Through his mother's third marriage, which was to Captain Humphrey Warren, he was half- brother of Sir William Warren.John Debrett, Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1840), p.249. Early career In 1599, after his father's death in 1581, Garret was knighted by Elizabeth I. He held the office of Seneschal of the Cavan in 1601. He inherited his father's very substantial estates in 1602. Much of these were leasehold, held directly from the English Crown. He was a staunch friend of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and hosted the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603 and the ending of the Nine Years' War. Moore and the Earl of Tyrone Despite his friendship with the Earl of Tyrone, his loyalty to the Crown was never seriously in doubt. However, after Tyrone's flight to the Continent in 1607, he was the target of vehement attacks by his enemies, especially the volatile and unreliable Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth, with whom he had quarrelled bitterly, despite their being relatives by marriage. Lord Howth accused Moore of treasonable dealings with Tyrone, and pressed the charges with such vigour that the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, who had originally laughed at them as \\"too absurd even to charge a horse-boy with, let alone a knight\\", felt obliged to place Moore under house arrest. Moore admitted that on the eve of the Flight of the Earls, Tyrone had visited him at his home, Mellifont, but he firmly denied any imputation of treason. Lord Howth, summoned before the Irish Council, refused to produce any evidence of the alleged treason, on the ground that since Moore was himself a Privy Councillor, that body was clearly guilty of bias, while his bizarre claim that he had seen Moore trying to raise the Devil did nothing to enhance his credibility. The case was transferred to England, and in due course Moore was cleared of all suspicion. Howth, undaunted, now accused Chichester and Moore of conspiring to murder him: the Council, which by now lost had all patience with Howth, ordered him to retire to his home in disgrace. Moore by contrast was assured that his loyalty to the King was not in question. Later career Moore was made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1604 and served in the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Dungannon in the Parliament of 1613-15. He held the office of Lord President of Munster in 1615. On 20 July 1616 he was created Baron Moore, of Mellifont in the County of Louth in the Peerage of Ireland. He was further honoured when he was created Viscount Moore, of Drogheda, also in the Peerage of Ireland, on 7 February 1621.John Debrett, Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1840), p.249. His principal residence was Mellifont Abbey, near Drogheda, which remained in the Moore family until 1927: it is now a ruin. 250px Mellifont Abbey, c.1755 Marriage and children He married Mary Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley and his wife Catherine Cusack, daughter of Sir Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by whom he had twelve children, three sons and nine daughters: The couple had seven sons: # Edward, who predeceased his father; # Thomas, who predeceased his father; and # Charles, who succeeded as the 2nd Viscount; # James; # Arthur; # Francis; # John. ‚Äîand five daughters: # Ursula, who married Sir Nicholas White of Leixlip in County Kildare; # Frances, who married Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh; # Anne, who married the prominent Royalist commander Sir Faithful Fortescue; # Eleanor, who married Sir John Denham, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, best known to history as one of the Ship Money judges: they were the parents of the distinguished poet Sir John Denham; and # Jane, who married Henry Blayney, 2nd Baron Blayney. Moore's grandson, Henry Moore, was created Earl of Drogheda in 1661.John Debrett, Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1840), p.249. Moore's widow Mary remarried Charles Wilmot, 1st Viscount Wilmot: she died in 1654, and was buried beside her first husband in St. Peter's Church, Drogheda.

They are former WWE Tag Team Champions. They formed a tag team in December 2014, and were accompanied to the ring by Natalya, Kidd's real-life wife. While the team had no official name, they were unofficially called the \\"Masters of the WWE Universe\\",http://www.cagesideseats.com/2014/12/27/7456049/report-wwe-has- given-the-cesaro-tyson-kidd-tag-team-a-name a reference to the Masters of the Universe franchise, and the \\"Brass Ring Club\\", a reference to the New Japan Pro Wrestling stable Bullet Club as well as a criticism of Cesaro from WWE chairman Vince McMahon.http://www.sescoops.com/back-story-behind-cesaro-tyson- kidds-new-brass-ring-club-name/ Other nicknames included BTE (Best Team Ever) and #FACT.  History  Kidd and Cesaro first teamed on the December 1 episode of Raw, when they were eliminated from a gauntlet match for a shot at the tag team titles by The Usos. In January 2015, Kidd formed an official alliance with Cesaro. The pair dubbed themselves \\"The Brass Ring Club\\" and proceeded to pick up multiple wins over Los Matadores, as well as allying with Adam Rose to feud with The New Day. At the Royal Rumble, Kidd and Cesaro defeated New Day members Big E and Kofi Kingston, before entering the Royal Rumble match at #12 (Kidd) and #28 (Cesaro) and being eliminated by Daniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler respectively. According to the Wrestling Observer, originally Rose was set to join the duo to form a faction, indicated by the \\"Brass Ring Club\\" shirts worn by the trio throughout January, but those plans were nixed following the Royal Rumble. Kidd and Cesaro performing the Cesaro Swing/Dropkick combination. At Fastlane on February 22, Kidd and Cesaro defeated The Usos to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship, a title Kidd had not held for nearly 5 years. They retained their title in a rematch the following night on Raw after Natalya caused a disqualification, cementing her as a villainess in solidarity with the duo. At WrestleMania 31, Kidd and Cesaro retained their title by defeating The Usos, Los Matadores and The New Day in a Fatal-4-Way tag team match. At Extreme Rules,http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2015/wwe-tag-team-championship- match-27298251 Kidd and Cesaro lost their titles to rivals; The New Day when Kofi Kingston held onto Cesaro's tights for the pin, ending their reign at 63 days. After The New Day turned heel, Cesaro and Kidd became faces for the first time as a tag team (also marking Cesaro's first true face turn in the WWE). On the May 4th episode of Raw, Cesaro and Kidd defeated The Ascension after Kidd dropkicked Viktor while Cesaro was performing his Cesaro Swing. Afterwards, they had a confrontation with The New Day backstage, leading the fans in chanting \\"New Day sucks\\" to The New Day's trademark clapping. At Payback, Kidd and Cesaro challenged The New Day for the WWE Tag Team Championships in a two out of three falls match. The duo scored the first fall of the match, but ultimately lost the second and third falls (the third fall being made by Xavier Woods, who wasn't one of the legal participants in the match), failing to recapture the titles. It was announced Kidd and Cesaro would take part in the first-ever Tag Team Elimination Chamber match for the titles at Elimination Chamber on May 31, but they failed to win as they were the fourth team eliminated. On June 7, WWE announced that Kidd had suffered a neck/spinal injury during a dark match with Samoa Joe a week prior. Kidd announced that he would be out of action for over a year. He later retired on June 29, 2017, becoming a backstage producer for the company. Kidd's retirement effectively ended any chances of reformation.

He fenced at Harvard earning NCAA All-America honors. He coached at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, and the Carroll Center for the blind, among others. As a coach he is notable for helping to quickly develop competitive fencers and for a paradigm shift in how to fence against classical fencers. Sollee trained a number of top competitors including Olympians. Personal =Youth= Eric Tennyson Sollee was born in Los Angeles, California, to a Norwegian immigrant Father, Oben Sollee, and Filipino mother, Delores Sollee n√©e Lichauco. During the Great Depression the family moved to the Philippines for work. Sollee was listed on his father's US passport while his sister was listed on his mother's Filipino passport. At age 14 he and his father were in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, Philippines, a Japanese prisoner camp, for 3 years during World War II. After the war, Sollee joined the US Army and was in the 42nd Construction Engineer Battalion. =Fencing at Harvard= After the Army, Sollee went to Harvard University. At Harvard, he picked up fencing quickly and was made captain of the freshman team, even without prior fencing experience. He learned to fence from Ren√© Peroy, Harvard fencing coach, European sabre champion, and member of the 1924 US Olympic fencing team. His other coach, Joseph Levis, was the second ranked in the world in foil and silver medalist at the 1932 Olympics. Sollee captained the Harvard team in 1951-52 and earned a varsity letter in 1952. With his support, Harvard's fencing team went 6-1 overall and finished 14th at the NCAA Championships in 1952. Sollee placed fifth in the foil at the NCAA Championships, earning All- America honors. In one Amateur Fencers League of America tournament, he won all three divisions - foil, √©p√©e, and sabre. He also won the Greater Boston Open Foils Championship. He was inducted into the Harvard Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. Professional =Coaching at MIT= At MIT, Sollee started as the assistant fencing coach and the women's team first fencing coach under the direction of Edwin Richards, Edo Marion, Silvio Vitale, and Branimir Zivkovic. Sollee initiated and developed the MIT women's fencing program. When Vitale retired, Sollee became head coach and Maitre d'armes at MIT. Because MIT doesn't recruit or offer scholarships in fencing, Sollee was charged with teaching students who typically had little to no experience fencing. In developing his approaches to teaching and fencing, Sollee used his understanding of a wide range of subjects, including boxing, martial arts and psychology, and his experience teaching fencing to the blind at the Carroll Center. Sollee taught well over a thousand students at the Carroll Center helping people regain their orientation in space. As part of the effort to work on teaching approaches, Sollee and Johan Harmenberg came up with a new way to think about √©p√©e fencing starting with the three \\"Sollee conjectures\\". Sollee and his students collaboratively worked on these conjectures and the associated new paradigm. Harmenberg implemented these ideas and won both the World Fencing Championships and the Olympic gold medal in √©p√©e at the 1980 Summer Olympics. It also worked for those who learned and helped to further develop Sollee's ideas by working with Johan Harmenberg away from MIT, e.g. Bj√∂rne V√§gg√∂, who won the Silver medal in √©p√©e in the 1984 Olympics. Sollee‚Äôs MIT men‚Äôs team won fourteen straight New England championships and won the Intercollegiate Fencing Association (IFA) first place foil team (Little Iron Man) Trophy four times in eight years. In 1980, the team tied for 2nd at the NCAAs (ended up third on indicators), resulting in Eric‚Äôs peers naming him NCAA Coach of the Year. =Notable students= At MIT *Holt Farley ‚Äï Winner of first US circuit cup 1981, member of US National Fencing Team, finalist in several √©p√©e Fencing World Cup events, member of 4th place 1986 World Championship √©p√©e team. *Johan Harmenberg ‚Äï Foil: IFA first place team (Little Iron Man) and individual, NCAA 3rd place individual, All-America. √âp√©e: individual Fencing World Cup three 1st places and one 3rd place; one World Fencing Championships team 1st place; World Fencing Championships individual 1st place 1977; two Combined Fencing World Cup individual 1st places; Olympics individual √©p√©e gold medalist 1980. * Geoff Pingree ‚Äï IFA Champion in √©p√©e (team and individual), NCAA All-America.

The three conjectures are: # Is it possible for the fencer with the lower technical ability to decide the technical level of a bout? # Can the fencer with the shorter fencing distance control the distance in a bout? # Is it possible to force your opponent into your own area of greatest strength?

The group sought to, among other goals, examine art from a feminist and political perspective. In addition to a variety of actions and cultural output, the collective was responsible for the overseeing the publication of the journal Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics, which was published from 1977 until 1993.  Background  The Heresies Collective was founded in 1976 by a group of feminist artists, with the goal of increasing discourse around the ideas of feminism, politics, and their relationship to art. The Heresies Collective's primary output was a reoccurring publication titled Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics. The goals of the collective, through the publication of their journal, were to encourage the writing of feminist history, generate new creative energies among women artists, broaden the definition of art, and articulate diversity within the art world. In addition to the goals of encouraging and supporting feminist political art, the collective sought to stimulate dialogue around radical political and esthetic theory, and reject the capitalist framework of the art world through interrogating the processes by which art is created, critiqued, and consumed. = Members= The founding collective members listed in the first publication were: Patsy Beckert, Joan Braderman, Mary Beth Edelson, Harmony Hammond, Elizabeth Hess, Joyce Kozloff, Arlene Ladden, Lucy Lippard, Mary Miss, Marty Pottenger, Miriam Schapiro, Joan Snyder, Elke Solomon, Pat Steir, May Stevens, Susana Torre, Elizabeth Weatherford, Sally Webster, and Nina Yankowitz. Numerous other feminist artists contributed to the publication over the years, and participated in the collective structure. The film, The Heretics, by collective member Joan Braderman, lists the following additional women as members of the Heresies Collective: Joan Snyder, Pat Steir, Michelle Stuart, Emma Amos, Patsy Beckert, Janet Froelich, Su Friedrich, Ida Applebroog, Sue Heinemann, Sabra Moore, Miriam Schapiro, Cecilia Vicuna, Nina Yankowitz, and Amy Sillman. Collective Activities While the publication was the primary activity of the collective, members of the group were also involved with other arts and political movements in New York. The collective was featured in an exhibit at the New Museum in 1983, titled Classified: Big Pages from the Heresies Collective. The exhibit featured large scale works from members of the collective, and was curated in part by En Foco, as part of the Events series. In 1984 the collective staged a demonstration in front of the Museum of Modern Art called the Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.), or Let MOMA Know, aimed at raising awareness about the poor representation of women artists at the museum. The Heresies Collective was also the subject of a documentary film, called The Heretics. The film was conceived and directed by Heresies Collective member Joan Braderman.

Biography Ellen Powell was the daughter of William and Queenie Powell, Baptist sharecroppers who moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from Cape Charles, Virginia in 1937, just a few weeks before Ellen was born. At 12, Ellen converted to Catholicism. She attended Overbrook High School, and then went to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1956‚Äì1961). She was the second black woman to receive a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, in 1959, which she used to travel in Europe. She lived in New York City for the next six years. In 1967, she married Joseph Tiberino, an Italian American Catholic artist who grew up in Philadelphia and attended the University of the Arts. Of their children, Raphael Tiberino, Ellen Tiberino and Gabriele Tiberino have also become well-known Philadelphia artists. Ellen Powell Tiberino died in 1992, after a fourteen-year battle with cancer. Even when bedridden, she continued to work, in a burst of creative activity that defied death. She told her husband, \\"I'm trying to work fast because I don't have a lot of time left.\\" Some of her later self-portraits have been compared to the work of Frida Kahlo. The MOVE Confrontation Her work was often thematically dark, including portrayals of lynchings and painful historical events. Evelyn Redcross of the October Gallery has said \\"She was able to show you the sides of life that you may not want to deal with.\\" A particularly controversial piece was a three-dimensional, seven-foot relief sculpture entitled The MOVE Confrontation, which Powell Tiberino and her husband created in response to the 1985 MOVE tragedy in which five children died. The sculpture depicts people on fire, viewed by Mayor W. Wilson Goode, horrified spectators, and a mask of death. Shown at Temple University, a number of people reportedly found it distressing and disturbing, including Goode's daughter. Powell Tiberino was quoted as responding that \\"I paint life, and life is not always beautiful. Ellen Powell Tiberino Memorial Museum of Contemporary American Art In 1999, her home at 3819 Hamilton St. in the Powelton Village neighborhood of Philadelphia and an extended courtyard area on Spring Garden and Hamilton Streets, became the Ellen Powell Tiberino Memorial Museum of Contemporary American Art. According to her husband, Joseph Tiberino, \\"We want to show other artists' work, too, in special exhibitions. And we also want to establish a permanent collection of work by Ellen's contemporaries.\\" The area includes both her paintings and those of other family members and friends, framing her work \\"within its natural context, which is eclectic and religiously flavored as well as biracial.\\" Tiberino: The Art of Life New Jersey filmmaker Derrick Woodyard has worked with Joseph Tiberino and other family members to create a feature-length documentary film about Ellen and the rest of the Tiberino family, entitled Tiberino: The Art of Life. Exhibitions * Her first solo exhibition occurred in 1977, and was the first solo show to be featured at the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum, now the African American Museum in Philadelphia. * The Unflinching Eye: Works of the Tiberino Family Circle, is a 50-year retrospective exhibit of the entire family, at the African American Museum in Philadelphia, 2013‚Äì2014.

This is also sometimes called malnutrition, but this could also refer to getting too much food (causing childhood obesity). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide, about 1 million children. Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide.Pr√ºss-√úst√ºn, A., Bos, R., Gore, F., Bartram, J. (2008). Safer water, better health ‚Äì Costs, benefits and sustainability of interventions to protect and promote health. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland The main causes are often related to poverty: unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene, factors related to society, diseases, maternal factors, gender issues.  Signs and symptoms  A child‚Äôs upper arm is measured to detect malnutrition in the village of Baggad, in Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs Dhar district (India) = Measures = There are three commonly used measures for detecting malnutrition in children: * stunting (extremely low height for age), * underweight (extremely low weight for age), and * wasting (extremely low weight for height). These measures of malnutrition are interrelated, but studies for the World Bank found that only 9 percent of children exhibit stunting, underweight, and wasting. Children with severe acute malnutrition are very thin, but they often also have swollen hands and feet, making the internal problems more evident to health workers. Children with severe malnutrition are very susceptible to infection. = Effects later in life = Undernutrition in children causes direct structural damage to the brain and impairs infant motor development and exploratory behavior. Children who are undernourished before age two and gain weight quickly later in childhood and in adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition. Studies have found a strong association between undernutrition and child mortality. Once malnutrition is treated, adequate growth is an indication of health and recovery. Even after recovering from severe malnutrition, children often remain stunted for the rest of their lives. Even mild degrees of malnutrition double the risk of mortality for respiratory and diarrheal disease mortality and malaria. This risk is greatly increased in more severe cases of malnutrition. Undernourished girls tend to grow into short adults and are more likely to have small children. Prenatal malnutrition and early life growth patterns can alter metabolism and physiological patterns and have lifelong effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease. Children who are undernourished are more likely to be short in adulthood, have lower educational achievement and economic status, and give birth to smaller infants. Children often face malnutrition during the age of rapid development, which can have long-lasting impacts on health.  Causes  Inadequate food intake, infections, psychosocial deprivation, the environment (lack of sanitation and hygiene), social inequality and perhaps genetics contribute to childhood malnutrition. =Inadequate food intake= A child suffering from Kwashiorkor caused by inadequate dietary protein intake, show signs of thinning hair or ‚ÄúFlag Sign‚Äù, edema, inadequate growth, and weight loss. Inadequate food intake such as a lack of proteins can lead to Kwashiorkor, Marasmus and other forms of Protein‚Äìenergy malnutrition. = Sanitation = Poor sanitary conditions in environment that can contribute to malnutrition and disease in children (Kibera, Kenya) The World Health Organization estimated in 2008 that globally, half of all cases of undernutrition in children under five were caused by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene. This link is often due to repeated diarrhoea and intestinal worm infections as a result of inadequate sanitation. However, the relative contribution of diarrhea to undernutrition and in turn stunting remains controversial. = Social inequality = In almost all countries, the poorest quintile of children has the highest rate of malnutrition. However, inequalities in malnutrition between children of poor and rich families vary from country to country, with studies finding large gaps in Peru and very small gaps in Egypt. In 2000, rates of child malnutrition were much higher in low income countries (36 percent) compared to middle income countries (12 percent) and the United States (1 percent). Studies in Bangladesh in 2009 found that the mother‚Äôs illiteracy, low household income, higher number of siblings, less access to mass media, less supplementation of diets, unhygienic water and sanitation are associated with chronic and severe malnutrition in children. = Diseases = Diarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption, decreased intake of food, increased metabolic requirements, and direct nutrient loss. Parasite infections, in particular intestinal worm infections (helminthiasis), can also lead to malnutrition. A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries is lack of sanitation and hygiene. Other diseases that cause chronic intestinal inflammation may lead to malnutrition, such as some cases of untreated celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Children with chronic diseases like HIV have a higher risk of malnutrition, since their bodies cannot absorb nutrients as well. Diseases such as measles are a major cause of malnutrition in children; thus immunizations present a way to relieve the burden. = Maternal factors = The nutrition of children 5 years and younger depends strongly on the nutrition level of their mothers during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Infants born to young mothers who are not fully developed are found to have low birth weights. The level of maternal nutrition during pregnancy can affect newborn baby body size and composition. Iodine-deficiency in mothers usually causes brain damage in their offspring, and some cases cause extreme physical and mental retardation. This affects the children‚Äôs ability to achieve their full potential. In 2011 UNICEF reported that thirty percent of households in the developing world were not consuming iodized salt, which accounted for 41 million infants and newborns in whom iodine deficiency could still be prevented. Maternal body size is strongly associated with the size of newborn children. Short stature of the mother and poor maternal nutrition stores increase the risk of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). However, environmental factors can weaken the effect of IUGR on cognitive performance. = Gender = A study in Bangladesh in 2008 reported that rates of malnutrition were higher in female children than male children. Other studies show that, at the national level, differences between undernutrition prevalence rates between young boys and girls are generally small. Girls often have a lower nutritional status in South and Southeastern Asia compared to boys. In other developing regions, the nutritional status of girls is slightly higher. Diagnosis Measurements of a child‚Äôs growth provide the key information for the presence of malnutrition, but weight and height measurements alone can lead to failure to recognize kwashiorkor and an underestimation of the severity of malnutrition in children. Since undernourished children are also more likely to die from preventable infections, there is some research into developing a rapid diagnostic tool to detect malnourishment and common infections from a drop of blood. This research was spearheaded by Evelyn Gitau.  Prevention Measures have been taken to reduce child malnutrition. Studies for the World Bank found that, from 1970 to 2000, the number of malnourished children decreased by 20 percent in developing countries. Iodine supplement trials in pregnant women have been shown to reduce offspring deaths during infancy and early childhood by 29 percent. However, universal salt iodization has largely replaced this intervention. The Progresa program in Mexico combined conditional cash transfers with nutritional education and micronutrient-fortified food supplements; this resulted in a 10 percent reduction the prevalence of stunting in children 12‚Äì36 months old. Milk fortified with zinc and iron reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 18 percent in a study in India. In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to combat malnutrition in the North, However, a research has shown that Soy Kunu, a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans contains the components of the Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) and this has been used massively to reduce malnutrition in the north. =Breastfeeding = Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and dehydration caused by diarrhea, but mothers are sometimes wrongly advised to not breastfeed their children. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce mortality in infants and young children. Since only 38 percent of children worldwide under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, education programs could have large impacts on children malnutrition rates. However, breastfeeding cannot fully prevent PEM if not enough nutrients are consumed. Treatment Getting support to children with malnutrition in Kenya Treatment with antibiotics such as amoxicillin or cefdinir improve the response and survival rate of severely malnourished children to an outpatient treatment plan which provided therapeutic food. This confirms the recommendation, \\"In addition to the provision of RUTF [ready-to-use therapeutic food], children need to receive a short course of basic oral medication to treat infections.\\" contained in \\"Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund.\\" Epidemiology The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide, about 1 million children. Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35% of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide. According to a 2008 review an estimated 178 million children under age 5 are stunted, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. A 2008 review of malnutrition found that about 55 million children are wasted, including 19 million who have severe wasting or severe acute malnutrition. In 2020, a research paper that mapped stunting, wasting and underweight among children across 105 low- and middle-income countries found that only five countries were expected to meet global nutrition targets in all second administrative subdivisions. As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the indirect disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the direct effects of malnutrition. The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.

(1856) Francisco Augusto Metrass (7 February 1825, Lisbon - 14 February 1861, Madeira) was a Portuguese painter in the Romantic style.  Biography  He came from a wealthy German immigrant family that ran an import business. Going against his father's wishes, he began his artistic studies in 1836, when he was only eleven, as an unmatriculated student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Lisbon. His teachers there included and Ant√≥nio Manuel da Fonseca.Brief biography @ Infopedia. Initially, he was a portrait painter. Several years later, in 1844, he was a student in Rome, where he associated with Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius and other German painters, coming under the influence of the Nazarene movement. Upon returning to Portugal, he abandoned portraits in favor of history painting and held his first exhibition in a palace belonging to Count of Lumiares. His work was not favorably received, so he sold all of his paintings to an auction house and went to France for further studies.Brief biography from the Dicion√°rio Hist√≥rico. In 1853, he was back in Portugal, having changed his style to more resemble that of the old Dutch Masters. His new works found favor with the public and King Fedinand II, who purchased his painting of a scene from the life of Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes. He also created some sketches on Orientalist themes, but these proved unsatisfactory. He was appointed a Professor of history painting at the Academy in 1854 after winning a competition with his painting of Solomon's Judgment. The following year, he had a major showing at the Exposition Universelle. Suffering from tuberculosis, he became increasingly unable to work. A trip to Italy, seeking a more healthful climate, made his condition worse, so he went to Madeira, thinking the climate might be better, but died there.

Life  Alexander was the second son of Emperor Alexios (reigned 1417‚Äì29) and of his wife, Theodora Kantakouzene. During his father's reign his older brother John attempted to depose Alexios, and failing fled to Georgia; Alexios appointed Alexander co- emperor. However, in 1429 John returned to Trebizond and seized control of the Empire. Alexios was assassinated by John's supporters, and Alexander was banished from Trebizond; he went to Constantinople to live with his sister Maria. When the Castilian traveller Pero Tafur met him in October 1429 at Constantinople, he recorded the gossip \\"they say that his [Alexander] relations with her are dishonest.\\" From Constantinople, Pero Tafur traveled to Trebizond (where he met Alexander's brother the Emperor John), then traveled to Kaffa before beginning retracing his steps to Venice. On his return trip, Tafur stopped at Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, where he encountered Alexander again. At this visit he found Alexander had married Maria, a daughter of the Genoese lord of Lesbos, Dorino I Gattilusio; according to Tafur Alexander \\"was preparing ships to set out for Trebizond against his brother.\\" Tafur shared with him the news to Alexander that John had concluded an alliance with \\"the Turk\\", which had been sealed with John's marriage to \\"a daughter of a Turk\\", and that it would be detrimental to all to make war. That Alexander was planning to overthrow his brother is confirmed by other reports. The Genoese archives contain a copy of a letter sent to Dorino Gattilusio urging that he do what he could to bring peace between Alexander and his brother the emperor, and offering Alexander a pension if he did allowing him to live where ever he wanted to, Mytilene, or Constantinople. The Republic of Genoa had business interests in Trebizond that might be harmed in a civil war between the brothers. Genoese interests changed a decade later. Following Alexander's younger brother David's raid on Kaffa in 1447, Genoa made an offer to support Alexander's efforts to recover the throne. However, by the time the letter was written (1451) Alexander and John apparently had reconciled: Alexander, Maria and their son were now living in Trebizond. Michel Kur≈°anskis even suggests that John, mistrustful of their youngest brother, had made Alexander co-Emperor, and later made the young Alexios his heir. Alexander died sometime before the death of his brother John in 1459.  Family  Alexander and Maria had one known son, Alexios. After the fall of Trebizond, according to Laonikos Chalkokondyles, Maria was taken into Sultan Mehmet's seraglio for a while for \\"she was said to be one of the most beautiful and comely of women.\\"Chalkokondyles 10.13; translated by Anthony Kaldellis, The Histories (Cambridge: Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, 2014), vol. 2 p. 415 But it is doubtful that young sultan would marry a woman who was almost 50 years old at that time, moreover a widow. It is known that many women who lived in the imperial harem were not sultan's wives, neither concubines. The Sultan took Alexios and made him a page at the Porte, \\"second in status to the brother of Murad, a child from Byzantion.\\" It is unclear whether Alexios was executed with his uncle David in 1463.

Flagler is a direct corporate legacy of the American businessman Henry M. Flagler. The company has developed more than 30 million square feet of commercial real estate space over the past 30 years. It also owns more than 2,500 acres of developable land statewide, and manages or leases more than 13 million square feet of commercial property. Its development projects include the new world headquarters for Bacardi USA, in Miami; Office Depot's world headquarters, in Boca Raton; and Miami's Flagler Station, South Florida's largest business park. Flagler has shifted its focus in recent years away from owning commercial real estate properties, and more towards development and providing brokerage, property management and asset management services to larger, institutional clients. The Flagler company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Florida East Coast Industries. Flagler's origins date back to the original railroad company founded by Henry M. Flagler in 1888. After visiting Florida with his sick wife, Flagler saw the state's great potential for tourism. He began purchasing small railroad companies, and started expanding his rail network down Florida's eastern seaboard. Florida East Coast Railway eventually stretched from Jacksonville to Key West. To support rail operations, Flagler also invested millions of dollars developing new infrastructure such as hotels, resorts, roadways, and utilities. A number of communities sprung up alongside Flagler's railroad, including West Palm Beach in 1894. Miami, which consisted of about 400 inhabitants when the train arrived in 1896, grew into a thriving city of more than 29,000 residents a generation later. In building his rail network, Flagler had also acquired thousands of acres of prime land adjacent to or near the main rail corridor. As a result, FECR over the years became not only the state's largest rail operator, but also one of its largest commercial developers. In 1983, the St. Joe Company, which was named FECR's majority shareholder in 1961 following a lengthy bankruptcy, split off the real estate operations from the rail company. Known first as Gran Central Corporation and later as Flagler Development Company, the firm merged in 2006 with another large real estate developer and service provider, the Codina Group, and changed its name to Flagler Development Group. In 2009, Fortress Investment Group purchased Flagler's parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, which still also owned FECR, for $3.5 billion. Shortly after, Fortress spun off FECR into a separate, distinct company. Following the arrival of Vincent Signorello as company President and CEO in 2010, FECI underwent a significant strategic realignment, resulting in the creation of four distinct companies all operating under the FECI umbrella: All Aboard Florida (operator of Virgin Trains USA), Flagler Global Logistics, Parallel Infrastructure, and Flagler Development. In 2012, the company sold off a significant developed portion of its Flagler Station business park in Miami, while holding on to the undeveloped parcels. In 2013, the company changed its name to simply Flagler.  Services  Flagler markets itself as a full-service commercial real estate provider with more than a century of experience in Florida. Their core services include development, brokerage, and property management and asset management. = Development = Flagler has developed more than 30 million square feet of commercial property over the past three decades, working with some of the region's largest businesses, including: * 11 million square feet of suburban office buildings. Projects include Ryder Systems, Strayer University, and Flagler Center. * 18 million square feet of industrial warehouse/distribution facilities. Projects include Flagler Station, Beacon Lakes, and Centergate at Gratigny. * 1.5 million square feet of office/retail space. Projects include Bacardi USA Headquarters, Office Depot Global Headquarters, and Toyota Headquarters. * 6 million square feet of tenant improvements. Projects include Carnival Cruise Lines, Target, and DHL. * Thousands of acres of infrastructure improvements & roadways.

Flagler has also made a commitment to building eco-friendly projects. The company is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council, and encourages its staff to work towards LEED certification in their particular fields. = Land = According to the company, Flagler owns approximately 2,500 acres of land across north, central, and southern Florida, with a focus on the Jacksonville, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and Miami metro areas. = Brokerage Services = Flagler was at one time considered Florida's largest commercial brokerage firm. Following a strategic shift, the firm has shifted into a high-quality, boutique brokerage operation that focuses on providing a full suite of services to large, blue-chip, or institutional clients, such as JP Morgan and AEW Capital Management. Flagler's services include helping property owners find tenants, helping businesses find space to buy or lease, strategic consulting services to help property owners maximize assets, property management, development services, and land sales. = Property Management = Flagler manages and leases approximately 14 million square feet of commercial space throughout Florida.

Cassiopea xamachana, commonly known as the upside-down jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish in the family Cassiopeidae. It is found in warm parts of the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It was first described by the American marine biologist Henry Bryant Bigelow in 1892. Description The medusa phase of Cassiopea xamachana can grow to a diameter of about . Compared to most species of jellyfish it is upside-down, that is to say the bell, which is saucer-shaped, is underneath and acts like a suction cup to stabilise the jellyfish on the seabed. The four pairs of much-branched tentacles are on the upperside. Instead of a central mouth, there are numerous oral openings in the tentacles which connect via channels to the stomach. The mesogloea, the jelly-like tissue, contains symbiotic zooxanthellae, single- celled protists, which are photosynthetic and give the jellyfish its variable color, often bluish-grey or bluish-green. Distribution and habitat Cassiopea xamachana is found in warm parts of the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It is normally found in large aggregations on the muddy seabed of inshore bays and shallow lagoons. If disturbed the jellyfish may pulsate their bells and rise in the water, soon flopping back onto the seabed. Biology Cassiopea xamachana obtains part of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic zooxanthellae it harbors in its tissues; these use energy from the sunlight to produce carbohydrates by photosynthesis. For its further needs, as well as being able to absorb nutrients dissolved in the water, it can also catch small prey using the cnidocytes with which its tentacles are armed. Having paralysed the prey, it digests them on the oral surfaces and the resulting fragments are ingested through the oral openings. This species has become an important model system to study the molecular basis of coral-algal symbiosis. Ohdera et al:Upside- Down but Headed in the Right Direction: Review of the Highly Versatile Cassiopea xamachana System. The life cycle of Cassiopea xamachana alternates between a polyp phase and the medusa phase. Gametes are released by the medusae into the water and the fertilized eggs hatch into planula larvae, which attach to the sea bed or some other suitable substrate. Decomposing red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) give off a substance which attracts the larvae to settle. Having settled, the larvae undergo metamorphosis into the hydroid stage of the lifecycle, forming tiny sessile polyps called scyphistomae. Under favorable conditions these bud and form further scyphistomae. In due course, when they have acquired zooxanthellae and the temperature exceeds , these strobilate (split) and new medusae are formed. In Florida, the medusae are found all the year round but the scyphistomae are only present in late summer and fall. This is the reverse of the usual situation of rhizostome jellyfish, in more temperate locations, where the scyphistomae are temperature-tolerant and the medusae are cold-sensitive. The jellyfish surround themselves with a layer of mucus containing cassiosomes, independent bodies consisting of a layer of stinging cells surrounding a piece of jelly; between sixty and a hundred cilia enable the cassiophore to swim independently of the jellyfish's body. The cassiophores allow the jellyfish to kill or stun its prey at a distance, and are responsible for the stinging sensation experienced by swimmers, divers and aquarists who get too close to the jellyfish.\\"These jellyfish can sting without touching you, thanks to 'mucus grenades'\\" at the National Geographic website References External links * Category:Cassiopea Category:Cnidarians of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Cnidarians of the Caribbean Sea Category:Animals described in 1892 Category:Taxa named by Henry Bryant Bigelow ","title":"Cassiopea xamachana"},{"id":"45576929","text":"Yves Pierracci (26 July 1918 - 26 July 1983) was a French racing cyclist.

In some sources her name appears as Maria Jackson, Mary Jackson or Mary Elizabeth Jackson.A number of sources confuse Miss Mary E Jacson of Somersal with Miss Mary A(nn) Jackson of Lichfield (fl. 1830s‚Äì1840s), botanical illustrator, daughter of John Jackson of the Lichfield Botanical Society and author of Botanical Terms illustrated (1842) and Pictorial Flora (1840) She spent most of her life in Cheshire and Derbyshire, where she lived with her sister following her father's death. Social conventions of the time obliged her to publish anonymously. She was influenced by Erasmus Darwin at a time when the new but controversial sexual classification of plants proposed by Linnaeus was becoming known in England. She published four books on the topic.  Life  Somersal Hall, Derbyshire, home of the Jacson sisters from 1808 Maria and Frances were two of five surviving children of the Anglican rector of Bebington, Cheshire, the Rev. Simon Jacson (1728‚Äì1808), and his wife Anne Fitzherbert (c. 1729 ‚Äì 1795), the oldest daughter of Richard Fitzherbert of Somersal Herbert in Derbyshire. The family had been landowners and clergy in both Cheshire and Derbyshire since the early seventeenth century. Their elder brother Roger (1753‚Äì1826) succeeded his father as rector in 1771, after which the family moved to Stockport (1777‚Äì87), Cheshire and then Tarporley in the same county, where her father became rector. Although their sister, Anne (d. 1805) married, both Maria and Frances remained single, and looked after their father after he was widowed in 1795 and suffered from failing health till his death in 1808. While they were at Tarporley, the family became worried about their other brother Shallcross (died 1821), also an ordained priest, who had taken to drink and horse-racing. The need to pay off his debts was the spur for the sisters to turn to writing. On their father's death in 1808, they had to find a new home and accepted an offer made by their Fitzherbert cousin, Lord St Helens (1753 ‚Äì 1839) to lend them Somersal Hall, a partly Tudor home in Somersal Herbert, Derbyshire for life. The Hall was the ancestral home of the Fitzherberts and when Frances Fitzherbert died (1806), the inheritance passed to her nephew Roger Jacson, who sold it, but was then repurchased by Lord St Helens, descendant of a different line of Fitzherberts. Shallcross's problems resurfaced, with debts totalling ¬£1760. Francis paid these off with her earnings from two further novels and with help from Roger and Maria. Shallcross died in 1821. The Jacson children were cousins to Sir Brooke Boothby, at nearby Ashbourne and a member of the Lichfield Botanical Society which brought them into contact with Enlightenment culture through Erasmus Darwin and other contemporary writers on science, as well as the literary circle of Anna Seward at Lichfield, Staffordshire. In 1829, while the sisters were staying with friends at Chelford in Cheshire Maria became suddenly ill, with a fever, and died on 10 October 1829 leaving her sister desolate.  Work  Title Page, Sketches 1811 Iris Xiphium, from Sketches Maria Jacson showed early signs of gifts in relation to botany, through drawing, horticulture and plant experiments. Darwin describes a drawing she made in 1788 of a Venus fly-trap, stating that she was \\"a lady who adds much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements\\". Maria Jacson, who was part of the first generation of women science writers, is known for her writings on botany. Her publisher placed a commendation by both Darwin and Boothby (\\"so accurately explaining a difficult science in an easy and familiar manner\\") amongst the prefaces to her first book, Botanical Dialogues (1797) written at the age of forty two, which was well received.This was originally a letter from Darwin and Boothby to Jacson written in 1795 Darwin also recommended Maria's work in his Plan for the Conduct of Female Education of that year; > But there is a new treatise introductory to botany called Botanic dialogues > for the use of schools, well adapted to this purpose, written by M. E. > Jacson, a lady well skilled in botany, and published by Johnson, London. However the book did not pass beyond a first edition, possibly because it was too advanced for the young audience for whom it was intended. For this reason she reworked the material into a more adult format in Botanical Lectures By A Lady (1804). She described the latter as follows \\"a complete elementary system, which may enable the student of whatever age to surmount those difficulties, which hitherto have too frequently impeded the perfect acquirement of this interesting science\\". She was familiar with the Lichfield Botanical Society's translation of Linnaeus' System of Vegetables (1785), for which she intended her Botanical Lectures as an introduction, but in a society that disapproved of female education, and in particular the new sexual classification of plants, she trod warily between the Linnaeans and contemporary propriety. She completed three books on Linnaean botany and plant physiology and a fourth on horticulture. Her Florist's Manual went into several editions. In her writing she faced two important obstacles, the backlash against educated women as typified by Richard Polwhele and his hostile satirical poem The Unsex'd Females (1798) and the moral concerns of a society that felt that such a delicate matter as the sexual reproduction of plants was inappropriate matter for 'female modesty' to be exposed to. Her sexual politics is evident in her resistance to Linnaeus' primacy of male sexual features in his classification system,Linnaeus first classified plants into Classes based on the number of Stamens, and then within the classes defined Orders based on the number of pistils, hence Hexandria (six stamens) Trigynia (three pistils). emphasising that the female pistil is of equal importance to the male stamen. Given the constraints on women writers of the times her books were published anonymously 'by a lady' but the introduction of Botanical Lectures is signed with the initials M.E.J. At the very end of the third edition (1827) of Florist's Manual, appear the words \\"Maria Elizabeth Jackson, Somersal Hall, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.\\" Since this contains a number of errors, it is possible it was added by the publisher. The first edition ends with \\"M.E.J., Somersal Hall\\". Her earlier writing was very much under the influence of Darwin, however her Sketches of the Physiology of Vegetable Life (1811), marked a new independent direction, which she illustrated with her own drawings. Her appreciation of the constraints placed on women writers was apparent, even in her first book, where she wrote that women must > avoid obtruding their knowledge upon the public. The world have agreed to > condemn women to the exercise of their fingers, in preference to that of > their heads; and a woman rarely does herself credit by coming forward as a > literary character. She carefully ascribes the norms she describes as those of the 'world' rather than herself, but steps back from challenging them, by advising her daughters of the dangers of being known for what you know. = Botanical Dialogues 1797 = Botanical Dialogues Between Hortensia and her Four Children, Charles, Harriet, Juliette and Henry Designed For the Use in Schools (1797) as the name suggests is constructed as conversations between her mother and her children. It makes reference to Darwin's versified botanical descriptions of The Botanic Garden (1791). It utilises the sexual differences of plants to point out the different social roles that her sons and daughters are destined to fulfil by society on account of their sex, reflections that are often bitter. While outlining the social norms, she is also at pains to distance herself from them.

In 2014, he was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing a district in the Omaha metropolitan area. In 2018, he lost re- election to Democrat Steve Lathrop. Personal life and professional career Riepe was born July 16, 1942, in rural Griswold, Iowa. He graduated from Griswold High School in 1960, then served as a hospital corpsman in the U.S. Navy from 1960 to 1963. In 1968, he received a B.S. in finance from the University of Nebraska at Omaha; in 1970, an M.A. in health policy and management from the University of Iowa. After leaving the Navy, Riepe worked in the field of health-care management. In 1964, he was named director of the Respiratory Therapy Department at Bergan Mercy Medical Center in Omaha. He eventually served, at various times, as chief operating officer and interim CEO of Bergan Mercy; as president of Mercy Hospital in Council Bluffs, Iowa; and as president of Children's Physicians, a joint venture of Omaha's Children's Hospital & Medical Center and Creighton University. After retiring from Children's Health Network in 2008, he worked as a health-care consultant. In 1974, Riepe married Janet Lee Anderson, a teacher at Benson High School in Omaha. The couple produced one son. Janet Riepe was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1978, and died of pneumonia arising therefrom in March 1996. In November 1996, Riepe married Jody Gillispie. Political career Riepe made two unsuccessful attempts to win a seat on the Ralston Public Schools Board of Education. In an election during the 1990s, he ran as an announced candidate; in 2010, he ran as a write-in. =2014 election= In November 2013, Riepe announced that he would run for the District 12 seat in the Nebraska Legislature. The district, located in southern Douglas County, included the city of Ralston and much of its school district, as well as parts of Omaha's Millard neighborhood. Under Nebraska's term-limits law, incumbent Steve Lathrop was ineligible to run in the 2014 election. 2014 primary Three candidates entered the race. Riepe, a Republican, stated that he was particularly concerned about health-care issues, and opposed to the proposed expansion of Medicaid in Nebraska under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Greg Hosch, a Democrat, was the general manager of Horsemen's Park, an Omaha horse-racing track. He had never sought office before, but had lobbied for the racing industry's interests at the Legislature. He stated that he had no fixed agenda, but would work for economic development in the district. Joseph Hering, who described himself as a moderate Republican and a fiscal conservative, was an inventory control specialist for the city of Omaha; he had not previously run for office, but had served an internship in the Legislature in 1992 and 1993. He stated that his priorities included the passage of a voter-identification law. In the nonpartisan primary election, Riepe received 2468 of the 4194 votes cast, or 58.8% of the total. Hosch came in second, with 1298 votes (30.9%); Hering received 428 votes (10.2%). 2014 general election As the top two vote-getters, Riepe and Hosch moved on to the general election. Each questioned whether the other would place the state's interests ahead of his industry's. Riepe suggested that Hosch might push a measure to allow betting on historical videotaped races at Nebraska's racetracks; the Legislature had voted to place such a measure on the 2014 ballot, but the Nebraska Supreme Court had found that aspects of the ballot measure violated provisions of Nebraska's constitution relating to referenda, and had ordered its removal. According to Riepe, the passage of such a measure would lead to decreased keno revenues for Ralston. Hosch, meanwhile, suggested that Riepe might be inclined to represent the interests of the health-care industry rather than those of the Nebraska taxpayer, should the two come into conflict. Over the course of the entire campaign, Riepe raised nearly $84,000 and spent over $88,000. Major contributions included $3000 from the Nebraska Bankers State PAC, $3000 from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry PAC, $1500 from the Associated General Contractors Highway Improvement PAC, and $1500 from the Nebraska Republican Party. Hosch raised $62,000, and spent nearly $66,000. Contributors included the Nebraska Horsemen & Benevolent Protective Association, which gave his campaign $7500; several other racing and casino organizations made smaller contributions. A number of labor organizations also contributed to his campaign: the United Transportation Union PAC gave $4000, two International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers locals gave $3750, Firefighters for Better Government gave $2000, and the Nebraska AFL‚ÄìCIO gave $1300. The Nebraska Democratic Party gave Hosch over $2700, and the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys $2000. Several organizations contributed to both candidates: the Nebraska State Education Association PAC gave each campaign $1250; the Nebraska Realtors PAC gave Riepe $2500 and Hosch $500; and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce PAC gave Riepe $2000 and Hosch $500. Turnout for the general election was approximately double that for the primary. Riepe received 5622 of the 8789 votes cast, or 64% of the total; Hosch received 3167 votes, or 36%. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the 2015 session of the Legislature, Riepe was named to the Agriculture Committee; the General Affairs Committee; and the Health and Human Services Committee. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Riepe voted against the death-penalty repeal, and to sustain Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted against the passage of LB623, then to sustain the gubernatorial veto; and he abstained in the vote on the gas-tax increase, then voted to sustain the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Riepe was listed as \\"present and not voting\\" in the bill's 29-15-5 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8-4; Riepe was among those voting against it. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Riepe voted against the bill at its passage, and against the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Riepe was among those who voted in favor of the bill.

In June 1965,Jean-Gabriel Jeudy, Les camions de chez nous en couleurs, Editions E.T.A.I. the Renault Super Go√©lette SG2 replaced the Go√©lette with new features: wide curved windscreen, replacement of the sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility suspension with coil springs (rear leaf spring suspension in 1967L'argus, 6 October 1966.), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine remained of the earlier \\"√âtendard\\" type (as used in the Renault Fr√©gate). The diesel engines were of a swirl chamber design, a 2.7-liter Saviem 580-03 was fitted to the SG 2 D and the 3-liter 591‚Äì01 to the SG 4 D. In the fall of 1962, the front end was revised: the windshield is enlarged downward, the grille is changed by abandoning its central bar and new lights were bi-colored. Inside, the dashboard was slightly changed. In 1967, the rounded headlamps became rectangular and two new variants appeared: the first a four-wheel-drive version (later called Saviem TP3)Charge-Utile n¬∞142, October 2004. and the second a front-wheel-drive called Trafic SB2. This latest version was especially designed for urban deliveries, offering a low loading floor. The shifter was moved to the floor and the rear axle was rigid with springs.L'argus, 7 December 1967. The diesel version switched to a version of Saviem's 3.0-litre four-cylinder, now with a MAN-licensed direct injection system. Two different outputs were available. Moreover, the Super Go√©lette SG2 was called Alfa Romeo-Saviem A15 in Italy. Saviem partner MAN also marketed the SG2, naming it MAN 270. For 1969 models, the diesel versions were updated to the 712 series, still with MAN's direct injection but with a longer stroke and now displacing 3.3 litres. In 1971 a three-speed automatic transmission became available on the Super Go√©lette SG2. From 1970 the Super Go√©lette SG2 and SB2 Traffic were rebranded as the Saviems SG2 and SB2.Jean-Yves Brouard and Michel Fontany, Les v√©hicules du service public de chez nous, Editions MDM. In January 1974, the SG3, incorporating dual rear wheels and rear suspension with leaf springs entered production. For 1979, the external appearance was again modernised with a large black plastic grille. On 21 April 1980, following the merger of Berliet and Saviem, the small range was sold under the RVI marque. Avia-built Renault SG3 The SG2 van was common in the 1970s before being replaced by the Master in 1980. In 1982, the remaining SG3 range was replaced by the B-series. However, the SG2 and SG3 continued in production for certain export markets. Later, SG2 and SG3 were manufactured under license in Czechoslovakia by Avia, and these were also sold with Renault badging in some countries. The truck was also produced at the state-owned \\"Madara\\" Lorry Works in Shumen, Bulgaria under licence and with the technical assistance of Avia as the Madara 201.

Since commercial milling on the site ceased in 1921 the mill has belonged to the town and is operated by Fylde Borough Council, who open it to the public during the summer. The mill also contains a museum run by the Lytham Heritage Trust which explains the history and practice of flour milling. The mill was built on Lytham marshes around 1805 on land leased by the local landowner and squire to miller Richard Cookson. Some of the mill's machinery, including a 150-year-old mainshaft of Baltic oak, was salvaged from other local mills. The plinth which now surrounds the mill was added later for safety reasons. The original smoky drying kiln, once adjacent to the mill, was moved to Kiln Street after pressure from well-to-do local residents in the growing town. The surrounding land was later levelled and grassed to form a ribbon green between the houses and the sea, in the middle of which stands the mill. In 1919 a high wind overcame the mill's braking mechanism and the sails spun out of control, causing the mill to be burnt out. Two years later the squire, John T. Clifton, donated the gutted building to the town. The shell was restored, given a new cap, a set of mock sails and used variously as a cafe, as headquarters of Lytham Cruising Club, Motorboat Club and Sea Cadets and even as an Electricity Board sub-station. In 1951 the mill was designated a grade II listed building. In 1989 it was totally restored by Fylde Borough Council and opened to the public.

As a result of his crimes, Joe Biden introduced legislation that required states to be notified by federal officials when dangerous criminals were placed in their jurisdictions. Early life Red Dog's heritage was a mix of Sioux and Assiniboine. He was a member of the Lakota tribe, and grew up on Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, in northeast Montana. He blamed poverty on his reservation for his crimes later in life; he said that there were no jobs and he could only make a living on crime. According to a family acquaintance, who asked not to be named, at age 8 or 10 Red Dog tried to emulate the lifestyle of an older half-brother whom he admired, who as of 1993 was in a federal prison. The acquaintance also said that life had \\"very little\\" to offer Red Dog. Delaware deputy attorneys Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, tried and failed to find a motive. According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: \\"There is no denying the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the simple fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders\\", he said, as well as that his killings were \\"essentially motiveless\\". Six of his eight sisters, however, said that he was not a \\"multiple and motiveless killer\\". They also said that \\"[the] people of Delaware should be thankful that our brother [...] is willing to give his life, like a man, instead of spending thousands and thousands of the taxpayers' money on appeals\\". Later life Red Dog once told a television interviewer that since his first serious crime, an armed robbery in 1973, he had been \\"prepared to die\\". Along with another man, he robbed a liquor and pizza store on the reservation in 1973. The owner was killed and Red Dog was sentenced to prison. In 1977, while on furlough from jail to attend a Native American ceremony, he escaped and fled with a companion to Los Angeles, where they met two Native American men in a bar who offered to lodge them for the night; they stabbed the men to death in their sleep. Red Dog pleaded guilty to two counts of second degree murder but was given a sentence concurrent with armed robbery; Wood said it was \\"mind- boggling\\" that he served no extra time for the murder. In the 1980s, while in an Illinois prison, he provided heroin to kill a prison gang member who had offended other inmates. Red Dog escaped from prison after being convicted of robbery and was on parole when he arrived in Delaware in 1988. He was placed there under the federal witness protection program in 1988 as a witness in an investigation about prison gangs and the militant American Indian Movement. While there he taught Sioux traditions to Delaware's Nanticoke Indians. At the time he killed Hugh Pennington, a 30-year-old motel night auditor and friend of Red Dog's wife Bonnie Red Dog, he was living outside Wilmington with Bonnie who worked as a secretary; Pennington and his mother lived nearby. Pennington also worked at the Tally Ho Motor Lodge with Bonnie. In February 1991 Red Dog drove north to Pennington's suburban Wilmington home in New Castle County. He appeared in Pennington's kitchen on February 9th, 1991 after a day spent drinking. He woke Pennington, still in pajamas, and forced him into a basement workshop. According to Wood, Pennington said or did \\"something very minor\\" that in Red Dog's homicidal state was enough to enrage him. Red Dog tied his wrists and ankles with duct tape and electrical cord, and forced him to lie on his back on the floor, then cut his throat. According to prosecutors he took off his boots so they wouldn't be stained with blood. He nearly decapitated Pennington with his knife; the wound was 6 inches deep. During the next 12 hours, he kidnapped a 52-year-old female witness, raped her in her home, then forced her to drive him to southern Delaware where he raped her again, a total of four times. She escaped and called police. He had earlier told companions that he was a \\"terminator\\". He also said \\"I hurt people\\", according to court records. This murder led to his being sentenced to death in April 1992. Four days later, police caught Red Dog 100 miles from where he was last seen, walking across Winchester Bridge in Wilmington. He had a strange odor; he later told his lawyer that he had smeared himself with deer feces to divert police dogs. When charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and four counts of rape, he pleaded no contest, saying he had been so drunk that he did not remember the killing. He could not think of a motive either, blaming childhood poverty and life in prison. He suggested in the television interview that Pennington might have done something to trigger hate he developed in prison. Execution Red Dog requested the death sentence and refused to appeal it because it would violate his warrior's code. He told a judge he wanted \\"no appeals or motions for stay of execution\\". Red Dog's family supported his decision not to fight the sentence. His relatives said that he was going to his death with dignity and was \\"proud that he's giving in return for what he took: a life\\". Red Dog became the second convict to be executed since Delaware reinstated executions in 1992. Steven Brian Pennell, executed in March 1992, was the first; prior to that, none had taken place since 1946. Red Dog decried the \\"festive\\" atmosphere of the Pennell execution and said he hoped \\"that my execution will be conducted with more solemnity than a circus act!\\" Edward C. Pankowski Jr., Red Dog's lawyer and a former prosecutor who joined the public defender's office, tried in vain to convince Red Dog to appeal the sentence. At the hearing to determine Red Dog's sentence he told Pankowski not to present mitigating evidence. The Delaware Superior Court judge rejected motion by lawyers to block his execution. His lawyers, who were public defenders, filed a motion asking the court to order psychiatric and psychological tests to determine if he was mentally competent to request execution; Judge Norman A. Barron said that he found \\"no substantial showing that Red Dog is currently incompetent\\" and that the court would respect Red Dog's \\"rationally based wishes\\". Red Dog wrote in court papers in 1992 that he \\"[wanted] to expedite this for the families\\", both his and those of his victims. The defense attorney said he did not have a trial because he expressed a lot of remorse and wanted to spare the Pennington family the \\"whole trial stage\\". He was to have received his lethal injection in July 1992, as ordered by Judge Barron, but under Delaware law the death sentence was automatically appealed to the State Supreme Court, so Judge Barron's ruling wasn't upheld until November; the case was rescheduled for March 3. Red Dog sent for John H. Morsette, 52, a tribal medicine man he said he met almost a decade before at a Native American purification ceremony in Montana. Prison officials were initially reluctant to have Morsette inside the chamber, saying only a prison chaplain was allowed there, but they approved it on Thursday. Morsette, also from Poplar, Montana, said he did not remember meeting Red Dog but would come to pray with him to prepare him for the Sioux afterlife. He conducted Native American rites over Red Dog for about two minutes and placed a necklace over his head. Red Dog was executed by injection on March 3 at the State Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, 15 miles north of Dover. He was 39 years old at the time. After receiving last rites from Morsette, Red Dog said \\"I'd like to thank my family and friends and [attorney Edward] Pankowski for supporting me and all others who treated me with kindness\\". As the drugs were administered, he choked and told his wife \\"I'm going home, babe\\". At about 10 am, his final words were to thank his supporters and curse the rest of the witnesses. According to witnesses he died with his left eye open. He was pronounced dead at 10:28 am. Red Dog's body was released to be transported by Amtrak train in Wilmington, Delaware to Wolf Point, Montana shortly thereafter. Because of the special circumstances, Amtrak I. A. Supervisor Kenneth Wilson was delegated to accompany the remains back to the final destination. Aftermath Steven Wood, Delaware state prosecutor, said that an earlier execution would have saved the lives of four of Red Dog's victims. As a result of Red Dog's crimes, Joe Biden introduced legislation that required federal officials to notify states when dangerous criminals were placed in their jurisdictions.

Together with researchers in Holland, Sheldon was responsible for the discovery that coeliac disease is related to wheat products in the diet. Education and career Wilfrid Percy Henry Sheldon was born on 23 November 1901 at Woodford, Essex. He attended Bancroft's School in Woodford, King's College, London, and King's College Hospital, London, graduating from the latter in 1923. In 1926, he was appointed consulting pediatrician at King's College Hospital and became consultant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street several years later. He was one of the few full-time early practitioners of pediatric medicine in Britain during this era, when volunteer hospital consultants were not paid for their services. During the Second World War, Sheldon organized hospitals for children evacuated from London. In 1947 he became director of the department of child health at King's College Hospital. Sir Wilfrid was Physician-Pediatrician to the Household of Queen Elizabeth II from 1952 to 1971, a period spanning the childhoods of the royal siblings Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward. He also maintained a private practice in Harley Street, London. As an advisor in child health to the Department of Health (United Kingdom) from 1952 to 1961, Sheldon was closely involved in establishing pediatric medical programs under the National Health Service.

As chairman of Ferranti from 1930 to 1963, he was responsible for evolving the company into a diverse multimillion-pound organisation recognized as an industry leader in electrical engineering, electronics and avionics.Ferranti and the British Electrical Industry J F Wilson Early life Ferranti was educated at Repton School, and had two years of training at Yarrow shipyards in Scotstoun. He fought in World War I in the service of the Royal Engineers. During his service, he rose to the rank of Captain, and was awarded the Military Cross. His elder brother, Major Basil Francis Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, also a Military Cross recipient in World War I, was killed in action. Career After the death of his elder brother, Vincent became heir apparent. When he returned from military service in 1921, Vincent joined Ferranti as a manager in the transformer department. Vincent jointly developed and patented surge absorbers to protect transformers from lightning strikes, which aided Ferranti's ability to produce high voltage transformers for export. In 1904 Dr Ferranti lost control of his company when it went into voluntary receivership, and after restructuring in 1905 he only held 10% of the shares.Ferranti Timeline ‚Äì Museum of Science and Industry (Accessed 29-05-2015)‚Äô‚Äô This resulted in him being effectively excluded from company business by the receiver managers until 1922, when a share restructuring meant that he and Vincent held 29% of the total equity allowing them to regain control of the company. However, it wasn't until 1928 that Dr Ferranti became chairman again. In 1923, Vincent and R. Schofield visited A.B. Cooper, the general manager of Ferranti Canada. Vincent realised that there was greater potential to expand transformer operations in the emerging Canadian market than in the UK market. After returning to the UK, Vincent gave Cooper the green light to go ahead with plans to double the Canadian factory output. Ball & VardalasFerranti Packard: Pioneers in Canadian Electrical Manufacturing Norman R Ball, John N Vardalas consider that this visit forged a special relationship between Cooper and Vincent that would last for the next thirty years and help Canadian small transformer technology transfer back to the parent company. During the 1920s, Dr. Ferranti diversified manufacturing into radio, and his team, led by Albert Hall, produced the Standard Model A21 allowing Ferranti to compete with other manufacturers. Vincent improved the performance of Ferranti‚Äôs radio model by adding valve (or vacuum tube) production. Vacuum tubes were produced at a plant in Stalybridge.Ferranti Down the Years Retrieved 7 March 2015 Later, Wilson identified this as a crucial decision because valves were the fundamental component of radios. After seeing Professor Finch perform a valve demonstration at the Physical Society, Vincent employed two of Finch's students (R. W. Sutton and M. E. Sions) in combination with Arthur Chilcott from General Electric and Kenyon Taylor, a Ferranti engineer. This group formed the nucleus of a team which would eventually become Ferranti Electronics. After the death of his father in 1930, Vincent became the chairman and chief executive of Ferranti. Around 1933, seeing the business potential of television, he assigned Taylor to research this new medium. By 1935 he had acquired larger premises at Moston to expand the company's domestic product line. In the expansion, accountant Sir John Toothill and chief engineer Dr. N. H. Searby were employed. As World War II approached, Ferranti diverted manufacturing from radio and TV to IFF radar and government work. Toothill was dispatched to Edinburgh to set up what would eventually become Ferranti Scotland, establishing Ferranti as one of Britain's leading electrical, electronics and avionics manufacturers. Mr M Stewart, stated that this move was the birth of the electronics industry in Scotland, indicating that Messrs. Ferranti Ltd. would be the first parent firm to receive electronics industry development government contracts. In 1946, Vincent became president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), the first time in IEE history that a son had followed his father into that position. In 1948, he was knighted in recognition of Ferranti's contribution to the war effort. In 1949, the British government contracted Ferranti to collaborate with the Bristol Aeroplane Company on a major guided missile project that was later known as the Bloodhound project. Vincent set up a Research & Development laboratory in Canada, led by Kenyon Taylor, to develop Datar,The Computer Revolution in Canada: Building National Technological Competence (History of Computing) John N Vardalas In 1957 he sold off the radio and television business to EKCO a move which allowed Ferranti to focus on commercial business. In 1963, he sold off Ferranti UK's non-military computer operations, which included the design rights to the Ferranti-Packard 6000 computer. According to Vardalas, this decision killed off the Ferranti-Packard computer business. By the time his eldest son, Sebastian, became chairman in 1963, the company was capitalised at ¬£22m. =Positions held= * 1930 Chairman and Chief Executive Ferranti * 1938 Chairman ‚Äì British Electrical and Allied Manufacturer's Association (BEAMA) * 1946 President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers * 1948 Knighthood bestowed on him * 1950 Chairman of the World Power Conference's international executive committee =Personal life= Ferranti had two sons, Sebastian and Basil, and three daughters.Peerage He died at his home Henbury Hall, Henbury, Cheshire) on 20 May 1980.

The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the public audit body for the Republic of Ireland and is headed by the C&AG.; The Comptroller and Auditor General is ex-officio member of the Standards in Public Office Commission and of the Referendum Commission. The C&AG; is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. The current Comptroller and Auditor-General is Seamus McCarthy (since 28 May 2012). Constitutional officer and independence The office of Comptroller and Auditor General was established under Article 33 of the Constitution of Ireland. The C&AG; is appointed by the President on the nomination of D√°il √âireann. The office has its origins in Article 62 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State of 1922 as implemented by the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act 1923, which provided that the Comptroller and Auditor- General () (as the office was then known) was to be appointed by D√°il √âireann. The 1923 Act and the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 are the two principal legislative instruments governing the C&AG.; Both the Constitutional and legislative provisions ensure the absolute independence of the C&AG; and the Office of the C&AG; to operate independently of government. The C&AG; makes reports to D√°il √âireann on the accounts of bodies falling within its remit, essentially the State or State bodies and certain specified agencies or bodies receiving State funds. The reports are examined in detail by the D√°il Committee of Public Accounts ().For the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts see Appendix 1 to Function The Comptroller and Auditor General audits and reports on the use of public funds. It establishes that they are legal and used appropriately. It also examines the internal audit systems of public bodies and applies tests for value for money and effectiveness. The bodies to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General are laid down by law. The Comptroller and Auditor General may receive new audit mandates from time to time regarding specific state bodies. It may lose its functions when bodies are dissolved, merged or rationalised. The C&AG; may not audit all recipients of state funding but only where audits of the recipient bodies are permitted or required by law. As a result, some bodies which receive a large amount of state funding or even are reliant on it, may not be subject to audit by the C&AG.; This also has consequences for the remit of the D√°il Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The C&AG; has permanent status as a witness at the PAC, and attends all meetings in person or deputed to a senior staff official. =Annual reports on the Accounts of the Public Service= The C&AG; makes an annual report under the heading \\"Accounts of the Public Services\\" on funding granted by the Oireachtas. This includes the accounts of 41 government departments and offices, including the establishment of the President of Ireland, as well as bodies such as the Garda S√≠och√°na, prisons service, and the secret service. It publishes the relevant annual appropriation accounts together with the annual reports. =Health sector= The C&AG; is responsible for auditing institutions in the health sector such as the Health Service Executive (HSE) and all regional health boards. It also audits specified hospitals, and a variety of health-related state agencies. It does not audit privately owned hospitals even though they may be in receipt of, or even reliant on, public funds. If the C&AG; considers problematic issues arise in relation to a regional health board which merit a public accountability audit, it may issue what is known as a Section 6 report, authorised by Section 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993. =Educational sector= In the education sector, the C&AG; audits all Irish Universities, institutes of technology and other specified third-level educational institutions such as the National College of Art and Design. It audits all vocational educational committees. It also audits specified state bodies related to education such as the Higher Education Authority and the Royal Irish Academy. If the C&AG; considers problematic issues arise in relation to a Vocational Education Committee which merit a public accountability, it may issue what is known as a Section 7 report, authorized by Section 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993. =Financial sector= The Comptroller and Auditor General audits 25 state bodies in the financial sector including the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). =Other audited bodies= The Comptroller and Auditor General audits a very wide variety (115 in 2012) of State bodies or agencies as diverse as the National Library of Ireland, the Road Safety Authority and the Abbey Theatre. It audits all 35 County Enterprise Boards. =North/South bodies= The Comptroller and Auditor General carries out audits of the annual accounts of designated North/South public bodies with cross-border functions or activities relating to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. These reports are prepared jointly with the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland. Where it is considered that an issue of public accountability arises, a report is drawn up. An interesting example of cross-border cooperation between the two comptrollers and auditors general is seen in the Bytel cross- border broadband project where the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Ireland made a coordinated examination of the Bytel project. Although the two comptrollers and auditors general issued separate reports, they were issued simultaneously on 3 March 2015 and the report of each comptroller and auditor general was annexed to the report of the other. This coordinated examination was the first time this approach has been used. =Value for money reports= The office publishes special reports on value-for-money according to orthodox value-for-money criteria (efficiency, economy, effectiveness evaluation systems, procedures, practices) used by public audit bodies. =Special reports= The C&AG; from time to time publishes special reports on specific or general issues arising from audits, inspections or examinations carried out by him or his office. Bodies not audited The C&AG; does not audit commercial semi-state bodies even when these are overwhelmingly owned by the state. Examples include the ESB (Electricity Supply Board) or Bord na M√≥na (the Peat Board) both of which are 95% owned by the state. Likewise it does not audit the accounts of Irish Water.

Animal Bars were especially popular during the 1960s and 1970s, thus many adults who were children at that time remember them fondly. They are still sold to this day, in either a single 19 gram bar (for ¬£0.25), or a four- pack of these for ¬£1.00. The original bars had numerous animal heads molded on them, not just two. Animals available There are a total of nine animals that can possibly be on Animal Bars: * Antelope * Monkey * Parrot * Iguana * Lion * Bear * Leopard * Zebra * Rhino Some people have also had deer on their Animal Bars, but they are rare.

Project brings emphasis on web site certification, since internet is becoming prevailing media for promotion and search of business opportunities and partners.  Principles  The project is built on three pillars: * institution of trust, preferably a chamber of commerce, assuming the role of issuer * credit rating data provided by credit rating agency * technology that enables easy verification of certificate validity and consequently prevents dilution of trust caused by forgery ().  Criteria  The Excellent SME certificate can be obtained by companies meeting basic criteria: * small or medium enterprise (usually up to 250 employees, other measures may apply in different countries) * minimum turnover of 25000 ‚Ç¨ * credit score at least 6 (out of 10), BBB in some credit scoring systems. The certificate is issued for period of 1 year. However the credit score is under permanent monitoring and the certificate is revoked prematurely if the holder's credit score drops below 6. Suggested benefits = For certificate holder = By publishing the certificate the holder exposes its good standing business and successful practices. The publishing is possible on holder's web site, stationery, promotional materials, vehicles etc. The observer can thus instantly establish the level of trust that would otherwise require some inquiries with credit rating agencies. As a consequence a selection of business partner becomes easier, faster, cheaper and risk free. = For the community = With growing number of certified companies the business environment becomes more transparent. Good enterprises are more exposed and visible and client have easier task finding such partner.  History  Project was initiated in 2012 in Slovenia by partners Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia,http://www.gzs.si/en/ credit rating agency and technology provider CONNET d.o.o. with its Serbia joined the project the same year. In 2013 Macedonia and Romania followed. In 2014 Bulgaria joined.

It is located on 230 Second Street in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts. History The Borden house at 92 Second Street in the late 1800s From 1874 to 1892, the house was the property of Andrew Borden, Lizzie's father, who was a member of Fall River high society. After Lizzie's trial and acquittal for murdering her father and stepmother in the home, she bought another house located at 7 French Street that she named 'Maplecroft'. Lizzie lived there until her death on June 1, 1927. The house number of 92 Second Street was changed to 230 in 1896. Today It has operated as a bed and breakfast since 1996 under the ownership of Martha McGinn who inherited the house. Martha's grandparents purchased the house on August 4, 1948. According to Martha McGinn, the room where Lizzie's stepmother Abby Borden was found murdered is the \\"most requested room\\" of the bedrooms at the bed and breakfast. The Fall River Historical Society promotes the Lizzie Borden bed and breakfast as a tourist attraction. Tours of the house often make reference to the possibility of ghostly activity, and in their book The Ghost Chronicles, self-proclaimed \\"medium\\" Maureen Wood and self-proclaimed \\"paranormal scientist\\" Ron Kolek describe experiencing ghostly events in the house. However, investigator of claims of the paranormal Joe Nickell reports that these claims are based upon either unverifiable personal feelings of a ghostly presence or the use of well-known and well-understand techniques like table-tipping that, like ouija board and dowsing rod effects, involve the ideomotor effect rather than the presence of a ghostly spirit.  In popular culture  *\\"Thin Lizzie\\", a 2015 episode of The CW series Supernatural (season 11, episode 5) involved a series of murders centered on the Lizzie Borden House Bed & Breakfast. It, however, does not depict the actual outside of the house nor the people working inside it favorably. *Nuka World, an expansion pack for the 2015 post-apocalyptic video game Fallout 4 features a house that resembles the Winchester Mystery House where a narrator tells the story of a young girl named Lucy who murdered her parents. *A heavy metal / glam band from Los Angeles chose the name Lizzie Borden.

Its type species is Riabininohadros weberi, emended to Riabininohadros weberae. It was originally classified as a species of Orthomerus, until 2015. Discovery and history Restored as a hadrosaur It was originally named Orthomerus weberi when first described by Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin in 1945 for hindlimb elements from an unnamed Maastrichtian-age formation in Crimea of what is now Ukraine (then a part of the Soviet Union). These were in 1934 near Bakhchysarai found by G.T. Weber who is honoured in the specific name. The find was in 1937 reported in the scientific literature.Weber, G.F., 1937, \\"From Yalta via the village of Kokkoz to Bakhchysarai\\", in: Mezhdunarodnyi Geological Congress, XVII sessiya. Yuzhnaya ekskursiya, Krymskaya ASSR, Moiseev, A.A., Ed., Moscow‚ÄìLeningrad: Glavn. Red. Geol. Razved. Liter., 1937: 48‚Äì58 As Weber was female, Lev Nesov in 1995 emended the name to Orthomerus weberae so the ending of the species name was also feminine. Although tossed as a nomen dubium in recent reviews of Hadrosauridae,Weishampel, David B.; Horner, Jack R. (1990). \\"Hadrosauridae\\".

Dinologia, 10 pp. [In Russian]. http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2015_Riabininohadros_Crimean_hadrosaur.pdf As this publication did not meet the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, \\"Riabininohadros\\" was not a valid name for the taxon until the name was formally published as new by Lopatin and Averianov in 2020. The holotype, specimen ZGTM 5751, was found in a marine deposit. It largely consists of a left hindlimb, including the thighbone, the shinbone, the calf bone, the astragalus, the calcaneus, the second and third metatarsal and the first phalanx of the second toe. In 2018, it transpired that Riabinin had misidentified several elements. Also a part of the right calf bone proved to be present. A postcranial juvenile skeleton in 1965 excavated at Aleshino, was considered to represent a different species, a hadrosaurid.Lopatin, A.V., Averianov, A.O., & Alifanov, V.R., 2018, \\"New Data on Dinosaurs of the Crimean Peninsula\\", Dokl. Biol. Sci., 482: 206‚Äì209 Classification As Orthomerus has typically been classified within or very close to Hadrosauridae, Riabininohadros weberae was placed similarly by reviews of the family. However, as discussed by Lopatin and Averianov in 2020, the femur of Riabininohadros is very distinctive, and has no morphological equivalents within Iguanodontia, the clade that includes hadrosaurs and their relatives. Instead, Lopatin and Averianov, in view of its basal astragalus, classified Riabininohadros as a primitive member of the Ankylopollexia, more specially the Styracosterna, well outside Hadrosauroidea, with uncertain relationships to other taxa in the clade.

The two highways shared a very short (~20m) concurrence before PR 263 left the concurrence and continued west for to meet southbound PR 270. From PR 270, PR 263 continued north for to its northern terminus at the south boundary of Riding Mountain National Park. The road continued into the park past several church camps and public campsites along the southwestern shore of Clear Lake. The route was gravel for most of its length, except for the section of the route between PR 270 and Onanole. PR 263 was designated as an east-west route except for the section between Riding Mountain National Park and PR 270, which was designated as north-south.  History  In the early 1990s, the Manitoba government decommissioned a number of provincial secondary roads and returned the maintenance of these roads back to the rural municipalities. PR 263 was one of the roads that was decommissioned entirely. After PR 263 was decommissioned, PR 262 was rerouted onto the section between its former junction with PR 263 and Onanole. PR 270 was extended on to the paved section to Onanole and maintained that designation until 1997, when the road was redesignated as PR 354, reconfiguring PR 270 to its current northbound terminus.

Parallel Infrastructure is a leading build-to-suit tower operator with nearly 500 macro cell towers across the US and several hundred more under contract or in late-stage development. The Company counts all major US wireless carriers as customers, including AT&T;, Verizon and T-Mobile, which lease space on towers under long-term contracts. On May 3, 2017, Lendlease, one of the world's largest development, property, infrastructure, and construction firms, has announced that it has acquired the Parallel Infrastructure portfolio of telecommunications towers and development positions across the United States, from Florida East Coast Industries a part of Fortress Investment Group. On Oct 14th, 2020, Apollo Global Management, Inc. announced that certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo (‚ÄúApollo Funds‚Äù) have acquired from Lendlease a US telecommunications platform, including a portfolio of operating cell towers and a pipeline of contracted towers under development. The acquired company will rebrand itself as Parallel Infrastructure (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), the same name it held prior to being acquired by Lendlease in 2017. See >> press release  History  Parallel Infrastructure's history dates back more than 100 years. As Henry Flagler bought land and expanded his railroad empire from Jacksonville down to Key West, he also invested in new roads, stations, and other infrastructure to support his venture. His investments allowed for the founding and settlement of several new communities along the eastern coastline, including West Palm Beach in 1894. Miami, then known as Biscayne Bay, was a small settlement of around 400 prior to the arrival of Flagler's rail line. Thirty years later, Miami's population had grown to more than 100,000. Despite changes in ownership and a lingering bankruptcy process that began in 1931 and lasted 30 years, Florida East Coast Railway remained a significant property owner and developer. In 1983, then-owner St. Joe Company split off Florida East Coast Railway's real estate arm ‚Äì then called Flagler Development‚Äîand placed the two companies under the control of a new holding company, FOXX Holdings. The company's name was changed in April 2006 to Florida East Coast Industries. In 2007, Fortress Investment Group announced it was purchasing Florida East Coast Industries for $3.5 billion. The next year, Fortress fully split off Florida East Coast Railway from FECI, turning them into two separate, distinct companies. In 2012, as part of a strategic realignment, FECI took its internal department focusing on right-of-way asset development and incorporated it as Parallel Infrastructure. In 2013, the company built and launched a new fiber optic network along the Florida East Coast Railway ROW between Miami and Jacksonville. This fiber optic network was made available to telephone and wireless companies, utility companies, cable companies, data centers, municipalities, and other healthcare and educational businesses that transmit large amounts of data. On May 3, 2017, Lendlease, one of the world's largest development, property, infrastructure, and construction firms, has announced that it has acquired the Parallel Infrastructure portfolio of telecommunications towers and development positions across the United States, from Florida East Coast Industries. On Oct 14th, 2020, Apollo Global Management, Inc. acquired Parallel Infrastructure from Lendlease.

It is approximately long and flows through Beaver Township in Columbia County and Black Creek Township in Luzerne County. The watershed of the stream has an area of at least . The stream was historically used as a water supply and one bridge crosses it. It is in the vicinity of Buck Mountain. Course Falls Run begins in a valley on Buck Mountain in Beaver Township, Columbia County. It flows east for more than a mile in the valley before exiting Beaver Township and Columbia County. Upon exiting Columbia County, Falls Run enters Black Creek Township, Luzerne County and continues flowing east. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northeast, leaving the mountain and entering the community of Rock Glen. It then turns north, leaving Rock Glen and flowing alongside Black Creek. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Black Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Falls run is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is between above sea level. The mouth of Falls Run is located near Buck Mountain and a hill known as Middle Hill. Part of the stream is situated to the west of a gorge known as the Black Creek Gorge. An area in the vicinity of Falls Run may overlay the a coal bed known as the Buck Mountain Bed. However, an 1895 book noted that it had not been demonstrated that this was the case. Watershed The watershed of Falls Run has an area of at least . Falls Run is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Nuremberg. Falls Run is one of eleven officially named streams in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek that has not been assessed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. History Falls Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202216. It was added because it appeared in the Atlas of the Anthracite Coalfields of Pennsylvania, which was published in 1888. In the early 1800s, the portion of the stream that flowed through Luzerne County was in Sugarloaf Township, not Black Creek Township. In the early 1900s, Falls Run was used as a water supply for the village of Rock Glen, a mining community that had a population of approximately 300 people at the time. The water supply was at one point owned by the Tomhicken Water Company before later being owned by the Wyoming Water Company. It was used as a domestic water supply in Rock Glen. The Pennsylvania Railroad also used the stream as a water supply. The water was supplied to it via gravity. A stone arch bridge over Falls Run was proposed as early as 1906. It was to be on the road from Rock Glen to Conyngham and would have cost $550. A concrete slab bridge carrying T-309/Park Street was constructed across Falls Run in 1936.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Timothy (2 Corinthians 1:1) in Macedonia in 55‚Äì56 CE. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 21 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 6‚Äì7,14‚Äì15) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) Verse 2 : I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago ‚Äì whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows ‚Äì such a one was caught up to the third heaven. NKJV *\\"I know a man in Christ\\": refers to Paul himself, as he speaks in the first person in 2 Corinthians 12:7. Paul speaks in the third person to show his humility and modesty. He says himself a \\"man\\", not to distinguish from an angel or any other creature; maybe only to express his gender (the Syriac version uses a distinct masculine word) or just to denote a person. * \\"Fourteen years ago\\": could refer either to the time of Paul's conversion or the time of his rapture, which could be in the period of the three days after the conversion, when he was blind, didn't eat nor drink, or many years after the conversion. Most probably, it was not in Damascus, but when Paul was again in Jerusalem, while praying in the temple, and was in a trance (). Lightfoot places Paul's conversion in 34 AD, the rapture into the third heaven in 43, at the time of the famine during the reign of Claudius (), when he was in a trance in Jerusalem (), and the writing of this epistle in 57. Bishop Usher puts the conversion in 35, his rapture in 46, and the writing of this epistle in 60. *\\"The third heaven\\": that is so-called \\"the seat of the divine Majesty, and the residence of the holy angels\\", in comparison to the \\"airy\\" and \\"starry\\" heavens. Paul refers to a distinction in the Jewish belief of \\"the supreme heaven, the middle heaven, and the lower heaven\\".Targum in 2 Chron. vi. 18. *\\"Whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell, God knows\\": Either similar to Elijah who was carried with soul and body in a chariot with horses of fire; or as Moses was disembodied for a time,De Somniis, p. 570. Philo says that Moses was \\"without the body\\", during his stay of forty days and forty nights in the mount or in a visionary way, as John was \\"in the Spirit\\" on the Lord's day (), and Ezekiel was taken by a lock of his head, lifted up by the Spirit between earth and heaven, and brought \\"in the visions of God to Jerusalem\\", it cannot be ascertained as Paul himself did not know.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, 2 Corinthians 12:2 Verse 7 : And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure.

His father, a graduate of St. John's College, Cambridge was a founder of Concord, Massachusetts as well as the first minister in the community. Gershom Bulkeley was an early graduate of Harvard University, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1655 and possibly his master's degree in 1658. After receiving his master's degree he might have married Sarah Chauncy, daughter of then Harvard President, Charles Chauncy. In 1661 became the minister of the Congregational church in New London, Connecticut, where he served for roughly 5 years. He then became minister of the Congregational church in the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut where he served until 1677. He left the ministry and practiced as a physician in Glastonbury. When the Salem Witch Trials spread from Massachusetts to Connecticut in the autumn of 1692, he expressed considerable scepticism about the evidence, saying that he had heard nothing of any weight to convince him that anyone was guilty of witchcraft. In particular he argued that Marcy Disborough, one of the only two women accused in Connecticut who actually stood trial for witchcraft, was the victim of the malice of her neighbours. Mercy was founded guilty and sentenced to death, but received a reprieve. She was set free and died some time after 1709. He has been mentioned in the work of historical fiction, The Witch of Blackbird Pond, as a tutor of a student named John Holbrook, who is learning to be a minister.

As of 1851, it was one of two charitable funds established for purposes relative to those who had been unfortunate in the practice of the fine arts, the other being the Artists' General Benevolent Institution. As of 1852, it consisted of two separate and distinct branches: the Artists' Annuity Fund, and the Artists' Benevolent Fund. The first was supported by the contributions of its members, for their own relief in sickness or superannuation. All artists of merit in painting, sculpture, architecture, and engraving, were eligible to become members, the annual payments to which were regulated by the age of the member, increasing a small sum every year. The amount of funded property was ¬£14,900, exclusively the property of the members themselves. The second was supported by the patrons of the Fine Arts, for the relief of the widows and orphans of the members of the Annuity Fund. And the whole was under the direction of the president, and ten subscribers to the Benevolent Fund, annually elected by the subscribers, and five members of the Annuity Fund, annually elected by its members. Every artist proposed as a member of the Annuity Fund, had to be balloted for, and approved by the committee of the Benevolent Fund, in order to entitle his widow and children to its benefits. The benefits of this fund were extended to about 40 widows and 22 orphans, the former receiving ¬£18, and the latter ¬£5 annually. The income for this purpose was about ¬£1,200 per annum, derived half from dividends, and the other half from present voluntary contributions.

He had little formal education but eventually went to Bala College in his twenties, where he was influenced by Michael D. Jones. Ministry in the Aberdare Valley He was ordained at Horeb, Llwydcoed and Elim, Cwmdare in 1859 and remained there until 1865. In that year he gave uo his pastorate in order to join the first group of migrants to Patagonia. He was presented with a testimonial at Horeb although some of the members expressed doubts about the venture. Abraham Matthews in Patagonia In May 1865, Matthews sailed from Liverpool on the Mimosa and was a member of the first party of Welsh settlers to leave for Patagonia. The ship arrived in South America on 28 July 1865 and the settlers landed at what later became known as Porth Madryn. The settlers had very few resources and Matthews was struck by a serious illness while crossing the prairie between Porth Madryn and the Camwy valley. He was instrumental in persuading the settlers to remain in Patagonia when several of their number sought to abandon the enterprise. For many years he was the leading figure in the Welsh settlement and was known as Esgob y Wladfa (the Bishop of the settlement). He remained in Patagonia for the rest of his life, although paying several visits to Wales. He died in April 1899. He left a widow, Gwenllian, whom he had married in 1862.

One man relates the story of how two kisses that's been given him turned into the babies and started to multiply.

All of us instantly recognized in Mayakovsky a revolutionary, even if his hectic sermons to the human souls, mutilated by the vile city, sounded a bit muddled.

Two days before the premiere all the original cast withdrew because rumours started to spread across the city that actors on stage would be thrown garbage at and beaten up by the public. Mayakovsky had to look for substitutes and settle for amateurs, mostly art students. The supporting actors, most of whom just stood on stage wearing white hoods, faces concealed behind cardboard symbols (painted by Pavel Filonov), and were looking out from time to time only to pronounce cues, were visibly frightened. The (mostly middle-class) public was hostile and behaved as aggressively as Mayakovsky who was pacing up and down the stage, throwing invectives at them. As his character, The Poet, having received his \\"three tears\\" (one looking more like a cannonball) started to pack them into his suit-case, some people in the audience started shouting: \\"Stop him immediately!.. Catch him!.. He is not to get away!.. Make him give us back our money!\\" One of the rotten eggs hurled hit Mayakovsky's shoulder. Later several papers accused the author and his cast of crookery and demanded them to be taken to justice. =Later critical reception= Both Luna Park shows, on December 2 and 4, were negatively reviewed by the press. \\"[The tragedy] was torn down to pieces,\\" Mayakovsky conceded in his autobiography. \\"The uproar which followed was of such proportions that the expected hits of the season, performances in Petersburg by actor Max Linder and child prodigy conductor Willy Ferrero, came and went almost unnoticed. Throughout Russia, in Riga, Taganrog, Ryazan, Kertch, Yekaterinodar, Warsaw numerous reviews were published, quite extraordinary in their fervency. Never before a stage production has been destroyed with such fierceness by the press across the whole country,\\" biographer A.Mikhaylov wrote. \\"Who's more insane, the Futurists or the public?\\", Peterburgskaya Gazeta enquired rhetorically. \\"We won't recall another such case of a theatrical stage abuse,\\" maintained Peterburgsky Listok, dismissing the text of the poem as \\"white fever delirium.\\" \\"The society that responds by laughter to being spat upon, should be ashamed of itself,\\" Teatralnaya Zhyzns reviewer wrote. After 1917 the Soviet critics hailed the play as a \\"daring swipe at the bourgeois values,\\" admiring the way the author has \\"dethroned the old, decrepit God who'd lost all ability to do anything for people, to place a Poet protagonist upon the pedestal.\\" See also *The Gas Heart External links  References  Category:1914 plays Category:Plays by Vladimir Mayakovsky ","title":"Vladimir Mayakovsky (tragedy)"},{"id":"45577911","text":"The Alliance for Space Development is a space advocacy organization dedicated to influencing space policy towards the goal of permanent human settlements in space.

It has resulted in 19 men being jailed for child sexual offences, rape and trafficking. Police investigation In March 2013, it was reported that 42 possible victims of crime had been approached as part of the initial inquiry, and that up to 34 further names of possible victims had been passed to the police. However, Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk expressed concern over the slow progress of the inquiry, and questioned whether officers were winning the trust of victims. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said in May 2013 that about 550 officers were working on Operation Doublet. He said that the investigation was at \\"an extremely sensitive stage\\", and that street grooming was the force's top priority, \\"a bigger priority than gun crime\\". He said that the investigation was looking at cases in Rochdale dating back to 2003. Charges In May 2012, nine men were arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a child; the men were not thought to have known each other. In March 2015, a tenth man was arrested for offences relating to two victims aged 13 and 14. In March 2015, the ten men aged between 26 and 45 were charged with serious sex offences against a total of seven females who were aged between 13 and 23 at the time of the offences. The offences took place in Rochdale between 2005 and 2013, and included rape, conspiracy to rape, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual activity with a child, and sexual assault. Ian Wiggett, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester Police said that, thus far, 65 people had been arrested as part of Operation Doublet. He said: \\"This is an extremely complex and challenging investigation which... will continue over the coming months and further arrests are anticipated.\\" Four more men were jailed in September 2016 with a further five in February 2017. Sentences Ten men were sentenced to jail: * Afraz Ahmed (33), guilty of 12 counts, 25 years in prison. * Choudhry Ikhalaq Hussain (38), guilty of 6 counts, 19 years in prison.

Life  The family's surname (erroneously spelled Œ†Œ±œÅœÉŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ, Parsakountenos, in some manuscripts) derives from the locality of \\"Parsakoute\\" (Œ†Œ±œÅœÉŒ±Œ∫ŒøœçœÑŒ∑). His father, Theodoulos Parsakoutenos, married a lady from the mighty clan of the Phokades, apparently a daughter of the general Bardas Phokas the Elder, father of the general and future emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (reigned 963‚Äì969). Theodore had two (probably younger) brothers, Bardas and Nikephoros. Theodore is first mentioned in 962, at which time he held the rank of patrikios and the post of strategos of an unnamed theme. He undertook a raid into the Hamdanid domains around Manbij with a force of 1,000 (according to Abu Firas) or 1,300 (according to Ibn Zafir) riders. The local Hamdanid governor, Abu Firas, led out a force of 70 soldiers with which he defeated a detachment of Theodore's men, recovering the plunder they had taken, but on his return to Manbij, Abu Firas was captured and brought as a prisoner to Constantinople. Theodore tried to have his prisoner, a cousin of the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, exchanged for his father and one of his brothers, captured at Hadath in 954, but apparently without success until 966, when Abu Firas and other Arab captives were exchanged for Byzantines held by the Hamdanids. Shortly after, in December 962, Nikephoros Phokas, then still commander-in-chief (Domestic of the Schools) of the Byzantine army, advanced on Aleppo, taking over the lower town but not the citadel, which continued to resist. Theodore is possibly identifiable as the unnamed nephew of Phokas who on his own initiative attacked the citadel, but was killed by a Daylamite soldier. When his severed head was brought to Phokas, the latter reportedly beheaded 1,200 Arab prisoners. If he was not killed in 962, then he likely participated along with his brothers in the failed rebellion of their cousin Bardas Phokas the Younger in 970 against John I Tzimiskes (r. 969‚Äì976). The Parsakoutenoi tried to drum up support for Phokas at Caesarea, but abandoned him as soon as the imperial army under Bardas Skleros drew near.

Jenness is currently a Visiting Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and prior to that, was a Senior Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Michigan. Jenness served as Dean of the School of Social Ecology from 2009 to 2015 and Chair of the Department of Criminology, Law and Society from 2001-2006. Jenness is credited with conducting the first systemic study of transgender women in men's prisons.  Academic life  Valerie Jenness presenting with Magic Johnson In 1991, Jenness received her doctoral degree from UCSB and began teaching as an assistant professor at Washington State University from 1991-1997. During that time, she served the Department of Sociology, the Criminal Justice Program and the American Studies Program. In 1997, Jenness when she began teaching as an assistant professor in women's studies at UCI. While serving as dean, Jenness has continued to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses. She has received multiple teaching awards as well as other forms of recognition for her contributions to teaching. Jenness‚Äô research primarily focuses on the links between deviance and social control (especially law); the politics of crime control and criminalization; social movements and social change; and the public policy surrounding the corrections system. Courses taught by Jenness include: Introduction to Criminology, Law and Society, Hate Crimes, Deviance and Violence Against Sexual and Gender Minorities. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, from social constructionism to new institutionalism, she has employed a variety of quantitate and qualitative research methods to contribute to our understandings of crime response.  Contributions to public policy  Early in her career (1999), Jenness gave a press conference at the American Sociological Association (ASA) meetings in Chicago with two other researchers. In this presentation, she summarized the current state of social science knowledge on the subject of hate crime and hate crime law for the national media. Later that year, Jenness appeared before members and staff of the United States Congress to deliver a presentation at the United States Congressional Briefing and Seminar on \\"Hate Crime in America.\\" The presentation was subsequently published in Hate Crime in America: What Do We Know? by the ASA as part of the Issue Series in Social Research and Social Policy. Jenness has used her research and findings to not only publish studies, but develop innovative educational materials for public policy officials. Her contributions have been recognized by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the Los Angeles Police Department and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Many agencies have referred to Jenness‚Äô research in the forming of their own policy, including the United States Congress and the National Academy of Sciences. Jenness also provided analysis and advice on bills in the California State Senate sponsored by then Senators Deborah Ortiz, Tom Hayden and Sheila Kuehl. In 2004, Jenness provided an assessment of The Omnibus Hate Crime Bill of 2004 (California Senate Bill 1234) to the legislative staff on the California State Senate Committee on Public Safety. The bill was designed to overhaul California's hate crime laws. In September 2004, the bill was enacted into law by Governor Schwarzenegger. Shortly after her work on the Omnibus Hate Crime Bill, Jenness served as a consultant to the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). Her task was working with law enforcement officials to redesign curriculum and produce instructional videos for training police officers. Presently, these videos are part of the official police training curriculum in the State of California. During Governor Schwarzenegger's term, Jenness was appointed to the Rehabilitation Strike Team to facilitate the implementation of California Assembly Bill 900, also known as the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007. This Strike Team was charged with working collaboratively with the CDCR to implement a set of sweeping reforms designed to improve rehabilitation services, grow entry opportunities and reduce prison overcrowding in California.

The country has ratified a number of United Nations conventions regarding human rights and its constitution guarantees some basic human rights, such as the right to fair trial and freedom from torture. However, clauses guaranteeing socio-economic rights, such as the right to education, and guarding against discrimination are \\"almost non-existent\\" in the constitution. There are also no individual complaints procedures for some of the ratified conventions. In 2014, Freedom House ranked Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as \\"free\\", the highest possible band. The country has been criticized for its high incidence of rape and prevalence of domestic violence, as well as a \\"cultural epidemic\\" that renders women dependent on men and allows perpetrators of gender-based violence to go unpunished. There are no provisions in the constitution guaranteeing gender equality.  Gender equality  A 2014 study for the University of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM) found that the \\"patriarchal structure\\" of the Vincentian society made women dependent on their husbands on partners financially, which increased their vulnerability to violence, and thus led to a \\"cultural epidemic of violence against women\\". There were no provisions in the constitution guaranteeing gender equality. A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report in 2011 placed the country at the fourth highest place globally in terms of its rate of rapes. According to the US Department of State, too, many women are \\"marginalized\\" and cannot enjoy full equality due to their financial dependence. In 2013, the US Department of State reported that violence against women was a \\"serious and pervasive problem\\". Domestic violence is not specifically criminalized, and while charges may be brought up by the authorities, the police is usually reportedly reluctant to follow up the cases, resulting in the perpetrators enjoying impunity. A crisis center was opened in 2012 for sufferers of domestic violence, but its secret location was reportedly compromised. Sexual harassment is also not prohibited under law, and while it can be possibly prosecuted under the law, its prosecution is seen as ineffective by women's rights groups. According to the UQAM study, domestic violence is considered a civil issue instead of a criminal one and there is no obligation for officers to investigate. The Domestic Violence Act also excludes women who do not cohabit with the perpetrators. There was an increase in reported rape cases in 2012-2013. The cases are referred to the police, but according to the US Department of State, fear of reprisal may deter some survivors from seeking assistance. Police and human rights groups also reported that perpetrators commonly made payoffs to survivors of rape or sexual assault in exchange for survivors not pressing charges. The UQAM study also concluded that incest was a major problem in the country, and found that \\"girls being raped by uncles and cousins\\" were not considered victims of incest. In 2008, despite 36 cases of rape being reported to criminal courts, no cases were opened. Toronto Star reported that the extent and culture of gender-based violence and the \\"climate of impunity\\" for its perpetrators has forced women to seek refuge abroad. A number amounting to 4.3% of the country's population has reportedly sought refuge in Canada in the 21st century, the majority of them being women, mostly fleeing from domestic violence. Women are also underrepresented in politics, as they only occupy 3 of the 23 seats of the parliament.  Freedoms  = Freedom of speech = According to the US Department of State in 2013, the constitution and law provided for the freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to ensure freedom of speech and press. An independent media engaged in the free expression of a wide variety of views, though some libel cases, used by politicians to preserve their reputation, and press being rebuked by officials were identified as issues that could reportedly lead to self-censorship. Freedom House concurred with the statements by the Department of State in 2014 and drew attention to the libel cases and threats of suing press members by the prime minister. According to Amnesty International, in 2008, Nicole Sylvester, the President of the St Vincent and the Grenadines Human Rights Association, was subjected to threats and intimidation, with the car of one of her colleagues being followed, allegedly due to the association's involvement in a rape case. According to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, \\"from most accounts [the country] enjoys a relatively high standard of freedom of speech and free press\\", but the unlawful arrest of a Canadian journalist in Kingstown was an issue in 2009. = Freedom of religion = According to both Freedom House and the US Department of State, religious freedom is respected. There is Christian religious instruction at schools, but students may choose to opt out. Rastafarians claimed that they faced extra scrutiny from police and immigration officials and that some officials searched their dreadlocks.

His career is little known, except for some references in Arabic sources, which call him \\"the One-Eyed\\" (al-A‚Äòwar) and record that he was a patrikios and commander (strategos) of the themes of Tzamandos and Lykandos in 954, when he was captured along with one of his sons (either Bardas or Nikephoros) at Hadath by the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla. In autumn 962, Theodoulos' son Theodore captured Sayf al-Dawla's cousin, Abu Firas al-Hamdani, in a raid, and tried to have his prisoner exchanged for his father and one of his brothers. This was without immediate success, as Abu Firas remained a captive until the prisoner exchange of 966, when Theodoulos and any other high-ranking Byzantine captives were probably also exchanged.

Biography Schultz was born in Odense. After completing an apprenticeship as a book printer in 1777, her moved to Copenhagen where he was employed at the Berlingske publishing house. In 1783, he established his own company after acquiring a small printing business. The company moved into a building on H√∏jbro Plads in 1787 and Schultz was appointed to Royal Book Printer in 1789. Schultz was also on good terms with many prominent writers, including Knud Lyne Rahb√¶k, C. Pram, T. Thaarup, R. Nyerup and Jens Baggesen. He published much of the Danish fiction of his time as well as several journals, including Minerva and Den danske Tilskuer. Among his most notable publications was an edition of Ludvig Holberg's Niels Klim in Baggesen's translation from 1789 with illustrations by Nicolai Abildgaard. Schultz's building on H√∏jbro Plads was destroyed in the Copenhagen fire of 1795. He immediately acquired a publishing house in Skindergade from P. M. H√∏pfner, who was both responsible for publications from University of Copenhagen and the Court. Schultz moved his business back to H√∏jbro Plads when a new building had been completed in 1797 and it soon developed into one of the largest Danish publishing houses om Copenhagen. Among Schultz's most important publications from this period was Rahbek's edition of Holberg's complete works which was published in 21 volumes between 1804 and 1814. Schultz became a wealthy man who owned several properties in and near Copenhagen. He was a member of the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society. He died in 1817 and is interred in Assistens Cemetery. Legacy After Schultx's death, his wife obtained permission to keep his privileges and ran the company until her death. It was then passed on to her son by her first marriage, Jens Nicolai Christian Hostrup S. (1782‚Äì1849) and later to his descendants. Schultx's building on H√∏jbro Plads (No. 4) still exist.

Early life She was born in Savyon, Israel, to a European Jewish family with roots in England, Germany and Lithuania. At the age of about nine she went with her family to South Africa where they spent the next ten years. Her parents were religious Jews, but at the age of about thirteen, she rebelled against Judaism, particularly the morning prayer called Shacharit, in which men say, \\"I thank God that he did not make me a woman\\". Career While her father wanted her to be a lawyer, Udwin supported herself working in theatre and teaching while at university; in her first year she was raped, a fact she told nobody about at the time. She began her career as an actress at the Space Theatre in Cape Town, one of the only two integrated (‚Äòmulti-cultural‚Äô) theatres in South Africa, playing in the Duchess of Malfi and Stephen Poliakoff‚Äôs Hitting Town. Not wishing to work in ‚Äòwhites-only‚Äô theatres, her work possibilities in South Africa were limited, so she moved to London at age twenty-one. There she acted in plays at the Royal Court, National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and Cheek By Jowl playing roles like Lady Macbeth, Isobel in The Mayor of Zalamea, Masha in Chekhov's Three Sisters, Nora in A Doll's House, etc. On screen she appeared in the BBC Shakespeare Series production of The Merchant of Venice (1980). In 1989 she set a legal precedent in the High Court of England against criminal landlord Nicholas van Hoogstraten who harassed her and her fellow tenants in their Rent Act-protected apartment block in West London. Her real life two- and-a-half year battle against Hoogstraten was subsequently fictionalised by Peter Ransley in the 1989 TV drama Sitting Target (19 March 1989) for BBC 2's Screen Two anthology series, directed by Jenny Wilkes. Having initially urged BBC Head of Drama Mark Shivas to make the programme (feeling that this optimistic story should inspire as many people as possible), Udwin worked as a script consultant with Ransley, and also starred as harassed tenant Vicki, alongside Jonathan Hyde as evil landlord Vincent Stott. Udwin also played Hyde's on-screen second wife in the contemporaneous historical legal drama series Shadow of the Noose After ten years as an actress she wanted more: \\"It was an exciting career, but working as an actress was not enough for me ‚Äì I began to want to choose and not just interpret the stories being told.\\" This led her to become a producer. She started her production company, Assassin Films, in 1989. Her productions include the films East is East (1999), Mrs Ratcliffe's Revolution (2007), and West is West (2010), and the documentary India's Daughter (2015). Udwin also co-produced Who Bombed Birmingham? (1990, starring John Hurt) for Granada TV, about the prosecution and wrongful imprisonment of the ‚ÄòBirmingham Six‚Äô. The morning after the broadcast, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons: \\"We will not have trial by television in this country.\\" Her feature film East is East promoted tolerance and the celebration of diversity as between the Asian and British communities. It won the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film at the BAFTA Awards, and was declared Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards. Her time spent creating award-winning documentary India's Daughter led Leslee to found UK and US education charity Think Equal, of which she is the CEO. Leslee was voted by the NY Times the No 2 Most Impactful Woman of 2015 (second to Hillary Clinton), and has been awarded the prestigious Swedish Anna Lindh Human Rights Prize (previously won by Madeleine Albright) in 2015.

It was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States. The incident came to be called the \\"Hill Abduction\\" and the \\"Zeta Reticuli Incident\\" because the couple stated they had been kidnapped by aliens who claimed to be from the Zeta Reticuli system. Their story was adapted into the best-selling 1966 book The Interrupted Journey and the 1975 television movie The UFO Incident. In September 2016, plans were announced to make a film based on the events, with an unknown release date. Most of Betty Hill's notes, tapes, and other items have been placed in the permanent collection at the University of New Hampshire, her alma mater. In July 2011, the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources marked the site of the alleged craft's first approach with a historical marker.  Background  The Hills lived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney (1922‚Äì1969) was employed by the United States Postal Service, while Betty (n√©e Eunice Barrett) (1919‚Äì2004) was a social worker. Active in the local Unitarian congregation, the Hills were also members of the NAACP and community leaders, and Barney sat on a local board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. They were an interracial couple at a time when it was particularly uncommon in the United States; Barney was black and Betty was white.  UFO encounter  According to a variety of reports given by the Hills, the alleged UFO sighting happened on September 19, 1961, around 10:30 p.m. The Hills were driving back to Portsmouth from a vacation in Niagara Falls and Montreal. Just south of Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty claimed to have observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved from below the moon and the planet Jupiter, upward to the west of the moon. While Barney navigated U.S. Route 3, Betty reasoned that she was observing a falling star, only it moved upward.Webb, 1961, p. 1 Since it moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter, Betty urged Barney to stop the car for a closer look, as well as to walk their dog, Delsey. Barney stopped at a scenic picnic area just south of Twin Mountain.Friedman/Marden, Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, 2007. p. 101. Betty, looking through binoculars, observed an \\"odd- shaped\\" craft flashing multi-colored lights travel across the face of the Moon.Friedman/Marden, Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, 2007, p. 102. Because her sister had several years earlier said she had seen a flying saucer, Betty thought it might be what she was observing. Through binoculars, Barney observed what he reasoned was a commercial airliner traveling toward Vermont on its way to Montreal. However, he soon changed his mind, because without looking as if it had turned, the craft rapidly descended in his direction. This observation caused Barney to realize, \\"this object that was a plane was not a plane.\\"Fuller, The Interrupted Journey, 1966, p 76. They quickly returned to the car and drove toward Franconia Notch, a narrow, mountainous stretch of the road. The Hills claimed that they continued driving on the isolated road, moving very slowly through Franconia Notch in order to observe the object as it came even closer. At one point, the object passed above a restaurant and signal tower on top of Cannon Mountain and came out near the Old Man of the Mountain. Betty testified that it was at least one and a half times the length of the granite cliff profile, which was long, and that it seemed to be rotating. The couple watched as the silent, illuminated craft moved erratically and bounced back and forth in the night sky.Friedman, Stanton and Kathleen Marden. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, 2007, pp. 103‚Äì04 Approximately one mile south of Indian Head, they said, the object rapidly descended toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovered approximately above the Hills' 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and filled the entire field of view in the windshield. It reminded Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he stepped away from the vehicle and moved closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claimed to have seen about 8 to 11 humanoid figures, who were peering out of the craft's windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, all but one figure moved to what appeared to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that encircled the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continued to look at Barney and communicated a message telling him to \\"stay where you are and keep looking.\\" Barney had a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black caps. Red lights on what appeared to be bat-wing fins began to telescope out of the sides of the craft, and a long structure descended from the bottom of the craft. The silent craft approached to what Barney estimated was within overhead and away from him. On October 21, 1961, Barney reported to National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) investigator Walter Webb that the \\"beings were somehow not human.\\"Webb, 1961, p. 3. Barney \\"tore\\" the binoculars away from his eyes and ran back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he told Betty, \\"They're going to capture us!\\"Clark, Jerome. The UFO Book, 1998, p. 276. He saw the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He drove away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolled down the window and looked up. Almost immediately, the Hills heard a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds, which they said seemed to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrated and a tingling sensation passed through the Hills' bodies. The Hills said that then they experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled. A second series of beeping or buzzing sounds returned the couple to full consciousness. They found that they had traveled nearly south, but had only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recalled making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road.  Immediate aftermath  Arriving home at about dawn, the Hills assert that they had some odd sensations and impulses they could not readily explain: Betty insisted their luggage be kept near the back door rather than in the main part of the house. Their watches would never work again. Barney said that the leather strap for the binoculars was torn, though he could not recall it tearing. The toes of his best dress shoes were scraped. Barney says he was compelled to examine his genitals in the bathroom, though he found nothing unusual. They took long showers to remove possible contamination and each drew a picture of what they had observed.Friedman and Marden. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience, 2007, p. 33. Perplexed, the Hills say they tried to reconstruct the chronology of events as they witnessed the UFO and drove home. But immediately after they heard the buzzing sounds, their memories became incomplete and fragmented.Clark, Jerome. The UFO Book, 1998, p. 277. After sleeping for a few hours, Betty awoke and placed the shoes and clothing she had worn during the drive into her closet, observing that the dress was torn at the hem, zipper and lining. Later, when she retrieved the items from her closet, she noted a pinkish powder on her dress. She hung the dress on her clothesline and the pink powder blew away. But the dress was irreparably damaged. She threw it away, but then changed her mind, retrieving the dress and hanging it in her closet. Over the years, five laboratories have conducted chemical and forensic analyses on the dress.University of New Hampshire Archival Collection (needs further citation) There were shiny, concentric circles on their car's trunk that had not been there the previous day. Betty and Barney experimented with a compass, noting that when they moved it close to the spots, the needle would whirl rapidly. But when they moved it a few inches away from the shiny spots, it would drop down.See Friedman/Marden, 2007, p. 153 = Initial report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP = On September 21, Betty telephoned Pease Air Force Base to report their UFO encounter, though for fear of being labeled eccentric, she withheld some of the details. On September 22, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for a more detailed interview. Henderson's report, dated September 26, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified the planet Jupiter. (This was later changed to \\"optical condition,\\" \\"inversion\\" and \\"insufficient data.\\") (Report 100-1-61, Air Intelligence Information Record) His report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO research project. Within days of the encounter, Betty borrowed a UFO book from a local library. It had been written by retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe who was also the head of NICAP, a civilian UFO research group. On September 26, Betty wrote to Keyhoe. She related the full story, including the details about the humanoid figures that Barney had observed through binoculars. Betty wrote that she and Barney were considering hypnosis to help recall what had happened. Her letter was eventually passed on to Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member. Webb met with the Hills on October 21, 1961. In a six-hour interview, the Hills related all they could remember of the UFO encounter. Barney asserted that he had developed a sort of \\"mental block\\" and that he suspected there were some portions of the event that he did not wish to remember. He described in detail all that he could remember about the craft and the appearance of the \\"somehow not human\\" figures aboard the craft.Webb, 1961, pp. 2‚Äì3. Webb stated that \\"they were telling the truth and the incident probably occurred exactly as reported except for some minor uncertainties and technicalities that must be tolerated in any such observations where human judgment is involved (e.g., exact time and length of visibility, apparent sizes of object and occupants, distance and height of object, etc.).\\"Webb, 1961, p. 4.  Betty's dreams  Ten days after the alleged UFO encounter, Betty began having a series of vivid dreams. They continued for five successive nights. Never in her memory had she recalled dreams in such detail and intensity. But they stopped abruptly after five nights and never returned. They occupied her thoughts during the day. When she finally did mention them to Barney, he was sympathetic, but not too concerned, and the matter was dropped. Betty did not mention them to Barney again.Fuller, 1966, p. 31. In November 1961 Betty began writing down the details of her dreams. In one dream, she and Barney encountered a roadblock and men who surrounded their car. She lost consciousness, but struggled to regain it. She then realized that she was being forced by two small men to walk in a forest in the nighttime, and of seeing Barney walking behind her, though when she called to him, he seemed to be in a trance or sleepwalking. The men stood about five feet to five feet four inches tall, and wore matching blue uniforms, with caps similar to those worn by military cadets. They appeared nearly human, with black hair, dark eyes, prominent noses and bluish lips. Their skin was a greyish colour.Friedman/Marden, 2007, p. 85. In the dreams, Betty, Barney, and the men walked up a ramp into a disc-shaped craft of metallic appearance. Once inside, Barney and Betty were separated. She protested, and was told by a man she called \\"the leader\\" that if she and Barney were examined together, it would take much longer to conduct the exams. She and Barney were then taken to separate rooms. Betty then dreamt that a new man, similar to the others, entered to conduct her exam with the leader. Betty called this new man \\"the examiner\\" and said he had a pleasant, calm manner. Though the leader and the examiner spoke to her in English, the examiner's command of the language seemed imperfect and she had difficulty understanding him. The examiner told Betty that he would conduct a few tests to note the differences between humans and the craft's occupants. He seated her on a chair, and a bright light was shone on her. The man cut off a lock of Betty's hair. He examined her eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, throat and hands. He saved trimmings from her fingernails. After examining her legs and feet, the man used a dull knife, similar to a letter opener, to scrape some of her skin onto what resembled cellophane. He then tested her nervous system and he thrust the needle into her navel, which caused Betty agonizing pain, whereupon the leader waved his hand in front of her eyes and the pain vanished. The examiner left the room and Betty engaged in conversation with the \\"leader.\\" She picked up a book with rows of strange symbols that the \\"leader\\" said she could take home with her. She also asked from where he came, and he pulled down an instructional map dotted with stars. In Betty's dream account, the men began escorting the Hills from the ship when a disagreement broke out. The leader then informed Betty that she couldn't keep the book, stating that they had decided that the other men did not want her to even remember the encounter. Betty insisted that no matter what they did to her memory, she would one day recall the events. She and Barney were taken to their car, where the leader suggested that they wait to watch the craft's departure. They did so, then resumed their drive.See Fuller, 1966, pp. 295‚Äì302 for a full account of Betty's dreams.  Medical help and more interviews  = Missing time = On November 25, 1961, the Hills were again interviewed at length by NICAP members, this time C. D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann. Although the Hills had noted that they had arrived home later than anticipated, the drive should have taken about four hours (178 miles). They claimed not to have realized that they arrived home seven hours after their departure from Colebrook. When Hohman and Jackson noted this discrepancy to the Hills, the couple had no explanation (a phenomenon ufologists call \\"missing time\\"). The Hills claimed to recall almost nothing of the 35 miles of US Route 3 between Lincoln/Indian Head and Ashland. Both claimed to recall an image of a fiery orb sitting on the ground. Betty and Barney reasoned that it must have been the moon, but Hohmann and Jackson informed them that the moon had set earlier in the evening.Clark, 1998, p. 282. The subject of hypnosis came up, and it was decided that it should be carried out in order to elicit previously irretrievable memories. Barney was apprehensive about hypnosis, but thought it might help Betty put to rest what Barney described as \\"the 'nonsense' about her dreams.\\" By February 1962, the Hills were making frequent weekend drives to the White Mountains, hoping that revisiting the site might spark more memories. They were unsuccessful in trying to locate the site where they observed a fiery orb sitting in the road. However, they were able to eliminate several possible routes. (They found what they claimed was the \\"capture\\" site on Labor Day weekend in 1965.) = Private disclosure = On November 23, 1962, the Hills attended a meeting at the parsonage of their church where the invited guest speaker was Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who had recently published a book of his poetry. After he read selections of his poetry, the pastor asked him to discuss his personal interest in hypnosis. After the meeting broke up, the Hills approached Captain Swett privately and told him what they could remember of their strange encounter. He was particularly interested in the \\"missing time\\" of the Hills' account. The Hills asked Swett if he would hypnotize them to recover their memories, but Swett said he was not qualified to do that and cautioned them against going to an amateur hypnotist, such as himself. = First public disclosure = On March 3, 1963, the Hills first publicly discussed the UFO encounter with a group at their church. On September 7, 1963, Captain Swett returned and gave a formal lecture on hypnosis to a meeting at the Unitarian Church. After the lecture, the Hills told him that Barney was going to a psychiatrist, a Mr. Stephens, whom he liked and trusted. Captain Swett suggested that Barney ask Stephens about the use of hypnosis in his case. When Barney next met with Stephens, he asked about hypnosis. Stephens referred the Hills to Benjamin Simon of Boston. On November 3, 1963, the Hills spoke before an amateur UFO study group, the Two State UFO Study Group, in Quincy Center, Massachusetts. The Hills first met Simon on December 14, 1963. Early in their discussions, Simon determined that the UFO encounter was causing Barney far more worry and anxiety than he was willing to admit. Though Simon dismissed the popular extraterrestrial hypothesis as impossible, it seemed obvious to him that the Hills genuinely thought they had witnessed a UFO with human-like occupants. Simon hoped to uncover more about the experience through hypnosis.  Simon's hypnosis sessions  Simon began hypnotizing the Hills on January 4, 1964. He hypnotized Betty and Barney several times each, and the sessions lasted until June 6, 1964. Simon conducted the sessions on Barney and Betty separately, so they could not overhear one another's recollections. At the end of each session he reinstated amnesia. = Barney's sessions = Simon hypnotized Barney first. His recall of witnessing non-human figures was quite emotional, punctuated with expressions of fear, emotional outbursts and incredulity. Barney said that, due to his fear, he kept his eyes closed for much of the abduction and physical examination. Based on these early responses, Simon told Barney that he would not remember the hypnosis sessions until he was certain he could remember them without being further traumatized. Under hypnosis (as was consistent with his conscious recall), Barney reported that the binocular strap had broken when he ran from the UFO back to his car. He recalled driving the car away from the UFO, but that afterwards he felt irresistibly compelled to pull off the road and drive into the woods. He eventually sighted six men standing in the dirt road. The car stalled and three of the men approached the car. They told Barney not to fear them. He was still anxious, however, and he reported that the leader told Barney to close his eyes. While hypnotized, Barney said, \\"I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes.\\"Clark, 1998, p. 284. Barney described the beings as generally similar to Betty's hypnotic (not dream) recollection. The beings often stared into his eyes, said Barney, with a terrifying, mesmerizing effect. Under hypnosis, Barney said things like, \\"Oh, those eyes. They're there in my brain\\" (from his first hypnosis session) and \\"I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mine, and I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes\\" (from his second hypnosis session) and \\"All I see are these eyes... I'm not even afraid that they're not connected to a body. They're just there. They're just up close to me, pressing against my eyes.\\"Clark, 1998, p. 291 Barney related that he and Betty were taken onto the disc-shaped craft, where they were separated. He was escorted to a room by three of the men and told to lie on a small rectangular exam table. Unlike Betty, Barney's narrative of the exam was less detailed, as he continued to keep his eyes closed for most of the exam. A cup-like device was placed over his genitals. He did not experience an orgasm, though Barney thought that a sperm sample had been taken. The men scraped his skin and peered in his ears and mouth. A thin tube or cylinder was inserted into his anus and quickly removed. Someone felt his spine and seemed to be counting his vertebrae. Betty reported a conversation with the \\"leader\\" that she understood in English. Barney said that he heard them speaking in a mumbling language he did not understand, yet he also understood them in English. Betty also mentioned this detail. The few times they communicated with him, Barney said it seemed to be \\"thought transference\\"; at that time, he was unfamiliar with the word \\"telepathy.\\"Clark, 1998, p. 285. Both Betty and Barney stated that they hadn't observed the beings' mouths moving when they communicated in English with them. He recalled being escorted from the ship and taken to his car. In a daze, he watched the ship leave. Barney remembered a light appearing on the road, and he said, \\"Oh no, not again.\\" He recalled Betty's speculation that the light might have been the moon, though the moon had set several hours earlier. He also stated that he attempted to produce the code-like buzzing sounds which seemed to strike the car's trunk a second time by driving from side to side and stopping and starting the vehicle. His attempt was unsuccessful. = Betty's sessions = Under hypnosis, Betty's account was similar to the events of her five dreams about the UFO abduction, but there were also notable differences, mainly pertaining to her capture and release. The technology on the craft was different. The short men had a significantly different physical appearance from that of her dreams. The sequential order of the abduction event was also different from Betty's dream account. Barney's and Betty's memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another but contradicted some of the information in Betty's dreams.Friedman/Marden, 2007, 119‚Äì54. Betty exhibited considerable emotional distress during her capture and examination. Simon ended one session early because tears were flowing down her cheeks and she appeared distressed. Simon gave Betty the post-hypnotic suggestion that she could sketch a copy of the \\"star map\\" that she later described as a three-dimensional projection similar to a hologram. Eventually, she did what Simon suggested. Although she said the map had many stars, she drew only those that stood out in her memory. Her map consisted of twelve prominent stars connected by lines and three lesser ones that formed a distinctive triangle (see below). She said she was told the stars connected by solid lines formed \\"trade routes,\\" whereas dashed lines were to less-traveled stars. = Simon's conclusions = After the hypnosis sessions, Simon speculated that Barney's recollection of the UFO encounter was possibly a fantasy inspired by Betty's dreams. Simon thought it was the most reasonable and consistent explanation. Barney rejected this idea, noting that while their memories were consistent in some regards, there were also portions of both their narratives that were unique to each. Barney was now ready to accept that they had been abducted by the occupants of a UFO, though he never embraced it as fully as Betty did. Though the Hills and Simon disagreed about the nature of the case, they all concurred that the hypnosis sessions were effective: the Hills were no longer tormented by anxiety about their experience. Afterwards, Simon wrote an article about the Hills for the journal Psychiatric Opinion, explaining his conclusions that the case was a singular psychological aberration.Benjamin Simon, \\"Hypnosis in the Treatment of Military Neurosis\\" (Psychiatric Opinion, Volume 4, Number 5, pp. 24‚Äì28, October 1967).  Publicity after the hypnosis sessions  The Hills went back to their regular lives. They were willing to discuss the alleged UFO encounter with friends, family and the occasional UFO researcher, but the Hills apparently made no effort to seek publicity. On October 25, 1965, a front page story in the Boston Traveller asked \\"UFO Chiller: Did THEY Seize Couple?\\"Clark, 1998, p. 286. Reporter John H. Luttrell of the Traveler had allegedly been given an audio tape recording of the lecture the Hills had made in Quincy Center in late 1963. Luttrell learned that the Hills had undergone hypnosis with Simon; he also obtained notes from confidential interviews the Hills had given to UFO investigators. On October 26, United Press International (UPI) picked up Luttrell's story, and the Hills earned international attention. In 1966 writer John G. Fuller secured the cooperation of the Hills and Simon and wrote the book The Interrupted Journey (see below) about the case. The book included a copy of Betty's sketch of the \\"star map.\\" The book was a quick success, and went through several printings. Later in life, Betty claimed to have seen UFOs a number of times after the initial abduction, and she \\"became a celebrity in the UFO community.\\" Barney died of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 25, 1969, at age 46; Betty Hill died of cancer on October 17, 2004, at age 85, never having remarried.  Analyzing the star map  Marjorie Fish's interpretation of Betty Hill's purported alien star map, with \\"Sol\\" (upper right) being the Latin name for the Sun. In 1968 Marjorie Fish of Oak Harbor, Ohio, read Fuller's Interrupted Journey. She was an elementary school teacher and amateur astronomer. Intrigued by the \\"star map,\\" Fish wondered if it might be \\"deciphered\\" to determine which star system the UFO came from. Assuming that one of the fifteen stars on the map must represent Earth's Sun, Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars (i.e. stars deemed to have characteristics that could support life such as that found on Earth) using thread and beads, basing stellar distances on those published in the 1969 Gliese Star Catalogue. Studying thousands of vantage points over several years, the only one that seemed to match the Hill map was from the viewpoint of the double star system of Zeta Reticuli. Fish sent her analysis to Webb. Agreeing with her conclusions, Webb sent the map to Terence Dickinson, editor of the popular magazine Astronomy. Dickinson did not endorse Fish and Webb's conclusions, but for the first time in the journal's history, Astronomy invited comments and debate on a UFO report, starting with an opening article in the December 1974 issue. For about a year afterward, the opinions page of Astronomy carried arguments for and against Fish's star map. Notable was an argument made by Carl Sagan and Steven Soter,see Clark, 1998 arguing that the seeming \\"star map\\" was little more than a random alignment of chance points. In an episode of Cosmos in 1980, Sagan demonstrated that without the lines drawn in the maps, the Hill map bore no resemblance to the real-life map. In contrast, those more favorable to the map, such as David Saunders, a statistician who had been on the Condon UFO study, argued that unusual alignment of key Sun-like stars in a plane centered around Zeta Reticuli (first described by Fish) was statistically improbable to have happened by chance from a random group of stars in our immediate neighborhood. In the early 1990s the European Hipparcos (\\"high precision parallax collecting satellite\\") mission, which measured the distances to more than a hundred thousand stars around the Sun more accurately than ever before, showed that some of the stars in Fish's interpretation of the map were in fact much further away than previously thought. Other research revealed that some stars counted by Fish as likely to host life would have had to be excluded by her own criteria, while some other stars which had been discounted by Fish have been recognised as potential abodes for life. Results such as these led Fish herself to reject her hypothesis in a public statement.  Interrupted Journey  The 1966 publication of Interrupted Journey, by John G. Fuller, details much of the Hills' claims. Excerpts of the book were published in Look magazine, and the book went on to sell many copies and greatly publicize the Hills' account. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience by Kathleen Marden further explored Fuller's themes along with scientist Stanton T. Friedman. Marden, who was Betty Hill's niece, knew Betty well and had spoken with her at great length about the encounter. She also examined all of the historical records and scientific reports pertaining to the case and transcribed the Hills' hypnosis sessions with Benjamin Simon for her detailed comparative analysis.  Refutations  Psychiatrists later suggested that the supposed abduction was a hallucination brought on by the stress of being an interracial couple in early 1960s United States. Betty discounted this suggestion, noting her relationship with Barney was happy, and their interracial marriage caused no notable problems with their friends or family. As noted in The Interrupted Journey, Simon thought that the Hills' marital status had nothing to do with the UFO encounter. Skeptic blogger Brian Dunning noted that the hypnosis sessions occurred over two years after the reported abductions, which afforded the couple plenty of time to discuss their encounter. Dunning concluded that the Hills' \\"inventive tale from the mind of a lifelong UFO fanatic ... is unsupported by any useful evidence, and is perfectly consistent with the purely natural explanation.\\" He added that a timeline analysis of the two Air Force radar sightings from that night in the Project Blue Book record shows that neither correlated with the Hills' story. The Air Force concluded that both targets were probably weather balloons. An alien (played by actor John Hoyt) depicted on television twelve days before the making of Hill's \\"Grey\\" hypnosis tape. In his 1990 article \\"Entirely Unpredisposed,\\" Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney's memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by an episode of the science fiction television show The Outer Limits titled \\"The Bellero Shield\\" which was broadcast about two weeks before Barney's first hypnotic session. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes who says, \\"In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak.\\" The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote: (originally published in Magonia magazine, January 1990). > Wraparound eyes are an extreme rarity in science fiction films. I know of > only one instance. They appeared on the alien of an episode of an old TV > series The Outer Limits entitled \\"The Bellero Shield.\\" A person familiar > with Barney's sketch in \\"The Interrupted Journey\\" and the sketch done in > collaboration with the artist David Baker will find a \\"frisson\\" of \\"d√©j√† vu\\" > creeping up his spine when seeing this episode.

When a different researcher asked Betty about The Outer Limits, she insisted she had \\"never heard of it.\\"Clark, 1998, p. 291. Kottmeyer also pointed out that some motifs in the Hills' account were present in the 1953 film, Invaders from Mars. A careful analysis of Barney's description of the non-human entities that he observed reveals significant similarities between the \\"Bifrost Man\\" and Barney's descriptive details. One must also take into account Barney's conscious, continuous recall of the entities he observed on the hovering craft. They were dressed in black, shiny uniforms and were \\"somehow not human.\\" Jim Macdonald, a resident of the area in which the Hills claimed to have been abducted, has produced a detailed analysis of their journey which concludes that the episode was provoked by their misperceiving an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain as a UFO.Macdonald, J. Making Light: Alien Abduction, accessed 15-05-09Jordan, C. Colebrook Chronicle: Betty and Barney Hill's Epic UFO N.H. Adventure Began in Colebrook , accessed 24-09-11 Macdonald notes that from the road the Hills took, the beacon appears and disappears at exactly the same time the Hills describe the UFO as appearing and disappearing. The remainder of the experience is ascribed to stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories \\"recovered\\" under hypnosis. After reading Macdonald's recreation, UFO expert Robert Sheaffer writes that the Hills are the \\"poster children\\" for not driving when sleep deprived. Macdonald's article focuses primarily on the Hills' observations of the light in the sky and the timing of the journey, discounting the Hills' accounts of close encounters south of Cannon Mountain as recovered memories. Skeptical Inquirer columnist Robert Sheaffer wrote: > I was present at the National UFO Conference in New York City in 1980, at > which Betty presented some of the UFO photos she had taken.

Prometheus Books, 1986, pp. 34‚Äì44. Sheaffer later wrote that as late as 1977, Betty Hill would go on UFO vigils at least three times a week. During one evening she was joined by UFO enthusiast John Oswald. When asked about Betty's continuing UFO observations, Oswald stated, \\"She is not really seeing UFOs, but she is calling them that.\\" On the night they went out together, \\"Mrs. Hill was unable to distinguish between a landed UFO and a streetlight.\\" In a later interview, Sheaffer recounts that Betty Hill wrote, \\"UFOs are a new science ... and our science cannot explain them.\\" Robert Sheaffer released 48 pages of archived documents relating to Betty and Barney Hill, Benjamin Simon and Philip J. Klass on the Internet on December 23, 2015.Dr. Simon Reveals his Real Thoughts on the Hill \\"UFO Abduction\\" Case  In popular culture  * Barney Hill was on an episode of To Tell the Truth, episode airdate December 12, 1966. * The couple was portrayed by James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in the 1975 television film adapted by S.

It is the largest of the Old World otters and the third largest otter after the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and the sea otter (Enhydra lutris).http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/671_Aonyx_capensis.pdf  Physical description  The Cape clawless otter has a massive body and a stout tail for an otter. It reaches 72‚Äì91 cm in length and 12‚Äì21 kg. The upper lips, sides of the face, neck, throat, belly, and edge of ears are all white while the rest of the coat is brown. The eyes and ears are small and rounded. The coat is dense with hairs that can reach 25 mm in length covering a layer of thick skin. As noted by the name, the toes are clawless except for digits 2, 3, and 4 of the hind feet, which have small grooming claws. The hind feet are partially webbed, but the front feet are not, the least interdigital webbing of all otters. Notably, the skull is quite large, housing a larger brain in relation to its body.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  As a subspecies of Aonyx capensis, Cape clawless otters are within the subfamily of Lutrinae (otters). The closest relatives to Aonyx capensis are the Oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea) and the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata).  Range  The Cape clawless otter is found in freshwater habitats that range from South Africa northward to Ethiopia in the east and Senegal in the west. This species is common in Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Zaire, and Zimbabwe. It is rare in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and Uganda. It is very or extremely rare in the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, and Rwanda. It is absent in ecosystems in the central African rain forest region of the Congo Basin where A. congicus, the Congo clawless otter, is found.  Behavior  Cape clawless otters are primarily solitary creatures, but have been seen to travel in family groups. Their density in freshwater habitats ideally reaches 1 otter per 2‚Äì3 km of stream. During the day, they typically escape the heat of the sun by hiding in dense vegetation on islands or burrowing. Burrows can reach up to 3 m in depth and have several entrances above or below water. Dens or burrows include rolling places, spots on the ground where the otter rolls to dry its fur, as well as multiple sprainting sites. Dens may be reused by several otters in a family group or at separate times. The breeding season starts around December and, with a gestation period of 63 days, litters can be born beginning in February. Litter size is 1‚Äì3 pups that are born with pale, smoky-gray, wooly fur. Eye-opening for the pups is seen in 16‚Äì30 days, after which pups are able to venture out of the den. Weaning occurs at 45‚Äì60 days and the young become fully independent of the mother after 1 year. As with most otters, this species has an elaborate vocal repertoire that includes four main vocalizations: two whistles (one low-pitched and one high-pitched), a grunt, and a variable noise described as a \\"Hah!\\" to express anxiety. Growls and snarls may be given as threats while humming-like noises may be used as a begging call in the pups. Other sounds may include squeals, mewing, and snuffing noises. When not hunting, they typically emerge from the water to rest upon the shore. Rolling and rubbing is done to dry and groom the fur or to scent-mark areas. Otters usually bask in the sun or can return undercover to sleep. Walking on land is awkward for Cape clawless otters so they are observed to either walk slowly or do a seal-like trot. The tail can either be carried off the ground with its tip curving upwards, or dragged on the ground leaving a distinct trail. These otters are able to carry objects or prey while walking on land by holding them against the chest with one paw while hobbling on three legs. Carrying offspring on land may result in the female using both front feet to carry the young and then hobbling on its back legs. Due to their awkwardness on land, Cape clawless otters typically spend most of their time traveling in the water.  Feeding  In freshwater habitats, the main sources of food are crabs, frogs, insects, and fish. Although crabs are available in all of their habitats, other prey in their diet may vary seasonally and change with prey availability. Due to this seasonal change, the Cape clawless otter usually is seen to consume more fish in the winter (10‚Äì30%) than in the summer (0‚Äì10%). Predation on waterfowl is rarely seen, but in the winter theyt have been seen to kill domestic ducks, geese, coots, and swans.  Conservation status  The Cape clawless otter is not under severe pressure and its conservation status is Red List Category Near Threatened, as assessed in 2014 by the IUCN. Human conflict with this species is mainly from changes in habitat due to fishing, water pollution, agriculture run-off, and the introduction of Louisiana crayfish, which has altered the prey base in the otter's ecosystem. Cape clawless otters can be hunted for their pelts, used for medicinal purposes, and in some areas killed as a perceived competitor for fish. This species is legally protected by the IUCN, but extra efforts towards awareness and protected areas are highly encouraged for local communities. Natural predators of the Cape clawless otter include crocodiles and fish- eagles; however, most mortality is human-caused.

British fleets had achieved dominance in European waters over the French following heavy defeats of French fleets in 1759. To maintain this control, British battle squadrons were stationed off French ports, as well as ports in neutral but French-supporting Spain which sheltered French warships. In 1761, two French ships, the 64-gun ship of the line Achille and 32-gun frigate Bouffone were blockaded in the principal Spanish naval base of C√°diz, on the Southern Atlantic coast of Spain. Achille had departed the French Atlantic base of Brest in March, fighting though the blockade of that port, and was then trapped in C√°diz by a British squadron detached from the Mediterranean Fleet based at Gibraltar comprising ships of the line HMS Thunderer and HMS Modeste, frigate HMS Thetis and sloop HMS Favourite, under the command of Captain Charles Proby on Thunderer. When the French ship attempted to leave Proby gave chase, eventually catching them and bringing them to battle. Thunderer suffered heavy losses when a cannon exploded, but Proby was able to bring his ship alongside Achille and capture the ship in a boarding action while Thetis and Modeste captured Bouffone. Action =Background= In 1759 the French Navy suffered heavy losses in the defeats at the Battle of Lagos and the Battle of Quiberon Bay, which gave the Royal Navy superiority in the Atlantic.Clowes, p.232 To retain this advantage, the Royal Navy stationed squadrons off the principal French naval bases in a strategy of close blockade; French ships periodically attempted to break through this blockade to operate against British commerce. On 9 March 1761, the squadron off the port of Brest in Brittany, led by Commodore Matthew Buckle, sighted a French ships of the line and a frigate sailing from the port. Buckle ordered the 60-gun British ship HMS Rippon under Captain Edward Jekyll to pursue the French, Jekyll chasing the enemy ships into the Bay of Biscay. The French ships were the 64-gun Achille and frigate Bouffone. Although the French ships outdistanced Rippon, Jekyll sighted them again the following afternoon and at 21:30 successful drew alongside Achille, opening fire at close range. The wind was strong and the seas rough, neither ship able to easily use their lower gun deck without water sloshing in through the gunports. During the exchange of fire, one of the guns on Rippon suddenly exploded, causing heavy casualties among the gun crews. Jekyll was forced to order most of the forward gunports closed in consequence, but fire from Rippon was able to knock away the foreyard and foretop mast on Achille. This caused Rippon to pull ahead of Achille and Jekyll brought his ship into the wind in readiness for an attack by the French ship. Achille however passed by the stern of Rippon missing the opportunity to rake the British ship. With the French now pulling away, Jekyll ordered his crew to wear around and follow Achille, but the damage to the British ship was too extensive and Achille was able to escape in the darkness.Clowes, p.305 Having escaped the blockade, Achille and Bouffone cruised in the Atlantic for several months before entering the neutral but friendly Spanish port of C√°diz. There they were discovered in July and a small British squadron sent to blockade the harbour in anticipation of Achille returning to sea. =Battle= The British blockade squadron stationed off C√°diz comprised the 74-gun HMS Thunderer under Captain Charles Proby, the 64-gun HMS Modeste under Captain Robert Boyle Walsingham, the 32-gun frigate [HMS Thetis under Captain John Moutray and the sloop HMS Favourite under Commander Philemon Pownall.Clowes, p.305 This force patrolled off the port in early summer, discovering on 14 July that Achille and Bouffone had recently sailed unopposed. Proby ordered his squadron to search for the French ships, discovering them on 16 July approximately southwest of C√°diz. A chase ensued, with the French sailing northwest into the Gulf of C√°diz. Proby's ships were faster however and Thunderer successfully reached Achille on the morning of 17 July approximately northwest of C√°diz. Thunderer opened fire on Achille as the ships came within range, the ships of the line exchanging broadsides. As the action intensified, a cannon on the upper deck of Thunderer suddenly burst, the explosion killing and wounding dozens of sailors. In the aftermath of the blast, Proby, who had been wounded in the hand, brought Thunderer alongside Achille and led a boarding action which captured Achille. Nearby, Thetis successfully brought Bouffone to action, holding up the French frigate long enough that Modeste was able to come within range. With his frigate heavily outgunned, the French captain surrendered. =Aftermath= Proby brought the squadron and its prizes back to Gibraltar, where the wounded were treated in the city's hospitals. British casualties were listed as 17 killed and 114 wounded, all on Thunderer and most from the gun explosion. Thunderer had also taken severe damage to the masts and rigging from French shot. The only other heavily engaged British ship was Thetis which had also suffered damage to masts and rigging, but received no casualties. According to Proby's dispatch to the Admiralty, no record of French losses was made in the aftermath of the battle.

Their first factory was in Worcester and in 1862 the company moved to Broseley, Shropshire in the Ironbridge Gorge. In 1883 they moved to the Benthall Works in Jackfield, Shropshire. The new, purpose-built factory was the largest tile works in the world and the company was the world's largest producer of ceramic tiles, making more than 20 million pieces a year. The range of tiles was expanded over the years and included relief tiles, encaustic tiles,mosaic tiles, transfer printed tiles and hand-painted picture tiles. Designs included Art Nouveau and Art Deco geometric designs. In the 1890s Maw & Co started making high quality art pottery. History Maw and Co's Benthall Works Old Library (1882) Maw & Co was established in Worcester in 1850 by brothers George and Arthur Maw. Their father, John Hornby Maw (1800 ‚Äì 1885), felt that the tile industry would be a good business opportunity for his sons as it combined their artistic talents with their entrepreneurial skills. In 1849 he bought the Encaustic Tile Works in Worcester which had been established by the Worcester Porcelain Company. They quickly gained a high reputation for their 'mock-mediaeval' encaustic floor tiles. The local clays were unsuitable and clay from Shropshire was brought in at great expense. In 1862 the company moved to Broseley, Shropshire in the Ironbridge Gorge to take advantage of the good-quality local clay. Until full commercial production was reached in 1857, the company barely covered its expenses but, within a few years, encaustic tiles became the height of fashion and the company prospered. By 1861 Maw & Co employed a work force of 83 (45 men, 17 women and 21 boys). The company continued to prosper and by 1880 had grown to be the largest producer of ceramic tiles in the world, making more than 20 million pieces a year. In May 1883 they moved to the Benthall Works at Jackfield, Shropshire. The new purpose-built factory covered an area of and was the largest tile works in the world. In 1858 an agreement was made with W. B. Simpson & Son Ltd appointing them as sole agent for the company in the area covered by the London postal district. They went on win a ¬£100,000 contract with Underground Electric Railways Company of London to supply Maw & Co tiling in construction of stations across three lines. A page from an 1867 catalogue of Maw and Co.'s designs Maw & Co have supplied ceramic wall and floor tiles to some of the world‚Äôs most prestigious buildings. In Maw‚Äôs printed catalogues the 'Lists of persons and establishments supplied' ran to five pages and included the British Royal Family, Alexander II of Russia, maharajas, dukes, earls, railway companies, cathedrals, hospitals, public buildings, schools and colleges, and even warships. Maw and Co won many awards at international exhibitions including those in London (1862), Paris (1867), Philadelphia (1876) and Adelaide (1887). The recession that followed World War I, building restrictions and railway closures were all detrimental to the tile industry. In 1960 Maw & Co merged with Campbell Tiles and In 1968 the Campbell-Maw Company was absorbed into the H & R Johnson group. Maw & Co closed down in January 1970. Maw & Co Limited was re-established as a private company on 27 June 2001. In March 2008 the company was acquired by new management. Encaustic and geometric floor tiles, and replica Victorian decorative wall tiles, are produced using traditional craft skills. Replica tiles of other leading 19th century makers, such as Minton, Campbell, and Malkin, are also produced. Products Maw & Co tile designed by Walter Crane, 1878 Maw & Co vase designed by Walter Crane, c. 1885 The earthenware encaustic and geometric floor tiles, that Maw & Co are best known for, have always been produced. In addition, mosaic tiles (from 1862), transfer printed tiles, hand painted picture tiles and relief tiles were also produced and included Art Nouveau and Art Deco geometric designs. In the 1890s Maw & Co started making high quality art pottery (the name they used for it) and employed artists, such as Lewis Foreman Day and Walter Crane, to design both art pottery and tiles. Two- handled Commemorative Toast Mug All the workers of Maw & Co contributed to a Benefit Club to enable them to be paid if they became ill. As a gesture of respect and affection for their employers the Club commissioned John Rose and Company (the trading name, at that time, of Coalport China) to make two toast mugs, one for each of the Maw brothers, The mugs were presented to the Maw brothers at the annual meeting of the Benefit Club in 1869. The inscription, on the inside of the lids of the mugs, shows the high regard that the workforce held for their employers and suggests that Maw & Co. were good employers and that their employees were well treated. The inscription reads: > Mr George and Mr Arthur Maw Gentleman ‚Äì in anticipation of this day‚Äôs > entertainment, in addition to the many substantial proofs of generosity and > concern which you have shown to those in your employ, a deep sense of the > obligation we felt ourselves under to you induced us to consider in what way > we could best mark our appreciation of your past and present munificence and > honourable treatment, but we were almost at a loss to know in what form or > by what means we could render a token of our unfeigned gratitude and > respect.

The book follows the events immediately preceding, during, and after the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The book is set in turn-of-the-century Galveston, Texas, a bustling port, placing a primary focus on the role of Isaac Cline in the hurricane's destruction of Galveston.  Synopsis  The book opens with a restless Isaac Cline on the night of September 7, 1900, the eve of the 1900 Galveston Hurricane‚Äôs landfall. Isaac, despite all of the meteorological signs saying otherwise, cannot shake the uneasy feeling that something is amiss. Larson follows this prologue with a look at the science of hurricanes and all of the unusual factors that may have led to the hurricane that season. The initial birth of the storm is described with Larson's speculation on hurricane formation. Larson follows the path of the storm up to Galveston, while also looking at the people of Galveston and the vitality of the city. The narrative is supported by the insertion of letters and telegrams surrounding the events of the storm. The meteorologists of Cuba are shown to be very skilled in the art, but are completely ignored by the overconfident Weather Bureau and its meteorologists. The hurricane passes over Cuba, and the Cubans predict it to be heading towards Texas. The Weather Bureau, however, disagrees and believes that the storm will track towards Florida. Larson, meanwhile, looks at the lives of multiple Galveston residents on the eve of the storm, specifically Isaac Cline. A storm begins to roll in and the streets begin to flood, not an unusual occurrence, but conditions soon worsen and the water continues to rise. Suddenly, from the mainland's view, Galveston goes quiet with no news or telegrams reaching anyone. Meanwhile, in Galveston, the storm literally uproots half the island and kills thousands, leaving utter destruction for the surviving. Rumors swirl on the mainland, and soon the full extent of the horror is realized. The islanders are left to rebuild their ruined city. Isaac has lost his wife and doubts himself some. The islanders rebuild the island, raising it by several feet in the process, but the city was never to return to its former glory with nearby Houston taking over Galveston's position as the prominent port in Texas.  Isaac Cline  Isaac Monroe Cline (1861 ‚Äì 1955) was the chief meteorologist at the Galveston, Texas office of the U.S. Weather Bureau from 1889 to 1901. Cline played an important role in influencing the storm's later destruction by authoring an article for the Galveston Daily News, in which he derided the idea of significant damage to Galveston from a hurricane as \\"a crazy idea\\". This article played a significant role in preventing the construction of a proposed seawall following the destruction of a competing port, Indianola, in the 1886 Indianola hurricane. Cline is credited during the 1900 hurricane with violating Weather Bureau policy and unilaterally issuing a hurricane warning; this warning, however, came too late to allow residents to evacuate the island. During the hurricane, Isaac went home to his pregnant wife, three daughters, and younger brother. There the Clines attempted to ride out the storm; however, the flood waters lifted the house and the family was separated for a time with Cline's wife, Cora, ultimately drowning.

It was released in 1968, and included the group's three hit singles including their number one UK hit, \\"Everlasting Love\\". The band had become one of the most popular groups in the United Kingdom, second in sales only to The Beatles. The album did not reflect their previous success as it failed to impact the UK Albums Chart. Background The Love Affair achieved critical acclaim in the United Kingdom when their single \\"Everlasting Love\\" was released in December 1967. The single reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on February 3, 1968, after securing extensive radio play, and advertising. Suddenly, the band was receiving more notable gig offers, television appearances, and interviews. One of which was on Jonathan King's show, Good Evening. On the show, King says to the band, \\"You didn't play on the record\\", to which the band replies \\"No we didn't\\". Steve Ellis still contributed lead vocals to the single, but instrumentals were conducted by studio musicians. Such a practice was common in studio recording, and was continued on the band's later ones, but the statement caused ridicule stemming from music critics. Still, the issue did not seem to affect the band's popularity as their next two singles reached the UK top ten. Recording commenced in November 1968 at the CBS Recording Studios. The band lacked the confidence to compose their own tracks so all the tracks were either cover versions or written by Philip Goodhand-Talt. Goodhand-Talt first wrote the B-side for Everlasting Love, and when the tapes were complete, more compositions followed for the album. Many of the songs followed the pop formula that brought the band to success, which was somewhat frustrating for the group. Morgan Fisher, the original keyboardist of the band, also returned in time for involvement in recording, having completed the college exams that forced his departure. Taking into account the band's escalating popularity, the process was brief. In the midst of all the Love Affair's commitments, the band had one day to complete the album. The band was involved in the orchestras, but, again, studio musicians were incorporated as it was deemed the most effective way to utilized their limited time. The album was released in December 1968 to the UK, but it failed to chart nationally. In 2006, the album was rereleased by Repertoire Records, and included eight bonus-tracks and a 16-page booklet containing an illustrated history of the band.

Early life Mary Bligh was born on 1 April 1783 at Douglas, Isle of Man, the daughter of William Bligh and his wife Elizabeth (Betsey) Betham. In 1805, she married John Putland, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy who had served in the victory of the Battle of the Nile under the command of Horatio Nelson. Lady of Government House When her father William Bligh was offered the post of Governor of New South Wales, her mother Elizabeth did not wish to accompany him, fearing the long ocean voyage. Instead, Mary agreed to accompany her father to act as the Lady of the Government House with her husband John Putland to serve as William Bligh's aide-de-camp. On 28 January 1806, Mary Putland and William Bligh left England on the convict transport ship Lady Madeline Sinclair while John Putland travelled as the first officer of the escorting vessel under the command of Commander Joseph Short. Bligh and Short disagreed continually through the voyage as each believed he was in charge of the expedition. When Bligh ordered a change of course of the transport ship, Short responded ordering Putland to fire warning shots at the transport containing his wife and father-in-law. In great distress, Putland complied with the order. When the convoy arrived in Sydney Harbour on 6 August 1806, Bligh assumed the governorship of the colony. He retained Porpoise to act as its principal naval unit, ordering Short to return to Britain on in disgrace. Bligh then appointed Putland to command Porpoise. Government House, Sydney, 1833 On arrival in Sydney, Mary Putland took charge of Government House. This was the first Government House in Sydney, built originally for Governor Arthur Phillip although extended on numerous occasions and subsequently demolished in 1845‚Äì1846. Mary Putland hosted many entertainments including dinners and balls. To ensure her high status in Sydney society, her mother, Elizabeth Bligh, kept Mary constantly supplied with the latest fashions from London. In return, Mary sent her mother bird feathers and precious stones from New South Wales. However, despite her public gaiety, her private life was taken up with concern about her husband's health which deteriorated since their arrival in New South Wales. Her husband John Putland died of tuberculosis on 4 January 1808. He was buried in the grounds of the Government House. While Mary Putland continued her role as the popular hostess of Government House, her father as governor was not popular with many of the colonists as he attempted to reform society by removing the control exercised by those who had a monopoly over the supply of rum, which had become the de facto currency within the colony. Mary Putland wrote to her mother, \\"We entertain everyone of importance, but I am sure many of them are secretly against my father\\". The Rum Rebellion Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell, second husband, circa 1840 In 1808, the power struggle between Governor William Bligh and John Macarthur, one of the leading colonists involved in the trade in rum, came to a head, leading to the Rum Rebellion on 26 January 1808 when the New South Wales Corps deposed Bligh based on a petition of officers and leading colonists. William Bligh and Mary Putland were placed under house arrest. William Bligh refused to leave the colony until he received an official order from London and so they remained under house arrest while John Macarthur became the de facto head of the colony. In April 1809, the British Government appointed Lachlan Macquarie as Governor of New South Wales. In making this appointment, the British government reversed its practice of appointing naval officers as governor and chose an army commander in the hope that he could secure the co-operation of the unruly New South Wales Corps,Ward, R., (1975), p. 36 and aided by the fact Macquarie arrived in New South Wales at the head of his own military unit, the 73rd Regiment of Foot, led by Maurice Charles O'Connell (also the new Lieutenant-Governor). They arrived in New South Wales on and HMS Dromedary. At the head of regular troops, Macquarie was unchallenged by the New South Wales Corps, whose members had become settled in farming, commerce and trade. William Bligh and Mary Putland were to return to England on Hindostan in May 1810. However, before that occurred, Mary Putland was courted by Maurice Charles O'Connell, encouraged by Macquarie's wife Elizabeth. Only days before the ship was to depart, Maurice O'Connell proposed marriage to Mary. The couple were married quickly on 8 May 1810 at Government House and Mary remained in Sydney with her new husband, while William Bligh returned to England alone. Although William Bligh had departed, his daughter, now Mary O'Connell, had not forgiven those who had deposed her father. She was prone to creating tensions between her husband and others in the colony, and O'Connell soon came to partake in her feelings and antipathies. In August 1813, Macquarie wrote in a dispatch to Lord Bathurst that, \\"though lieutenant-colonel O'Connell is naturally a very well disposed man . . . it would greatly improve the harmony of the country . . . if the whole of the officers and men of the 73 regiment were removed from it\\". On 26 March 1814, O'Connell and his regiment were transferred to Ceylon. Return to New South Wales Tarmons, now St Vincent's College, 2012 In 1838, Lady O'Connell returned to Sydney, as her husband, now Sir Maurice O'Connell, became the major-general of all the troops in New South Wales and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. They built their residence, Tarmons, in 1838. In 1841, Maurice O'Connell was promoted to lieutenant general. He served as acting governor in 1845‚Äì46, between the terms of Governors George Gipps and Charles Augustus FitzRoy. Once again, Mary was the Lady of Government House, but this time in the recently completed \\"new\\" Government House (still in use today as the Governor's residence). In December 1847, Major-General Wynyard arrived to take charge of the troops. The O'Connells prepared to return to England, but Maurice fell ill before that could happen. Maurice O'Connell died at Tarmons on 25 May 1848, the very day they were due to depart to the Medway. Later life After the death of her second husband, Lady O'Connell returned to Europe, living mostly in Paris. She died in London in 1864. Legacy Their house Tarmons subsequently became St Vincent's College.

He was mostly known for his activities in Manhattan. Early life and career It is unknown when Viserti emigrated from Naples to America. But once in New York he quickly established himself in the Italian underworld. Earliest records indicate that by 1913 Viserti was a gunman and soldier associated with a traditional Italian mafia organization, the Morello family of East Harlem and their occasional ally Giosue Gallucci, for whom the police said that, he killed Amadio Buonomo in April that year. Later that same year he was arrested and convicted for the death of Jerry \\"the Lunchman\\" Maida, a police informant, and was sent away for a sentence of \\"not less than seven years and nine months in Sing Sing\\" Prison. Mustache Pete Mafia Boss and Bootlegger After serving only four years of his sentence, New York's Governor Whitman pardoned him in 1918. He was heavily into white slavery before the advent of Prohibition and grew rich and influential in the Italian Underworld on it and other criminal enterprises. He was soon a force to be reckoned with, becoming \\"by all accounts...most likely one of Lower Manhattan's Mafia bosses\\" where he was married with children. He was arrested again on November 29, 1919 on another murder charge but was not convicted When Prohibition began, he left white slavery behind and became an effective bootlegger. Along with his ally, Vincenzo Terranova, one of the heads of the Corleonesi mafia borgata known as the Morello Family, he was reputed to run all illicit liquor trade in Harlem during Prohibition's first years. He had become very rich, reportedly, by the time of his death, being worth $300,000 from his illicit booze selling operations. He was also reputed to own a \\"carpet-joint\\" gambling house known as the Fordham Casino in addition to some tenement buildings, both in the Bronx As he became rich from his criminal enterprises, he began to famously flaunt his wealth. He became a very flashy dresser and was often \\"covered in jewels\\". By 1921, he had become known as \\"Diamond Joe Peppe\\" or \\"Diamond Joe\\" for short, boasting shortly before his death of owning a $10,000 diamond stick pin. Author Patrick Downey has suggested that he may initially have been the boss to which the rising mafia gangster, Joe Masseria, reported as his captain, until Viserti's death Death When the original head of the Morello Family, Giuseppe Morello, emerged back on the scene in 1920, after a decade behind bars, he immediately took back the reigns of leadership from his younger half-brother, Vincenzo Terranova. Morello quickly formed an alliance with one of his former Capo's, the now emerging new Mafia boss of Lower Manhattan's Little Italy, Joe Masseria. The Boss of Bosses at that time, Salvatore D'Aquila wasted no time in fighting back against this threat to his authority and went to war with the Morello-Masseria pact. The first casualty of this new conflict was Diamond Joe Viserti. He was shot twice in the back in a gunfight on October 13, 1921 at a coffee shop in Little Italy.

Since 1997, she has served as a White House correspondent and is the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. In 2017, she joined CNN as a political analyst. In May 2017, the National Association of Black Journalists named Ryan as the \\"Journalist of the Year\\". Career Ryan is a graduate of Morgan State University with a B.S. in broadcast journalism, and was awarded an honorary doctorate from her alma mater in 2017. Ryan also holds an honorary doctorate from Claflin University. She began her media career as a jazz disc jockey before turning to reporting. Prior to working for the White House press corps, she worked for various radio stations, including North Carolina A&T; University and WXYV-FM in Baltimore, Maryland, where she served as its news director. Ryan has been a member of the White House press corps for American Urban Radio Networks since January 1997. She is a member of the National Press Club and is one of only three African Americans to have served on the board of the White House Correspondent's Association. As a White House correspondent, Ryan has covered four presidential administrations. Ryan has conducted one-on-one interviews with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Thabo Mbeki, and John Kerry, among others. Following the election of President Donald Trump, Ryan participated in exchanges with him and his press secretary Sean Spicer. At a February press conference, when Trump began talking about \\"inner city places\\" and urban crime, she asked him if he planned to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). He responded by telling her to set up the meeting with them before asking, \\"Are they friends of yours?\\" Ryan responded that she was only a reporter and not a member of the CBC. In March 2017, Spicer accused her of having an agenda when she asked about Trump's ties with Russia and then berated her for shaking her head. As one of the few African Americans in the White House press corps, Ryan frequently asks questions on issues concerning minorities and has made statements suggesting that she resents that other journalists do not ask such questions as often. She said in an interview in May 2017: \\"Why can't the dynamic of all people be in that room? Why can't it be? All people are covered under the White House. Am I correct? So I really dislike that, but I have no qualms with it. If you want to call me a black reporter, I am the black reporter who also asks other issues and questions on China, Russia, Syria, North Korea. So if you want to label me a black reporter, I take it with a badge of honor.\\" Explaining the utility of diversity in the White House press corps, Ryan says \\"I remember many years ago, George W. Bush said we need more minorities in there because you don‚Äôt hear a lot of the issues unless it‚Äôs coming from a person of a certain background. When you‚Äôre not at the table, you often don‚Äôt hear stories that are in your community.\\" Ryan, whom The A.V. Club dubbed \\"stalwart and professional\\" in her approach, said on an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that the purpose of the press remains unchanged by the Trump administration's hostile attitude to the mainstream media. Ryan stressed that the journalists must \\"get accurate information, facts for the American public. It's not about us, it's about freedom of the press. It's about informing the masses.\\" She joined CNN as a political analyst in 2017. Her first book, The Presidency in Black and White: My Up-Close View of Three Presidents and Race in America, was published in 2015 and won an NAACP Image Award. Her second book, At Mama's Knee: Mothers and Race in Black and White, was published in 2016. Her work has also appeared in Politico. Her blog, Fabric of America, is devoted to minority issues and stories in the United States. Awards and honors In May 2017, the National Association of Black Journalists named Ryan as the \\"Journalist of the Year\\". On July 11, 2019, she was inducted as an honorary member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Controversies At an April 2018 White House press conference, Ryan asked whether or not Trump has considered resigning, which drew the ire of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called Ryan's question \\"absolutely ridiculous.\\" Ryan said she subsequently received death threats and hired a bodyguard. Ryan gave the keynote speech at the NJ Parent Summit, held on August 3, 2019 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Before she began her speech, she ordered a local journalist, Charlie Kratovil of New Brunswick Today, to remove his camera, despite the presence of other press cameras recording the event. Kratovil refused, so Ryan, while at the lectern, talked to her bodyguard, then told the crowd, \\"When I speak, I do not have news covering my speeches.\\" Her bodyguard, Joel Morris, violently ejected Kratovil; he was subsequently charged with harassment, assault and theft in connection with the incident. In an August 25 interview, Ryan stated that she was unaware of the incident as it was happening, and that she \\"did not order anyone to do anything\\". She also said that Morris no longer worked for her. Media critic Erik Wemple of The Washington Post criticized Ryan's explanation of the incident as \\"lame excuses\\". Personal life Ryan was raised in Baltimore, where she lives with her two daughters, Ryan and Grace. Her marriage to husband Tennie James ended in divorce.April Ryan. At Mama's Knee.

It is approximately long and flows through Black Creek Township. The stream has been used as a water supply for portions of Hazleton and some surrounding areas. It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and wild trout naturally reproduce within it. Course Barnes Run begins on the northern side of a mountain in Black Creek Township. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before turning north for nearly a mile. After several tenths of a mile, it leaves the mountain and crosses Rock Glen Road. The stream then turns west-northwest for several tenths of a mile, passing near the Sugarloaf Golf Course and flowing through a series of ponds. A short distance downstream of the ponds, it reaches its confluence with Black Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Barnes Run is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is between above sea level. Barnes Run is in the ridge and valley physiographic province. The Barnes Run collecting dam has a capacity of . Watershed Barnes Run is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Nuremberg. The stream is not considered to be a major stream. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection opted not to recognize the watershed of Barnes Run as a \\"high quality watershed\\" with the potential to be affected by development. One proposed route for the Susquehanna-Roseland 500 kV Transmission Line crosses Barnes Run. Barnes Run is one of eleven officially named streams in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek that has not been assessed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. History Barnes Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202218. The stream was added because of its appearance on the Atlas of the Anthracite Coalfields of Pennsylvania, which was published in 1888. The Barnes Run Reservoir was constructed in 1912. It is dammed by an earth dam with a masonry core wall and a cut-stone spillway. In 1964, it was noted in the Standard-Speaker that the reservoir rarely ran dry. Barnes Run has been one of several streams used as a water supply in Hazleton. It and two other streams (Wolffs Run and Stony Creek) supplied water to as many as 14,400 people in 1974. In the early 1900s, Barnes Run and Wolffs Run made up 25 percent of the water supply of Hazleton. In 1963, Barnes Run was one of ten suppliers of water to Hazleton. It also supplied water to West Hazleton and Humboldt. Biology Barnes Run is designated as a Coldwater Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Barnes Run from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission considered adding the stream to its list of Wild Trout Waters in a meeting on April 11 and April 12, 2012.

She releases solo music under the name Indiensoci. Her vocal style has been described as slipping \\"from exquisite sweetness to Bj√∂rk-like yelps\\".  Beginnings  Standell-Preston listened to Top 40 music while growing up and continues to love pop. She credited former Braids bandmate Katie Lee for introducing her to \\"music which is not on the radio\\". She played clarinet and trumpet in her school bands, before moving on to guitar. In 2012, she recalled her entry into music as having been brought about by switching \\"through a lot of different artistic endeavours. I wanted to be a painter, I wanted to be a dancer and I wanted to be an actor, then I just found music\\". Her first notable band was Calgary indie outfit Jane Vain and the Dark Matter, with whom she played in 2007.  Influences and themes  Standell-Preston has stated that the pop music she listened to as a teenager still influences her writing, in which she focuses on producing hooks, but without catchiness being central to her melodies. In 2013, she named Aphex Twin, Stephan Bodzin, Max Cooper, Pantha du Prince and Burial as influences. She has described her lyrics as \\"dirty\\" and \\"graphic\\" and also revealed that her struggle with depression influences her lyrics. She described her lyric-writing process as being \\"a lot of the time, I'll sing for 20 minutes, then I'll go back and review all the words that I said and I'll type them up. I'll find a pattern or a theme. I'll start paring things together and see the intent of what I was trying to have during that outburst\\". Standell-Preston cited labelmate Claire Boucher as an inspiration to her as a person, saying, \\"She is able to be really real, but then have this project that is so other-worldly and the two work really beautifully together. It's something I really look up to a lot when it comes to my personal image\\".  Braids  = Beginnings and Native Speaker (2006‚Äì2011) = Austin Tufts was the first future member of Braids who Standell-Preston met, at junior high school in Calgary, Canada. The pair moved on to Western Canada High School, where they met Lee, Taylor Smith and Vince Man. The five formed The Neighbourhood Council in 2006, during their final year of high school. Standell-Preston fronted the band as lead singer and guitarist, handling the \\"delivery and emotional content\\" of the music in addition to writing the lyrics. While putting off university, the band quickly picked up steam, intensively rehearsing, writing and performing at the Calgary Folk Music Festival and at Sled Island in 2007. They released their first EP, Set Pieces, in July 2008. After the release of the EP, and their rechristening as Braids, each member of the band was accepted into McGill University in Montreal, with Standell-Preston turning down the offer and remaining in Calgary. She later moved to Montreal to reunite with her bandmates. Of the musical atmosphere in Montreal, she said, \\"In Calgary it's really looked down upon if you don't have a normal job, a nice house and a normal car, but here you're considered a nobody if you give in to that\\". After signing to Arbutus Records, the band's debut album, Native Speaker, was released in January 2011, winning critical acclaim and Juno Award nominations for Best Alternative Album and Best New New Group. The album was also shortlisted for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize. In August 2013, Standell-Preston said, \\"With Native Speaker, everything besides the title track is so angry. I was so upset and felt like the world was really unfair\\". = Flourish // Perish and Deep in the Iris (2012‚Äìpresent) = Standell-Preston returned to Montreal in 2012 to record her second album Flourish // Perish. The period was overshadowed by the breakdown of Standell- Preston's friendship with Lee, which resulted in a bitter split and resulted in Lee leaving Braids. Looking back in December 2013, Standell-Preston said, \\"The band really felt like it was going to end and we all had to make that decision. It's been really hard, I really, really miss her and I think about her\\". The album was recorded in the garage below the house the band shared and featured a prominent electronic direction. After the \\"angry\\" Native Speaker, Standell-Preston realised that after being in such a painful situation during the early stages of the making of Flourish // Perish, she needed to make an effort \\"to be more aware of beauty, in my life and my lyrics\\" on the album. The album was a different experience for her musically as well, abandoning the guitar for all but one song, \\"In Kind\\", instead focusing on keyboards. The album was released in August 2013 to critical acclaim. After the release of the album, Standell-Preston expressed a desire to return to playing guitar again, saying, \\"I need to abandon something in order to realise just how much I appreciate it\\". As Braids' Flourish // Perish tour neared its end in December 2013, Standell-Preston revealed that after recording the album in the confines of a garage, \\"for our next record, we want to try and embrace open space. We want to go to Arizona and rent out some weird place in the middle of the desert and just have endless space\\". The band recorded their third album, Deep in the Iris, throughout the first half of 2014 in Arizona, New York and Vermont.  Blue Hawaii  A meeting and relationship with Alex \\"Agor\\" Kerby (aka Alex Cowan) in 2009‚Äì2010 resulted in the formation of electronic/ambient pop duo Blue Hawaii. After a trip to South America, Standell-Preston and Cowan released their first EP, Blooming Summer, on Arbutus Records in 2010. They released their first album Untogether in 2013. The separation between the pair inspired the writing of Untogether, with Standell-Preston working with Braids and Cowan living in Berlin. The duo released a mixtape in late 2014, titled Agor Edits, featuring edits of old songs and a new song, \\"All of My Heart\\". The group reunited in 2016 in Los Angeles,https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/blue-hawaii/601168171 and a single, No One Like You, was released in 2017.\\"Daily Dose: Blue Hawaii, \\"No One Like You\\".

CBC News, Katherine Duncan ¬∑ CBC News ¬∑ Jan 11, 2018 Standell- Preston has described the project's difference from Braids, saying \\"Blue Hawaii is a bit more of an outlet for the urge in me to explore what it really is to be a performer and to have face paint and to bring all the artistic elements into the performance\\".  Indiensoci  Self-described as \\"very feminine and ethereal\\", Standell-Preston released her first solo track, \\"Tickle Grass\\", on MySpace under the name Indiensoci in January 2009.https://myspace.com/indiensoci/music/song/tickle-grass-48189153-51749122 She provided the live music for the opening of the Canadian Centre for Architecture exhibition \\"Speed Limits\\" on 19 May 2009. Standell-Preston released her second solo track, \\"Besnard\\", on YouTube in May 2010. The song was later released on the Flemish Eye mixtape Eye Spy.  Solo  In 2014, Standell-Preston appeared on a re-recorded version of Jon Hopkins' \\"Form by Firelight\\", released on his Asleep Versions EP.  Personal life  Standell- Preston grew up in Calgary, Canada. She later lived in Montreal in a shared house with Kerby and Braids members Tufts and Smith. She had a relationship with Tufts at school, before breaking up at age 17. Standell-Preston has suffered from \\"pretty crazy bouts of depression\\" since a young age.

She was ordered by a royal order of 28 September 1791, built in the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro shipyard and launched on 17 March 1794. Designed by Romero Landa and belonging to the Monta√±√©s-class (a subset or modification of the San Ildefonsino class), her main guns were distributed along two complete decks, with 28 24-pounder in her first battery (lower deck) and 30 18-pounders in her second battery (upper deck). Additionally she had 12 8-pounders on her quarterdeck and four 8-pounders on her forecastle. History She underwent proving trials between September and November 1794 alongside the Monta√±√©s, also launched in 1794, aiming to work out whose method of construction was best. The trials were overseen by Jos√© Justo Salceno and the results favoured the Monta√±√©s. The Monarca was assigned to Juan de L√°ngara's squadron, taking part in the defence of Roses. She took part in the battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 under the command of Captain Teodoro Argumosa. She was attacked at close range by Mars and Tonnant as they first cut the Franco-Spanish line. The ship behind the Tonnant, the Bellerophon, slipped under her stern at 12:30 and fired two broadsides into her. She was heavily damaged, with 100 men killed and 150 wounded. A party of 55 Royal Marines captured the ship, but the night after the battle the surviving Spanish crew overpowered them and cast them adrift, leaving them to the mercy of the storm that night. On 24 October the survivors decided to try to repair the ship's rudder and return to Cadiz, as the weather was improving, but an hour later they were pursued by Leviathan, which also picked up the marines and some Spanish survivors of the storm. On 28 October the ship ran aground on the Arenas Gordas coast near Huelva, between Torre de la Higuera and Torre del Asperillo, leaving it lying on its side. On 31 October she was destroyed by the guns of the frigate Naiad to avoid her being reused or refloated.

In December 2014, he was appointed to the Nebraska Legislature, representing a district in the east-central part of the state. He is a member of the Republican Party. Personal life and professional career Schnoor was born on December 29, 1961, in West Point, Nebraska. He graduated from Scribner High School in Scribner, Nebraska, and immediately enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, in 1980. He earned two associate degrees from the Community College of the Air Force. He worked as a combat controller, and was awarded a Bronze Star with a \\"V\\" device for valor, for his actions during the rescue of a downed helicopter in Panama. In 2000, Schnoor's father retired from the family farm near Scribner. Schnoor retired from the Air Force with the rank of master sergeant and, with his brother, took over the farm. He founded a cattle- feeding operation, Schnoor Feedyard. He was elected to the Scribner-Snyder School Board, and served as its president. Nebraska legislature Scribner lay in the Nebraska Legislature's 15th District, which was coterminous with Dodge County, and included the city of Fremont. In 2014, Charlie Janssen, the district's legislator, successfully ran for the post of state auditor, and resigned from the Legislature with two years left in his term. Governor Dave Heineman, charged with appointing someone to fill the vacancy, chose Schnoor from a set of five applicants. Schnoor was sworn in on December 12, 2014. =2015 session= In the 2015 session of the Legislature, Schnoor was appointed to the Education Committee and the Natural Resources Committee. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Schnoor voted against the death-penalty repeal, and to sustain Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted against LB623, then to sustain the gubernatorial veto; and he abstained in both the vote on the gas-tax increase and the vote to override the veto. =2016 session= In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Schnoor was listed as \\"present and not voting\\" in the bill's 29-15-5 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8-4; Schnoor was among those voting against it. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Schnoor was present and not voting at the bill's passage, and voted against the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Schnoor was among those who voted in favor of the bill.

St.Patrick's Basilica, South Dunedin, exterior. The Basilica The exterior is incomplete and is \\"only a shadow of what the architect intended\\", but the impressive interior is completely realised. With St Patrick's Basilica, Petre turned to the Palladian Revival style with which he is most associated. The interior in contrast to the earlier neo-Gothic style of the cathedral, is richly embellished with classical detailing. The Crucifixion Its single greatest feature is the deeply embossed High Renaissance ceiling, a feature which occurs in many variations in Petre's later work, most notably in St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru (ceiling installed in 1898) and Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington (1901). In many respects St Patrick's Basilica foreshadows Petre's Wellington cathedral (the other Petre church most like St Patrick's Basilica), the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch (1905), and the last of his major churches, Sacred Heart Basilica, Timaru (1911). Features The interior features a large arcaded nave forming a clerestory with two side aisles and a large arch forming the entrance to the sanctuary. Walls are built in a succession of arches surmounted by a cornice of stone which forms part of the rooves of the aisles. Series of stone pilasters are ranged against the walls and on the sides of piers. The style of the capitals of the pilasters is Corinthian. The Basilica has retained its high altar (behind a modern one installed for the post-Vatican II liturgy) and features many fine statues. The 14 great stained glass windows (made by F X Zettler in Munich and purchased through H Credington & Co, Melbourne) represent the mysteries of the Rosary with one (the third sorrowful mystery, \\"The Crowning with Thorns\\") omitted. The Sanctuary is dominated by a large oil painting by Giuseppi Brazi of St Patrick and St Brigid interceding with Our Blessed Lady and her Divine Son. The Stations of the Cross, which are of terracotta and framed in oak, were made in Paris in 1901. Thomas Heffernan and his wife Margaret were significant funders of the church and they are notably memorialised in one of the windows. Devotion St Patricks is known as a centre of Catholic devotion in Dunedin. \\"I was only in the parish a few days when I realised the great number of people who came in prayer on their way to work, on their way home, on their way shopping, on their way to pick up children at school.\\"L A Boyle, Bishop of Dunedin, St Patrick's Basilica Centennial 1894-1994, p. 3. This devotion was accentuated (especially in the 1950s-1970sSt Patrick's Basilica Centennial 1894-1994, p. 33.) by the Novena in honour of Our Lady. This was held every Saturday night at 7.00pm and consisted of prayers, hymns, a short homily, the reading of petitions placed in the box at the shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, some thanksgivings and finally Benediction. \\"Large numbers came to the novena, from all over the city. They filled the seats and stood in the aisles and porch. The devotion was followed with great numbers flocking to the four confessionals, where the priests remained for lengthy periods.\\" The novena was so popular that a special bus provided transport for those in outlying parishes who wished to attend.Jeff Dillon, \\"Novena, nostalgia, and a nosh-up in South Dunedin\\", NZ Catholic, November 3-16 , 2019, p. 17. Anniversary St Patrick's 125th anniversary was celebrated in October 2019 over a weekend. Over 500 people attend a combined Sunday Mass con-celebrated by Bishop Michael Dooley and Bishop Paul Martin followed by a shared lunch outside in fine weather to enjoy food, friendship, music and a bouncy castle for the children. At the commencement on the Friday night, current parishioner Jo Bell organised a replica set of novena celebration which 130 people attended. On the Saturday night, Sean Brosnahan, a curator at Toitu Otago Settlers Museum, gave a presentation on the history of the basilica. He noted that the early history of St Patrick's was influenced by the diversity of population in the South Dunedin \\"flats\\" area and the particular concentration of Catholic Irish people there. He spoke also of two important figures in the history of the church. These were prosperous roading contractor and important contributor to the church, Thomas Heffernan, and Francis Petre, St Patrick's Basilica's architect.

It is the latest local train to be served on TRA. Introduction The six newest EMU800 series are painted with inverted colors. The EMU800 series was purchased in response to increasing passenger volume and electrification of branch lines, which diverted older commuter EMUs. At 296 cars, the order is the second-largest ever placed by TRA. The first two EMU800 trains were built by Nippon Sharyo, and the remaining 35 were built by the Taiwan Rolling Stock Company from 2013 to 2015. At the beginning there was a dispute over the braking system. After years of negotiation, TRA accepted the proposal and the EMU800 began to service. =Features= Unlike previous commuter EMUs, the EMU800 features a fully streamlined nose. Its yellow-and-blue paint scheme has earned it the nickname \\"smiling train\\" (ÂæÆÁ¨ëËôü) due to the way the stripe is painted on. The trainsets also have a top speed of , compared to for all other commuter stock. The EMU800 is also the first to have bicycle racks, installed in each of the end cars.

She was launched in May 1794 and entered service the following year. With 2400 copper plates on her hull, she was much faster than other ships of the same era, reaching 14 (rather than the average 10) knots downwind and 10 (rather than 8) knots upwind. In 1795 she fought a French force of 8 ships of the line (including one three-decker) and 2 frigates single-handed in the bay of San Feliu de Gu√≠xols - thanks to her superior speed, the Monta√±√©s managed to get within range of a coastal artillery battery, forcing the French to break off the chase. In June 1805 she was put under the command of Francisco Alcedo and made part of Alcal√° Galdiano's division, defending Cadiz from a possible British attack. At the battle of Trafalgar she was assigned to the second division of Gravina's squadron.

It was built from 1788 to 1789 and used until 1845, after which it was demolished in 1846. Some of the site is now occupied by the Museum of Sydney. Its construction was attributed to James Bloodsworth. It is also known as First Government House Site, Museum of Sydney and A Rum Rebellion Site. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 1999; and on 19 August 2005 the site was listed on the National Heritage List.  History  The abode of the first Governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip, was a structure made of canvas and timber brought from England with the First Fleet and erected in January 1788. First Government House took about a year to build. Governor Phillip laid the foundation stone in May 1788. He moved into the house on 17 April 1789.Ross, John (ed.) (1993) Chronicle of Australia, Melbourne, Chronicle Australasia, p.77. As the first permanent building in the colony, it had two storeys built of bricks and stone comprising six rooms, two cellars and a rear staircase. In front of the house was a garden where many imported plant species were grown and the first orchard planted. After establishing the site of the settlement, a substantial \\"temporary\\" government house in the Australian Georgian style was established on the corner of Bridge and Phillip streets in the Sydney central business district. The two-storey house was built under the direction of James Bloodsworth, a convict builder responsible for the construction of most of the colony's buildings between 1788 and 1800. This building, the first \\"permanent\\" building in Sydney, was completed by 1789 using English bricks, native stone and a quantity of convict-baked sandstock bricks from the Sydney region. At the back of the house were clusters of outbuildings containing the kitchen, bakehouse, stables and offices and workrooms. When Governor Hunter took over as governor in 1795 he added a verandah to the house, possibly the first in the colony. Hunter also set up the colony's first printing office in the grounds which produced Notices and Orders and in 1803, Australia's first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette. This first government house was extended and repaired by the following eight Governors. The building was adapted quickly to the Australian climate. A verandah was added by Governor King circa 1800, and a drawing room was added in a side wing in the same year. By 1816 Francis Greenway was commissioned to construct a substantial extension and ballroom by Governor Macquarie, transforming Phillip's house into an Italianate cottage; the first such Italianate structure in the colony. Greenway designed a new wing of five rooms on the southern side and a new stable block. The stable block is now the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Macquarie was responsible for prompting the construction of many of the colony's first permanent public buildings, and he attempted to build a replacement for the original Sydney Government House. Work on this was started by Greenway, but the project was not approved by the British government, and unlike the castle-like stables, commissioned in 1816, was never finished. The heritage-listed 1816 stables build by Greenway under Macquarie's direction still stand in the Botanic Gardens and form a facade for the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. The stables were built in the Gothic Picturesque architectural style with turrets, the building was described as a \\"palace for horses\\", and is a portrayal of the romantic vision of Macquarie and the British architectural trends of the time. It is the only example of a gothic building designed by Greenway still standing. The cost and apparent extravagance was one of the reasons Macquarie was recalled to Britain. The stables, located close to picturesque Sydney Harbour, reflect the building techniques and the range of materials and skills employed during the early settlement era. The first Government house was generally in poor condition and was vacated when the Governor relocated to the new Government House in 1845, and was demolished in 1846. The house suffered as a result of the poor mortar (made from the lime of crushed sea shells), white ant infestations, and what appeared to be rising damp in later years.Department of Planning Despite these problems, the house was an architectural milestone for Australia, and the first proportionately classical building in the continent. It even included Australia's first staircase. The colony's first Legislative Council met at the house in 1824. In 1851 the site was granted to the Municipal Council of Sydney for a proposed town hall. However, it was not considered sufficiently centrally located for this purpose. The site remained unfenced and covered in grass until 1867, when it was reported as being used for Council Stores. In the 1880s and 1890s terraces were constructed around the site. Throughout the 1880s the Phillip Street side of the block was bounded by high wooden hoarding. The site was entered off Bridge Street and there were at least two small sheds, one of which was used as a tailor's shop. In 1899 workmen digging at the site found the foundation stone laid by Phillip in 1788. Much of the \\"Governor's Domain\\" to the east of the original house has survived today as the adjacent areas of parkland known as The Domain, the Botanic Garden, and also the gardens of today's Government House, adjacent to the Sydney Opera House. In 1912 a corrugated iron, two storey building was erected on the site for the office of the Government Architect. After its demolition in 1967 the site was paved over for use as a carpark. =Site preservation= Until 1983 it was generally thought that nothing remained of First Government House and the buildings associated with it. Excavation was undertaken as a prerequisite of a building development. In February 1983 the archaeologists uncovered foundations dating back to 1788. Between June and December 1983 a second stage of excavation was carried out. In the meantime increased public and political interest was evident. The base of the back wall, part of the western wall of Phillip's house and the foundations of the original outbuildings containing the kitchen and the bakehouse were all uncovered. Stone foundations, garden paths, drains, evidence of the first printing office and thousands of other objects were also discovered. The site of the first government house remained virtually untouched until the 1980s, when a proposal to build a new high rise office tower on the site was made. Following representations to the NSW Government by concerned members of the newly formed Friends of the First Government House Site, construction was deferred to allow archaeologists to explore the area. The well-preserved foundations of First Government House were located in 1983 and excavated over the following months; providing a priceless insight into the early years of our nation. The tower was redesigned to preserve the historic foundations and incorporate them into the design of a new museum. When it was commissioned, the project was called the First Government House Museum.Fraser Range Granite NL, \\"Quarterly Exploration Reports December (Part A)\\", 27 January 1994, Australian Stock Exchange Company Announcements via factiva accessed 27 August 2011. Whilst the museum building was being built in November 1993, the New South Wales Minister for the Arts announced that the museum would be known as the Museum of Sydney on the Site of First Government House,Local Government (General) Amendment (Rate Exemptions) Regulation 2009 (NSW) and reg 123, Local Government (General) Regulation 2005 (NSW). described in the press at the time as a \\"mouthful\\" and commonly contracted to Museum of Sydney. The change of name attracted protests. The site was placed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate by special gazettal and public meetings were held to raise support for the site. The progress of the excavations was followed in the media.Proudfoot, et.al. 1991. As a result of the importance of these finds the NSW Government, owner of the site, released the commercial developers from their development lease in order to keep the site for future generations. A national design competition was announced for a development design to ensure the conservation and protection of the site. In 1984 a third stage of excavation was carried out. Between December 1984 and January 1985 the site was sealed with bitumen to protect the remains. Further analysis of the stratigraphy and artefacts from the site was carried out. In June 1988 an architectural competition was announced for the design of a structure to commemorate first government house, and adjoining commercial office development. It is now the site of the Museum of Sydney.  Description  The site is situated on the south-west corner of the intersection of Bridge and Phillip Streets in the northern section of the Sydney CBD. It includes an area that is currently occupied by Victorian terraces on the north-west portion of the site. Remains uncovered on the site include the foundation of the back wall and part of the western wall of Phillip's house, and the foundations of the original outbuildings containing the bakehouse and kitchen. Other stone foundations, drains, and a corner of the Dining Room Governor Macquarie added to the house are also extant. (Department of Planning) These are incorporated into the interior floor of the Museum of Sydney and the forecourt. = Condition = As at 11 October 1999, the archaeological potential of the site is medium to high.

It was the home and offices of the Governors of New South Wales from 1788-1845 and the official, social and administrative centre of the colony from 1788-1845. As such, it is associated with numerous events of political, cultural and social significance to the colony's development. Its use as both home and seat of authority and its siting and subsequent development determined to a large extent the pattern of growth of Sydney. This entails both the physical pattern of the streets and its cultural pattern of political, official, recreational and residential and mercantile quarters. The site of the building contains the only remains from 1788 known to survive in 1983. These remains provide evidence of Australia's major phases of history, architectural, building technology, and administration of the colony in New South Wales. First Government House has a unique historical significance because of the many historic figures, both European and Aboriginal, who are associated with the building. It also has great scientific significance which is proven in its potential to answer research questions in these and other fields. First Government House is of great symbolic importance to the Australian people. The site is our most tangible link to our past and the foundation of white settlement in this country.Historic Houses Trust, 1992.Bickford, 1983. First Government House, Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is a symbol of the foundation and perpetuation of European settlement and authority in Australia. First Government House was a major link with the U.K. as it was the first permanent centre of British colonial administration in Australia. It is associated with a major phase in Australia's government, being the centre of power throughout its life. The first portion of the building to be erected was constructed by the first settlers of the colony. The in situ works and structures demonstrate the high standard of the first building in the colony and the echoing European style. An example of the technology and high standards of the building are demonstrated in the footing and drainage system. The remains show evidence of difficulties in the building materials used and how the problems were resolved. First Government House was an example of modern living and displayed in later buildings. The extensions and alterations show the enhanced importance of the governor and his colony. Its replacement was an indication that it could no longer reflect this status adequately. It has associations with important people, such as explorers, governors, foreign visitors, Aboriginals, merchants, statesmen and settlers. It is also associated with government decisions and historic events for the first 57 years of the colony's existence. It was the office and residence of the first and eight succeeding Governors of NSW. It is associated with the earliest formal attempts to communicate with the Aboriginal people of Australia. It was the location for historic events such as the arrest of Governor Bligh at the beginning of the Rum Rebellion, the beginning of the press in Australia and the first meetings of the Legislative Council. As one of the first stone and brick buildings erected in the colony, it is significant as a prime example of experimentation with, and development of, building style and technology. The location of First Government House influenced the development of the irregular street pattern at the south-eastern side of Sydney Cove. The ground around the house was one of the first areas in the colony to be cleared. The changing use of this land is a prime example of experimentation with the development of landscape design. It is also associated with the history of art. It was a major landmark and was the centre of many paintings and drawings of Sydney before 1845.Conybeare, et.al., 1988. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The First Government House Precinct is significant due to the variety of styles, and the consistent scale, texture and unique quality of many of its component buildings. Both variation in terms of space and scale are contributed by the site within the townscape of Bridge and Phillip Streets. The site provides a balance between the dominant verticality of buildings in the city. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is a crucial landmark for all Australians, including in particular groups of people who are of English, Irish and Scots descent, Aboriginal people and First Fleeters. The site is significant to Aboriginal people because of its association with historic Aboriginal persons and also as the focal point in their country's invasion by white people. As it contains the oldest in-situ remains of British settlement in Australia, and as the site of the earliest seat of government in the colony, the site is saturated with direct historical associations and, for many, has become the symbolic focus of diverse environmental, cultural, racial and political issues related to the colonisation of Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. First Government House is of Archaeological significance because it contains the answers to many historical and scientific questions which can only be solved by archaeological techniques. The First Government House site gives archaeologists and historians opportunities for research into aspects of the city of Sydney 200 years ago. The site has research value as an area of primary information from the earliest days of colonisation to the present day. It has educational value as a resource explaining the history of an area and the techniques for researching that history. The primary site and precinct with their associated structures and grounds are significant because they constitute an archive of the development of architectural history, building technology and changing land uses in urban development over a 200-year period. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site contains in situ remains of Australia's first permanent Government House. These remains are the only known in situ physical evidence from the first year of European settlement and are our most tangible link with it. It is the only site yet located with archaeological deposits covering the full 211 years of Australia's European Colonisation. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Being the first permanent residence, it became an exemplar for building fashion: stone footings, white washed brick walls and terra-cotta or shingle roofs became the accepted residential standard of the free class.

Both remained valid until the end of the Ottoman Empire. The law underwent very minor amendments during the course of the Second Constitutional Era and was retained by the Republic of Turkey with slight revisions until 1946. The law was detail compassing wide electoral matters. The law stipulated designation of electoral districts. The law stipulated determination of the size of parliamentary contingents. The law stipulated preparation of registers The law stipulated selection and duties of electoral inspection committees. The law stipulated suffrage requirements. How to conduct of elections including updating registers. The law also included penal clauses.  Background  In 1860 a provincial law passed. Before the Ottoman Electoral Law, provincial law included elections for the neighborhood headmen. It is arguable that elections in the Ottoman Empire began in 1860, not 1876. Registration was the task of village and neighborhood headmen and religious leaders, which this rule extended to Ottoman Electoral Law. In this respect at the lowest level, basic election unit, never changed.  Electoral structure  All males above the age 25 who were registed at the tax office were entitled to vote. There were exemptions, such as proteges of a foreign government, A degree in business court related to bankrupt or disposed of their property. The prisoners were also accepted as deprived of their civil rights which extended to voting and candidacy. The two-stage indirect election process. One deputy in the chamber for every 50,000 male residents. The provincial subdivision was the sancak. Inspection units were the kaza. Candidacy for deputy was province-wide. Eligible voters elected secondary voters (that is two stage voting), one for every 500 primary voters one Secondary voter. Two-stage system reinforced patronage relationships and precluded the election of candidates truly representative of the common people.  Balloting  The election was a staggered and drawn-out process that was not coordinated throughout the empire or even the province. Balloting was based on the multiple-member plurality system. The voters wrote in as many names as there were candidates. A candidate could run either in his province of residence or province of origin. There were rules for the secrecy of balloting and security of tallying and tabulating.  Analysis  French scholar Raoul de la Grasserie's detailed comparative study of electoral systems. the Ottoman electoral system compared favorably to its contemporary Western counterparts in the extent of suffrage it provided for. In contrast to contemporary electoral systems of Germany, Russia, Japan, and England, there was no legally stipulated weighting that distributed among different social groups.

Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the Wickersham Commission, that spelled out reforms but left to the police to implement them, often with limited success. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. Mapp v. Ohio found that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against \\"unreasonable searches and seizures\\" may not be used in criminal prosecutions. Miranda v. Arizona required that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by police. These decisions began to set national standards for policing. Special commissions, such as the Knapp Commission in New York City during the 1970s, have been used to bring about changes in law enforcement agencies. Civilian review boards (permanent external oversight agencies) have also been used as a means for improving police accountability. Civilian review boards tend to focus on individual complaints, rather than broader organizational issues that may result in long-term improvements. In response to instances of police brutality, the United States Commission on Civil Rights suggested in 1981 that police departments enforce early intervention programs. The goal of these programs is to spot potentially risky behaviors within police departments, and to take preventative action to reduce instances of police misconduct. Although not required, many police departments have opted to adopt early prevention programs. However, the methods used to identify problematic police officers were found to be inefficient. The identifiers used often flag officers that in reality pose a minimal threat, while those that would benefit from additional oversight fly under the radar. To offset this, police departments have been using an increased number of indicators to determine risk factors. The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act authorized the United States Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to bring civil (\\"pattern or practice\\") suits against local law enforcement agencies, to reign in abuses and hold them accountable. As a result, numerous departments have entered into consent decrees or memoranda of understanding, requiring them to make organizational reforms. This approach shifts focus from individual officers to placing focus on police organizations. Some law enforcement agencies in the United States in the early 2000s and 2010s began to emphasize de-escalation as a method of conflict resolution and obtaining voluntary compliance. There are also emphases on community policing to build relationships and community trust in law enforcement; the evidence-based policing approach of using of data to assist with decision-making; and the importance of civilian oversight of police work. Nonetheless, instances of misconduct and brutality have continued to occur. Many reforms related to the killing of George Floyd have been put forward. Early history Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the Wickersham Commission, that spelled out reforms but left implementation to the police, often with limited success. 1960s: the Johnson Administration and the Warren Court In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson created the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. The Commission's final report, issued in 1967, has been described as \\"the most comprehensive evaluation of crime and crime control in the United States at the time\\". It laid out reorganization plans for police departments and suggested a range of reforms. Several of the Commission's findings related to the poor treatment of juvenile offenders. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. Mapp v. Ohio found that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against \\"unreasonable searches and seizures\\" may not be used in criminal prosecutions. Miranda v. Arizona required that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by police. These decisions began to set national standards for policing.. 1970s and 1980s Special commissions, such as the Knapp Commission in New York City during the 1970s, have been used to bring about changes in law enforcement agencies.. Civilian review boards (permanent external oversight agencies) have also been used as a means for improving police accountability. Civilian review boards tend to focus on individual complaints, rather than broader organizational issues that may result in long- term improvements.. 1990 to 2010 The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act authorized the United States Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to bring civil (\\"pattern or practice\\") suits against local law enforcement agencies, to rein in abuses and hold agencies accountable. As a result, numerous departments have entered into consent decrees or memoranda of understanding, requiring the agencies to make organizational reforms.. This approach shifts focus from individual officers to police organizations. The Department of Justice also has a component called the Community Relations Service. Over the years, the Community Relations Service (CRS) has helped police departments and communities all over the country come to grips with the difficult task of maintaining law and order in a complex and changing multicultural society. Frequently, these efforts have involved minority citizens' complaints about police behavior, use of force, and hate groups. In a 2003 document titled Principles of Good Policing: Avoiding Violence Between Police and Citizens, the DOJ Community Relations Service outlines a two-level strategy for reducing potential for violence by police: > To reduce the potential for violence, police executives must inculcate the > values articulated by policy and procedure into two levels of the police > department: the administrative level and the \\"line\\" or operational level. To > accomplish the task of value-transition on one level without doing so on the > other is futile, for no change in police behavior will result. In addition > to the two levels of the organization which the police executive must > address, two dimensions of law enforcement must also be addressed: the > police culture and various community cultures. Thus, to effect change in > police-community violence, police executives must take a multidimensional > approach. Traditional approaches to reform have been one-dimensional, and > have met with little success. 2010 to present Some law enforcement agencies in the United States in the early 2000s and 2010s began to emphasize de-escalation as a method of conflict resolution and obtaining voluntary compliance. There are also emphases on community policing to build relationships and community trust in law enforcement; the evidence-based policing approach of using of data to assist with decision-making; and the importance of civilian oversight of police work. =Police use of force and issues of race= In the 2010s, a series of shootings of unarmed individuals by police officers correlated with calls for police and law enforcement reform, especially regarding the diversity of police officers and the treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system. In the specific case of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August 2014, an investigation by the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division concluded that, while there were not sufficient grounds to charge the police officer who shot Brown with a criminal offense, the Ferguson Police Department as a whole \\"was routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents.\\" Members of the Congressional Black Caucus indicated their appreciation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, and said that while many American police officers serve honorably, the problems found in Ferguson such as the use of fines to generate revenue instead of promote safety and justice, the use of excessive force, and unconstitutional practices may also be found in other communities in the United States. President Barack Obama created the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The commission issued a report on March 2, 2015, that made numerous recommendations. It did not call for all officers to wear body cameras, but did call for independent prosecutors to investigate civilian deaths in police custody or in officer-involved shootings. Sue Rahr, while sheriff of King County, Washington, had introduced a new policing model called L.E.E.D. (Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity) in 2011, which influenced her later work on the \\"guardian model\\" of training police candidates when she became the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission; Obama appointed Rahr to the President's Task Force, where the \\"guardian model\\" received support as a desirable alternative to the \\"warrior model\\" of training officers. Rahr said in a U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee hearing that, \\"When I talk about a guardian mindset... this is not a more kind and gentle way of doing the job. It's the opposite. We have increased firearms training and defensive tactics training, because we want to create strong, effective police officers who have the confidence that they don't [need] to behave in an intimidating manner. When someone has confidence, that helps deescalate as well. I think that when we were too focused on the boot camp method of training, it detracted away from our ability to train officers to be critical thinkers... What we have tried to shift towards is officer training, where you focus on critical thinking and confidence.\\" A spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union said that the ideas in the report of the President's Commission \\"will significantly improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve\\" and that \\"For us to see meaningful change, local authorities must first implement data collection systems to improve transparency, use of force policies that emphasize de-escalation, eradicate all forms of biased policing, and improve community engagement and oversight to provide accountability.\\" In response to the 2015 Baltimore protests, President Barack Obama said that \\"It's in [the interest of police officers] to root out [police] who aren't doing the right thing, to hold accountable people when they do something wrong, instead of just the closing-ranks approach that all too often we see that ends up just feeding greater frustration and ultimately, I think, putting more police officers in danger.\\" Obama also said, \\"Unfortunately we've seen these police-related killings or deaths too often now, and obviously everybody is starting to recognize that this is not just an isolated incident in Ferguson or New York, but we've got some broader issues.\\" Police leaders responded on January 29, 2016, with \\"Use of Force: Taking Policing to a Higher Standard\\". According to The New York Times, the new guideline call for police to use higher standards for use of force than those set by the U.S. Supreme Court. \\"This is a defining moment for us in policing,\\" said Charles Ramsey, the recently retired commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, according to The Washington Post. On July 7, 2016, after police shootings of black individuals in St Paul, Minnesota and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Obama said that \\"When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if it's because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same... This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about.\\" That same day, at a protest in Dallas, Texas, an attacker shot and killed multiple officers. On July 17, multiple officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge amid tensions after the shooting of Alton Sterling. Obama and Black Lives Matter leaders condemned the violence. Obama said, \\"We may not yet know the motives for this attack, but I want to be clear: there is no justification for violence against law enforcement. None. These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes. The officers in Baton Rouge; the officers in Dallas ‚Äì they were our fellow Americans, part of our community, part of our country, with people who loved and needed them, and who need us now ‚Äì all of us ‚Äì to be at our best.\\" =Police use of force on mentally ill individuals= Another dimension of police work receiving scrutiny in the 2010s is the interactions between police officers and individuals with mental illness. \\"Twenty-five percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder, according to various analyses.\\" Experts in criminal justice say that funding for mental health services in many parts of the country is insufficient, so police are likely to encounter mentally ill people. In response to negative reactions from the public to high-profile violent interactions between police and mentally ill individuals, some police departments are increasing their specialized training and changing their tactics for their interactions with mentally ill people. For example, all officers in Portland, Oregon receive 40 hours of \\"crisis intervention training\\". Officers in some departments may specialize in this type of work, similar to how other officers specialize in SWAT, narcotics, or K-9. =Reform of law enforcement agencies with other forms of misconduct= Oakland, California Police Department The Oakland, California Police Department had three police chiefs in nine days amid revelations that some Oakland officers had shared inappropriate text messages and emails, that a police sergeant allowed his girlfriend to write his reports, and that there had been sexual misconduct among officers of multiple law enforcement agencies and at least one U.S. Department of Defense employee. Oakland's mayor, Libby Schaaf, said at a news conference, \\"I am here to run a police department, not a frat house,\\" and that she wants \\"to root out what is clearly a toxic, macho culture.\\" Peter Keane, a former San Francisco police commissioner and law professor at Golden Gate University, said, \\"I think she can find someone who is really ruthless about instituting reforms of these kinds of things\\" but \\"You can't do any of this stuff with an internal candidate.\\" Los Angeles County Jails and Sheriff's Department On June 27, 2016, a federal judge sentenced Paul Tanaka, a former second-in-command of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, to five years in prison. The Court found him guilty of conspiracy and of obstructing an FBI investigation of abuses at the county jails. Judge Percy Anderson said, \\"Not only did [Tanaka] fail to identify and address problems in the jails, he exacerbated them.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"Prosecutors accused him of overseeing a scheme in which underlings tried to intimidate the lead FBI agent on the inquiry, concealed the whereabouts of an inmate who was working as a federal informant and pressured deputies not to cooperate with the investigation\\". =Firings and resignations of police chiefs= Police chiefs of Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Oakland were fired or resigned in 2015 and 2016 after various controversies, often involving issues of race and allegations of use of excessive force by officers. Chicago's chief was fired after a judge ordered the city to make a video public that showed the shooting of an individual by a police officer, and after public criticism of the city's handling of the video. Baltimore's chief was fired after a citizen died in police custody in controversial circumstances, riots after the death, and amidst a crime surge. =Praise of the Dallas, Texas Police Department= After the 2016 shooting of multiple officers in Dallas, Texas during what had been a peaceful protest, there were reports in the media that Dallas had one of the most progressive police departments in the nation. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said, \\"We did community policing before anybody, we had de-escalation training before anyone. We had this year the lowest number of police involved shootings than any major city in the country, and so it's very ironic that our police were protecting those that were exercising their freedom of speech and they lost their lives doing their jobs.\\" Police Chief David Brown received widespread praise for his leadership in the aftermath of the shooting of his officers, although in the past he has faced criticism for the low pay of Dallas officers compared to neighboring jurisdictions. Brown addressed protesters in a speech, saying \\"Become a part of the solution. Serve your community, don't be a part of the problem. We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we'll put you in your neighborhood and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about.\\" Job applications for the police department rose significantly in the days following the officers' shootings and Brown's statement, and the department received demonstrations of public appreciation. = Police reform after the killing of George Floyd = After the killing of George Floyd, protesters began to call for \\"Defunding the Police\\". Democrats unveiled new legislation June 8, 2020 to help curb reform policing following calls by protesters.
