In 1917 he became Britain's first government actuary and was very influential in setting up the funding by National Insurance for the newly introduced state pension.  Early life  Watson was born in Bristol on 11 March 1870 to parents Alfred Reuban Watson, a violinist and composer, and Emily Morris Hobro. He studied at Nottingham High School, before joining his grandfather Reuban Watson's actuarial practice, R. Watson and Sons. He became a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries in 1893, passing his final examination with the highest mark in his year.  Career  In 1896, Watson was appointed to the 1896 Rothschild Committee on Old Age Pensions, which had been set up to investigate establishing a state pension in the United Kingdom, following the introduction of a state pension in Germany. The committee concluded in 1898 that none of the systems presented to them were viable. Watson questioned witnesses with an \\"aggressive and combative style\\". After continuing his career as an actuary, consulting for friendly societies including the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. In 1903, he published an article titled Sickness and Mortality Experience (1893‚Äì97) of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries. In the article, he demonstrated an increase in sickness and a reduction in mortality, with links between occupation and sickness and between region and mortality, and that sickness benefit claims had risen for all groups of members, but most significantly for members older than 65. He began consulting in London from 1910. He gave a series of lectures on the subject of Friendly society finance to the Institute of Actuaries in 1911 and 1912. Watson gave advice about the writing of the National Insurance Act 1911, before being appointed chief actuary to the National Health Insurance Joint Committee after the National Insurance bill had become law in 1912. In this role, which he held until 1919, he advised various government departments during World War I.WATSON, Sir Alfred William', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 11 March 2014 During this time, he worked on plans with the Ministry of Shipping to optimise the use of shipping.  Government actuary  Watson became the first government actuary on 14 May 1917, gaining influence with the expansion of National Insurance, particularly with regard to pensions. He worked inside HM Treasury, and was seen to be aligned with the department's desire for more control over social policy. The Government Actuary's Department was created in July 1919. During the time he held the role, no social policy could become law without his approval. He was often consulted by all government departments on subjects, including subjects outside his specialism. Watson served on royal commissions on decimalisation in 1918 and national health insurance in 1926. He served as president of the Institute of Actuaries from 1920 to 1922 and served on the council of the Royal Statistical Society and the committee of the Reform Club. Watson has been credited as the \\"driving force\\" behind the introduction of contributory pensions in the United Kingdom, believing that means-tested pensions or universal pensions paid for by general taxation would be unsustainable.  Personal life  Watson married Elizabeth Moffrey, daughter of a grand master of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, in June 1895. They had two daughters and a son, who died in childhood. Watson died on 7 May 1936 in London, while still in his role as the government actuary.  Honours  Watson was knighted in 1915 and made a knight commander of the order of the Bath (KCB) in 1920.

He served as the president of Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Company from 1918 to 1925. McQueen was born on April 15, 1866 in Society Hill, South Carolina to John McQueen and Sarah Pickens. His father was a member of Congress from 1816 until secession, and he served in the Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1865. His mother was the granddaughter of Andrew Pickens, a Revolutionary War hero and member of Congress. McQueen grew up in Eutaw, Alabama, and received his early education in private schools under the well known educators Daniel Collier and Joseph A. Taylor. At age 16, he began work as a clerk in a bank in Eutaw. In 1884, he began work for the Alabama Great Southern Railroad and served as agent at Eutaw, Tuscaloosa and other points along the line until 1890, when he moved to Birmingham, Alabama as train dispatcher. It was in 1891 that he began his service with Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Company‚Äîthen Sloss Iron & Steel Company‚Äîone of the greatest industrial concerns in the Southern United States. He began in the transportation department, but in the following year was made auditor of the company. He rose quickly through the ranks: in 1897, he was made secretary and treasurer, and in 1902 he was made vice-president. Finally, in 1918 he was elected president of the company. As an executive at Sloss-Sheffield, McQueen devoted much of his attention to the development of the company's properties. Many facilities were built or rebuilt under McQueen, including by-product coke ovens in North Birmingham. He served as the president of Sloss-Sheffield until his death. In his private life, McQueen belonged to many civic and social clubs, and he was involved in the Birmingham Baseball Association. He sold his stake in the Birmingham Barons to Rick Woodward in 1909. He married Lydia Edwards on April 11, 1899, and they had two children (Giles E. and James W.). McQueen died at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City on April 20, 1925.

The agreement was concluded at the Blue House in Seoul on 11 March 2014 by Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, and Park Geun-hye, the President of South Korea. It is the first free trade agreement between Canada and an Asia Pacific nation. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 2015. Upon full implementation, Canada will eliminate 97.8% of its tariff lines for goods imported from South Korea, and South Korea will eliminate 98.2% of its tariff lines for goods imported from Canada. Background The two countries began discussing establishing a free trade agreement in 2005, and held 14 rounds of bargaining sessions before finalizing the agreement. Canada's trade with South Korea had dropped by about after the conclusion of the European Union‚ÄìSouth Korea Free Trade Agreement and the Free trade agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Korea. Canada's primary exports to South Korea in 2012 were non-renewable resources such as mineral fuels and oils (31%) and ores, slag, and ash (8.4%), and renewable resources such as wood pulp and paper products (9%). These totalled $3.7 billion in value, a decrease from $5 billion in 2011. South Korea's primary exports to Canada in 2012 were transportation products such as automobiles, trailers, and bicycles (40%), machinery and appliances (17%), and electrical machinery and equipment (15%). These totalled $6.3 billion in value, a decrease from $6.6 billion in 2011. Tariffs Canada will eliminate tariffs on imported South Korean automobiles within two years of ratification of the trade deal. South Korea will eliminate the 40% tariff on imported Canadian beef within 15 years of ratification of the trade deal. Reaction Representatives of Canada's automotive industry criticized the deal, stating that it \\"rapidly eliminates tariffs on Korean imports and does not include retaliatory measures\\", such as the 'snap-back' provisions in the Free trade agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Korea. Dianne Craig, chief executive officer (CEO) and president of Ford Motor Company of Canada, stated that \\"South Korea will remain one of the most closed automotive markets in the world under the deal negotiated by the Canadian government\\" because South Korea imposes non-tariff barriers on imported vehicles. The government stated that automotive disputes between the two countries will be resolved within 177 days. Canada is South Korea's fifth- largest export market for automobiles, where South Korean automakers had 12% market share in 2013. Farmers and ranchers in South Korea have opposed the deal since it was first proposed. The South Korean government's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy predicts that Korean cattle ranchers and the livestock sector in general will suffer from the increase in Canadian imports.\\"Netizens Angry as Korea Signs FTA with China,\\" koreaBANG, http://www.koreabang.com/2014/stories/netizens-angry-as-korea-signs-fta-with- canada.html See also *Canada‚ÄìSouth Korea relations *Economy of Canada *Free trade agreements of Canada *Canada's Global Markets Action Plan *Rules of Origin *Free-trade area *Market access Notes References  * * Further reading   * * External links *Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA) at Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development *Canada‚ÄìKorea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA) - Overview at Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development *Fact Sheet: Republic of Korea at Embassy of Canada in Korea *Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement page on the Rules of Origin Facilitator, with member countries' status and access to legal documents.

About  Harrisburg Kannapolis Mt. Pleasant Conceptual Image of Midland The Cabarrus County Library has locations in Concord, Harrisburg, Kannapolis, Midland and Mt. Pleasant. Records show that more than one out of three citizens of the county are registered users who have access to over two hundred and fifty thousand books, magazines, audio and video materials as well as digital collections that include audio, video and book selections. The library also provides such services as educational and entertainment programming, instructional classes, children's activities and other offerings that promotes the enjoyment of reading and supports pursuit of lifelong learning. History Mayfield Cole The very first library for Cabarrus County was established on July 8, 1902 in Concord. This first library was in a small frame house located on Spring Street near the present day Coltrane-Webb elementary school. Mayfield Cole was named the first librarian with a salary of $8 per month;Horton, Clarence E. Jr., Compiler. A Bicentennial History of Concord: from the Pages of Progress Magazine, pg. 306 the library had very limited operating hours and books were acquired via donations from local citizens and it was proclaimed that the library owned a set of encyclopedias as well as a collection of Shakespeare's works. The library was governed by a board of directors that was composed of various local business men and/or their wives. This original library closed after just a year or two of being in operation. In 1911, a second attempt at organizing a public library met with greater success. The Board of Aldermen for the city of Concord named a Board of Trustees who became the governing body for the library. Various book clubs were in existence in the community and their desire for reading material was a part of the foundation for library services in Cabarrus County. These clubs banded together to form the Concord Library Association and citizens were charged dues in order to have borrowing privileges at the library which was located on the second floor of the Phifer Building. Interest was low as the area was still mainly rural and those living in Concord were generally textile mill workers earning low wages; education and reading were low priorities for those citizens. The library operated out of space given to them within various buildings in the city of Concord and eventually influential citizens urged the Board of Trustees to borrow money to buy a building dedicated solely to a library. James W. Cannon, founder of Cannon Mills gave $300 towards the purchase of a building for the library and in early 1913, the board purchased a small brick building located on South Union Street for a total cost of $3000. This building was remodeled in 1916 and included the installation of a skylight and \\"quiet\\" signs.Garrison, Barbara Shepherd.

Each of the twelve string quartets, by a different composer, is based on a song by Dywili.  Concept  The Bow Project invited South African, and later Faroese, composers to transcribe and paraphrase or reimagine, for the classical string quartet, the uhadi songs of Nofinishi Dywili. Composers based their transcription on the field recordings of ethnomusicologist Dr Dave Dargie, made between 1980 and 2002. The medium of the string quartet was seen as providing a perfect bridge between the world of traditional bow music and the world of new classical music. The Bow Project was launched at the New Music Indaba in 2002, and new works premiered at subsequent festivals. A South African tour in 2009 was followed by the CD production. Each concert included performances of the uhadi songs interpreted by musicians of the next generation, namely Madosini and Mantombi Matotiyana. The project is dedicated to the memory of Nofinishi Dywili who died in 2002. According to Dargie, Dywili possessed \\"exceptional rhythmic skill‚Ä¶ whatever of the marvellous and complex rhythms there were in any of the songs ‚Äì 10-vs-8 cross-rhythms or whatever ‚Äì Nofinishi would also effortlessly bring in greater rhythmic complexity, making the songs even more wonderful.\\"Dargie, David, in Watermeyer, Natalie. October 2010. \\"The Bow Project\\". ClassicFeel (South Africa), 44.  Compositions  The Bow Project contains 26 compositions: ten string quartets by South African, and two by Faroese, composers; twelve performances of eight different uhadi songs; a short electronic bowscape; and a studio remix of one of the quartets. The compositions represent a broad range of contemporary compositional styles drawing on jazz and blues, rock, choral music, African traditional music, European new music including electronica, and American experimental music.  Instrumentation  In addition to the string quartet, two variants of the one-string calabash bow from South Africa can be heard, most notably the Xhosa uhadi from the Eastern Cape and the Zulu ughubu from KwaZulu-Natal. The ughubu (as well as some percussion) is featured on Track 6 of the first CD, in combination with the string quartet.

Only 48 of Bolekhiv's Jews were known to have survived the war.Bartov O. \\"Erased: vanishing traces of Jewish Galicia in present day Ukraine.\\" Princeton University Press, 2007. , 9780691131214 p73 - 74. Accessed at Google Books 24 February 2014. A wealth of documentation exists about the atrocities committed in this town, beginning already in 1935, before World War II, by the local population and government, and ending with the total annihilation of the Jewish population by 1943. A book, The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million by Daniel Mendelsohn, tells the story of the town and the demise of its Jews, according to testimony, most of which was found at the Yad Vashem holocaust museum in Jerusalem. A survivor, Shlomo Adler, published a book \\"I am a Jew Again\\" about the town in Hebrew, and a German writer Anatol Regnier who married an Israeli singer the daughter of a Jewish Bolechov survivor, wrote another version of the town story \\"Damals in Bolech√≥w: Eine j√ºdische Odyssee\\". A documentary movie \\"Neighbors and Murderers\\" was made, about the books and their authors, following the survivors' stories, and those of some of the Ukrainian neighbors who witnessed what happened, also confronting some of the Ukrainian perpetrators' family. The movie ends with the sister in law of one of the murderers from the Ukrainian police, herself a victim of the communist regime sent to Siberia for many years, asking forgiveness, and the survivor asking if he is allowed to forgive.Murderers and Neighbors (YouTube)  The Jews of Bolekhiv  Bolekhiv synagogue, 2009. A Jewish community existed in Bolekhiv (Yiddish pronunciation: Bolechov) since its establishment by Nicholas Gydzincki. The town founder proclaimed equal rights to Jews as Christians, and this was confirmed by Sigismund III Vasa, the king of the new Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, formerly crown prince of Poland, the grand duke of Lithuania, and later to become king of Sweden.JewishEncyclopedia.com By 1890, seventy-five percent of the population of Bolekhiv (4237 people) was Jewish. Two Jewish residents of Bolekhiv, Moshe Weiss and Josef Rotte, established and participated in the first Kibbutz by the Shomer Hatzair movement in Palestine, and were members of the Shomriya Workers Battalion. By 1940 the Jewish population of Bolekhiv reached about 3000.The Lost page 128 In 1941 and 1942, thousands of Jews were added to the population, from the surrounding towns. Only 48 Jews of the town survived World War II A book about 19th century Bolekhiv, \\"Memoirs of Reb Bear of Bolechov\\" is known to be one of the important historical documents about Jewish life in Galicia and eastern Europe in those times.In The Lost it is mistakenly discussed as describing the thoughts of the early \\"liberal\\" and Secular Jews, but in fact, it is known to be a document of the liberal religious movements, showing respect to the rabbis, even Hassidic 'rebbes' and at the same time open to the study of sciences and the practice of fair politics. (Preface by Y. Vishnitzer, Memoirs of Reb Dov of Bolechov, Page 8) A Hassidic Rebbe, rabbi Shneibalg, 'the Rebbe of Bolechov', had a large Hassidic court in the town.Rabbi Shneibalg, the Bolohover Rebbe (Hebrew) = Antisemitism and the Holocaust = In 1935 with the death of the Polish leader Joseph Pilsudski, antisemitism began to prevail. The Polish government encouraged citizens to boycott Jewish businesses, and Christian business owners were warned not to do business with Jewish owned companies. These measures caused a deterioration in the economic status of the Jews of Galicia and among them of the Jews of Bolekhiv. From newspaper reports of the time, it is known that the number of violent attacks against Jews was on a rise, and hundreds of Jews were shot and killed.The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million page 126  The first 'Aktion'  In 1940 the thriving Jewish population of Bolekhiv was about 3000, with 4 major Synagogues.Ukrainian Shtetls (Jewish Web Index website) On 28 and 29 October 1941, four months after capturing the town, and 16days after the first mass murders in Galicia at StanislavovThe Bloody Sunday at Stanislawow (US Holocaust Memorial Museum website) the German police carried out a first Aktion (German annihilation operation) in Bolekhiv: About 1000 of the richer Jews, doctors, and others including the Rabbis, were taken from their homes, rounded up in the town square and marched to the Dom Katolicki - the catholic center at the north of the town, where they were tortured for 24hours, especially the rabbis, and many killed. They were then taken to the nearby Taniawa forest where they were shot and dropped into a pit and then buried, many of them still alive.Bolechov remembered (JewishGen website)Yad Vashem Holocaust Encyclopedia, 'Bolechov' At around the same time the population grew by a few thousand, when Jews from surrounding towns were brought to Bolekhiv. Ms. Rivka Mondshein gave evidence about this first 'Aktion': In the documentary \\"Neighbors and Murderers\\" the narrator translates other testimony and tells of a woman who was forced to dance naked on the others, and that Rabbi Horowitz who refused to watch was stabbed in the eyes, before being ripped to pieces. A man from the town describing what he saw, said that the shots were done by \\"our policemen\\" - 9 Ukrainian policemen.The evidence of about nine Ukrainian policemen, and the testimony about the surrounding Germans, is taken from a video by Father Patrick Desbois (researcher and author of Holocaust By Bullets). It is not clear that this is testimony from Bolechov. One of them, Matwiecki, was hunted down by the Polish police along with Shlomo Adler, who had joined the Polish police after the war, using his alias name Stanislav. The man had opened fire at the police unit, and Adler threw a grenade, killing the man's wife and baby. Someone else shot the man with the rifle. Years later Adler discovered that they had attacked the wrong person.  The second 'Aktion'  About a year later, on 3 to 5 September 1942, the Germans committed a second 'Aktion' in which about 1,500 Jews were murdered, many of them children, and an additional 2,000 Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp where most were subsequently murdered. The Jews had received a warning message from the Judenrat of Drohobitz that a murderous attack was ensuing. Local Ukrainian residents decided to begin the massacre before the Germans arrived. Mostly children were brutally murdered, one baby stamped upon after being grabbed from his tortured mother while giving birth. The Gestapo soldiers bragged that they killed 600 children, and one Ukrainian civilian said that he alone killed 97 children. (Following the war, a son of this man, living in the US, and serving as a priest read about these atrocities and dedicated the rest of his life helping commemorate the Jewish community of Bolekhiv).The Geleranter Evidence, Yad Vashem document, quoted in \\"The Lost\\" pages 288-290 A total of 600-700 children and 800-900 adults were killed that day. Two thousand others were gathered and sent to the Belzec death camp. While marching to the train station they were forced to sing, mostly the song \\"Belz mein shtetele Belz\\".Mathilda Geleranter's testimony, Yad Vashem In 1946 Ms. Mathilda Geleranter gave the following evidence about the second Aktion in Bolechov:  Further atrocities and 'Aktions'  Most of the Jews gathered from the nearby towns or originally living in Bolechov were murdered during 1942. Very few hid in dug out caves in the forest and stole food from nearby farms, or joined the Partisans, and survived the war, but mostly all the Jews left in Bolechov were killed. A list of deportations to the Belzec death camp list 2000 Jews sent on 3 to 6 August 1942 (perhaps this is a mistake and should be 3 to 6 September during the 2nd action) and then 400 Jews deported there on 21 October and another 300 Jews on 20 to 23 November. In June Dina Ostrover, a survivor of the train ride to Belzec from Stryi, who was in Bolechov with false papers as a Ukrainian, heard that the next day 30 German soldiers were coming to town. It was obvious that they were coming to finish off the Jews. She saved a Jewish accountant who came regularly to the farm and his wife, and hid them in the attic, till the end of the war.Dinah Ostrover's testimony for the Holocaust Memorial ceremony in Israel (YouTube, Hebrew) On 25 August 1943, 3200 Jews, who were most of, or the last of the remaining Jews in Bolechov, were deported to the Stanislavov Ghetto or to a camp nearby. At some stage in 1943, when there were only about 900 Jews left, working at local makeshift \\"work camps\\" for a few days, groups of 100 and 200 Jews were marched to the town cemetery nearby and shot. The sounds were heard well in the town, and one woman testified that her mother, who was then at the age of 40, felt obliged to drown out the sound with an old pedal powered sewing machine. = Ukrainian participation in atrocities = Surviving Jews testified that several local Ukrainians took a major part in the atrocities. According to Rab Van der Laarse, in an article written for a conference of the European Union Archaeologist Society, Eastern European \\"national amnesia\\" is now (since around 2000 and till today at 2014) being contested, with national and international affiliations, including at times affiliation with the Nazi regime as anti-communist, and emphasizing communist post-war atrocities, as well as pre-war and during the war mass murders and other crimes.Archaeology of memory. Europe‚Äôs Holocaust dissonances in East and West, Rab Van der Laarse In the documentary movie Neighbors and Murderers, neighbours of the cemetery, who remember the killing in the cemetery, differ on the perpetrators. One says that \\"the Jews were taken like a herd of sheep, the Germans surrounded the Jews in cemetery from three sides...\\" but another, when asked who did the actual shooting, said: \\"They were all our policemen. Nine Ukrainian policemen, there were no Germans at all.\\" Shlomo Adler, one of the Jewish survivors, discovers that the Ukrainian collaborator that disclosed the hiding place of three families living in a cave, was the brother of the woman that saved his own life and hid him throughout the last years of the war. In the same movie, the sister in law of Matwiecki is confronted by Adler (mistaking her for Matwiecki's actual sister), and upon hearing of her brother in law's actions, at first cannot believe it and claims it's a mistake, but finally realizes the truth and cries along with Adler.

This occurs when a nucleic acid-processing enzyme needs access to the base to perform work on it, such as its excision for replacement with another base during DNA repair. It was first observed in 1994 using X-ray crystallography in a methyltransferase enzyme catalyzing methylation of a cytosine base in DNA. Since then, it has been shown to be used by different enzymes in many biological processes such as DNA methylation, various DNA repair mechanisms, and DNA replication. It can also occur in RNA double helices or in the DNA:RNA intermediates formed during RNA transcription. DNA base flipping occurs by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the bases and unstacking the base from its neighbors. This could occur through an active process, where an enzyme binds to the DNA and then facilitates rotation of the base, or a passive process, where the base rotates out spontaneously, and this state is recognized and bound by an enzyme. It can be detected using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, or hybridization probes. Discovery Base flipping was first observed in 1994 when researchers Klimasauskas, Kumar, Roberts, and Cheng used X-ray crystallography to view an intermediate step in the chemical reaction of a methyltransferase bound to DNA. The methyltransferase they used was the C5-cytosine methyltransferase from Haemophilus haemolyticus (M. HhaI). This enzyme recognizes a specific sequence of the DNA (5'-GCGC-3') and methylates the first cytosine base of the sequence at its C5 location. Upon crystallization of the M. HhaI-DNA complex, they saw the target cytosine base was rotated completely out of the double helix and was positioned in the active site of the M. HhaI. It was held in place by numerous interactions between the M. HhaI and DNA. The authors theorized that base flipping was a mechanism used by many other enzymes, such as helicases, recombination enzymes, RNA polymerases, DNA polymerases, and Type II topoisomerases. Much research has been done in the years subsequent to this discovery and it has been found that base flipping is a mechanism used in many of the biological processes the authors suggest. Mechanism Model of Entamoeba histolytica DNMT2, Demonstrates a base flipped out of the double helix and into the active site of a methyltransferase DNA nucleotides are held together with hydrogen bonds, which are relatively weak and can be easily broken. Base flipping occurs on a millisecond timescale by breaking the hydrogen bonds between bases and unstacking the base from its neighbors. The base is rotated out of the double helix by 180 degrees., typically via the major groove, and into the active site of an enzyme. This opening leads to small conformational changes in the DNA backbone which are quickly stabilized by the increased enzyme-DNA interactions. Studies looking at the free-energy profiles of base flipping have shown that the free-energy barrier to flipping can be lowered by 17 kcal/mol for M.HhaI in the closed conformation. There are two mechanisms of DNA base flipping: active and passive. In the active mechanism, an enzyme binds to the DNA and then actively rotates the base, while in the passive mechanism a damaged base rotates out spontaneously first, then is recognized and bound by the enzyme. Research has demonstrated both mechanisms: uracil-DNA glycosylase follows the passive mechanism and Tn10 transposase follows the active mechanism. Furthermore, studies have shown that DNA base flipping is used by many different enzymes in a variety biological processes such as DNA methylation, various DNA repair mechanisms, RNA transcription and DNA replication. Biological processes =DNA modification and repair= A uracil residue flipped out of the DNA double helix and into the specificity pocket of Uracil DNA glycosylase DNA can have mutations that cause a base in the DNA strand to be damaged. To ensure genetic integrity of the DNA, enzymes need to repair any damage. There are many types of DNA repair. Base excision repair utilizes base flipping to flip the damaged base out of the double helix and into the specificity pocket of a glycosylase which hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond and removes the base. DNA glycosylases interact with DNA, flipping bases to determine a mismatch. An example of base excision repair occurs when a cytosine base is deaminated and becomes a uracil base. This causes a U:G mispair which is detected by Uracil DNA glycosylase. The uracil base is flipped out into the glycosylase active pocket where it is removed from the DNA strand. Base flipping is used to repair mutations such as 8-Oxoguanine (oxoG) and thymine dimers created by UV radiation. =Replication, transcription and recombination= DNA replication and RNA transcription both make use of base flipping. DNA polymerase is an enzyme that carries out replication. It can be thought of as a hand that grips the DNA single strand template. As the template passes across the palm region of the polymerase, the template bases are flipped out of the helix and away from the dNTP binding site. During transcription, RNA polymerase catalyzes RNA synthesis. During the initiation phase, two bases in the -10 element flip out from the helix and into two pockets in RNA polymerase. These new interactions stabilize the -10 element and promote the DNA strands to separate or melt. Base flipping occurs during latter stages of recombination. RecA is a protein that promotes strand invasion during homologous recombination. Base flipping has been proposed as the mechanism by which RecA can enable a single strand to recognize homology in duplex DNA. Other studies indicate that it is also involved in V(D)J Recombination. =DNA methylation= DNA molecule that is methylated on both strands on the center cytosine DNA methylation is the process in which a methyl group is added to either a cytosine or adenine. This process causes the activation or inactivation of gene expression, thereby resulting in gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. DNA methylation process is also known to be involved in certain types of cancer formation. In order for this chemical modification to occur, it is necessary that the target base flips out of the DNA double helix to allow the methyltransferases to catalyze the reaction. =Target recognition by restriction endonucleases= Restriction endonucleases, also known as restriction enzymes are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at specific nucleotides sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long. Studies performed by Horton and colleagues have shown that the mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as bending the DNA and the expansion of the minor groove. In 2006, Horton and colleagues, x-ray crystallography evidence was presented showing that the restriction endonuclease HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This enzyme is known to cleave the DNA at the palindromic tetranucleotide sequence G‚ÜìCGC. Experimental approaches for detection =X-ray crystallography= Workflow for solving the structure of a molecule by X-ray crystallography X-ray crystallography is a technique that measures the angles and intensities of crystalline atoms in order to determine the atomic and molecular structure of the crystal of interest. Crystallographers are then able to produce and three-dimensional picture where the positions of the atoms, chemical bonds as well as other important characteristics can be determined.X-ray crystallography Klimasaukas and colleagues used this technique to observe the first base flipping phenomenon, in which their experimental procedure involved several steps: # Purification # Crystallization # Data Collection # Structure determination and refinement During purification, Haemophilus haemolyticus methyltransferase was overexpressed and purified using a high salt back-extraction step to selectively solubilize M.HhaI, followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) as done previously by Kumar and colleagues. Authors utilized a Mono-Q anion exchange column to remove the small quantity of proteinaceous materials and unwanted DNA prior to the crystallization step. Once M.HhaI was successfully purified, the sample was then grown using a method that mixes the solution containing the complex at a temperature of 16 ¬∞C and the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique to obtain the crystals. Authors were then able to collect the x-ray data according to a technique used by Cheng and colleagues in 1993. This technique involved the measurement of the diffraction intensities on a FAST detector, where the exposure times for 0.1¬∞ rotation were 5 or 10 seconds. For the structure determination and refinement, Klimasaukas and colleagues used the molecular replacement of the refined apo structure described by Cheng and colleagues in 1993 where the search models X-PLOR, MERLOT, and TRNSUM were used to solve the rotation and translation functions.Brunger A.T. (1992)\\"X-PLOR, Version 3.1 : A system for x-ray crystallography and NMR\\"(New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press) This part of the study involves the use of a variety of software and computer algorithms to solve the structures and characteristics of the crystal of interest. =NMR spectroscopy= NMR spectroscopy is a technique that has been used over the years to study important dynamic aspects of base flipping. This technique allows researchers to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms and other molecules by utilizing the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei.NMR spectroscopy In addition, NMR can provide a variety of information including structure, reaction states, chemical environment of the molecules, and dynamics.Gueron, M., and J. L. Leroy. 1995. Studies of basepair kinetics by NMR measurement of proton exchange. In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance And Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, San Diego, CA. During the DNA base flipping discovery experiment, researchers utilized NMR spectroscopy to investigate the enzyme-induced base flipping of HhaI methyltransferase. In order to accomplish this experiment, two 5-fluorocytosine residues were incorporated into the target and the reference position with the DNA substrate so the 19F chemical shift analysis could be performed. Once the 19F chemical shift analysis was evaluated, it was then concluded that the DNA complexes existed with multiple forms of the target 5-fluorocytosine along the base flipping pathway.Klimasaukas, Salius, and Zita Liutkeviciute. \\"Experimental Approaches to Study DNA Base Flipping.\\" DNA and RNA Modification Enzymes: Structure, Mechanism, Function and Evolution. Landes Bioscience, 2009. 37-50. Web. 16 Mar. 2014. . =Fluorescence spectroscopy= Fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique that is used to assay a sample using a fluorescent probe. DNA nucleotides themselves are not good candidates for this technique because they do not readily re-emit light upon light excitation. A fluorescent marker is needed to detect base flipping. 2-Aminopurine is a base that is structurally similar to adenine, but is very fluorescent when flipped out from the DNA duplex. It is commonly used to detect base flipping and has an excitation at 305‚Äë320 nm and emission at 370 nm so that it well separated from the excitations of proteins and DNA. Other fluorescent probes used to study DNA base flipping are 6MAP (4‚Äëamino‚Äë6‚Äëmethyl‚Äë7(8H)‚Äëpteridone) and Pyrrolo‚ÄëC (3-[Œ≤-D-2-ribofuranosyl]-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2(3H)-one). Time- resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is also employed to provide a more detailed picture of the extent of base flipping as well as the conformational dynamics occurring during base flipping. =Hybridization probing= Hybridization probes can be used to detect base flipping. This technique uses a molecule that has a complementary sequence to the sequence you would like to detect such that it binds to a single-strand of the DNA or RNA. Several hybridization probes have been used to detect base flipping. Potassium permanganate is used to detect thymine residues that have been flipped out by cytosine-C5 and adenine-N6 methyltransferases. Chloroacetaldehyde is used to detect cytosine residues flipped out by the HhaI DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase (M. HhaI).

Origin and purpose  The NSDDB emerged in 1935 from the National Socialist Teachers League and was established on the basis of an order of the Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess; its purpose being, the exertion of influence on the universities and the political control of higher education. Massive influence was applied especially on appointments to staff positions.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix C; see the entry for the NSDDB District leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an Habilitationsschrift, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of Privatdozent necessary to becoming a university lecturer.Hentschel, 1996, Introduction p. xxxvi ff. The expulsion of the Jewish scientists from the universities was substantially carried out by the activists of the Lecturers League. Leadership  In 1938 about a quarter of the German higher education faculty was associated with the Lecturers League. The share of Lecturer League members was particularly high in the humanities faculties. The leadership ranks in the Lecturers League were strikingly often members (or graduates) of the medical faculty. Like all Nazi organizations, the NSDDB was set up according to the \\"leadership principle\\". From the emergence of the institution until June 1944, the \\"Reich Lecturers Leader\\" was the surgeon, Walter \\"Bubi\\" Schultze. For misconduct to the detriment of a party member he was relieved of his office in 1944 by the Nazi Party Court and replaced by \\"Reich Students Leader\\", Gustav Adolf Scheel. Scheel was likewise a physician. Schultze made clear how he intended to carry out his authority, after taking office in 1935. First, he caused all party members among the higher education teachers to register. For senior positions, he let it be known, it was not enough only to wear a party badge on the lapel, one must also be capable of \\"forcing the opposition to the wall\\". Besides the partisan feelings, the recognizable determination and talent to educate the youth in the National Socialist spirit, the \\"race question\\" should be above all a decisive factor in higher education. With his inauguration speech for the Reichsuniversit√§t Stra√üburg, on November 1941, Schultze declared the highest aim of the college to be: \\"to eradicate\\" everything \\"un-German\\" from \\"our people's world of thought\\".  Effectiveness  To anchor the national socialist ideology among the lecturers, four NS-Lecturer League scientific academies had already been set up. They were located at the Universities of Giessen, G√∂ttingen, Kiel and T√ºbingen. The NSDDB's so-called \\"training camp\\" was a special kind of scientific education that was supposed to take the place of old-style conventions, and aimed at bringing the participants into line with the Nazi ideology. The effectiveness of the Lecturers League was limited, for one thing, by the \\"office-holder confusion\\" typical of National Socialism: the imprecise differentiation of the jurisdiction and competence of a position. The NSDDB most frequently clashed with the Amt Rosenberg, which laid equal claim on higher education policy as its domain. Deputy-F√ºhrer Hess was an ally of the NSDDB in these conflicts. Another factor limiting the effectiveness of the NSDDB was the often low regard for its leaders at the universities. Many had a reputation of wanting to compensate for their lack of scientific standing and expertise by means of excessive partisan zeal. Many educators and lecturers evaded the pressure to alter their work; so that overall, the League was largely ineffective. However, in the strongholds of Nazi teaching and research, such as Jena, Kiel and K√∂nigsburg, the League was more potent.  Literature  * * Helmut Heiber: Universit√§t unterm Hakenkreuz.

He was a student of Aharon Kotler. After the death of Pinchas Duvid in 1941 his eldest son, Moshe Horowitz (1909-1985), held the position of Bostoner Rebbe in New York until his death in 1985, following Chasidic tradition. As the eldest son of Moshe, Horowitz succeeded his father as the Bostoner Rebbe of New York. He later founded the Bostoner community in Ramat Beit Shemesh, Israel, where he resided. He composed contemporary Chasidic music; many of his compositions were performed by leading Jewish music artists of the day. Andy Statman credits him with being a major influence in his musical career, having performed several of the Horowitz's compositions on his recordings and in concert.

It was founded in Novi Sad, Habsburg Monarchy, and was pan-Slavist. Its slogan was \\"Srpstvo sve i svuda\\" (Serbdom all and everywhere). When the organization was banned in the Principality of Serbia and in Austria-Hungary, the seat of Omladina became Cetinje, in the Principality of Montenegro. Their ideas were propagated in Glas Crnogorca, Cetinjski Vjesnik, and Panƒçevac. The Association for Serb Liberation and Unification was founded by members of the United Serbian Youth and other people from all over the Serbian lands. United Serbian Youth, modeled after Giuseppe Mazzini's Giovane Italia, with whom they directly collaborated, was one of the first organizations to raise the question of women's emancipation. The first Serbian women's society was established in Novi Sad, then part of Hungarian-controlled Vojvodina in 1864. After that a new, powerful political group also of liberal political orientation was formed by the Serbs of Vojvodina, with its leader Svetozar Miletiƒá, which appeared at assemblies in Sremski Karlovci (1861, 1864). Miletiƒá's supporters collaborated with the liberal Jovan Djordjeviƒá's journal Srbski dnevnik (\\"Serbian Diary\\"), spreading their ideas, like Miletiƒá's own journal Zastava (\\"Flag\\") as well as founding various societies preceding the United Serbian Youth.

It was one of the first companies, along with Synack and Bugcrowd, to embrace and utilize crowd-sourced security and cybersecurity researchers as linchpins of its business model; it is the largest cybersecurity firm of its kind. As of May 2020, HackerOne's network had paid $100 million in bounties. History In 2011, Dutch hackers Jobert Abma and Michiel Prins attempted to find security vulnerabilities in 100 prominent high-tech companies. They discovered flaws in all of the companies, including Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Twitter. Dubbing their efforts the \\"Hack 100\\", Abma and Prins contacted the at-risk firms. While many firms ignored their disclosure attempts, the COO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, gave the warning to their head of product security, Alex Rice. Rice, Abma and Prins connected, and together with Merijn Terheggen founded HackerOne in 2012. In November 2015, Terheggen stepped down from his role as CEO and was replaced by Marten Mickos. In November 2013, the company hosted a program encouraging the discovery and responsible disclosure of software bugs. Microsoft and Facebook funded the initiative, known as the Internet Bug Bounty project. By June 2015, HackerOne's bug bounty platform had identified approximately 10,000 vulnerabilities and paid researchers over $1 million in bounties. In September 2015, the company launched a Vulnerability Coordination Maturity Model, which then-policy chief Katie Moussouris described as ‚Äúan important effort from HackerOne to codify some reasonable minimum standards on how organizations handle incoming, unsolicited vulnerability reports.‚Äù In April 2017, the company announced 240% year-over- year customer growth in Europe, and the subsequent opening of additional European offices to serve increasing customer demand.  Funding  In May 2014, HackerOne received $9 million (USD) in Series A funding from venture capital firm Benchmark. A $25 million Series B round was led by New Enterprise Associates. Angel investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Digital Sky Technologies founder Yuri Milner, Dropbox chief executive Drew Houston and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. A Series C round led by Dragoneer Investment Group netted $40 million in February 2017 for a total of $74 million in investments to date. In April 2017, European-based venture capital fund EQT Ventures invested in the $40 million Series C funding round. In 2019, the company raised $36 million in Series D funding led by Valor Equity Partners.  U.S. Department of Defense Programs  In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) launched an initiative dubbed \\"Hack the Pentagon\\" using the HackerOne platform. The 24-day program resulted in the discovery and mitigation of 138 vulnerabilities in DoD websites, with over $70,000 (USD) in bounties paid to participating researchers. In October of the same year, DoD developed a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP), the first of its kind created for the U.S. government. The policy outlines the conditions under which cybersecurity researchers may legally explore front-facing programs for security vulnerabilities. The first use of the VDP launched as part of the \\"Hack the Army\\" initiative, which was also the first time this branch of the U.S. military welcomed hackers to find and report security flaws in its systems. The Hack the Army initiative resulted in 118 valid vulnerability reports; 371 participants, including 25 government workers and 17 military personnel, took part. Approximately $100,000 (USD) in total was awarded to participating researchers. In May 2017, DoD extended the program to \\"Hack the Air Force\\". This program led to the discovery of 207 vulnerabilities, netting more than $130,000 (USD) in paid bounties. As of the end of 2017, DoD has learned of and fixed thousands of vulnerabilities through their vulnerability disclosure initiatives.  Events and Live Hacking  In February 2017, HackerOne sponsored an invitation-only hackathon, gathering security researchers from around the world to hack e-commerce sites Airbnb and Shopify for vulnerabilities. This was the second such hackathon, with the company hosting one in Las Vegas in August 2016 during the Black Hat Security Conference. Throughout 2017 and so far in 2018, HackerOne hosted seven Live Hacking events in cities across the US and Europe. Over $1 million in bounty cash has been awarded at these events, with Oath Inc. (now called Verizon Media) paying over $400,000 in bounties during a single event in San Francisco, CA in April 2018. In October 2017, HackerOne hosted their first conference, called Security@ San Francisco. The 200-attendee event included speakers from DoD, General Motors and Uber and also featured talks from hackers.  Locations  HackerOne is headquartered in San Francisco. The company maintains a development office in Groningen, Netherlands. In April 2017, the company announced the addition of offices in the UK and Germany.

Local and global fields  surveys the computations of K-theory of global fields (such as number fields and function fields), as well as local fields (such as p-adic numbers).  Algebraically closed fields showed that the torsion in K-theory is insensitive to extensions of algebraically closed fields. This statement is known as Suslin rigidity.

Buchanan has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB), for the Philadelphia Phillies and for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). After growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Buchanan attended Chipola College from which the New York Mets drafted him in 2009; he did not sign, instead attending Georgia State University. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Buchanan in 2010, and he quickly moved through their Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system, before ultimately earning an invitation to major league spring training in . Although he was not initially expected to make the team, Buchanan‚Äòs strong performance thrust him into the competition for the fifth- starter spot of the Phillies starting rotation. Though he ultimately did not make the opening day roster, Buchanan remained in consideration for the fifth- starter spot. When not playing baseball, he enjoys various outdoor activities among other hobbies, and resides in Georgia. Early life The son of Andrew Buchanan and Stacy Wood, Buchanan is one of seven children, (he has two sisters, three step-sisters and one step-brother). He was born in Atlanta, Georgia on May 11, 1989. He attended Fayette County High School, where he played baseball, and, during his senior season, won team most valuable player accolades. He also holds the Fayette County single-game strikeout record (19). Subsequently, he attended Chipola College, a junior college, for two seasons, and earned placement on Baseball America's list of the top 40 prospects in Florida. After the 2009 season, the New York Mets drafted him in the sixth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft, however he did not sign, instead opting to attend Georgia State University. He played for Georgia State during the 2010 season, and was the team's top pitcher, earning several honors from the Colonial Athletic Association before a finger injury caused him to miss significant time. After the 2010 season, he briefly played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted him in the seventh round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Scout Ellis Dungan signed him to a contract, and he thus began his professional career. Professional career =Philadelphia Phillies= Buchanan with the Philadelphia Phillies He began his professional career in 2010 as a member of the Williamsport Crosscutters, with whom he started 13 games, losing only one of them, and recording a 4.21 earned run average (ERA). At the conclusion of the season, he played in the Florida Instructional League. He progressed to the Class A and Class A-Advanced level in 2011, pitching for both the Lakewood BlueClaws and the Clearwater Threshers, and combining to post a 3.49 ERA in 26 starts. He finished third in the South Atlantic League (with Lakewood) by posting 11 wins, and finished seventh with a 3.38 ERA. His steady advancement through the minor league system continued in 2012; the next year, he spent a full season with the Reading Fightin Phils of Class AA. Despite his fast ascent through the minor league system, he flew \\"under the radar\\" with Reading, despite a 3.86 ERA. However, his season ended in June when the Phillies placed him on the disabled list due to a ligament injury in his middle finger. After splitting his time in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Class AAA ‚Äì International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, he was the only one of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a \\"leadership role\\" at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, \\"I wanted to come in here and make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel like I did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp.\\" With his college coach on hand to witness a \\"monumental time in Georgia State baseball history\\", Buchanan made his major league debut against the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 24, 2014. Replacing Cliff Lee, who was injured, Buchanan pitched five innings, and struck out two batters, and allowed five hits, two runs, and no walks in only 66 pitches, en route to earning the win. Buchanan was designated for assignment by the Phillies in November 2016, and released on November 23. =Tokyo Yakult Swallows= On December 19, 2016, Buchanan signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball. On December 13, 2019, he become free agent. =Samsung Lions= On January 16, 2020, Buchanan signed a one-year, $850,000 deal with the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. Pitcher profile Almost as soon as he was drafted into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew comparisons to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, \\"Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick‚Äôs: He isn‚Äôt overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency.\\" Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic ‚Äì instead of talking to the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute medicine ball workout. In addition to the aforementioned sinker, he throws a slider and a changeup. Personal life Outside of baseball, Buchanan's hobbies include playing the drums and guitar, golfing, drawing, yoga, watching movies, playing spades, and other various \\"outdoor activities\\". During the offseason, he resides in Peachtree City, Georgia.

The Suffolk System was the first regulatory banking system arrangement of remote banks created in the United States. Starting in 1824, the Suffolk Bank of Boston, Massachusetts, along with six other banks, created a system that required country (non-federal) banks to deposit reserve balances in one or more of the participating banks, which guaranteed that each country bank could redeem their banknotes in specie. The Suffolk Bank became one of the most profitable in the country and continued to operate under the Suffolk System until 1858, when rival institutions complained of dictatorial practices and eventually national legislation banned state banknotes. The Suffolk System was the predecessor to modern banking practices and led to the creation of the Federal Reserve that still operates today. Background During pre-Civil War times in the United States, banks around the country issued bank notes as a form of currency. The large number of banks led to a large, number of diverse bank notes that circulated around the country. Although many banks issued only enough bank notes that could be backed up by specie (gold and silver during the time), riskier banks gave into temptation and issued more than they could cover. This practice caused many people to doubt the exact worth of certain notes and in turn have little faith in some banks. In 1819, the Suffolk Bank of Boston was founded and only five years later it had developed the Suffolk System and recruited six other Boston banks to join. The system was set up to ensure that banks could always back up their bank notes issued.Woodhouse, Leesa. Suffolk System e-articles, August, 2006 This was accomplished by forcing all of the banks within the system to hold higher reserves of specie and keep deposits in the Suffolk Bank, resulting in the first ever clearing house agreement for currencies in country banks. Only a year later in 1825, all bank notes that passed through the Suffolk System were taken at par. In just a single year the Suffolk System had given these seven Boston banks a uniform currency. As the Suffolk Bank grew in size it became able to assert pressure on other country banks and by 1838, over 300 banks (basically all of New England's banks) redeemed their notes through the Suffolk System.Lake 1947, p. 192 All of New England now had a uniform currency. Throughout the system's existence, The Suffolk Bank was sure to keep all of the country banks within the system honest by presenting banks with their notes and requesting specie. The discipline enacted by the Suffolk Bank made virtually all bank notes in New England equal to their face value, allowing them to be traded within banks. The uniform currency was the first of its kind in the United States and remained in use all the way until 1858. Purpose Economic historians still disagree on the original purpose of the Suffolk System. Although the system would later lead to stronger banking practices and a uniform currency for the Northeast, not all historians believe this was the System's original intention. Some believe the Suffolk Bank was not attempting to police the currency markets in Boston, but rather to monopolize the brokerage of all the paper notes of the country banks in order to decrease circulation and open the markets for themselves.Maloney, CJ, \\"Life without the Fed: The Suffolk System.\\" Ludwig von Mises Institute, January, 2011 Although the systems‚Äô initial intentions are unknown, its results are evident. The Suffolk System in practice Throughout the existence of the Suffolk System many important banking practices were discovered and put into practice. After the system became in place, the role of counterfeiting in the New England area fell dramatically. Before the appearance of a uniform currency, many rural banks issued their own bank notes creating a large amount of different notes. This not only caused confusion, but also led many criminals to counterfeit bank notes creating an ever-present risk of accepting bank notes that may not be worth what they claimed. The presence of bank panics during the existence of the Suffolk System also led to new banking practices that would continue in practice until present day. The Panic of 1837, a deflationary backlash inducing depression and unemployment, was caused by many different factors including the practices of the Second Bank of the United States and political failures. Although the country entered a recession, the activities of the Suffolk Bank led the New England area to fare much better than the rest of the country. These practices included, lending reserves to other banks and keeping the payment system operating. Today central banks adopt these same practices that started with the private, commercial Suffolk Bank.Rolnick et al, Arthur J. \\"Lessons from a Laissez-Faire Payments System: The Suffolk Banking System. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review. May/June 1998, pp. 108 More banking panics happened during the reign of the Suffolk System (Panic of 1839, Panic of 1857) but their practices continued to minimize the depression in New England. The Suffolk Bank has been considered by some to be a central bank, however it is highly contested due to its private nature. Some economist have argued that it can not be labeled a central bank because of a lack of control of the money supply, while others claim the system certainly had a degree of control or it would have been altogether ineffective. Although it seems The Suffolk Bank cannot be considered completely private, it has proven that private individuals acting outside of political control are capable of providing the same functions of a central bank at lower costs.Whitney, D.R. \\"The Suffolk Bank.\\" Private Manuscript, 1878, pp. 38 End of the Suffolk System Although the Suffolk System was a great regulator of unsound banking practices, it lacked the ability to properly administer the total volume of banknote circulation. The Suffolk System regulated how many bank notes could be issued by country banks, but it was ineffective regulating the bank note circulation of the system. It has been considered a \\"good regulator of a bad system\\".Lake 1947, p. 202 In 1858 the Suffolk System ended and was later replaced by the advent of the Bank of Mutual Redemption. The Suffolk System's many good qualities could no longer outweigh the lack of their ability to increase note circulation.Lake 1947, p. 204 Although the Suffolk System was done away with by national legislation, the system of centralizing reserves among only a small number of banks developed into modem banking practice. The Suffolk System was responsible for creating strong banking techniques and in making smaller banks responsible for all of their banknotes issued. The system created a uniform currency throughout New England and most importantly the system help lead United States banking practices into what they are today.

This led to his joining the Hershey Improvement Company about two years later, and to a long association with various Hershey enterprises. Entertainment From 1936 until his retirement in 1962, Sollenberger was general manager of all the attractions in the Hershey empire, including the Hershey Sports Arena and the amusement complex that grew to become Hersheypark. In February 1940, he and eight other arena managers met in Hershey and organized the Ice Capades. Sollenberger brought many famous entertainers to Hershey: Fred Waring, Victor Borge, Sonja Henie, Tallulah Bankhead and Eleanor Holm all knew him as \\"JB\\". He had significant and far- reaching impact on the development of Hershey as a vacation and entertainment destination. Many of his innovations are still in place today. Ice hockey Sollenberger was an early figure in the establishment of the American Hockey League (AHL), and since 1955 the John B. Sollenberger Trophy is awarded to that league's leading scorer. His involvement with the league was due to his association with the Hershey Bears, one of the nation's oldest professional hockey teams.

This methodology is used to simulate linear continuous systems, hybrid continuous and discrete-event systems, and any other system that involves the rate-based movement or flow of material from one location to another.  Areas of application  Industrial areas where discrete rate simulation is used include: * Bulk material handling (e.g. minerals and ores, powders, particles, mixed wastes, wood chips) * Liquids and gases * Pulp and paper processing * Oil and gas pipelines * Traffic * High speed/volume production lines in the food & beverage, consumer products, and pharmaceutical industries.  Compared to discrete-event and continuous simulation  Discrete rate simulation combines the event-based timing of discrete event simulation and the continuous variables calculations found in continuous simulation. It predicts and schedules events when the system needs to calculate a new set of rates and determines the appropriate rate of flow for each branch or stream. A comparison between discrete rate, continuous, and discrete event simulation Discrete rate simulation is similar to discrete event simulation in that both methodologies model the operation of the system as a discrete sequence of events in time. However, while discrete event simulation assumes there is no change in the system between consecutive events, in a discrete rate simulation model the flow continues to move at a constant rate such that, for example, the level in a tank could change. Another difference is that discrete event simulation models are overwhelmingly concerned with the status of system entities (discrete objects moving through the system) while discrete rate simulation models are concerned with the status (quantity and location) of homogeneous flow. For rate-based systems, discrete rate simulation has faster computational times and is more accurate in calculating mass balance compared to discrete event simulation. Discrete rate simulation is also similar to continuous simulation in that it simulates homogeneous flow. In addition, both methods recalculate flow rates, which are continuous variables, whenever a state change occurs. However, discrete rate simulation S differs from continuous simulation in that it is event-based and does not simulate every time slice. Modeling linear flow systems using continuous simulation has limitations because it usually is unable to detect important events, such as a tank becoming full or empty, until after the event has occurred plus requires many more system recalculations during the course of the simulation.  Example  An exercise in learning how to build discrete-rate simulations is to model a tank filling and emptying over time. The tank fills at a constant rate and empties at two different rates, one rate until it is full and a faster rate until it is empty. There are 4 types of events in the simulation: start simulation, storage full, storage empty, and end simulation. At each event the model determines which emptying rate to use; between events the emptying rate remains constant.

Nicknamed \\"Hurricane Hutch\\", he played as a forward for Dunfermline Athletic, Dundee United, Newcastle United, Derby County and Hull City. Born in Kelty, Fife, Hutchison began his senior career with Dunfermline. He was released after breaking a leg and joined Dundee United in July 1927. After a debut goal against Bathgate on 13 August 1927, he went on to become United's top scorer in 1927-28, with a total of 32 league and cup goals, including two hat-tricks. In the following season, he was once again United's top scorer with 35 goals, helping the club to the Division Two title and promotion. He scored four goals in one match against Albion Rovers, as well as two more hat-tricks. Hutchison's goalscoring led to speculation regarding transfers to other clubs, and a bid for his services from Liverpool was rejected. After only three matches of the 1929-30 season, however, Hutchison was unexpectedly sold to Newcastle United for a fee of about ¬£4,000, leading to vociferous protests from Dundee United supporters. Without him, the club were relegated at the end of the season. After two years at Newcastle, Hutchison had spells with Derby County and Hull City before rejoining Dundee United in June 1935. Arthur Milne was now United's established centre forward, so Hutchison now took on the role of a supporting forward, although he continued to score regularly. His brother Dan was a teammate during this time. Hutchison continued to play for Dundee United up until retiring at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He became a publican, running the United Bar in Dundee, and became a director of Dundee United in 1953. After the resignation of manager Willie MacFadyen in August 1954, Hutchison took over on a temporary basis for six matches until the appointment of Reggie Smith. He remained as a director until his death in 1973, also having a brief spell as club chairman in 1963. In January 2011, Hutchison was posthumously inducted into the Dundee United Hall of Fame.

Ryde Inshore Rescue Service is a voluntary run lifeboat station located in the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight.OS Explorer Map OL29 - Isle of Wight, Folded Map. Publisher:Ordnance Survey; B2 edition (17 Mar 2008). Ryde Inshore Rescue is an independent lifeboat station within the United Kingdom, is not part of the RNLI and does not receive funding from the RNLI or the government. The station is on call to the Coast Guard 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The service operates an inshore lifeboat from its station at Appley Lane. The organisation training is to a high standard and the volunteers are expected to be able to give at least 1 day a week to ensure that they meet the exacting requirements of the organization.  History  The first lifeboat service in the town started in 1858 and was run on a voluntary basis. On 8 May 1869 the town's rescue volunteers service was supplied with a new lifeboat called The Captain Hans Busk which was kept and launched from a slipway on Ryde Pier. The cost of the new lifeboat was met by Hans Busk. The lifeboat was built by J. Samuel White at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. She was in length, across the beam and had a depth of . The lifeboat had 24 oars and she was fitted with two sailing masts. She was steered with a galvanised iron tiller. For transit the lifeboat had its own carriage and wheels and could be moved over land if the situation required. = First Boathouse = The first station boathouse was constructed on the west side of the town‚Äôs pier in 1870.For Those In Peril ‚Äì The Lifeboat Service of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Station by Station.

The lifeboat was a wooden non self-righting lifeboat with coxswain William John Bartlett at the Helm. This lifeboat was a whaleboat design and had never been intended for use in the conditions she now faced. Augustus Jarrett, master of the 56 ton barge Jane had earlier reported a small boat stolen from the barge and it was reported drifting out to sea with one man aboard. The lifeboat went to attend the drifting boat under sail heading eastwards towards the Sandhead buoy. The lifeboat searched the area but was unable to locate the small boat with the man, who turned out to be Augustus Jarrett himself. Sea conditions began to deteriorate and a sudden and unexpected heavy squall hit the lifeboat causing it to capsize. All the crew were thrown into the cold sea. They had nothing to hold on to and no way of signalling for help. The stricken lifeboat drifted across the Solent with the crew grasping at the keel and at the mercy of the wind and tide, and the lifeboat was washed on to the shore at Southsea. The surviving crew members were rescued there, all in an exhausted state and suffering from exposure. Two of lifeboat crew, Frank Haynes and Henry Heward, had died after succumbing to exhaustion and exposure in the cold water and their fellow crewmen were unable to hold them. The lost crewmen‚Äôs bodies were eventually washed up later in the evening. In a cruel twist Augustus Jarrett had survived and had managed to row across the Solent, landing opposite Eastney Barracks at Southsea earlier the same evening. He had been in no danger at all. = Formation of Ryde Inshore rescue = In 1956 a fatal double drowning at the end of Ryde Pier prompted the re-formation of a life saving organisation in the town. Local volunteers formed a lifeguard unit and operated from the old RNLI station on the pier along with the local St John Ambulance Brigade. The organisation was run by Vectis Fishing Club who ran a sea rescue service using small dinghies with Seagull outboard motors.

Morrow (1815) was a Pennsylvania decision by the Adjourned Court of Quarter Sessions for the County of Allegheny on the issue of Labor unionization. The jury in this case agreed that the master shoemakers, the journeymen, and the public, were endangered by the association of journeymen and returned a verdict of guilty on charges of conspiracy.Walton, Gary M., and Hugh Rockoff. History of the American Economy. Mason, OH: South¬¨-Western/Cengage Learning, 2010. Print. The Pittsburgh Cordwainers and the Court's ruling on Commonwealth v. Morrow reaffirmed the Court's views on the earliest forms of American labor unionization ‚Äîthat activities performed by these unions were unlawful. Prosecutors summoned former members of the journeymen cordwainers and master journeymen, most of the owners of the shops. These witnesses provided accounts of collective bargaining, which drove nonmembers out of the work force by refusing to work with them. Defendants argued that every man has a right to determine his own desired wages and doing so as a collective unit was lawful. This court case established the formation of unions and its activities as unlawful, in the form of conspiracy. The legality of unions as a legitimate entity would be established 25 years later in Commonwealth v. Hunt, a Massachusetts Supreme Court Decision. Commonwealth v. Morrow, however, serves as an example of early unionization of workers in the United States, and the challenges it faced. Background German journeymen in traditional uniform during journeyman years In nearly all the major cities, shoemakers (cordwainers) and printers were among the first to form workingmen's societies; carpenters, masons, hatters, riggers, and tailors also found it worthwhile to organize. As the number of workers in manufacturing industries rose, so did their activities to organize for their benefit. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania accused George Morrow, along with 21 other members of the journeymen cordwainers, of \\"unlawfully, perniciously and deceitfully, designing and intending to form and unite themselves into an unlawful society for the purpose of unjustly raising the price of their wages and the wages of all journeymen cordwainers in Pittsburgh.\\" A Documentary History of American Industrial Society, American Bureau of Industrial Research, Carnegie Institution of Washington. Edited by John R. Commons, Ulrich B. Phillips, Eugune A. Gilmore, Helen L. Sumner, and John B. Andrews. (pp. 20-23) The trial was held at an Adjourned Court of Quarter Sessions for the County of Allegheny at Pittsburgh on December 10, 1815, The counsel for the prosecution was Attorney General Samuel Douglas, along with Henry Baldwin and William Wilkins. The counsel for the defendants was Walter Forward and Parker Campbell. Before the landmark decision in Commonwealth v. Hunt, several generations of Americans, including lawyers, judges and legislators, have been convinced by their teachers to believe that the most effective legal weapon against the struggling labor union was the doctrine that concerted activities were conspiracies, and for that reason, illegal.Petro, Sylvester. \\"Unions and the Southern Courts: Part III- The Conspiracy and Tort Foundations of the Labor Injunction.\\" North Carolina Law Review 60 (1982): 546-550. Print. Prosecution Douglas argued that the indictment contained three counts. The first was for combining and conspiring together to form a society for purposes \\"highly prejudicial both to individuals and society in general.\\" The second charge was the \\"formation of that society in pursuance of such confederacy.\\" The third charge was the \\"acts resulting from that confederacy injurious to employers, to journeymen, to Pittsburgh, and the whole community. Witnesses for prosecution included former members of the journeymen cordwainers, such as Adam Moreland and John M. Phillips, and master cordwainers, such as Walter Glenn. Adam Moreland, one of the first members of the society testified, ‚Äúthe means we took to get our wages were a turn-out.., scabbing a shop is leaving it (society) and those who worked there after that were scabs. John M. Phillips, a relatively new resident of Pittsburgh and former member of the journeymen cordwainers, testified that the manner of joining the society involved putting a printed bill of wages in the Bible, and then swearing to work for no less wage than the bill contained.\\" He further claimed that many members of the society, including himself, were compelled to take the oath or leave the society, and consequence was you would be expelled from the town‚Ä¶as no one would work or board with an expelled member.\\" Walter Glenn employed 3 of the journeymen defendants (Mindeher, Meloney, and Hughes) along with his (Glenn's) brother. When Glenn declined to sign the turn-out and the new prices requested by Mindeher, Meloney, and Hughes, they all left him, including his brother. When asked to return to work week after turn-out, he said he could not work on account that he ‚Äúwould gain enemies by it or be found fault with him.\\" He later testified that he was forced to dump $1100‚Äì$1200 worth of stock at one point as a result of the wage demands by the journeymen. Defense Walter Forward, counsel for the defendants, argued three main points. First, he argued, \\"every man has a right to affix his own prices to his own labors, and it was not a crime to have a uniform price for price they pleased for their work.\\" Secondly he argued that the wage demands by the journeymen were reasonable and there were no proven charges of extortion. The third argument was the fact that journeymen wages, before the creation of such association, were too low and could not obtain fair price by any other means than the association.\\" Mr. Moreland, in his earlier testimony, admits to this fact as being true. Verdict The jury in this case agreed that the master shoemakers, the journeymen, and the public were endangered by the association of journeymen and returned a verdict of guilty of conspiracy, although the court fined the defendants only $1 each, plus prosecution costs. Implications The early craft societies, mainly shoemakers and printers, were typically transitory. Cyclical economic downturns routinely dissolved worker collective actions, and wage reductions, though resisted, were common during downturns in the economy. Another deterrent to unionization came from court actions. Conservative judges, in their instructions to juries, contended that union action per se was illegal. Commonwealth v. Morrow was first of many of the legal cases that challenged the \\"common law police power maintained in many of the preceding cases.\\"Law, labor, and ideology in the early American republic. Christopher L. Tomlins (pp. 142-143) The case largely followed what had by now emerged as a normal pattern‚Äîprosecution disclaimers of hostility to the journeymen and promises of a light penalty. The case was a breakthrough in that the court indicted the defendants, not for demanding high prices, but for employing unlawful means to extort those prices. It also redefined the definition of conspiracy as a \\"combination to effect an unlawful purpose or to effect a lawful purpose by unlawful means. Threats and violence would qualify as conspiracy, but not the simple act of writing and adopting a constitution or a collective refusal to work unless a nonmember were discharged.‚Äù Commonwealth v. Morrow was one of the many cases that helped transform labor unionization from an act of conspiracy to legitimate means of personal expression. Over the next few years, the apparent precariousness of the journeymen's legal position would become somewhat qualified, as sum by the decline in the incidence of prosecution regarding unionization and collective bargaining of wages.

In 1929, the South African Railways acquired a single self-contained steam railmotor for low-volume passenger service. The vehicle was a vertical boilered steam locomotive with a passenger coach as an integral part of the locomotive itself.Clayton Steam Rail Coach - From the Dave Rhind Collection, Railway History Group of South Africa, Pinelands, Cape Town. Steam railmotors The first steam railmotors in South Africa were the Cape Government Railways steam railmotor no. M6 and the Central South African Railways steam railmotor no. M2 which were introduced in 1906 and 1907 respectively. During the years since its establishment in 1910, several petrol-driven railmotors had been placed in low-volume passenger service by the South African Railways (SAR). In 1928, despite its declared preference for petrol-engine railcars, the Railways Administration decided to acquire a single experimental steam railmotor.SAR General Manager's Report for 1930, pp. 84-85. Manufacturer An order for one steam railmotor was placed with Clayton Carriage and Wagon in June 1928, at a purchase price of ¬£4,780 plus ¬£65 for a spare geared wheelset. Although it was initially intended for Durban, the railmotor was delivered to Cape Town instead. It was erected in the Salt River workshops and numbered RM11. After initial trial runs, the railmotor entered regular service on 24 September 1929. Characteristics The vertical boiler of the engine was located to the rear of the front driving compartment and had an outer cylindrical shell and an inner firebox, with the middle portion of the firebox pressed into a square cross-section. The coal bunker and water tank were mounted on the power bogie and the bunker part was separate from the coach body to enable it to swivel with the power bogie. The engine unit had two cylinders with piston valves which drove a spur gear on the driving axle, while the two axles of the power bogie were connected with coupling rods. For bi-directional operation, the railmotor had a second driving cab at the rear end of the coach. 300px The rear end of the railmotor rode on conventional passenger bogies. The coach had the capacity to seat 30 first class and 35 second class passengers in two compartments and it also had a baggage compartment immediately to the rear of the front driving cab and boiler. The vehicle was equipped with the old Johnston link-and-pin couplers instead of the new AAR knuckle couplers that were introduced in 1927. The reason was most likely that the commuter carriages in service at the time were all still equipped with the older couplers. Service The railmotor was initially placed in service on the Milnerton line for a brief period and often operated with a passenger carriage in tow. When this line was closed to regular traffic on 31 July 1930, the railmotor was transferred to the Cape Flats line. The railmotor fleet was reported as giving good results and accomplishing the objects of economical working and speedier and more comfortable travel compared to steam train services, since mixed trains on branch lines usually resulted in slower passenger service as a result of frequent stops to load or unload goods.SAR General Manager's Report for 1931, p. 35. The Clayton railmotor was later used on the Overberg line to Caledon. No more steam railmotors were acquired, however, and all subsequent railmotor models on the SAR were petrol-driven vehicles.

Deafblindness is a low incidence disability that describes individuals with varying degrees of vision and hearing losses. The combined loss often compromises the ability to access information in the environment or to communicate effectively. Inverveners provide a vital link to the people, things and events in the world surrounding a deaf-blind person. Interveners provide services in educational settings for students, as well as in early intervention and community settings.  Practice  In educational settings, interveners, through the provision of intervener services, provide access to information and communication and facilitate the development of social and emotional well being for children who are deaf-blind. An interventer is typically a paraeducator who has received specialized, in-depth training in deaf-blindness and works one-to-one with an infant, child, or youth. The intervener serves as a member of the student‚Äôs educational team. Working under the guidance and direction of a student‚Äôs classroom teacher or another individual responsible for ensuring the implementation of the student‚Äôs IEP, an intervener‚Äôs primary roles are to: * provide consistent access to instruction and environmental information that is usually gained by typical students through vision and hearing, but that is unavailable or incomplete to an individual who is deaf-blind; * provide access to and/or assist in the development and use of receptive and expressive communication skills; * facilitate the development and maintenance of trusting, interactive relationships that promote social and emotional well-being; and, * provide support to help a student form relationships with others and increase social connections and participation in activities.  Development of intervener services in the US  The concept of intervener services for individuals who are deaf-blind arose in Canada in the 1970s, and has been developing as a practice in the U. S. over the past two decades. In that time, significant efforts by many individuals across the nation have improved the availability of intervener services for children who are deaf-blind. Since 2002, there has been a national intervener task force that has developed valuable resources, including materials that raise awareness of intervener services and guidelines for intervener competencies. Families have educated policymakers about the role of interveners and the positive impact an intervener can have on the education of a child who is deaf-blind. State deaf-blind projects, part of the system of federal supports for this group of students, have developed creative ways to train interveners and support them in classrooms. Formal and informal collaborations are leading towards the development of a stronger national infrastructure to support this practice. Currently, a national set of recommendations, a national set of competencies for training interveners, national training modules and a national association are part of a strong foundation for promoting quality intervention services for individuals with deaf-blindness.

Life  Liu Yiming was born in 1734 in Quwo, Pingyang Âπ≥ÈôΩ (in present-day Linfen, Shanxi). Before he reached the age of 20, he was severely ill three times (Sun Yongle 2011:302).

Five years later, he moved to Henan, where he lived until 1765 working as a doctor (Sun Yongle 2011:302).

After the death of his father in 1769, Liu Yiming‚Äîwho was then in his mid-30s‚Äîalternated periods of traveling (in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and elsewhere) and of seclusion for a decade. In 1779 or 1780, he visited the Qiyun Ê£≤Èõ≤ mountains in Jincheng ÈáëÂüé (present-day Yuzhong, Gansu) and settled there to practice self-cultivation. From that time, this mountain became his stable residence, even though he occasionally traveled elsewhere. His abode, called Zizai wo Ëá™Âú®Á™© (Nest of Being by Oneself), is still extant in the present day (Sun Yongle 2011:304; Baldrian-Hussein 2008:691). Liu Yiming devoted the second half of his life to teaching and writing. His biographies also report that he used his financial resources to restore temples, shrines, and other buildings; to buy and lease fields to poor farmers; and to provide burial ground to those who could not afford it. In 1816, he prognosticated an auspicious place for his tomb on top of the Qiyun mountains, and his ‚Äútomb cave‚Äù was built there. In 1821, on the 6th day of the 1st lunar month, Liu Yiming entered the cave, pronounced his final words to his disciples, and died (Sun Yongle 2011:8).  Works  The main collection of Liu Yiming's works is entitled Daoshu shi'er zhong ÈÅìÊõ∏ÂçÅ‰∫åÁ®Æ (Twelve Books on the Dao; Pregadio 2008:331-33).

The main Chinese works on Liu Yiming are Liu Ning 2001; Liu Zhongyu 2010; and Jia Laisheng 2011. Although the \\"unity of the three teachings\\" (Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism) is not a major theme in his teachings, Liu Yiming does use Buddhist and Neo-Confucian terminology, to different extents according to the individual texts he wrote (Baldrian-Hussein 2008:691). This is a major aspect of Neidan (Internal Alchemy) itself, whose masters frequently draw concepts and terms from different traditions if this serves to express their point. = \\"Precelestial\\" and \\"Postcelestial\\" = The distinction between the ‚Äúprecelestial‚Äù (xiantian ÂÖàÂ§©) and the ‚Äúpostcelestial‚Äù (houtian ÂæåÂ§©) domains (before and after the generation of the cosmos, respectively) is essential in Liu Yiming's discourse on Taoism and Internal Alchemy. The precelestial domain harbors Original Essence (yuanjing ÂÖÉÁ≤æ), Original Breath (yuanqi ÂÖÉÊ∞£), and Original Spirit (yuanshen ÂÖÉÁ•û), which are all formless. Their operation results in the generation of the postcelestial domain (Liu Yiming 2013:23-25). In the human being, Original Essence manifests itself mainly as semen in males and menstrual blood in females; Original Breath manifests itself mainly as the ordinary breath of inspiration and expiration; and Original Spirit manifests itself mainly as the thinking mind (Liu Yiming 2013:27; see Three Treasures). The precelestial state is Yang, and the postcelestial state is Yin. The shift from one to the other state is seen as inevitable; however, the precelestial state is not erased, but only concealed within the postcelestial (Liu Yiming 2013:50, 124, 141). Above the precelestial and postcelestial domains, Liu Yiming places the Precelestial Breath of True Unity (xiantian zhenyi zhi qi ÂÖàÂ§©Áúü‰∏Ä‰πãÊ∞£). This state is beyond definition or description: ‚ÄúIt cannot be compared to the postcelestial breath of inspiration and expiration, the thinking spirit, and the essence of the intercourse; and it also cannot be equated to the Original Essence, the Original Breath, and the Original Spirit‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:32). In alchemical terms, according to Liu Yiming, the Precelestial Breath of True Unity is the Golden Elixir (id.). The Elixir, therefore, consists in the conjunction of the precelestial and the postcelestial, and grants access to the higher state of non-duality, or True Unity. = The Human Being = The Mysterious Barrier. The One Opening of the Mysterious Barrier (xuanguan yiqiao ÁéÑÈóú‰∏ÄÁ´Ö) is the spaceless center of the human being. Liu Yiming agrees with earlier Neidan masters in saying that this center is neither in the body nor in the mind (Liu Yiming 2013:101-2). The One Opening harbors the Precelestial Breath of True Unity. With the shift from the precelestial to the postcelestial, the precelestial True Yang becomes concealed within the postcelestial Yin, and the recognition of the spaceless center is lost. In the images of the Yijing (Book of Changes), True Yang becomes the solid line (‚öä) found within Kan ‚òµ, surrounded by two broken Yin lines. The purpose of Neidan consists in recovering the Yang within Kan ‚òµ and in using it to replace the Yin within Li ‚ò≤. This allows Qian ‚ò∞ (True Yang) and Kun ‚ò∑ (True Yin) to be reconstituted and then newly joined to one another. Nature and Existence. Nature (xing ÊÄß) and Existence (ming ÂëΩ) are the two main poles of one's life, and the core of Neidan: ‚ÄúThe Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of cultivating Nature and Existence‚Äù (Xiuzhen biannan). ‚ÄúNature‚Äù refers to one's authentic, inner Nature, which is innately perfected. ‚ÄúExistence‚Äù refers to one's life as an individual being, including one's function in existence as a whole. According to Liu Yiming, the shift from the precelestial to the postcelestial involves that both Nature and Existence take on two aspects, which he calls ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:44). One's true Nature can be hidden by one's false personality; and one's true Existence (or ‚Äútrue destiny‚Äù) can be concealed by ‚Äúfollowing the course‚Äù (shun È†Ü) of life. The gradual process of Neidan provides a means for ‚Äúinverting the course‚Äù (ni ÈÄÜ), making it possible first to ‚Äúreturn to one‚Äôs destiny,‚Äù and then to ‚Äúsee one‚Äôs Nature.‚Äù Body and Mind. In Liu Yiming's view, the ordinary body and mind are ‚Äúillusory‚Äù (huan Âπª). Their authentic counterparts are the ‚Äúdharma-body‚Äù (fashen Ê≥ïË∫´) and the ‚Äúcelestial mind‚Äù (tianxin Â§©ÂøÉ). The celestial mind is ‚Äúutterly empty and utterly numinous, silent and unmoving,‚Äù and ‚Äúpervades throughout by responding to impulses‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:40). The dharma-body (a term that in Buddhism means the awakened ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the Buddha; see Trikaya) has ‚Äúno head and no tail, no front and no back; it stands at the center and does not slant‚Äù (id.). With the shift to the postcelestial domain, ‚Äúthe dharma-body is buried and the illusory body takes charge, the celestial mind retires from its position and the human mind takes power‚Äù (id.). Neidan makes it possible to attain ‚Äúthe utmost of quiescence,‚Äù which is a property of the celestial mind. Moreover, the practice is concluded with the birth of the Embryo of Sainthood (shengtai ËÅñËÉé), which in Liu Yiming's view is equivalent to one's dharma-body, or ‚Äútrue body‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:62). = Neidan (Internal Alchemy) = \\"Superior Virtue\\" and \\"Inferior Virtue\\". Concerning Neidan, Liu Yiming makes a fundamental distinction between two ways of self-cultivation, respectively called ‚Äúsuperior virtue‚Äù (shangde ‰∏äÂæ∑) and ‚Äúinferior virtue‚Äù (xiade ‰∏ãÂæ∑; Liu Yiming 2013:117-20). Superior virtue is the state in which the precelestial has not been damaged and the original state of Unity is unspoiled. The few persons who have an inherent potential to preserve this state only need to ‚Äúprotect it and guard it‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:117). This requires receiving the instructions of a master, but the method (fa Ê≥ï) ultimately consists in following the Tao itself: there is no need to ‚Äúdo‚Äù a practice, and one operates by ‚Äúnon-doing‚Äù (wuwei ÁÑ°ÁÇ∫). If this original state is not preserved, the precelestial is dispersed and the postcelestial takes over. To recover the precelestial state, one cannot anymore operate by ‚Äúnon- doing‚Äù and instead must ‚Äúdo‚Äù: one needs a technique (shu Ë°ì) through which one can conjoin the True Yang and True Yin now found within the postcelestial Yin and Yang, respectively. This is the way of Internal Alchemy, which is the way of inferior virtue. However, Liu Yiming points out that when the way of inferior virtue has been fulfilled, it leads ‚Äúto the same destination as superior virtue‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:118). ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù and ‚ÄúNon-Doing‚Äù. In parallel to the distinction between superior and inferior virtue, Liu Yiming also establishes a key difference between two aspects, or stages, of the Internal Elixir. These stages focus on the cultivation of Nature and Existence, and they correspond to the ways of superior and inferior virtue, respectively. Those who are able to follow the way of superior virtue perform the two stages simultaneously: ‚ÄúIn superior virtue, there is no need to cultivate Existence and one just cultivates Nature: when Nature is fulfilled, then Existence is also fulfilled‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:119). Everyone else should perform the two stages in sequence, starting from the lower one and then proceeding to the higher one: ‚ÄúIn inferior virtue, one must first cultivate Existence and then cultivate Nature; after Existence is fulfilled, one must also fulfill Nature‚Äù (id.). The way of superior virtue attains both stages instantly by ‚Äúnon- doing.‚Äù Inferior virtue, instead, is the gradual way, and its practice is performed first by ‚Äúdoing‚Äù and then by ‚Äúnon-doing.‚Äù The Two Elixirs. The stages mentioned above correspond to two different Elixirs, which Liu Yiming calls Small Reverted Elixir (xiao huandan Â∞èÈÇÑ‰∏π) and Great Reverted Elixir (da huandan Â§ßÈÇÑ‰∏π). The Small Reverted Elixir ‚Äúconsists in returning from the postcelestial to the precelestial‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:61). This is the movement of ascent, the ‚Äúinversion of the course‚Äù performed through Internal Alchemy. The practice, however, is completed only by compounding the Great Reverted Elixir. At this stage, one performs the complementary movement of descent, returning ‚Äúfrom Non-Being to Being, and from the subtle to the manifest‚Äù (Liu Yiming 2013:62). Thus Internal Alchemy, through its gradual process, enables one to ascend to the precelestial, but its practice is concluded when the descent to the postcelestial is also performed. Then the precelestial and the postcelestial become one, and one operates by transforming (hua Âåñ) the postcelestial into the precelestial.

He was born in Lincoln, probably in 1830, and his family came from Branston near Lincoln.The 1851 Census notes that John Giles, aged 21 and born in Lincoln, was a lodger with Pearson Bellamy in Melville Street, Lincoln He was articled to the Lincoln architect Pearson Bellamy. Lincolnshire Chronicle - Friday 28 July 1893 pg 5 He had moved to London by 1859 and with Pearson Bellamy entered a number competitions for major public buildings. Of these only one, for Grimsby Town was successful. In London he was responsible for a number of major projects including the Langham Hotel. He also started in 1869 on the design of hospitals with the Infirmary to Hampstead Union Workhouse. After a short period of partnership with Lewis Angel, when Stratford Town Hall was built and with Edward Biven, by 1873 he was in partnership with Albert Edward Gough. They were joined in the practice by J E Trollope and they became involved in the design of Arts and Crafts housing in London's west end. Giles had business interests in the City of London and was noted in 1867 as being a Director of the Imperial Guardian Life Insurance Company. Brighton Gazette - Thursday 22 Works Giles initially worked with Bellamy and Hardy of Lincoln. In 1859 they submitted plans in a competition for the Manchester Assize Courts in Great Ducie St. Manchester, but the competition was won by Sir Alfred Waterhouse with a notable building in the Venetian Gothic style. Giles and Bellamy and Hardy's proposed building was in the Palazzo revival style. Then in 1861 they were successful in a competition to design the Town Hall at Grimsby. Giles' practice was first at 2 Verulam Buildings, London in 1864 and he was to move to 28 Craven Street, Charing Cross by 1868. A notable architect articled to Giles was Charles Bell who came from Grantham in Lincolnshire. Following this Giles was working by himself and his most notable buildings were: *Langham Hotel, London, built between 1863 and 1865 The Petersham Hotel overlooking the Thames at Richmond *Petersham Hotel, Petersham completed in 1865Hillfield House, Gloucester (geograph 3833102) *Torwood, Wimbledon Park, Surrey, a house illustrated in The BuilderIllustration for The Builder, 11 November 1865. pg 801. *Hillfield House, Gloucester, a mansion faced in ashlar Bath stone and built in 1867-69 for the timber merchant Charles Walker.

The building is described as a confidently Victorian version of arched Cinquecento with rusticated stone ground floor with square headed window openings beneath an upper storey of round arched windows, divided by Corinthian columns.

He spent hours in AOL chat rooms devoted to exposing predators, posing as a 12-year-old boy named \\"Sean.\\" In 1995, after turning his evidence over to the FBI, he testified before the United States Congress in 1995 about pedophilia on the internet, and how child pornography laws needed to be enforced. AOL eventually shut down the chat rooms dedicated to pedophilia and child pornography. In 2016, Crimmins endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In 2017, in the wake of the #MeToo campaign, Crimmins voiced support of the movement and called for increased awareness of harassment in the workplace.

While attending Caltech, Trimberger joined the Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) project, with principal investigator Gene Shoemaker, operated by Eleanor \\"Glo\\" Helin. PCAS searched for asteroids that could potentially impact planets, including Earth. In recognition for his contributions to this project, minor planet 2990 was named \\"Trimberger.\\"  Career  Trimberger joined VLSI Technology in 1982 where, as a member of the original Design Technology group, he developed a variety of computer-aided design software including interactive tools, simulation, physical design automation and logical design automation. During this time, he wrote An Introduction to CAD for VLSI, collecting and explaining the fundamental algorithms and techniques used in the early days of the CAE industry. Since 1988, he has been employed at Xilinx, a fabless semiconductor company in San Jose, California. He was a member of the architecture definition group for the Xilinx XC4000 field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the first FPGA with dedicated arithmetic and memory. At the same time, he was the technical leader for the XC4000 design automation software. He led the architecture definition group for the Xilinx XC4000X device families. He developed a time-multiplexed FPGA and software to map to it in the 1990s, long before Tabula commercialized the time-folded FPGA. He is an inventor on approximately thirty patents in this area. In the early 1990s, he edited and co-wrote Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology, introducing the first generation of academic researchers to the industrial side of programmable-logic architecture, tools and design. He designed the bitstream security system for the Xilinx Virtex-II [US Patent #7,058,177], the first bitstream encryption deployed in FPGAs. His inventions on that security system are the basis of security in all commercial FPGAs from Xilinx and others. He was also instrumental in bringing 3D packaging from a lab curiosity to a product in the mid-2000s [US Patent 7,605,458]. This was deployed by Xilinx as Stacked Silicon Interconnect Technology (SSIT). Trimberger led the Xilinx Advanced Development group for many years and is currently Xilinx Fellow in Xilinx Research Labs in San Jose. Trimberger has written three books on computer-aided design for integrated circuits and FPGAs. He has written dozens of papers on design automation and FPGA architectures. He is a four-time winner of the Ross Freeman Award, Xilinx‚Äôs annual award for technical innovation. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2016 for his contributions to solid state electronics.

It would link S√£o Paulo to the southeast portion of the Greater S√£o Paulo, ending in S√£o Bernardo do Campo. The line was expected to be the first S√£o Paulo Metro Line to go beyond the city limits.  Station   Background  Preliminary studies for a city passenger rail transportation system in S√£o Paulo were sketched as of 1888, and later some of them included the so-called ABC region. One of them cited a suspension railway as an alternative for the city and its neighborhoods in the 1960s, inspired on Wuppertal Suspension Railway and SAFEGE models, including a suggestion to link ABC to Parque Dom Pedro II through Tamanduate√≠ River. S√£o Paulo Metro was established as a company in 1968 and started its revenue service in 1974. Its justification was based upon the fast growth of the city of S√£o Paulo, and its car fleet as well, with all the problems emerging due to that. The original plan suggested the construction of four lines, all of them enclosed within the city's limits, although predicting transfer stations to the commuter rail system and the buses. The southeasternmost station of the system was predicted to be settled near Via Anchieta (and bearing such name), a state road linking S√£o Paulo to Santos passing by the ABC region. Although commuter rail services exist between the ABC region and the city of S√£o Paulo since the end of the 19th century, through S√£o Paulo Railway and its successors, the fast growth of the area observed in the 2nd half of the 20th century and the unavailability of such services in some cities (notably S√£o Bernardo do Campo and Diadema) demanded further transport options to the region. At first the government didn't see any rationale to establish a metro line in the area, choosing to install a trolley bus service linking S√£o Paulo to S√£o Bernardo do Campo through Diadema. Such initiatives led to the establishment of S√£o Mateus‚ÄìJabaquara Metropolitan Corridor, one of the first bus rapid transit systems in Brazil. The S√£o Paulo secretariat of Metropolitain Transportation started to issue plans for the future transport expansion in 1997, aiming to anticipate and get prepared for the demands of its citizens on this matter. Those reports are known as Integrated Urban Transport Plans (Plano Integrado de Transporte Urbano ‚Äì PITU). PITU 2025 claimed for the need to a metro branch linking ABC to S√£o Paulo, more specifically employing either a light rail or guided bus technology.  Project  The original project predicted an 18 stops' line linking the current Tamanduate√≠ station (already served by S√£o Paulo Metro and CPTM commuter rail service as well) to Alvarengas station, a future terminal station to be located near the city road bearing the same name. However parts of such path overlaps the current S√£o Mateus‚ÄìJabaquara metropolitan corridor, which would demand the extinction of such service between S√£o Bernardo and Ferraz√≥polis. As this corridor is operated through a concession, it would imply breaking that contract thus exposing the state government to a termination fee. Such risk endangered the whole project and the solution sought was to truncate the proposed line to end at S√£o Bernardo station and eventually at Djalma Dutra station. The government procurement for the establishment of the line has been established in 2014 and states it will be constructed as a public‚Äìprivate partnership. The system is expected to be concluded in 2018. Stations Rudge Ramos and Mau√° are shown as Pra√ßa Regina Matiello and Instituto Mau√°, respectively, in some local news sources, although the most recent metro company documents still don't mention them bearing such names. On July 2014, Malaysian rail company Scomi Rail announced that it had been selected as the monorail technology provider for the winning consortium of the Public Private Partnership Project (PPP), Consorcio ABC Integrado. This would be Scomi's third project in Brazil after Line 17-Gold and the Manaus Monorail. The line will operate the Scomi SUTRA monorail systems designed by Scomi Rail. In July 2020, more than a year after the cancelling of the project, Chinese company BYD presented a proposal to the State Secretary of Regional Development, along with the Chairman of the Greater ABC Intermunicipal Dealership, Gabriel Maranh√£o, Mayor of Rio Grande da Serra, to \\"rescue\\" the monorail line.  Controversy  The monorail alternative for line 18 was contested, as it is not employed on current metro branches but appointed as the most suitable construction for this project, as well as for lines 15-Silver (formerly Line 2-Green expansion) and 17-Gold. Positive arguments are the cheaper, faster construction and decreasing the need for resumption; listed setbacks are visual pollution, difficulty to be evacuated in case of emergency, its relative small capacity and incapability to be upgraded. In downtown S√£o Bernardo do Campo, some real estate owners tried to settle a civil action to change the proposed right-of-way, as it may adversely affect high-end apartment buildings recently erected there, through aesthetic concerns and planned resumptions. On 3 July 2019, Governor Jo√£o Doria, along with Vice Governor, Rodrigo Garcia, and Secretary of Metropolitan Transportations, Alexandre Baldy, announced that the Line would be cancelled and replaced by a BRT system, already rumored months before.

She worked for Katipunero fighters and brought materials from Manila to make gunpowder and bullets, which she delivered to her husband in Cavite. Upon the death of her first husband, Mariano Barroga of Batac, she married Gen. Artemio Ricarte. Early life Born in Binondo, Manila, she was the second child of Ambrosio Esteban, a native of Ligao and Francisca de la Cruz of Cainta, Rizal. Her parents moved to Binondo after their marriage. In Binondo, Agueda and her brother and sister were taught by \\"Maestrang Bulag\\" who was selling ikmo leaves and tobacco.AGUEDA ESTEBAN Coming from an impoverished family, she enrolled in a girls' school under the auspices of Dona Vicenta de Roxas. She excelled at school, which earned her the respect of her teacher, parents and most importantly, Dona Vicenta. She married Mariano Barroga of Batac, Ilocos Norte who was the mayordomo in the house of the son of Dona Vicenta. They had three children, Catalina, Adriana and Anastacia. Katipunan Her husband joined the Katipunan and assumed the pseudonym Tungkod (Tagalog for \\"rod\\" or \\"staff\\"). He was put in charge of the revolutionaries in San Juan del Monte, Montalban and Marikina. Later, he was transferred with his family from Manila to Tangos, Cavite. Agueda helped her husband in his revolutionary activities. They traveled between Manila and Cavite in order to secure materials for ammunition to be used by the Filipinos. Their activities remained undetected by the authorities until the first phase of the revolution ended with the Truce of Biak-na-Bato. American invasion During the American occupation of the Philippines, she was the courier between her husband in Manila and General Artemio Ricarte in Cavite. She was entrusted with secret papers on war strategies and planned attacks on the Spanish detachments. Because she was a woman, she was never suspected of involvement in revolutionary activities. On July 1, 1900, all three were arrested in Calle Anda after the authorities discovered grenades in her house. On February 16, 1901, Tungkod (then a Lt. Col.) was exiled to Guam with other revolutionaries. Aguada was left behind to take care of her four children. She left her three older children in the care of Hospicio de San Jose, while she sold jewelry with her youngest child Salud, to support her family. In November 1902, her husband died; leaving her with another child named Artemio in honor of Artemio Ricarte. Exile and later life In 1910, she visited Gen. Ricarte who was in Hong Kong exiled for the second time after refusing to sign an oath of allegiance to the United States. In May 1911, she married the general and lived there from 1910 to 1921 on the small island of Lemah. When the British government deported political exiles from Hong Kong during the outbreak of World War I, her family was shipped to Shanghai and then Japan. In 1921, they moved to Tokyo, where Gen. Ricarte taught Spanish in an overseas school. In April 1923 they transferred to Yokohama, where they lived permanently and opened a profitable restaurant. They lived there for eighteen years together with their children and grandchildren. After Japan occupied the Philippines, she came back. In 1944, she fell ill and died.

It is sometimes referred to in international mainstream media reports on aviation incidents.  History  The site was launched on 12 May 2008 as a one-man project by Austrian aviation security expert Simon Hradecky. Hradecky's search for safety-related incidents in aviation began in 1995, so despite its launch in 2008, reports on events up to 19 June 1999 can be found on the website. The site garnered over 1,000 readers in the first month, and after eight months it had over 100,000. In May 2018, the website had around 3.5 million visitors per month. , over 25,000 individual news items had been published.  Website  The website records incidents that occur during commercial flights (aircraft with at least 19 seats). According to its own statements, the published news is based on its own research and is only included if there are reports from at least one official source or two unofficial, independent sources. The website, which is visually designed in a no-frills style, lists the headlines of the latest events and news in aviation, all of which fall into one of the following categories: * Crash (C) ‚Äì an accident that killed multiple people or caused catastrophic damage * Accident (A) ‚Äì an incident that caused injury, death or extensive damage * Incident (I) ‚Äì an incident that did not cause injury, death or extensive damage * News (N) ‚Äì an article about an event other than a crash, accident or incident * Report (R) ‚Äì an article about an accident or incident investigation report where the site did not report the original event. The user can filter articles by category. The articles are kept up to date even years after an aircraft accident. For example, the final reports of the associated aircraft accident investigations are often incorporated into the original article.

Since tobacco was so widely used as commodity money, the act affected currency as well as the structure of tobacco farming and export.Schwietzer 2011, p. 554 As the primary export and revenue source for Maryland, tobacco played a vital role in the economy. The Tobacco Inspection Act of 1747 guaranteed that a specified quality would be met, with the intention of increasing demand for Maryland Tobacco and hence increasing its price, and overall revenue.Walsh, Lorena S. \\"Plantation Management in the Chesapeake, 1620‚Äì1820,\\" The Journal of Economic History 49,2 (1989): 393-406. JSTOR, Cambridge University Press. Web. 15 Mar, 2011. . Background Earlier attempts of Maryland's Government to stimulate stagnating prices for Maryland Tobacco came in the form of legislated reduction in output.Schwietzer 2011, p. 551 By reducing the output of tobacco produced, the equilibrium price for tobacco would be driven up, counteracting the otherwise stagnating prices. These policies, however, turned out to be so unpopular that the government of Maryland had trouble enforcing them After a similar inspection law in Virginia in the 1730s, however, Maryland witnessed the benefits of such a policy. Maryland tobacco farmers were able to observe the rising revenues for Virginian tobacco farmers, which had a devastating effect on the Maryland tobacco industry.Schwietzer 2011, p. 552 Also, because tobacco notes were used so widely as commodity money, it was necessary to ensure the quality of the tobacco to validate the reliability of the notes.Walton, Gary M., and Hugh Rockoff. History of the American Economy. Mason, OH: South-Western/Cengage Learning, 2010. Print. Impact on local economies The first and most significant effect on the local economy was the impact the inspection act had on prices. From 1720 to 1747 tobacco prices stagnated, however, prices rose dramatically after 1747, closing the gap on the price for Virginian tobacco.Schwietzer 2011, pp. 557-558 Another significant effect the law had was to diversify the local economy. Because the act set a minimum level of quality for tobacco, growers who could not meet this minimum quality level were driven to other crops, namely the production of foodstuffs such as grains and livestock.Schwietzer 2011, p. 556 This led to a consolidation of tobacco farmers into a specialized group of producers, decreasing distribution costs in the tobacco trade. Regarding the effect on local currency, the Tobacco Inspection Act served to further legitimize the use of tobacco notes as commodity money. Because the quality of the tobacco backing the notes was now guaranteed, the notes were accepted more readily and in a broader circulation base. This is because there was a decrease in the uncertainty associated with a stranger's tobacco, increasing the number of transactions in which the tobacco notes could be used.Schwietzer 2011, p. 564 The result of this was to increase the velocity of money, subsequently increasing the money supply. Also, the revaluation of tobacco led to a one-time redistribution of wealth from most debtors to creditors, since they were being repaid in more valuable currency, and a long term redistribution of income from tenants to landlords.Schwietzer 2011, p. 566 Overall effects Overall there were many positive effects of the Maryland Tobacco Inspection Act of 1747. The act without a doubt contributed to the economic growth of MarylandSchwietzer 2011, p. 565 Likewise, revenue from tobacco production rose sharply, and the industry in general benefited from an increase in specialization. One factor in this was the development of the inspection warehouse system, which reduced transportation costs of the tobacco trade. Also, those producers of tobacco who were too large or small, too far from rivers for transportation, or did not have optimal lands for tobacco production were forced out of the industry because of the rising costs associated with more stringent inspection. On the whole, the law encouraged diversification, increased productivity, and created long run benefits for the economic performance of Maryland.

Spillenger (October 24, 1924 ‚Äì November 20, 2013) was an American painter associated with the New York School. Biography Spillenger was born on October 24, 1924, in Brooklyn, to Herbert Spillenger, a postal worker, and Minnie Pines. He showed artistic ability from an early age and won several art prizes in elementary and high school. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and flew a C-47 transport plane over ‚ÄúThe Hump‚Äù (the Eastern Himalayas) in Burma, China and India, an extremely dangerous assignment, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and other honors. Spillenger returned to the U.S in 1945 and attended Pratt Institute on the G.I. Bill. After graduating in 1948, Spillenger enrolled at Black Mountain College in Asheville, North Carolina, where he studied with Willem de Kooning and Josef Albers and met John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Kenneth Noland and a number of painters with whom he‚Äôd remain close, Pat Passlof and Elaine de Kooning among them. After Black Mountain, he studied in Rome with Giorgio Morandi and Pericle Fazzini, returning in 1950 to New York. By 1950 Spillenger had left behind his early figurative work and was focusing exclusively on abstraction. His media of choice were oil on canvas, board and paper. He occasionally exhibited during the fifties, and showed works at three New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals at the Stable Galleries, from 1953 to 1955. His work was admired by his peers; Pat Passlof called him ‚Äúthe most brilliant unknown painter of his generation.‚ÄùPat Passlof, personal communication to Paul Spillenger. He was one of the first regular members of The Club, the modern artists‚Äô semi-official discussion venue, and the Cedar Tavern, the unofficial one. In 1955, he married Marian Dennison (n√©e Katz) and with the birth of their first son Paul in 1956, they moved to an apartment at 95 East Tenth Street in the middle of a hub of the New York art scene. Their second son Clyde was born there in 1960. De Kooning‚Äôs studio was across the street, at 88 East Tenth Street, Esteban Vicente was in the same building, right across the hall, and his friend Franz Kline lived around the corner on Ninth Street. Tenth Street between Third and Fourth Avenue was then home to a number of artist cooperative galleries (the Tenth Street galleries) such as the Tanager, the Camino, the March and the Brata, which were created to offer alternatives to the uptown galleries that the artists felt were too conservative. Spillenger was a founding member of the March Gallery in 1957. During the 1950s and 1960s, Spillenger produced a large number of abstract paintings. The influence of Arshile Gorky, de Kooning, and Kline on these works is unmistakable, but they retain their own identity and integrity. By the mid-1970s, the New York art scene as Spillenger knew it had dispersed. Some painters (Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Kline) had died, others (de Kooning) had become wealthy and moved out of New York; many more either gave up painting or moved to more congenial places to raise their children. At the same time, Spillenger felt the galleries and the art scene in general had become more corrupt than ever before. He wanted no part of it, and soon he stopped painting entirely. Fifteen years later, now in his late sixties, he came back to art with a vengeance. He began attending life drawing classes and churning out hundreds and hundreds of works on paper, mostly figurative, which still showed the command of movement, line and form that had characterized his abstract work. He continued painting, drawing and revising until 2011, when advanced dementia made it impossible for him to work. He died in 2013, one of the very last abstract expressionists to pass. Work Works by Raymond Spillenger can be found in the collections of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minn., and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. He was subject of an exhibition at the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center January 22 ‚Äì May 21, 2016. The show traveled to the Neuberger Museum of Art September 11 - December 23, 2016.

Adam had begun his experimentation with songwriting whilst undergoing his studies at The BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. In 2010, Adam began writing towards what would eventually become Kyros' debut album under the then name of Synaesthesia. In 2012, he joined in collaboration with fellow Middlesex University student Nikolas Jon Aarland, who helped record guitar parts. Nikolas was involved in the recording process of the early demos but left the project in 2013 soon after his parts were re-recorded at Aubitt Studios for the GEP release of the album. This was due to his ongoing work with a number of other projects. He was replaced with guitarist, Ollie Hannifan who helped record a number of the remaining guitar parts for the album as well as contributions from IQ guitarist, Michael Holmes. Under the band name of Synaesthesia, Adam signed a recording deal with Giant Electric Pea in February 2012 and promptly started the recording process at Aubitt Studios in Southampton for the debut album with IQ guitarist and Giant Electric Pea CEO, Michael Holmes as record producer and Rob Aubrey as recording engineer. The album was recorded through the process of multi-track recording and overdubbing as all the instruments with the exception of bass guitar and electric guitar were performed by Adam Warne. Guitar duties were taken care of by Ollie Hannifan, Nikolas Jon Aarland and minor edits and re- recordings by Michael Holmes. Bass duties were taken care of by Michael Holmes with the exception of Nikolas on the track, Technology Killed The Kids. Once the recording of the album had finished, Adam began the process of completing the band lineup for future albums and live purposes. He welcomed second guitarist, Samuel Higgins whom he had also met through university, along with drummer, Robin Johnson via an online forum and bassist, Peter Episcopo via recording engineer, Rob Aubrey, into the band with Adam taking care of vocals, synths and keyboard duties from then on. Kyros's debut album was released originally a self-titled work as the band was under the name of Synaesthesia at the time. The album was released 20 January 2014 The band performed their debut concert at The Cultuurpodium Boerderij in Zoetermeer supporting IQ and received positive reviews for their performance. =2014: Departure of Ollie Hannifan and Joey Frevola's joining= In early April 2014, the band announced that guitarist Ollie Hannifan would be taking what was then, a temporary leave due to his commitments to stage production, Mamma Mia!. Through a post made via the band's Facebook page, an announcement was made stating the following: \\"In terms of what's happening when Ollie returns is not yet clear. At the moment, we're going to see what happens when he finishes the tour and we'll take it from there.\\" Following this, the band sent out a press release announcing the search of a fill-in guitarist. The press release stated that the position is required to be filled until January 2015. Although the press release stated clearly that the position was temporary, applicants were told via email response that this did not mean restrictions to membership of the band and that they could contribute to the band creatively and artistically. In this sense, this meant that they could not be counted as a Touring member but rather, a full-time member for the period they were filling in for Ollie Hannifan. On 28 May 2014, the band announced via their Facebook page, \\"After nearly five weeks of discussions and reviewing over the auditions and applications we received to replace Ollie Hannifan for the next eight months, we are very happy to announce who we chose.\\" The band announced the welcoming of guitarist, Joey Frevola into the band to temporarily replace Ollie Hannifan for the period stated. With this, Joey was chosen to become a full-time member of Kyros with the ability to contribute to writing sessions for future songs as well as replacing Ollie Hannifan for live concerts. Through the same Facebook page post, the band also announced that Joey is based in the United States and would be moving over to London to work with the band for the duration needed. In January 2015, the band announced that Joey would become a permanent member since Ollie will no longer be available to return to the band. The announcement was made at their headline show in W2, Den Bosch in the Netherlands. =2015‚Äì2016: Name change, split from GEP and release of EP= In the Spring of 2015 the band also opened for Marillion at the Wolverhampton Marillion Weekend event before making their North American debut at RoSfest On 24 September 2015, the band announced via Facebook, newsletter and their website that they will be changing their band name from what was then Synaesthesia to Kyros, effective from the end of the European Spock's Beard tour of 2015, on which they were a support act. The band stated that this was due to a number of reasons, including legal complications and the marking of a new period, as the debut album was originally a solo studio project of Adam Warne but the project had since gone on to become a fully fledged band with a creative style that was heading in a vastly different direction than their debut album. Within the same announcement, the band stated that they would no longer be working with Giant Electric Pea due to \\"creative differences\\". This led to the band announcing that not only would they be releasing their second album independently but they will also be producing, mixing, mastering, pressing, and promoting the album independently, taking much influence from bands such as Marillion who are known to currently work independently from major record labels and gather funding via crowdfunding. To help fund their new album, as part of the same announcement, the band cited that they would be independently releasing a limited edition pressing of an EP titled BETA. It was the first independent release from the band, with all work including mixing duties and artwork undertaken by members of the band. The BETA EP contained three new tracks from the band's then-upcoming album in their work- in-progress mixes and arrangements and three demos from the recording and writing sessions of the debut Synaesthesia album. Following the release of the band's BETA EP, their social media posting and presence dramatically dropped whilst they continued to work on what would eventually become their double album, Vox Humana. =2017‚Äì2018: Vox Humana, KMG and independence= Towards the end of 2016, the band dispatched a press release announcing their double album, Vox Humana, which was to be independently released through their newly established management company and record label, KYROS Media Group or KMG. The announcement detailed that the release had been a culmination of approximately three years of writing, recording and mixing with efforts from all members; Adam Warne on vocals, keyboards and mixing, Joey Frevola on guitars and programming, Sam Higgins on vocals, guitars and additional programming, Peter Episcopo on vocals and bass guitar and Robin Johnson on drums and percussion. It was made clear that Vox Humana was Kyros' first professional release as a band since transitioning from a solo studio project whilst signed to GEP Records. The album also features a full live brass section with parts arranged by Raymond Hearne, better known as the drummer in the progressive metal band, Haken. The double album was mastered by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios in Sweden. Within the same period, the band released the maxi single \\"Cloudburst\\", which included multiple versions of the track \\"Cloudburst\\", including a shortened radio edit for pushing towards a mainstream wider radio audience and extended \\"feature-length mix\\" to market towards their established progressive scene roots. Following the release of the single on 21 September 2016 and their double album, Vox Humana, on 5 November 2016, the band continued to push forward and released an EP on 12 February 2017, the Monster EP. Following suit, this EP included a radio edit of their track \\"Monster\\" as well as alternative versions of the track. Differing from their \\"Cloudburst\\" maxi single release, the Monster EP also included two entirely new tracks. \\"Indigo Was Her\\", which preceded the eventual album version of \\"Monster\\" before being shelved and later adjusted, and \\"The Door\\", which was written by Joey Frevola as part of his contribution towards an external songwriting project. \\"The Door\\"'s mix and overall sound palette was adjusted once taken in by the band as a Kyros song. With an emphasis on image and a conscious approach towards artwork, the band have been working closely with artist Matt Verges for creating the artwork of Vox Humana and the Monster EP. Matt has been working in close partnership with the band since these two releases and continues to work together for further plans. Continuing the band's conscious approach to artwork and image, the band released a simple self-produced music video for the track \\"Cloudburst\\" making the use of projectors and overlays and a CGI video for the track \\"Monster\\", which was directed by Miles Skarin and produced by Crystal Spotlight. The video includes the use of 3D depth scanning and advanced 3D modelling. Since then, the band have also continued to work closely with Crystal Spotlight. = 2019: Departure of guitarist, Samuel Higgins = On the 7 April 2019, the band announced the departure of Samuel Higgins via their Facebook page. Higgins' last performance with the band was at the annual 2DaysProg+1 Festival in Veruno, Italy in September 2018. Within the same post, the band announced it would continue as a four-piece lineup with Joey Frevola taking on backing vocals. Responding to fan queries via comments, the band had also stated that all of Sam's parts had been recorded for the third album Celexa Dreams. = 2020‚ÄìPresent: Signing to White Star Records and release of third studio album, Celexa Dreams = On the 13 March 2020, the band announced their signing to White Star Records, headed by musician and record producer, John Mitchell and Magick Eye Records head, Chris Hillman. On signing to White Star Records, Kyros vocalist and keyboardist Adam Warne comments: > ‚ÄúWhen we were introduced to White Star, we knew from the get-go that it > would be a natural fit. John and Chris‚Äô open-mindedness meant that they > understood our desires to experiment and try out different styles, and that > we would have a very clear-cut vision on how we wanted to go about executing > our ideas. The limits are ours to push. For all of us in Kyros, that‚Äôs > incredibly important and motivating. This is a new chapter for Kyros, and > one that will undoubtedly surprise a lot of people. I‚Äôm incredibly excited > for what the future holds.‚Äù Mirroring his enthusiasm, White Star Records‚Äô Chris Hillman exclaims: > \\"We‚Äôve been thoroughly pleased with the positive feedback we‚Äôve had for the > previous releases on our White Star Records label, but that also creates a > pressure to ensure that future releases maintain a high standard. That > pressure is made a lot easier with bands like Kyros! When we heard early > mixes of the band‚Äôs new album, we knew that the band would be a worthy > addition to our White Star family of artists. Inventive and exciting and > with great melodies too, the band have progressed impressively from their > previous, well-received releases. We are looking forward to getting the > finished tracks out there and looking forward to working with this fine band > of exceptional musicians.‚Äù > Soon after, both the label and the band announced that the upcoming studio album, entitled 'Celexa Dreams' will be released on the 19 June 2020 and \\"would consist of a collection of short stories, each underpinned with a thought-provoking lyrical concept. From delving into the emotional weight of working in a job you hate to the more serious commentary on the dangers of toxic internet culture and anonymity, each slice of the band‚Äôs forthcoming album pulls from threads of the band‚Äôs collectively accumulated life experiences.\\" Their first single to be released, Rumour was released on digital platforms on the 17 April 2020 and displayed a change of direction and sound palette for the band with journalist, Eden Kupermintz describing the style of Rumour and the rest of Celexa Dreams to be \\"a giant love letter to that sweet (and sometimes painful) time when progressive rock bands like Yes, Rush, and others were experimenting with the synth-pop sounds of the 80‚Äôs and early 90‚Äôs. The result is an eclectic and well written album filled with tasty bass, prominent synths, and ethereal, evocative vocals.\\". On the 19 June 2020, the band then went onto release their second single from Celexa Dreams, entitled Phosphene. Described by Metal Mayhem Radio as \\"a dense, textural track that adopts a more deliberate pace into deep, ballad-esque territories.\\" A press release was announced with front man Adam Warne stating, ‚Äú‚ÄòPhosphene is a very personal song to me. It was actually written directly in response to our debut album, Synaesthesia. I wrote the lyrics on that album about someone who had negatively affected my life in a significant way at that point. I fell out of contact with that individual, but many years later, re-established contact after realising how pointless it was to hold onto grudges. It‚Äôs all just teenage drama at the end of the day. We mature, we gain experiences and learn how to cope with certain situations as we grow older.‚Äù Phosphene marked another push towards new territory as the band explored a slower paced, ballad-esque approach to songwriting with inspiration taken from eighties ballads, modern synth pop and vaporwave. As a result of the 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic, the band have had to cancel multiple shows and appearances, as well as music video and press photo shoots in the run up to the release of Celexa Dreams but have gone onto to start their Isolation Gigs series on Facebook and YouTube with each online show broadcasting on the last week of every month. Starting initially as a one-off special for World Health Day, the band followed up with their second edition in April and have alluded to future shows. Musical style Kyros perform a brand of Alternative Rock, Electronic Rock and Art Rock with heavy leanings towards the Progressive Rock genre. The band are also not afraid of taking influence from popular music with heavy influence from eighties, nineties and modern pop music. Kyros have cited Porcupine Tree, Kate Bush, Muse, Radiohead, Rush, CHVRCHES, The Dear Hunter, Duran Duran, Frost* Trevor Horn, IQ, Spock's Beard and more as major influences.

Hough. The series was simultaneously released in both the United States (by Del Rey Books) and the United Kingdom (by Titan Books). The first book in the series, The Darwin Elevator, was released in July 2013, and the two sequels, The Exodus Towers and The Plague Forge, were released later that same year. An eBook-only release, The Dire Earth: A Novella, acts as a prequel to the trilogy and reveals more of the main characters' backgrounds. Reception for The Darwin Elevator was extremely positive, and the book placed on The New York Times Best-Seller list. Background The series is based on a future post-apocalyptic Earth in the 23rd century. An empty space vessel arrives which harbingers additional arrivals; the next is a ship which constructs the cord of a space elevator anchored on Darwin, Australia, labelling the unknown aliens as \\"The Builders\\". Neil Platz, having discovered the first vessel in orbit, works out the future location of the elevator and establishes Platz Industries to exploit it: buying the land where it will anchor, building the NightCliff elevator base and climber infrastructure in Darwin, and eventually establishing orbital colonies along the elevator cord. For a time, Darwin thrives as it becomes the centre of space technology innovation. Synopsis =The Darwin Elevator= The first novel is set years after a plague has afflicted most of the Earth's population, dubbed \\"subs\\" (as the disease turns people into zombie-like sub-humans). The others comprise the rare \\"immunes\\" and the refugees inhabiting the \\"aura\\" safe zone around the space elevator. Humanity exists as refugees in Darwin or as technological space dwellers, who occupy space stations and space farms constructed around the elevator. They live a fragile coexistence: Darwin exports air and water for the space stations, and the space farms feed the ground population. The lead character, Captain Skyler Luiken, an immune, heads a team of immune scavengers who can survive outside the aura where they battle sub-humans while collecting items of value to trade, or repair the aging elevator complex and space stations. Skyler and the crew become entangled in the political plots and power games of Russell Blackfield, the head of the Nighcliff elevator base, and Neil Platz, \\"owner\\" of the space stations. As the aura protection begins to fail, Platz and scientist Dr. Tania Sharma discover that another Builders vessel is due to arrive. Skyler eventually gets to the bottom of the aura failure but is unable to stop Blackfield from assaulting the space facilities. The novel ends in a cliffhanger: as the new Builders vessel has established another space elevator in South America, the characters escape from the Nightcliff coup by relocating some space stations to the new elevator, where they find things are very different. =The Exodus Towers= Skyler and Tania have managed to build a colony around the new space elevator in Brazil, but things are far from over. They are soon attacked by a group of soldiers who are also immune to the plague and bent on taking over. Things are made worse by the existence of a new group of plague-infected humans who are enhanced by strange alien technology and by the presence of a religious cult back in Darwin, Australia. =The Plague Forge= In the third book Skyler must try to find a set of strange keys left behind by the aliens, all of which are spread throughout the world. In Africa, Skyler manages to find several strange artifacts as well as many humans warped by the plague. Throughout this Skyler continues to question: what is the purpose of the aliens, and why they have done all that they did? Development Prior to writing the trilogy Hough was greatly influenced by Joss Whedon's television series Firefly; Hough had enjoyed the show during its limited run, and the show's cancellation made him to want to write books with a similar theme. Hough did not immediately begin writing the trilogy, as he felt \\"in novel form the genre had largely alienated all but the hard-SF reader\\". He began writing after reading John Scalzi's Old Man's War (2005), which he stated showed him that the literary genre still had potential. While writing Hough tried to create a world that was \\"equal parts The Stand and 2001\\" that would be accessible to all readers. He chose set the trilogy in Darwin, Australia, as he \\"needed a location near the equator, because otherwise a space elevator doesn‚Äôt work\\", and because the location had other things that appealed to him, such as the name's connotations and its melting pot-esque nature. Reception Critical reception for The Darwin Elevator has been predominantly positive, with positive reviews from such outlets as SF Signal and Locus Online. Alan Cheuse praised the book and compared it positively to older books in the same genre, such as Arthur C. Clarke's The Fountains of Paradise. Tor.com also had praise for the novel and commented that, although the book did not fully live up to the blurb's promise of its being \\"a novel with the genes of a Firefly episode mixed with a John Scalzi novel\\", its action sequences and Hough's development of the \\"alien mystery and the story's rising stakes\\" were extremely entertaining.

Review of the 2013 exhibition at the Art Space Gallery, London, with photographs of seven paintings. Biography Green Painting, 2007 Roy Oxlade was born in Tottenham, England to Emily and William Oxlade. He was educated at the Bromley School of Art and Goldsmiths in London, and was a student of David Bomberg for two years at the Borough Polytechnic. He received his PhD from the Royal College of Art. His PhD thesis was on David Bomberg and titled, Bomberg and the Borough: An Approach to Drawing. While studying at Goldsmiths, Oxlade met the painter, Rose Wylie, a fellow student, and they married in 1957. Roy Oxlade: Work from the 80s & 90s (2018), the first solo exhibition of Oxlade's work since his death, received critical acclaim and coverage in numerous publications including Frieze, ArtLyst and Mousse. In 2019, it was announced that Oxlade would be the subject of the inaugural exhibition at Hastings Contemporary, Hastings, United Kingdom. Paintings Oxlade is quoted in a 2013 exhibition review: \\"Painting to me is like a room of the imagination. It‚Äôs up to me what I do with it. I choose its size and its materials ‚Äì usually canvas and oil paint. At the beginning its relationships don‚Äôt amount to much ‚Äì it‚Äôs a rectangle in a jumble of art history I relate to. There would not be much fun in leaving the room empty, a passive ‚Äì one colour field ‚Äì a blank canvas. And entirely abstract forms place too many restrictions on dialogue. So I have put in some other stuff, some characters, some actors ‚Äì tables, pots, colours, easels, lamps, scribbles, figures and faces to interact with each other. I adjust the temperature, open the windows, shut the windows, throw things out, change the lighting.\\" In a written dialogue with the painter Marcus Reichert in 2003, Oxlade said: \\"Like poetry, painting‚Äôs got its own language of metaphor: I think of van Gogh‚Äôs The Night Caf√©, a bowl of flowers by Rousseau, many Matisses: the aubergines still life in Grenoble, Music, the Red Dessert. Matisse sometimes managed to achieve wonderfully direct drawing within his painting like he does with the box of pencils in the Red Studio. Aren‚Äôt these paintings modernism? A rich vein, you could call it metaphorical modernism; it makes the rest of painting, ancient and modern, so much framed tedium. They‚Äôre a hundred years old, but that‚Äôs not so long in the scale of things. Do they mark the end of what‚Äôs possible? Spengler? Gombrich? We don‚Äôt need them to remind us; it‚Äôs obvious that ‚Äòwe‚Äôve lost faith in our own culture‚Äô. The rush to abstraction was a diversion, the dismantling too fast; the dialogue dried up ‚Äì in abstraction there were no metaphors to make. Philip Guston made a defiant counter-attack but just now the language of painting seems to be foreign. But when cat-walk art has finally imploded perhaps there can be a fresh and essentially evaluative look at metaphorical modernism. That could initiate a continuation of representational painting.\\" Sisters Bath, 1995 In his essay of 2009, There's An Iceberg Up Ahead, Oxlade wrote: \\"Desperate measures for desperate times; what is the role of art at a time of global emergency? Art‚Äôs first response must be to release itself from its old myths. For centuries art has been so closely tied to the prevailing ideology that any need to adjust our way of life in a way that will make a difference to the planet‚Äôs current problems will mean that art too must rethink its position fundamentally. Art History is the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô art history and as such it stands monumentally as the custodian of the iconography of our mercantile past, itself currently on trial. The store rooms of our art galleries and museums bulge with artefacts illustrating the evolution not only of realist art but also the story it tells of unworthy heroes and their inglorious lives. Certainly, the history of art is sprinkled with outstanding exceptions, where art escapes from social conformity, and the great value and significance of those exceptions must not be overlooked. Yet, if these are indeed desperate times should we not be considering how much of it should go? Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Titian, Velazquez ‚Äì even the greatest are all deeply implicated in a history of narcissism and literalism. Such art, because of an apparent brilliance which goes unquestioned, is especially dangerous when it provides the cultural underpinning of a society now in need of different support.\\" Personal Oxlade and Wylie's three children are Luke-John, Elizabeth, and Henrietta.

It was the last remaining large-scale resort hotel in Alabama from the late 19th century. The hotel burned to the ground after an electrical fire on March 1, 2014. History The hotel was built from 1884‚Äì87 by J. Frank Caldwell, a physician from Pennsylvania who had vacationed in the area. On the property are two springs, Mineral Springs and Beauty Springs. The hotel and town were named after the French resort town of Menton. The area gained in popularity among tourists in the 1890s, due largely to the cooler temperatures and scenery of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. In 1915 the hotel was renovated and an annex built, adding 27 rooms. Through the Great Depression to the 1970s, the hotel went into decline, saddled with debt and bouncing between owners. It ceased operating in 1950 and was later converted to a private residence and organ repair shop. See also: The hotel reopened in 2001, and underwent an extensive restoration in 2010‚Äì11. An antique store occupied the 1915 annex.

It premiered on February 21, 2013 in the U.S. Plot Leaving school after teaching, David Rosen is spooked when all the lights of the school turn off one by one, causing him to flee. Olivia meanwhile heads to her dinner with Jake who relocates from the restaurant to the Jefferson Memorial. While there Olivia quizzes him on Albatross, the case that Wendy was working on before she was murdered. Jake tells Olivia that the name Albatross is an inside joke in the intelligence community, a mysterious shadow figure used as a scapegoat whenever things go wrong. Olivia abruptly leaves their date to go to her offices where the team try to assess whether or not someone is really stalking David. The team decide that Huck will be assigned to protect him, but not before they notice that Huck has begun to smell and has stopped taking showers. Meanwhile, Jake leaves their date in order to go meet with Fitz who he knows from their time in the navy. It is revealed that Jake has been surveying Olivia at Fitz's personal request. He reports on her behaviour to Fitz despite having misgivings as to why he is watching her and does not reveal that he has been in contact with her and has taken her out on a date. The gladiators start work on Will Caldwell‚Äôs bid for governor of North Carolina. Caldwell, a member of a Republican political dynasty, is rumoured to be gay. Olivia tries to convince Will to become the first gay governor but after Will denies that he is gay he and his family decide to arrange a marriage for Will and the team begin scouting successful women as potential wives. After a meeting with one of the potential future wives goes well, Abby accosts the woman as she is leaving the office and warns her against being in a political marriage. Olivia is initially irritated by Abby's interference but lets it slide after Abby reminds Olivia that her own political marriage ended with violence and abuse. The hostage situation intensifies with Fitz feeling his hands are tied since there is a mole in his administration. After the terrorists holding the soldiers send in a tape of them murdering one of them to U.S. news networks, Cyrus suggests to Mellie that Fitz needs to send drones to Kashfar as a show of strength. Despite Mellie telling Cyrus that she will credit him with the suggestion she takes full credit for the idea herself. David goes back to work under the assumption that Huck is protecting him. However a rainstorm triggers memories of Huck's waterboarding, causing him to become immobile and have a panic attack. David is left to fend for himself and confronts his stalker who turns out to be Molly, Wendy's roommate who believes that David is innocent and that Wendy was murdered after a fight she had with a man who threatened her after learning about the intelligence she had. The Caldwells struggle with their choice of a runner-up but are impressed when they meet her. Olivia learns that Fitz will be present at the fundraiser dinner where the Caldwells plan to introduce the new arranged fianc√©. Olivia goes to Cyrus wanting to know why he didn't warn her about Fitz being at her work event and he reveals that he's been completely cut out of Fitz's circle and usurped by Mellie. Olivia tells him to simply wait for Mellie to overstep her bounds. The parents of the soldiers grow angry at Fitz and his administration believing that the bombings on Kashfar are endangering their children. Mellie decides to speak to them privately about the situation and Cyrus leaks the story. After discovering what Mellie has done Fitz begins to freeze her out while bring Cyrus back into the fold. Right before Olivia heads out to dinner she receives a call from Harrison that the story about the Caldwells' auditioning wives has been leaked. Harrison manages to shut the story down and Olivia realizes that the information was leaked by Marion Caldwell, Will's sister-in-law, and the two have been having an affair. Olivia urges Will to end the affair and put his career first. Later, Will‚Äôs older brother Peter reveals he‚Äôs known about the affair all along but has refused to confront Will as he didn't want Will to fight to be with Marion and jeopardize his career. Huck is finally able to decrypt Wendy‚Äôs flash drive and brings the information to Olivia. They find the names and information of the Kashfar hostages and realize that Albatross is the one who leaked their names to the terrorists. When they show Molly video images of the man who they think attacked Wendy, she instead identifies CIA director Osbourne, whose image happened to be playing on the TV at that exact moment. Production Costume designer Lyn Paolo chose a black and white Escada dress for Olivia to wear during the fundraiser dinner noting that \\"because Olivia‚Äôs life and loves are once again in turmoil, we have transitioned to a gown that is both black and white, feminine and romantic.\\" Reception =Critical Response= Vulture named Olivia Pope's Escada evening dress in their list of The 10 Best Outfits We Spotted on TV This Season.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, endemic to Clackamas County, Oregon. The flowers are white, pale blue or lilac, with a yellow or golden low dissected crest and pale green leaves. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to Iris cristata, except that it is taller and larger.British Iris Society (1997) It has small, slender, cord-like, rhizomes, which are 10‚Äì15 mm in diameter. They have brown scale-like leaves on top of the rhizome. The shallow rooted, creeping and spreading rhizomes,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees and H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) that create loose colonies around 30 cm wide. It has deciduous, narrow, pale green, or dark green, basal leaves. They are sword-shaped, they can grow up to between long and wide. They are fan-like, with brown membranous edges. The leaves are taller than the stems. It has slender, stems that can grow up to between tall. It has 2‚Äì3 branches. The pedicel (flower stalks) are 0.4‚Äì1 cm long but they do not carry the flower clear of spathes. The stems have several spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are long and 5 mm wide, and scarious (dry and membranous). The stems (and the branches) hold 1 flower (each branch), in late spring, between April and May. The flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of white, pale blue, or pale lilac.William Cullina It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The white or pale blue falls are oblong-spatulate, long, with violet, blue or purple veins. In the centre is a yellow signal area and a low yellow or golden crest with undissected ridge. The erect standards are oblanceolate-spatulate, shorter than the falls, and notched at tip. It has a 3 cm long, funnel-form perianth tube, triangular-acuminate stigmas and a 0.4‚Äì0.7 cm long, elliptical ovary. It has 1.8 cm long styles, that do not have notched lobes. In propagation, the pollen tubes of Iris tenax reach the Iris tenuis ovules in 30 hours, whereas the pollen tubes of Iris tenuis require 50 hours to reach the Iris tenax ovules.Verne Grant After the iris has flowered, it produces an globose, or ovoid seed capsule, which is long and 1.2 cm wide. Inside are 'D' shaped, pale brown, pitted seeds, with a whitish raphe (ridge). =Biochemistry= In 1956, a cytological (cell) study was carried out on various irises in the Californicae Section. Including Iris tenuis. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several time; 2n=28, Simonet in 1934, 2n=28, L.W. Lenz (Studies in Iris embryo culture, El Alsio 3 173‚Äì182 1956) and 2n=28, Smith & Clark in 1956. It has a published chromosome count of 2n=28.  Taxonomy It is pronounced as (Iris) EYE-ris (tenuis) TEN-yoo-iss. It is commonly known as Clackamas Iris.Tim Johnson The Latin specific epithet tenuis refers to the Latin for slender or thin. It was discovered in 1881, by Mr. L. F. Henderson, of Portland, Oregon, near a branch of the Clackamas River called 'Eagle Creek', about thirty miles from Portland. It was first published and described by Sereno Watson in (Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts) Vol.17 page380 in 1882. It was originally placed within the Californicae Series. In May, 1884, Mr. Henderson found iris specimen roots for the Cambridge Botanic Garden in the UK. But they did not survive the following winter in the British climate. Sereno Watson published another description of the iris in Garden and Forest Weekly, Volume 1 No. 1 on 29 February 1888, and in Vol.1 No.6 on 7 March 1888 with an illustration. A black and white Illustration and description appears in Volume 1 An Illustrated Flora of the Pacific States in 1923, and reprinted in 1940.Leroy Abrams The iris also appeared in Volume 4 on page313 in 1959. In 1937, R.C. Foster, was one of the first botanists to think that Iris tenuis is similar in form to Iris cristata. In 1956, F. H. Smith and Q. D. Clarkson noted, \\"It clearly does not belong in the subsection with the other members of the Californicae,\\". Due to the chromosome count of 2n=28, which is not similar to other Californicae series irises, who are normally counted as 2n=40. In 1958, Clarkson created a new subsection, the Oregonae, for it. Then in 1959, Lee W. Lenz moved it into the Lophiris section. It was also published in Rickett, Wild Flowers of the US, Vol.5 plate19 in 1971. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 28 August 2007. Iris tenuis is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to north western USA. =Range= It is found in the U.S. state of Oregon. Within the Cascade Mountains, in Clackamas County. Found along the Clackamas River, and Molalla river. =Habitat= It grows in the open wooded slopes, and along shaded stream banks. It is found underneath the Douglas fir (Pseutotsuga menziesii), and other shrub undergrowth in large colonies, in moist leafy soils. Conservation Iris tenuis along with Aster gormanii (now called Eucephalus gormanii), douglasia laeviagata var. laevigata, Isopyrum hallii, lilium washingtonianum, Pleuricospora fimbriolata and Sullivantia oregana are all sensitive species recorded with the Table Rock Wilderness in Oregon.United States Department of the Interior It grows in Mount Hood National Forest, Oregon. Cultivation It is cold hardy, but not heat or dry hardy. It is less hardy than other crested irises and is more difficult to establish in the UK. It is hardy to Europe Zone H2, and between USDA Zone 6 to Zone 9. It can grow in Marion, Multnomah, Josephine, and Washington. It prefers to grow in humus rich, (leafy) well drained soils,A. K. Singh and it is tolerant of soils that are mildly acidic to neutral. It is tolerant of sun or partial shaded positions, and it prefers to have some sun during the day to create flowers. It has average water needs, it prefers to have moisture during the growing season. If the plant is lifted up in summer or in the spring, and then re-planted in leafy soil in the shade, it will re-grow again. The plants should be planted cm apart. It can be found in most plant nurseries in the US. =Propagation= It can also be propagated by division or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. References Sources * FNA Editorial Committee. 1993‚Äì. Flora of North America. * Hitchcock, C. L. et al. 1955‚Äì1969.

The most recent barangays to be created are Fortune and Tumana, which in 2007 were separated from Barangay Parang and Barangay Concepcion Uno respectively. Barangka Barangka is named after the Spanish canyon, barranca. It is located along the western border of Marikina, is bordered on the west by Loyola Heights in Quezon City; to the south City; to the south by barangays Industrial Valley and Calumpang; to the east by Ta√±ong; and the north by Loyola Grand Villas. On its south portion lies the Marikina River where the Riverbanks Center is located. Barangka actually lies on the hills of Quezon City, not too far from the Marikina fault system. Along with former Parang and Nangka, the former sitio was elevated to barrio (now termed barangay) by virtue of Republic Act No. 2601, which was enacted on June 21, 1959. Barangka is surrounded by schools, shopping malls, industrial zones, and transport hubs. It is accessible to neighboring commercial and business areas. Calumpang Calumpang was named after a wild almond (Sterculia foetida). The largest among the barangays of Marikina during the colonial period, Calumpang was originally bordered on the northwest by the Marikina River and immediately opposite it are barangays Ta√±ong and Jesus de la Pe√±a. Floods and soil erosion would drastically alter its landscape, giving to shrinkage and expanding the two other barangays from silt buildup. Over time, part of the river dried up, giving way to what is known as Patay na Ilog, an area where Provident Village is now situated. To spare it from nature's threats, a dike was constructed in the early 1950s to secure the barangay. In the pre-war era, Calumpang's land extended as far west above the hills of Quezon City, which is a section of White Plains; on the north northwest, the Marikina River; on the east, Pasig City; and as far north as the boundaries of barangays Jesus dela Pe√±a, Ta√±ong, and Barangka. With the creation of Quezon City in 1939, its jurisdiction was altered. Although it remained a part of Marikina, its boundary on the west sector was reduced. The area from the chapel of San Antonio de Padua to the residence of Tayug family were added to the city. It was only after the war, through the effort of Rep. Emilio dela Paz, Sr., that it regained a portion of the disputed area that extended up to Usiw Hills, near Quezon City, which is now part of Industrial Valley. Later, when Industrial Valley was created into an independent barangay, its area of influence was again reduced. Concepcion I (Uno) Formerly known as the Bayan-Bayanan (little town), Barangay Concepcion, like the old Marikina area, was a rich agricultural area. Over time, though, new settlers found promise in its rich soil and migrants started to cultivate public lands, followed by the emergence of new communities. The barangay was officially named Concepcion after Mary the Immaculate Conception on June 16, 1956 with the enactment of Republic Act No. 1514. As an organized community, Marcelino de Guzman was installed as the first barangay leader in 1903 and held the post for five years. Concepcion II (Dos) The barangay was created under Presidential Decree No. 1488, which was signed by President Ferdinand Marcos on June 11, 1978, stipulating the territorial boundaries in 1978. Officially, Concepcion Dos is bounded on the north by barangay Marikina Heights; on the west by Barangay Concepcion Uno and Barangay Sto. Ni√±o; on the east by Antipolo City; and on the south by the municipality of Cainta. The first barangay election, held on July 4, 1978, elected lawyer Butch Crisol (1978‚Äì1980) as the first punong barangay. Fortune A former sitio of Barangay Parang, Fortune was constituted as a separate entity on April 10, 2007 by virtue of Republic Act No. 9431. The new barangay, was named after a cigarette company located in the area, is the youngest among the 16 barangays of Marikina. Officially, the barangay is bounded on the north by the centerline of Fortune Avenue; on the east and north by the centerline of the Nangka River; on the southeast by the Marikina-Antipolo boundary until it intersects the centerline of Nangka River; on the southeast by the Marikina- Antipolo boundary until it intersects the centerline of Nangka River; on the west by the centerline of Park 8 Creek; on the west by the centerline of F. Balagtas Street; on the southwest by the centerline of Tanguile Street; and on the southwest between one depth along Monserrat Hill Street, La Milagrosa subdivision, until it intersects the Marikina-Antipolo boundary. The city mayor appointed the barangay's first set of officials after a plebiscite was held ratifying Fortune's creation Industrial Valley Complex Barangay Industrial Valley Complex was created under Batas Pambansa Bilang 203, approved by the unicameral legislature on March 25, 1982. The law is an offshoot of Pambansang Batas Bilang 1755. Under the law, the barangay was separated from Calumpang to form an independent barangay known as Barangay Industrial Valley. The new sub-territory would be legally be defined as follows: ‚ÄúBeginning from the intersection of Marikina Diversion Road and A. Bonifacio Avenue thence southward along the centerline of Marikina Diversion Road, until it intersects the centerline of Marikina River; thence southwest along the common boundary line of the municipality of Marikina and municipality of Pasig, province of Rizal, until it intersects the common boundary line of the municipality of Pasig and Quezon City; thence northward bounded by Quezon City until it intersects the point of beginning.‚Äù The first set of barangay officials was appointed by the President until their successors had been elected. The Industrial Valley Complex includes the underground wastewater treatment facility, the Olandes Sewage Treatment Plant, which can process up to 10 million liters per day of domestic wastewater from 40,000 residents in the surrounding communities. Jesus Dela Pe√±a The eldest Christian settlement in the city, the barangay was named after the first Augustinian parish of Jesus dela Pe√±a (Jesus of the Rocks). It derived its identity after a Christ-like image was seen on the rock formations in the area. Aside from being host to Marikina's oldest church, the Jesus dela Pena Chapel which held its first mass in 1630, the place is also acknowledged as the traditional site of the first Holy Mass that was officiated in Marikina. In early colonial times, Jesus dela Pe√±a was known as ‚ÄúNiyugan‚Äù (from niyog) because of the coconut plantations that dotted its agricultural landscape. With the arrival of the Jesuits, wheat from Mexico was introduced, earning another name for the place, the Tirriguhan, which is derivative of the Spanish ‚Äútrigo‚Äù for wheat. Toward the latter part of colonial rule, influenced in part by the growing literacy among residents, alternative livelihoods, foremost of which was the shoe-making business, started to make a mark. The American Occupation greatly helped in developing the barangay. Health and educational infrastructure was introduced, while homespun industries became popular. In the years leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth, progress became more obvious. Marikina Bridge, a vital economic link to cities like Quezon and Manila, was formally opened in 1934. Under the Japanese rule, Jesus dela Pe√±a, like many other areas in Marikina, was hit hard by atrocities. The Kempetai police, in particular, killed everyone who was suspected of spying for the Americans. The place was in ruins as a result of the indiscriminate bombings by the Allied Forces and invaders. Although devastated, Barangay Jesus dela Pe√±a picked up the pieces and reassumed its role as the town's shoe capital. Today, it ranks as one of the city's most progressive business addresses. Malanday Malanday was named after the shape of its territory, round and flat, just like that of a bilao (winnower). Malanday is bounded on the northeast by Barangay Concepcion, while to its southeast sector is Barangay Sto. Ni√±o. On the southwest is Barangay Jesus dela Pe√±a, and on the northwest is Quezon City. Mainly an agricultural area, Malanday was originally an uncultivated grassland that formed part of a rural community that would be known later for its rice field. To reach the place, pioneers had to transport and deliver commodities using the carabao-drawn , given its ease in negotiating mud tracks. For Malanday residents, 1937 holds a special significance ‚Äì it was the year they were released from the bondage of paying land taxes to the Tuasons, owner of most of the lands in Marikina. As a result, petitions for transfer of land ownership were filed. In response, the government bought a big portion of a vast estate and distributed it to occupants, requiring only the beneficiaries to pay a nominal amount for every square meter of land owned over a period of one decade. This development would give rise to the founding of Barangay Malanday. Marikina Heights During World War II, Barangay Marikina Heights was a vital military defense location. The Japanese built tunnels in the area to stage ambuscades, hide ammunition, store provisions, or seek shelter. The underground subway notably made it easy for the Japanese to reach their airfields known among residents as the Paliparan (airport). In post-war times, it was also the military training ground for Filipino soldiers who were deployed to the Korean War. The initial effort to create the area into a barangay was made on June 6, 1974 through the advice of the municipal council, by virtue of Resolution No. 76, which was later submitted to the provincial board of Rizal for action. In response, Provincial Resolution No. 75-746 was passed, recommending the creation of Marikina Heights to President Marcos. On April 2, 1978, Presidential Decree 1489 was issued, formally creating the new barangay. Nangka Situated at the northernmost sector of Marikina along the concrete highway that leads to the towns of San Mateo and Montalban (Rizal), Barangay Nangka was the most rural among the city's barangays. It started as a small settlement built by two pioneering families and later evolved into a flourishing community largely due to a river, which is the barangay's namesake, that bilaterally cuts through Marikina and San Mateo, in Rizal Province. Named after the jackfruit, Barangay Nangka was created under RA 260, which was approved by Congress on June 21, 1959. It is situated on an elevated section of the southeastern part of Marikina and traverses the road that leads from the city to the towns of San Mateo and Montalban (now Rodiguez) in Rizal Province, where it shares common boundaries with Nangka River. It stretches up to sitio Balubad and the old railroad tracks known as Daang Bakal, and has an area of 181.68 hectares. During colonial times, the area was home to rice fields and sugarcane plantations. Nangka was a thriving agricultural hub before it yielded to urban incursion; it was a primary source for root crops, vegetables, and rice. Conversion of farms into housing patches and the rise of commercial establishments eventually transformed the place into a population center and economic hub. Parang Before 1880, Parang, a sprawling estate of forest, farm, plains and low-lying regions, was part of Barrio Bayan-Bayanan. Initially, only 25 families, mostly orchard farmers, settled in the area. It was host to small sugar cane plantations and home to a forest area that was a good source of lumber, fruits, and wild life. When the railroad system reached its vicinity, specifically in the area between the sitio and its mother barangay, transport of farm products to Manila became easier. The legacy of this once-productive era can still be gleaned from the ‚ÄúDaang Bakal‚Äù tradition the place continues to remember. The arrival of the Americans at the turn of the 20th century would have a long-term impact on Parang (Tagalog for ‚Äúthicket‚Äù or ‚Äúbush‚Äù). Sugar cane plantation would give way to the cultivation of undergrowths, which in turn were developed as grazing farms for cattle, carabaos, and deer. This development, which made sprawling lands into grazing areas, would eventually give the place its name. Later, warehouses for stacking of fodders and serving as garage for tractors were built in the district. Coconuts, which were easy to cultivate and required lesser effort on the part of farmers, were introduced, slowly transforming the landscape of the place. Parang, given its dense forest, became a secure hangar for Japanese planes, and it was also made into a shelter for fleeing Imperial soldiers who were pursued by Allied Forces from Manila. But through it all, the barangay at once recovered from the travails of the conflict. Projects like houses started to make headway in the area and new shoe factories such as Eduardson Shoe Factory were opened. San Roque Named after a saint, Barangay San Roque was a forestal region before the colonizers founded settlements here. Early migrants, encouraged by the opening of agricultural tracts following the arrival of missionaries, built communities, among them Daang Cainta. Two of the pioneering settlers in the area were the families of Don Isabelo Mendoza, a former gobernadorcillo, and Gervacio Carlos, later a stalwart in the shoe industry. Geographically, San Roque is bounded in the east by the Sierra Madre mountains; on the north, by Sta. Elena; to the south is Calumpang; and on the western sector, by the Marikina River. San Roque is known for its landmarks. The old residence of Apolonia Santos (Maestrang Oniang) was formerly a civil guard headquarters, cuartel, in the last decade of Spanish rule. During the American era, it housed the old Roosevelt High School. It used to be a church property but the Spaniards abandoned it just as the Revolution of 1896 started to gain momentum. Fray Rafael, the building administrator, sold the building to the government, which in turn was sold to Captain Itoy, Santos‚Äô grandfather, before the Americans arrived. Santa Elena Sta. Elena got its name from a cross-shaped driftwood that was found floating in the river. The barangay traces it beginnings to 1687 when the Jesuits stationed at the Jesus de la Pe√±a mission were looking for a new church site. The settlement was then a rural community of contented folk who survived from the fruits of their farms and depended on fish from the nearby Marikina River. Over time, the rural community flourished, becoming the poblacion of what now is Marikina City. Although it had progressed very well, it also had its share of tragedies. In 1825 and 1880, strong tremors rocked the place. Another catastrophe occurred in 1887 when a fire burned down the flourishing neighborhood. A similar calamity took place in 1974 in which numerous laborers were lethally trapped inside the workplace. In World War II, like most of the barangays of the city, Sta. Elena also had its share of devastation from bombing runs. Santo Ni√±o Oral tradition traces the barangay's origin to 1667 when the Jesuits crossed Marikina River from Jesus dela Pe√±a in search of a place where a new church could be built and a mission established. The missionaries found a rustic area known as Halang, so named after the orientation of the place, which is perpendicular to the rising sun. The place was later dedicated to the Holy Child or Sto. Ni√±o, after whom it was named. In colonial times, Barangay Sto. Ni√±o was bounded on the north by Malanday, on the east by Apongao, Cupang, and Mayamot, on the south by Sta. Elena, and the west by the Marikina River. Originally, the river had its bank along J.P. Rizal Street but geologic movement, flash floods, and siltation eventually led to the formation of a fertile area known as Tumana. In 1903, Sto. Ni√±o hosted the first Aglipayan Chapel that was built in a location adjacent to Marikina Bridge. Unfortunately, the structure was destroyed in World War II. A new house of worship was later built in another location but a large fire gutted it in 1908. Ta√±ong Ta√±ong traces its origin to March 1898 when pioneering families decided to formally establish a community. Like many rural communities in colonial Philippines, it had its formal beginnings during the period when missionary work was pervasive in areas with existing settlements and in places near river sources. During the Spanish rule, Ta√±ong was populated by migrants from nearby Balara and Krus na Ligas (Gulod) areas. The area was not just a favorite hunting ground for individuals who were considered fugitives by the colonial regime; it was also an impoverished community that was subjected to many abuses of the civil guards. Life, however, was better under the American rule. New developments were introduced and living conditions improved. The eruption of war derailed all these inroads. But with Liberation, life in the barrio started to show promise with the influx of new arrivals, some of whom have permanently settled in an area aptly called, Halo-halo (hodgepodge). Tumana A former sitio of Concepcion Uno, Barangay Tumana was created on April 10, 2007, under Republic Act No. 9432. It is the youngest among the sub-territories in the city. The place has been geologically shaped by soil buildup resulting from flooding, erosion, and landslide. Part of the barangay was a component of the riverbank but it has been converted into a fertile land. Over the centuries, the accretion has been cultivated as rice fields and fruit farms.

Stulberg (17 December 1923 ‚Äì 12 October 2000) was a Canadian-born film executive and lawyer, best known for a long stint as president and chief operating officer of 20th Century Fox and Cinema Center Films and PolyGram Pictures.Gordon Stulberg obituary at Los Angeles Times Early life and education Stulberg was born to a Jewish family in Toronto, the son of a labor organizer. He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Toronto and a J.D. from Cornell University before moving to Los Angeles. He became a naturalized citizen of the US in 1951. Career After school, he worked in entertainment law with the firm Pacht, Ross, Warne & Bernhard and represented among others the Writers Guild of America. In the 1954 writers strike he served as chief counsel and negotiator for the guild helping to establish the concept of \\"separation of rights and residuals\\" which ensured that all writers would receive payment for their work regardless of the format in which it was used, be it in plays, radio, television, film, or simply for sales promotion. In 1956, Stulberg joined Columbia Pictures as an executive assistant to Ben Kahane, second in charge to Harry Cohn, and worked his way up through the company, becoming in 1960, vice president and chief studio administrative officer. =Studio Head= In 1967, Stulberg was hired by CBS president William S. Paley to run CBS' new motion picture division, called Cinema Center Films where he oversaw 26 films including Little Big Man (1970) and The Boys in the Band (1971). In 1971, he was approached by 20th Century Fox to be president and chief operating officer when Fox's future was threatened by banks intending to call in their loans, which they offered to extend only if Stulberg were hired. He worked with chairman and CEO Dennis Stanhill. Stulberg worked to turn around the studio's financial performance. He had some notable successes and some failures as well but over all opinion on Stulberg's tenure was quite positive in light of his salvaging and reallocating misused funds, revamping the studio's sagging image, and his foresight in making such films as the epic classic Star Wars (1977) and cult favorites like Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Young Frankenstein (1974) and Sounder (1972). In 1974 Stulberg left Fox after differences with Stanhill and returned to practicing law at the entertainment law firm of Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp for five years. He returned to the film business in 1980 and became president of PolyGram Pictures making Endless Love (1981) and An American Werewolf in London (1981). He later became head of American Interative Media, chairman of the board of Philips Interactive Media of America and a director of Trimark Pictures. Personal life Stulberg was married to Helen (n√©e Applebaum) Stulberg (1925-2010). They had four children: Jac Stulberg (from Helen's first marriage), Sita Stulberg, Scott Stulberg and Lysienne \\"Lysa\\" Stulberg.Los Angeles Times: \\"Helen Stulberg Obituary\\" February 18, 2010 Stulberg died from complications related to diabetes.

He won the most votes in the first round of the election and but went on to lose to the incumbent Juan Manuel Santos Calder√≥n in the second round. Political career Zuluaga began his career in Acer√≠as de Colombia S.A., a steelmaking company owned by his family. Subsequently he became involved in local politics, serving on the municipal council of Pensilvania, Caldas and as its Mayor. After returning to the family business he became Vice President and President. During this time Zuluaga also served on the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic, Colombia's central bank, the National Federation of Merchants (Fenalco), the Federation of Metallurgical Industries of Colombia (Fedemetal), and the Colombo-Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce. In 2001 he became involved in √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez's presidential campaign. Zuluaga was elected to the Senate of Colombia in March 2002; Uribe was victorious in Presidential elections held two months later. As a Senator he backed the amendment to the Colombian Constitution permitting Presidential re-election. Along with many other supporters of Uribe, Zuluaga joined the Social Party of National Unity in 2005, led by Juan Manuel Santos. Zuluaga did not stand for election to the Senate in 2006 and was subsequently appointed the 68th Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia by Uribe. Zuluaga is suspected of colluding with certain paramilitary groups in the country. 2014 presidential election Zuluaga joined the newly formed Democratic Centre in 2013 and ran for its presidential nomination in the 2014 election against incumbent President Juan Manuel Santos Calder√≥n. He defeated former Vice President Francisco Santos Calder√≥n and former Interior Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo in the Democratic Center Convention. Zuluaga then chose Holmes as his running mate. Zuluaga, who was leading the polls a week before the election, became involved in a scandal after a video published by the news magazine Semana, showing Zuluaga getting secret military information from Andr√©s Fernando Sepulveda Ardila, who had been arrested on 5 May and accused of \\"managing an illegal office dedicated to intercepting emails from between those close to the peace dialogues in Havana (Cuba)\\", according to a news release published by the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia. In the video they discussed how to use this information to win the elections. Zuluaga quickly denied any role in the hacking scandal calling the video a manipulation and a montage, \\"this video, which was made illegally, which is clearly a montage and a trap; for whoever has listened to it and watched it carefully, there is no conversation or declaration that demonstrates illegal conduct,\\" he told reporters on Monday 19 May. But on 23 May, the Office of the Attorney General announced that the video was authentic and had not been doctored. It had been filmed by a campaign worker who told reporters he had become troubled by what he believed were illegal spying activities in the Zuluaga campaign. The scandal led Zuluaga's campaign manager, Luis Alfonso Hoyos Aristiz√°bal, to resign from the campaign after Colombian broadcaster RCN said that Hoyos and Sepulveda had offered it confidential information about the peace talks. Zuluaga accused Santos of orchestrating the scandal describing it as a trap set to derail his growing support, but Santos has not commented on the scandal itself. Enrique Pe√±alosa Londo√±o the Green Party candidate however, openly called for Zuluaga to resign, \\"we're talking about the crime of illegal wiretapping, conspiracy to commit a crime, and the crime of using military information and intelligence. We Colombians cannot resign ourselves to this. These are not the leaders we want\\", Pe√±alosa said. Former President Uribe came to the defence of Zuluaga stating \\"[Sep√∫lveda] is an alleged 'hacker' who has worked with [Venezuelan political strategist] J.J. Rend√≥n, who's close to President Santos. In the video, they show √ìscar Iv√°n Zuluaga getting information that has already been in the rumour mill and has no relevance\\". √ìscar Iv√°n Zuluaga is suspected of involvement in the corruption scandal Odebrecht. Personal life Zuluaga was born on 3 February 1959 in Pensilvania, Caldas to Ovidio Zuluaga and Carina Escobar. He attended the Pontifical Xavierian University where graduated in 1982 as an economist. He later attended University of Exeter in the United Kingdom where he earned an M.A. in Public Finance.

Life Charlotte Sophia Juliana, Baroness Marshal of Ostheim, was born in Saal an der Saale in 1761. She was characterized as neurotic in her youth. Career She married Major Heinrich Julius Alexander von Kalb on 25 October 1783. He was a veteran of France's involvement with the American War of Independence.Heinrich Julius Alexander von Kalb, waltershausen-grabfeld.de (in German), retrieved 17 March 2014 Charlotte von Kalb by Johann Heinrich Schmidt Her marriage was an unhappy one as her husband was devoted to his career and they only spent their winters together. She employed Friedrich H√∂lderlin, then a young poet, as a tutor for her son. She was also associated with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Von Kalb was more than just a socialite and was said to have been asked to pass on Goethe's ideas about the development of animals' skulls to Professor Johann Herder. The idea was that skulls developed from vertebrae, an idea that is now discredited. Friedrich Schiller had an affair with von Kalb in the 1780s after they met in Mannheim in 1784. Schiller was two years older than she and they were together for a number of years; there was talk of von Kalb divorcing and remarrying. Schiller is said to have based a number of his female characters on von Kalb. Eventually Schiller convinced himself that they needed to separate, but he needed help from his family and friends to extricate himself. Schiller married in 1790.\\"Friedrich Schiller\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, retrieved 17 March 2014 In 1796, von Kalb began her correspondence with Jean Paul. The primary interest was intellectual but Jean Paul was flattered and arranged to travel to Weimar to meet her in person. Even then their letters were initially cool, although Jean Paul was said to be \\"magnetic\\", and he admired not only von Kalb's eyes but also \\"her soul\\". Von Kalb's letters to Jean Paul were later published, containing their entreaties of love. Jean Paul was in two minds but he decided that she was \\"too titanic, too heroic\\". They did not marry as Jean Paul might have indicated. Von Kalb's marriage effectively ended in 1800 when she unofficially separated from her husband. His military career had ended and his financial position was poor. He shot himself in April 1806 in Munich. She died in Berlin in 1843. Von Kalb published no books in her lifetime. In 1851, some years after her death, Cornelia was published, and in 1879, over thirty years after her death, an incomplete autobiography was published titled Charlotte.Charlotte von Kalb, retrieved 16 March 2014 Von Kalb was judged unfavourably by women but she \\"fascinated nearly all the men she ever knew\\".

Growing out of the rise of slave patrols in the slave-owning southern United States, the song is about and follows an unnamed black man who attempts to run from a slave patrol and avoid capture. This folk song was released as a commercial recording several times, beginning in the 1920s, and it was included in the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave. History and documentation In the mid-19th century, black slaves were not allowed off their masters' plantations without a pass, for fear that they would rise against their white owners; such uprisings had occurred before, such as the one led by Nat Turner in 1831. However, it remained common for slaves to slip away from the plantations to visit friends elsewhere. If caught, running from the slave patrols was considered better than attempting to explain oneself and facing the whip. This social phenomenon led the slaves to create a variety of songs regarding the patrols and slaves' attempts to escape them. One such song is \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\", which was sung on plantations in much of the Southern United States. It is not certain when the song originated, although John A. Wyeth describes it as one of the oldest of the plantation songs, songs sung by slaves working on Southern plantations. Larry Birnbaum notes lyrical parallels in some versions to earlier songs, such as \\"Whar You Cum From\\", first published by J. B. Harper in 1846. According to Newman Ivey White, the earliest written documentation of \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\" dates to 1851, when a version was included in blackface minstrel Charlie White's White's Serenaders' Song Book. After the American Civil War, the song was documented more extensively. Joel Chandler Harris included a version of it in his Uncle Remus and His Friends (1892), and in 1915, E. C. Perrow included a version with his article \\"Songs and Rhymes from the South\\" in The Journal of American Folklore. Dorothy Scarborough and Ola Lee Gulledge, in their book On the Trail of Negro Folk-songs, included two versions, collected from two different states, and in his book American Negro Folk-Songs (1928), Newman White includes four different variations. Folklorist Alan Lomax recorded folk versions from at least two different sources, one in 1933 from a black prisoner named Moses Platt, and another in 1937 from a white fiddler named W. H. Stepp. Commercial recordings of the song began in the 1920s, many by white singers. In 1924, Fiddlin' John Carson recorded his version of the song. By the end of the decade at least another three recordings had been produced, by Uncle Dave Macon (1925), Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers (1927), and Dr. Humphrey Bate and His Possum Hunters (1928). In 2013 the song was used in 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen's film adaptation of the memoir by Solomon Northup. In the film, a white carpenter named John Tibeats (portrayed by Paul Dano) leads a group of slaves in a rendition of the song. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian described the scene as \\"nauseating\\", and Dana Stevens of Slate found it to be \\"hideous\\". Kristian Lin of the Fort Worth Weekly wrote that, though the song had initially been used by black slaves to encourage escapees and warn them of the dangers involved, when performed by the character of Tibeats it became a taunt, \\"like a prison guard who jingles the keys for the prisoners to hear, reminding them of what they don't have\\". Contents and versions Version recorded in Slave Songs of the United States (1867) Various versions of the song exist, though all focus on a (usually unnamed) black individual running away from, or to avoid, slave patrols (referred to as a \\"patter-rollers\\" or \\"patty-rollers\\" in the song). The White's Serenaders' Song Book version is presented as a narrative, with both sung and spoken parts. A slave, known as Mr. Bones, recounts the tale of his escape, interspersed with cries from the audience of \\"What, Mr. Bones?\\". In this version, the escapee is caught temporarily, but escapes at great speed after he \\"left my heel tied round de tree\\". Scarborough and Gulledge record a later version as follows: ::Run, nigger, run; de patter-roller catch you ::Run, nigger, run, it's almost day ::Run, nigger, run, de patter-roller catch you ::Run, nigger, run, and try to get away ::::Dis nigger run, he run his best ::::Stuck his head in a hornet's nest ::::Jumped de fence and run fru the paster ::::White man run, but nigger run faster Some versions of this song include events which occur to the slave during his escape. A version recorded in Louisiana, for instance, has the escapee losing his Sunday shoe while running, while another version has the black man lose his wedding shoe. In other versions, the runner is described as tearing his shirt in half. Still others have the runner point out another slave, one who is hiding behind a tree, in an effort to distract his pursuer. E.C. Perrow records the following verses, found in Virginia: ::Es I was runnin' through de fiel', ::A black snake caught me by de heel. ::::Run, nigger, run, de paterrol ketch yuh! ::::Run, nigger, run! It's almos' day! ::Run, nigger, run! I run my bes' ::Run my head in a hornet's nes'. ::::Run, nigger, run! Themes White finds parallels between \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\" and African-American spiritual songs, in which themes of a hunted person running, seeking a place of safety and asylum, were common. These themes, he writes, may be derived from the sermons of slavemasters and campfire songs sung by groups of slaves. White records one song from North Carolina with the refrain \\"Run, sinner, run, an' hunt you a hidin' place\\", repeated as in \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\". He likewise finds a \\"psychological connection\\" between this song and a spiritual often called \\"City of Refuge\\", which features the refrain ::They had to run, they had to run ::They had to run to the City of Refuge ::They had to run. The act of running itself is a common theme in slave literature and folklore, taking both literal and metaphorical forms. The ability for blacks to run faster than whites was considered of such importance that a common proverb of the time went \\"What you don' hab in yo' haid, yuh got ter' hab in yo' feet\\". Slave folksongs praised blacks for their running capabilities, comparing them to \\"a greasy streak o' lightning\\" or stating that one \\"ought to see that preacher [nigger, man] run\\". The black runner's ability to escape white pursuers is rarely in doubt, and consequentially the escape is ultimately successful. These conventions carried over, through the slave narrative genre, into written African-American literature.

It was created by a citizen of Funabashi with the objective of cheering up local residents and to help promote its hometown. It has subsequently appeared at events and festivals, as well as on numerous TV programs and commercials, gaining popularity around Japan. It has also issued 4 CD albums and 6 singles, DVDs, starred in its own anime series and live action drama special, headlined its own concert at Budokan and opened its own character goods store. While it remains an unofficial character, Funassyi is used frequently in official events for Chiba prefecture, the city of Funabashi and Japan itself due to its popularity and high name recognition.  Profile  Funassyi is neither a boy nor a girl, but a fairy. Its parents are ordinary pear trees. Funassyi is the fourth of their 274 children. Its birthday is July 4, and it is 1,881 years old as of 2019 (in a literal time frame, it was possibly born in the year AD 138). Its full name is , and its favorite food is peaches. The character is fond of heavy metal music, revealing that it bought Deep Purple's Machine Head as its first album, and is also fond of Aerosmith and Ozzy Osbourne.  Behavior  Generally, Japanese local mascot characters, known as or , move slowly and do not speak. Instead, they are usually accompanied by an attendant who speaks for them. Funassyi, however, always speaks for itself. It also often shrieks, jumps, dances and makes violent movements like headbanging. When it speaks, it usually ends its sentences with which sounds like the Japanese word for . The number 274 appears in a lot of Funassyi's material (e.g. as the number of siblings, on license plates, as a house number, as a team jersey number). Under the rules of Japanese number puns, one possible reading of this number is \\"fu-na-shi\\".  History The character was first created by a Funabashi citizen involved in retail trade in November 2011 as an illustration to advertise his business. A Twitter account was opened for it on November 21st. At first, the creator didn't intend to make Funassyi a physical reality, however, the number of followers on Twitter increased far more than he expected and Funassyi became very popular. He then decided to create the suit (kigurumi, in Japanese) of Funassyi. From April 7, 2012, videos were uploaded on YouTube. In July 2012, Funassyi visited the Funabashi City Office to have it authorized and supported officially, but this was rejected. On October 30, 2013, Funassyi was awarded a certificate for its contributions in promoting Funabashi all over Japan. However, the Funabashi Municipal Government, with the mutual consent of Funassyi, did not formally approve Funassyi as an official mascot of the city, since doing so might restrict Funassyi's activities. On November 27, 2013, Funassyi released its first CD single, collaborating with Toshihiko \\"Takamiy\\" Takamizawa of The Alfee, on the Far Eastern Tribe Records label. In June 2014, Funassyi was interviewed by CNN. In August 2014, Funassyi was taught how to pitch by Billy the Marlin, the official mascot of the American Miami Marlins baseball team. On December 17, 2014, Funassyi released a full CD Album, on Universal Music Japan's Universal Sigma label. On March 5, 2015, Funassyi held a press conference for the overseas media at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. On March 6, 2015 Funassyi opened its flagship store, Funassyiland, in the Lalaport Tokyo Bay shopping center in its hometown, Funabashi. A 2nd Funassyiland store opened in Umeda, Osaka in July 2015, and a 3rd store named Funassyiland Select opened in December 2015 in Harajuku, Tokyo inside the Kiddy Land store. A 4th store opened in April 2016 in Nagoya. An online Funassyiland store opened in November 2015. From March to September 2015, an animated version of Funassyi starred in its own short-anime series, , which aired every weekday during the Sukkiri! morning news and variety show on Nippon TV. The series has been released on DVD. On January 7, 2016, a life- action 2 hour drama starring Funassyi titled aired on Fuji TV. On August 23, 2016, Funassyi headlined a concert called Nassyi Fes at Budokan in Tokyo, drawing 12,000 fans. Nassyi Fes was also held on the 29th of the same month at Osaka-j≈ç Hall in Osaka.  Offshoot characters and imitations  Funassyi's \\"brother\\" , was introduced on October 15, 2014. Funagoro is the 56th brother of Funassyi. Funagoro is half-pear, half-caterpillar. The major difference between Funagoro and Funassyi is that Funagoro has a caterpillar tail that squirts silk thread. When Funagoro speaks, it usually ends the sentences with \\"nappi\\" („Å™„Å£„Å¥„Éº). Funassyi appears on the Tamagotchi 4U officially released by Bandai as a promotional touch spot character named \\"Funassyitchi\\". Along with the character, the package also includes a golden pear and an electric guitar. A number of characters \\"inspired\\" by Funassyi, some sanctioned and some not, have appeared on the past. Sanctioned characters include Funyassyi, created to promote the Shironeko Project game, and Akanassyi, a red version of the usually yellow Funassyi character that was created to promote a Gundam movie in 2015. As of 2016, Funagoro and Funyassyi appear frequently at Funassyiland stores and other events, with or without Funassyi. Speculation regarding income and revenue generated by the character There has been frequent speculation in the Japanese media regarding Funassyi's personal income, as well as the revenue he helps to generate for the city of Funabashi and Chiba prefecture. However, due to its unofficial status, it is a private enterprise and is not required to disclose any such figures. Funassyi has given various off-the-cuff answers to the question of how much it earns over the years, ranging from \\"274 yen per hour\\" to \\"1000 pears per hour\\".

SR 223 (1923‚Äì1926) SR 223 was a state route in southern Butler County that existed from 1923 until 1926. Beginning near Ross at SR 128, it traveled north through Millville before ending at SR 126 in McGonigle. Most of the route today is a part of US 27 however the southernmost mile (1.6 km) of the former route is now a township road as US 27 was moved onto an expressway. SR 223 (1927‚Äì1930) SR 223 was the designation for Perrysburg-Holland Road, near Holland, that had numerous route numbers during the road's time as a state highway. The SR 223 number was applied to the road connecting US 20 in Lucas County to SR 2 just south of Holland between 1927 and 1930. Prior to the 223 number, the road was known as SR 102 and after 1930, the road was called SR 283. Subsequently, for the last two years the road was part of the state highway system, the road was known as SR 326. SR 224 (1923‚Äì1933) SR 224 was a state highway that connected Hamilton to the Indiana state line near Fairhaven. The route existed from 1923 until 1933 when it was renumbered to SR 177 due to the addition of US 224 in the northern section of the state. SR 226 (1923‚Äì1927) SR 226 was a short state route in the vicinity of Minerva that existed from 1923 until 1927. The route was located north of the village and connected US 30 at its southern end with SR 80 at its northern end. After 1927, the road appeared on Ohio maps as an unnumbered state highway for three years before being deleted altogether. By 1980, the road became a state road again when SR 183 was moved off of its previous alignment on Market Street through Minerva to a new route along US 30. SR 227 SR 227 was a short connector between SR 9 and SR 151 west of Jewett, Harrison County. At the time SR 227 existed from 1923 until 1962, SR 151 traveled on a more winding route involving a grade crossing west of the village. SR 9 stayed south of the railroad tracks before entering the village. SR 227 was deleted when SR 151 was routed along a high-speed alignment involving the use of SR 9 south and west of Jewett thus negating the need for a state-maintained connector. SR 229 (1923‚Äì1924) SR 229 was a short connector between Colby and Bellevue that briefly existed in the 1920s. The route ran from SR 101 to SR 2 (now a part of US 20 and existed for two years. After 1924, the route became a part of SR 106. SR 229 (1925‚Äì1926) SR 229 was a short state route near the location of the 1923 routing of SR 229. Located in central Seneca County, the route connected Tiffin and Republic. Formerly a part of SR 106 until 1925, the route was fully asphalt-paved by 1926. By 1927, the entire route became a part of SR 18. SR 229 (1927‚Äì1929) SR 229 was the third short-lived state highway with this number in north- central Ohio. This incarnation of the designation ran from eastern Bellevue to the community of Strongs Ridge at SR 4 (within Lyme Township). The route existed from 1927 until 1929 when it was replaced by SR 59. SR 230 (1923‚Äì1957) SR 230 was a short connector route on the western side of Fremont. At a length of , the route connected SR 19 and US 6. The route existed from 1923 until 1957 when all state highways in the vicinity of Fremont were moved outside of the city. ;Major intersections SR 230 (1962‚Äì1971) SR 230 was the successor of SR 270 when it was renumbered due to the creation of I-270. The entire route was located in Perrysburg mostly within the area of the Fort Meigs State Memorial. At a length of , it was one of the shortest state highways in Ohio. The route connected SR 65 on the north side of the Fort to the foot of the Maumee-Perrysburg Bridge along US 20, US 23, and US 25. Around 1971, restoration of the Fort Meigs site resulted in the rerouting of SR 65 south of the park; this relocation also caused the abandonment of some parts of SR 230; the route was removed from the state highway system as a result of this. What remains of the route is now called Rapids Road. ;Major intersections SR 232 (1923‚Äì1928) SR 232 was a state route in Cuyahoga County that existed from 1923 until 1928. The route started at SR 3 (later US 42) east of Berea, traveled west into Berea, and headed north into Brook Park and ended in the Cleveland neighborhood of Kamms. In 1929, the route was removed from the state highway system but parts were added back to the system in 1935 as SR 237. SR 234 (1924‚Äì1929) SR 234 was a section of modern-day SR 93 that existed between 1924 and 1929. The route throughout its history ran between West Lafayette and Shanesville and also passed through Baltic. SR 234 was deleted by 1930 when SR 93 was extended south from its former terminus in Brewster. SR 234 (1930‚Äì1937) SR 234 was a state highway in Coshocton and Holmes Counties. The route when it was created in 1930 ran from SR 95 (later US 36 east of Warsaw to Killbuck at SR 19 (later US 62) paralleling the Killbuck Creek for its entire length. In 1932, the route was extended north of Killbuck to act as a connector from US 62 to the village of Glenmont. For the last year of its existence, the spur of SR 234 to Glenmont was removed and instead, SR 234 was routed on roads into northern Holmes County to end at SR 514 southwest of Shreve. The former route to Glenmont became SR 520. The entire route from US 36 to SR 514 became a part of the extended SR 77 by 1938. SR 237 (1924‚Äì1932) SR 237 was a state route entirely in Licking County in existence from 1924 until 1932. At a length of about , the route connected the villages of Buckeye Lake and Hebron. The route was removed after 1932 and is currently a part of SR 79. SR 238 SR 238 was a short connector between US 62 and SR 3 in Union Township and SR 38 in Bloomingburg, entirely in Fayette County. It was created in 1924 and remained unchanged until 2014. In that year, the portion of SR 38 south of Bloomingburg was turned over to county control; SR 38's southern terminus was then moved to the former intersection of SR 238 and US 62/SR 3 taking over SR 238 in its entirety. SR 240 (1924‚Äì1938) SR 240 was a state route in the Scioto River valley near Lucasville. The route existed from 1924 until 1938 and always consisted as a connector between SR 104 (from 1924 until 1926, also presently) or SR 112 (after 1927) and U.S. Route 23 in Ohio in Lucasville via a bridge over the river. The route became a part of SR 348 in 1939 though this specific bridge has since been removed. SR 240 (1948‚Äì1967) SR 240 was a spur from SR 163 to the entrance to East Harbor State Park near Marblehead. The state highway was created in 1948 along an unnumbered road and deleted after 1967 when SR 269 was extended north to the park's entrance. SR 242 SR 242 was a route near Versailles, Darke County. Signed in 1924, the route connected US 127 and SR 121 to the Darke County Airport. The route would remain unchanged until 2013 when after a proposal to extend a runway at the airport which would require the closing of a portion of the route, the Ohio Department of Transportation decided to abandon the entire route. The route is now Darke County Route 242 and township roads. SR 244 SR 244 was an L-shaped state route that existed from 1925 until 1961 and passed through the community of Newport, Washington County. The route is a former section of SR 7; SR 244 was created when SR 7 was routed on an alignment closer to the Ohio River. In 1961, the route was removed from the state highway system having been replaced by two county roads: CR 25 (Greene Street) is the former north-south section and CR 244 (Dana Road) is the former east-west portion. SR 245 (1925‚Äì1934) SR 245 was the designation for what is now SR 260 between the community of Bloomfield (within Ludlow Township) and Matamoras. The route was in existence from 1925 until 1934 and traveled between SR 26 and SR 7. SR 245 was deleted when SR 260 was extended on a previously-unnumbered road from Marr to Matamoras. SR 249 (1925‚Äì1926) SR 249 was a short route that provided a more direct route along SR 9 between Sherwood and Bryan. The route existed for two years in 1925 and 1926 and existed in the vicinity of Ney. After 1926, SR 9 was moved onto SR 249 and the route number was reused on the former SR 22 between Indiana and Ney. SR 250 (1925‚Äì1928) SR 250 was a state route in Holmes and Wayne Counties. During the route's first two years in existence starting in 1925, SR 250 started at the intersection of SR 3 and SR 179 near Lakeville and traveled northwest to Burnetts Corners, southwest of Wooster. For the next two years, SR 3 was moved onto this direct alignment and SR 250 was routed onto SR 3's former alignment. The end points of SR 250 remained the same, but SR 250 traveled east towards Shreve and traveled north to SR 3. In 1929, SR 250 was renumbered to SR 226 as US 250 was created in the state. SR 253 (1925‚Äì1957) SR 253 was a state highway entirely in Medina County. The route's western terminus had always been at Routes 18 and 57 near Mallet Creek. From 1925 until 1936, the route was a connector from Mallet Creek to US 42 (originally SR 3) in Medina Township. Afterwards from this point until the route's deletion in 1957, SR 253 was extended further east to SR 3 near Weymouth. Today, the entire route is now Medina County Road 70. SR 255 (1926) SR 255 was a state highway that existed for one year, 1926, and ran between Ada and Mount Cory. The route started at SR 69 in Ada and traveled due north past SR 3 and SR 103 before it ended at SR 6 in Mount Cory. After 1926, SR 69 was routed north along the entire route of SR 255. SR 255 (1927‚Äì1932) SR 255 was a state highway in Tuscarawas County. The route replaced part of SR 259 in 1927 and ran from downtown New Philadelphia and ran north to SR 8 near Reeds Run. By 1933, the entire route was deleted and the road on which it ran became a northern extension of SR 16. SR 256 (1926) SR 256 was the state-numbered route for Lewis Avenue north of the city limits of Toledo. The route was created along a previously-unnumbered road in 1926 and was replaced within one year by US 23. SR 262 SR 262 was a state route in western Crawford County. Throughout its nearly 40 years in existence, the route always traveled from the community of Osceola at US 30N to Texas Township, just south of the Seneca County line at SR 100. SR 262 was first signed in 1926 and was removed from the state system after 1967. Today, the entirety of the former state highway is now Crawford County Road 1. SR 263 (1926) SR 263 was a short-lived predecessor to SR 170 between East Liverpool and East Palestine. The route was created in 1926 but was resigned as an extension of SR 170 within one year of its designation. SR 263 (1926‚Äì1939) SR 263 was a highway from US 223 in Toledo west and north to US 223 in Sylvania. The route was designated in 1926 as a renumbering of part of SR 23 from Toledo to west of Toledo and part of SR 63 (which the remainder was replaced by US 20 and US 23) from west of Toledo to Sylvania. SR 263 was cancelled in 1939 and was replaced by SR 120. However, the section of SR 120 from Sylvania south was renumbered as SR 333 in 1946, but was decommissioned in 1962. This section is now Holland-Sylvania Road. SR 265 (1926) SR 265 was the predecessor to a section of SR 76 that existed in 1926. The route ran from SR 37 north of Beverly to SR 78 just outside Reinersville. Within one year, the entire route became a part of a southern extension of SR 76. SR 268 SR 268 was a state route between Bridgetown and Cheviot following Bridgetown Road. The route, created in 1928, existed until 1975 when the entire road was turned over to county and local control. SR 270 (1928‚Äì1962) SR 270 was a short state highway in the vicinity of Fort Meigs in Perrysburg. The route was one of the shortest routes in the state and connected SR 65 with the foot of the Maumee-Perrysburg Bridge along US 20, US 23, and US 25. In 1962, due to the construction of I-270 around Columbus, SR 270 was renumbered to SR 230.

In 1985, he purchased a Kurzweil K250 for use in the studio and reverse engineered it in order to develop and use sounds of his own design, establishing Surack as an expert within the K250 community. Sweetwater Sound was eventually selling K250 sound libraries and became established as a Kurzweil K250 reseller. Being part of the small professional K250 community allowed Surack to develop relationships and work with artists such as Kenny Rogers and Stevie Wonder.

History The theatre was built for vaudeville with a maximum capacity of nearly 4,000 by architect Thomas W. Lamb and hosted talent including Houdini. Following the demise of vaudeville, it was converted into a movie theater. From 1920 to 1927 the theatre was managed by Edward L. Hyman, a popular exhibitionist that attracted audiences with his elaborate musical productions. The theater was affiliated with Warner Brothers in the 1940s prior to its sale to Fabian Theaters in 1948. In 1953 it became Alfredo Salmaggi's opera company's home. It also spent time as a bowling alley and a print shop. Subsequent to that, it was gutted internally and converted into a glass factory when the city took it over due to tax foreclosure, which it remained until early in the 20th century when UrbanGlass moved in the late 1980s and BRIC followed suit in 1993. When a printing company that operated on the first floor left in the mid 1990s, UrbanGlass and BRIC began discussions of renovating the space.

With the exception of the type species, A. gaudryi, all species of Apterodon are known from Africa. It is closely related to the African Quasiapterodon, and, together with Dissopsalis, they comprise the hyaenodontid subfamily Apterodontinae. Uniquely among hyaenodontids, it was a semiaquatic, fossorial mammal. It possessed strong forelimbs that were well equipped for digging, compared to those of modern badgers, while the tail, torso and hindlimbs show adaptations similar to those of other aquatic mammals like otters and pinnipeds. The dentition was suited to feed on hard- shelled invertebrate prey, such as crustaceans and shellfish. It probably lived along African coastlines. Borths and Stevens (2017) described a new specimen of Apterodon macrognathus (among with other hyaenodonts) and concluded that the dental eruption of secondary dentition occurred much more slowly than in Carnivora.

It was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris. Plot Hector Loursat, attorney at law, lives with his daughter Nicole in a vast and shabby mansion in this provincial town. Their conversation with each other is limited, somehow holding the other one responsible for the situation: Hector Loursat used to be one of the great attorneys until his wife left him for another man eighteen years ago. He has been drinking ever since, and given up living altogether, intoxicated every night. Hector did not care much about his daughter, who was brought up by Fine, the old woman servant in the house. One night, gunshots are heard upstairs in the house and Hector spots a shadow running away. Hector goes upstairs with Nicole and finds a dead man lying on an old bed in the attic. The police arrives and investigates. Hector soon finds out his daughter has a kind of secret life with a band of young idle bourgeois from the town: they have regular meetings in the attic. The police soon finds out the dead man is called Gros Louis, with a criminal record. Nicole and her friends are being interrogated by the police. But how is Gros Louis linked to the group? They find out the band of young idle bourgeois have set up in between them a sort of pact, a theft competition which started by stealing a ballpoint or a lighter, and was amplified by boredom up to grand theft auto. They turned delinquants by ennui. The police also finds out that one of them, Emile, is Nicole's boyfriend. Did he kill Gros Louis by jealousy? Emile is suspected, and arrested. In jail, Emile asks Hector Loursat to be his attorney. Hector, scenting a miscarriage of justice, accepts to be his defense attorney. At the trial, the prosecution produces many witnesses of good faith, all bourgeois parents of good faith. Hector Loursat does not bulge, has no questions to asks the witnesses, doesn't seem to be there altogether, to the point where people, and his daughter among them, wonder, with awe, if he is not still drinking. But when finally Hector Loursat stands up and speaks, everyone is bewildered by his speech and strategy. First he does not want any defense witnesses, but wants all the prosecution witnesses to come back to the stand, and accuses all them of being responsible for the boredom of the town, responsible for the boredom and nonsense and stupid behavior of their young ones, then singles out that only one girl - his own daughter, Nicole - was in the group, and, by asking each of the young men, that every one of them was in love with her, except one, Luska. Hector Loursat soon proves Luska was the one most in love with Nicole, that he found out Emile was Nicole's boyfriend, and that he killed Gros Louis to have Emile accused, moved aside and framed. At this rate, Luska cracks up, and is arrested. Nicole falls into her father's arms.

Construction  = The Agreement = Ahmad Shobaki, Minister of Public Works of Jordan, meets RSEA officials An agreement was signed in Amman on October 24, 1974, between the Retired Servicemen Engineering Agency (RSEA) of Taiwan and the Jordanian government, under which a new \\"road to friendship\\" will be built in the southern part of the Hashemite Kingdom. Yen Hsiao-chang, RSEA director, and Ahmad Shobaki, Jordanian minister of public works, signed the agreement for the construction of the highway. Under the agreement, RSEA will build the highway in 30 months. Construction will start in three months. Carrying a price tag of US$14 million, the highway will open up new horizons in industrial and agricultural development in southern Jordan. = Preparation = Taiwan engineers and local labors at the site of sand dune was opened for the critical area of the road within three months. To expedite the program, engineering expertise from surveying to embankment were brought in from Taiwan as well. More than 150 pieces of equipment were used, including three Wabco 555 self-elevating scrapers, 10 Caterpillar bulldozers, 10 HINO dumping trucks, loaders, graders, water tanks, vibrating compactors and roller compactors, etc. = Safi-Aqaba Highway = Map of the Safi-Aqaba Highway and nearby locations The Safi-Aqaba Highway is a highway at Jordan side of the Jordan‚ÄìIsrael border. Totaling in length, it connects Safi, the south end of Dead Sea to Aqaba, the north point of Red Sea. RSEA started the project in 1974 and finished it 1977. Lo Chien- Ning, chief engineer, was assigned to oversee the engineering. All engineers, mechanics, operators‚Äî74 expatriates‚Äîwere selected from RSEA's job site at Taiwan (ROC), Africa, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. There are also over 200 local operators, laborers from Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Yemen, etc. The working schedule should follow Muslim's custom regarding the warship bell and festival of Ramadan and Hajj. There was rarely life of animals and plants along the construction route. During the construction, the engineering group and equipment were moved in from Aqaba to form a new town in the desert, the lowest place in the world. Crown Prince of Jordan visits the construction site Besides high temperatures over , the project had some challenges along the way. The Jordan‚ÄìIsrael border fence at was standing on the designed alignment. Lin Chi-Ko, manager of Jordan Project Office of RSEA, contacted Israel patrol at the fence and told them the fence need to be moved to meet the highway design. After the fence was moved, the surveyors continued to work through. Furthermore, at , Jordan Engineering Corps support had to clear some mines. And it was only safe to conduct construction within of the centerline of the alignment. Unfortunately, on June 17, 1975, an accident happened. The leader of surveying team of Jordan Public Works, along with two technicians and a driver were killed by a mine. \\"The Pavilion of Friendship\\", a landmark and symbol for the highway, was built as a present by Taiwan to Jordan. Even though the diplomatic relation was terminated eventually, the people from two countries continued working together to finish building the highway. Engineers and officials from Taiwan at the opening ceremony = Project passes over Wadi Arabah = Safi-Mazra'a Highway is in length. the embankment at the swampy region, and the rock at steep cliff area was exploded to use for the backfill. RSEA started the project in 1978 and finished it in 1979. During that time, RSEA also provided the equipment in the desert to Hyundai Engineering & Construction for housing units and to M&K; Construction Company for Arab Potash Company projects. Suweima-Zara Highway, in length, was built north of Mazra'a. RSEA started the project in 1979 and finished it in 1981. There is a gap along the Dead Sea between Mazra'a and Sweima. All heavy equipment was moved through King's Highway via Al Karak on crooked mountain roads over . And the Camp of Sweima was set face to face with the golden dome of Jerusalem across the Dead Sea. = Incomplete section by the Dead Sea = There was an incomplete section from Mazra'a to Zara. Part of the original scope of the project, this section is in length. The highway can range from a dirt road to a pavement and is intended to facilitate access by the Dead Sea. But the impact of the project was a dominant concern. Environment control, natural resource development, transportation facilities, tunnels, bridges and other structures are all among the factors taken into consideration. And it was decided that the project would be too expensive. = Completion = Later, the highway was constructed nevertheless as part of Jordan's 25-year plan to build an extensive road network which travels around the country. As of today, Highway 65 reaches far north in Jordan.  Two Seas Canal  The connection of the seas by canal was suggested in the mid 19th century by British officers who were thinking how to circumvent the Suez Canal. Later on at the end of the 19th century planners thought how to use the Jordan River water for irrigation and bring sea water to the Dead Sea to create energy from its position of below sea level. One of those planners was the Zionist leader Hertzel. The Red Sea Dead Sea conduit was proposed in the end of the 1960s and was analyzed as part of the peace process between Israel and Jordan. On May 9, 2005, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement to go ahead with a feasibility study for the Two Seas Canal. The agreement was signed on the Dead Sea by Jordanian Water Minister Raed Abu Soud, Israeli Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Palestinian Planning Minister Ghassan al-Khatib. In August 2013, Jordanian government announced that it would move ahead with the first phase of the project. On December 9, 2013, an agreement to build the pipeline was signed by Israel, Jordan and Palestine.

He also formed and founded the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of sound and vibration measurement equipment, systems and solutions, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r. Br√ºel was a close friend of Niels Bohr, and despite danger Br√ºel traveled from Sweden to Denmark during the German occupation with important documents of Bohr's work.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996.Mowry, and Borring (2012). The Journey to Greatness: the Story of Br√ºel & Kj√¶r. Acoustical Publications, Inc. . Br√ºel was fluent in Danish, German, English, Swedish, and spoke French and Italian.Mowry, and Borring (2012). The Journey to Greatness: the Story of Br√ºel & Kj√¶r. Acoustical Publications, Inc. . Br√ºel was a descendant of the Br√ºel branch of the German noble family, the von Br√ºhl family.  Early years  Br√ºel was born in Copenhagen as the eldest son to his family. Br√ºel's father was a forester, a tradition that he intended his son to continue. However, Br√ºel did not like the idea of becoming a forester, causing a family scandal. The family lived in the South of Jutland, away from schools and towns. When Br√ºel got older, he was sent away for \\"blacksmith\\" education, which then denoted a practical education in engineering. But he decided to attend university and reallocated to the technical university in Copenhagen. There Br√ºel pursued aerodynamics, electronics, and acoustics.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996.  Early career  At the Technical University of Denmark, Br√ºel started working on his Ph.D, which today would be equivalent to master of science, in 1932, and finished it in about five months. Br√ºel's mentor was P.O. Pedersen, a famous Danish engineer and physicist, and Br√ºel was handpicked by Pedersen to work with him. Br√ºel later described Pedersen as brilliant, but that he took credit for Br√ºel's and his other students' work.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996. In January 1939, Br√ºel was drafted into the Danish army to do the radio for the military for a year, and it was there he built his first instrument, a battery-operated, constant-percentage bandwidth analyzer. In the end of 1942, due to German occupation of Denmark, Br√ºel went to work in Sweden. He there went on to do important work in both Sweden and Finland, including constructing an acoustic lab at Chalmers University.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996.  BR√úEL & KJ√ÜR and the Second World War  NASA's Mars rover 'Curiosity' was tested using a Br√ºel and Kj√¶r LDS shaker system In 1942, Br√ºel started the company Br√ºel & Kj√¶r with his old friend Kj√¶r. The company experienced immediate growth, and they quickly expanded their sales throughout Scandinavia. However, due to WW2, they soon had shortage of copper. Luckily, Br√ºel had a good friend who was trying to cause problems for the Germans, and informed Br√ºel about Germans' thick communication cable from Copenhagen to Berlin that was in the sea, and together they picked it up, destroying Hitler's communication with his troops for some time.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996. In 1945, Holger Nielsen became a partner in the firm, for which he worked until his death in 1978. Despite the ongoing world war, Br√ºel managed to navigate his company and career to further success. In 1948, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r bought their first property, a wooden army barracks in N√¶rum, 15 km north of Copenhagen, which are the premises where the company's headquarter is still located today. Br√ºel was responsible for product planning and research. As long as the market was limited to Denmark and Sweden, Br√ºel initially delivered instruments to customers on his Nimbus motorcycle. He still has this original antique in the basement of his home. When the rest of Scandinavia and some parts of Europe joined the market, cars were needed. By the 1980s, there were about 30 company cars. In 1956, with customers in the rest of Europe and in some other parts of the world, \\"Br√ºel & Kj√¶r Airlines\\" was established. The company eventually maintained a substantial fleet of aircraft, including two Piper Aztecs and two Beechcraft King Airs. This made it possible for Br√ºel and other company pilots to make airborne deliveries directly to any customer that was located near a general aviation airport. The fleet also provided high-speed transportation, independent of the scheduled airlines, to employees and customers. When Br√ºel was flying as PIC (pilot in command), he would often appoint a nontrained employee to be a co-pilot on some of his trips. Br√ºel often blamed (in jest) these hapless individuals for doing a lousy piloting job. In the mid 80s, a number of employees were asked to get a pilot license to fly with Br√ºel due to concern with his advancing age. He subsequently solved this issue by hiring his flight instructor as his personal co-pilot. To the consternation of passengers, he was even older than Br√ºel Kj√¶r used a bicycle as primary transportation between home and work, while Br√ºel used a company aircraft for commuting to and from his summer house on Anholt Island. In regard to automobiles, Nielsen used a Jaguar while Br√ºel had a Fiat 500. When asked why he preferred the Fiat to the other more comfortable company cars, Br√ºel answered that the comfort in a Fiat 500 was so poor that he could keep the car for himself; nobody in the company would ever ask him for a lift.Svend Gade (2008):. \\"A Br√ºel and Kj√¶r History Lesson ‚Äì Short Version\\", Svend Gade, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r, N√¶rum, Denmark In 1953, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r was part of the first European corporation delegation into China.

When Br√ºel and Bohr both lived in Sweden during WW2, Br√ºel neglected apparent danger and flew to Denmark from time to time, carrying his friend Bohr's documents of his important work on quantum physics.Per Br√ºel: An Interview Conducted by Frederik Nebeker, Center for the History of Electrical Engineering, 18 July 1996.  Legacy  Br√ºel was instrumental in the construction of the level recorder, which would become one of the most successful products for his company Br√ºel & Kj√¶r. Br√ºel was a pioneering engineer within acoustics, and started one of the first companies focused on acoustics. He celebrated his 100th birthday in March 2015.

These artistic mediums include film, photography, drawings, paintings, and sculptures. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.  Research process, a definition and visual images  Images are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.  Participant generated visual methodologies  This method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions. = Photovoice = Caroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called photovoice. Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research. = Fotohistorias = Ricardo Gomez and Sara Vannini (Gomez, Ricardo & Vannini, Sara (2015). Fotohistorias: Participatory Photography and the Experience of Migration. CreateSpace, Bilingual: English & Spanish) introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people's perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context.http://www.fotohistorias.org = Photo- elicitation = The photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based on the \\"assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot.\\" Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for \\"bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched.\\" The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo- elicitation, Collier (1957, p. 858), argued that ‚Äòpictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews‚Äô and noted the technique's ‚Äòcompelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant‚Äôs life‚Äô. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)Mannay, D. 2016 Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods Application, reflection and ethics. Abingdon: Routledge. = Film-elicitation = This technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world. Making a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. This technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. Making films ‚Äì to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types: 1.Documenting or filming the subjects 2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion 3.Asking the subjects to make a film There are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: 1\\\\. the analytical approach taken towards film or video. 2\\\\. method employed to derive data. 3\\\\. the kind of issue being analysed. = Benefits and limitations = This methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be illiterate or have difficulty communicating because of language barriers, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)Mannay, D. 2010. Making the familiar strange: Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?. Qualitative Research 10(1), pp. 91-111 The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds. Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).Mannay, D. 2014. Story telling beyond the academy: exploring roles, responsibilities and regulations in the Open Access dissemination of research outputs and visual data. The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 54, pp. 109-116.  Ethical warnings  = Deception or manipulation = These are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity. This includes assuming a false identity such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions. = Observing and objectifying people by looking covertly from a distance = These activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via webcam). = Intimate or detailed observations of personal places or behavior = This category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti. = Possibility of causing discomfort or concern = This is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‚Äòthe right‚Äô to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‚Äòvoice‚Äô.

The building was originally planned to be tall. However, in late 2018, the naming rights (Salesforce Tower Chicago) were sold for a redesigned shorter tower of . Background Map depicting Wolf Point (area owned by the Kennedy family in black, with approximate area of the historical Wolf Point settlement in red)On January 26, 2012, the Chicago Sun-Times broke the story that the Kennedy family was planning a three-tower development at Wolf Point. On May 8, 2012, Chicago Alderman Brendan Reilly announced that a three-tower proposal for Wolf Point had been made including buildings of approximately , and and that plans would be made public on May 29. The South Tower would be the tallest of these buildings. Location The site of Wolf Point South Tower in March 2014 The property upon which the development was planned is historic and drew scrutiny by critics. Plans for the tower development were presented as scheduled by the Kennedy family on land that they own in the River North neighborhood at the confluence of South, North, and Main Branches of the Chicago River southwest of the Merchandise Mart complex. As plans for the Kennedy proposal were developing on the north bank of Wolf Point, a plan for a 45- to 50-story office building on the west bank called River Point were progressing according to Robert Sharoff of The New York Times. Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prize- winning architecture critic Blair Kamin felt that the initial plans presented by Christopher G. Kennedy needed some work. History West Tower under construction On October 30, 2012, a revised plan was presented that included more open space. In November the responses to the revisions were negative, and Reilly withdrew the proposal on November 27. The Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the entire three-tower development that included 1,410 residential units, 450 hotel rooms and 1,285 parking stalls on January 24, 2013. In May 2013, opponents of the planned development filed suit in United States Federal Court. On November 19, 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve ruled that the valuable and iconic views of downtown are not something that can be constitutionally protected saying \\"Illinois courts do not recognize property values, air, or light as constitutionally protected property interests.\\" The Wolf Point Towers broke ground in March 2014. Neighboring Wolf Point West Tower had its groundbreaking ceremony on July 18, 2014. The building opened for residence on January 13, 2016. In July 2015, a rumor emerged that the South Tower might exceed based on revised renderings. However, October 2016 plans showed the building had been scaled back to . On November 30, 2018, Salesforce committed to a 17-year $475 million lease in the tower commencing in 2023. The lease included naming rights for redesigned building to be named Salesforce Tower Chicago with a reduced height of . On April 2, 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic slowdown that jeopardized construction projects around the world, the project secured a $500 million-plus construction loan and construction commenced within 2 days.

April 1704? ‚Äì 21 August 1767) was an English publisher and bookseller noted for his association with author Samuel Johnson and his purchase of the library of Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford. Early life His father, also named Thomas Osborne, was a bookseller and stationer based in Gray's Inn, London. Osborne himself was probably the Thomas Osborne, son of Thomas and Brilliana Osborne, who was baptised on 13 April 1704 in the church of St Andrew's in Holborn. Osborne probably took up a major role in his father's business sometime before 1728, when he was made a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers. In 1729, the firm also issued its first catalogue, a practice for which Osborne would become famous. Osborne the elder died in 1744, leaving the business and several properties to his son. Career Osborne was well known for buying large libraries and offering the books for sale at fixed prices listed in catalogues. Most famously, after Edward Harley's death in 1741, Osborne purchased for ¬£13,000 the extensive collection that had been assembled by Harley and his father, Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (Harley's collection of manuscripts was purchased by the British government and remains in the British Library as the Harleian Collection). Osborne hired William Oldys, who had been Edward Harley's literary secretary, and Samuel Johnson to compile a catalogue of the collection, which eventually ran to five volumes published from November 1742 to April 1745 under the name Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae. Osborne sold the first two volumes of the catalogue for ten shillings, which created enough irritation among his customers that he announced in the third edition that the price of the catalogue could be either applied to the purchase of a book from the collection or refunded. Oldys and Johnson also compiled for Osborne The Harleian Miscellany, an eight-volume selection of 16th- and 17th-century political and religious pamphlets, which was published from 1744 to 1746. Harley's collection included a copy of William Tyndale's 1526 translation of the New Testament, the first complete version to be published in English. Osborne sold it for 15 shillings; in 1994, the British Museum bought the copy, one of only two surviving, for more than ¬£1 million. Beginning in 1748, Osborne made forays into the business of exporting books to British American destinations such as Williamsburg. Many of these were likely \\"rum books\\" which would not have sold in the London market. Osborne, along with Mary Cooper, Ralph Griffiths, and John Baldwin, was one of the major publishers of works by the prolific writer and botanist John Hill. In an era when royalties for authors were virtually unknown, Hill's contracts with Osborne entitled him to periodic payments if the books whose copyright he assigned to Osborne sold unexpectedly well. Osborne also took part in the Battle of the Booksellers, a prolonged effort by London publishers to win perpetual copyright protections. In 1765, he and publisher Andrew Millar sued Alexander Donaldson in the Court of Chancery over Donaldson's reprinting of books whose protection under the Statute of Anne had lapsed, maintaining that the works were protected in perpetuity by a common law copyright. In the cases, Osborne v. Donaldson and Millar v. Donaldson, Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington ruled in favour of Donaldson and against common law copyright. Henley proposed that the case be brought before the House of Lords, but Osborne and Millar refused, fearing a decisive rejection of their position. In 1754, Osborne purchased a country house in Hampstead. A Chinese-style hand fan commemorating a party he held on 10 September to mark the purchase survives in a collection donated by Charlotte Guest to the British Museum. Osborne's influence was not limited to London. He served as a primary supplier of English-language books to the nascent University of G√∂ttingen, which had embarked on a major book-buying campaign in the decades after its founding in 1734 and had by 1800 accumulated around 17,000 English works. His large catalogues of the 1760s circulated around the literary capitals of continental Europe; philosopher Christian August Wichmann consulted one while researching his 1788 translation of John Cary's Essay on the State of England's Trade. Reputation and legacy Osborne was sometimes mocked for his supposed short stature, ignorance, and abrasive manner. According to one often-repeated story, Osborne once visited Samuel Johnson to complain about his slowness in compiling the either Harleian catalogue or The Harleian Miscellany‚Äîirritating Johnson enough that he knocked Osborne to the floor. The event seems to have taken place around 1742, but its first known mention came about thirty years later, in a 1773 article in The London Packet. The article described an incident where writer Oliver Goldsmith had attacked bookseller Thomas Evans, publisher of The Packet, and mockingly contrasted Goldsmith's defeat with Johnson's supposed victory against Osborne.O. M. Brack, \\"Samuel Johnson, Thomas Osborne, and the Folio: The Incident Revisited', Johnsonian News Letter, 59:2 (September 2008): 18‚Äì24. Punctuation modernized in quote. Around 1777, Hester Lynch Thrale wrote in her diary: \\"I asked [Johnson] the other day about his combat with that Osborne, how much of the story was true: 'It was true,' said he 'that I beat the fellow, and that was all; but the world so hated poor Osborne that they have never done multiplying the blows and increasing the weight of them for twenty years together.' \\" Many retellings of the story mention that Johnson used a heavy folio as a weapon, but this detail is absent from the earliest accounts, including the 1773 Packet article, Thrale's diary entry, and a passage in James Boswell's 1791 Life of Samuel Johnson, based on Boswell's direct conversation with Johnson. Alexander Pope mocked Osborne in the 1743 edition of The Dunciad, where Osborne takes the place of a character, called \\"Chetwood\\" or \\"Chapman\\" in previous editions, who loses a urinating contest for the love of novelist Eliza Haywood. Osborne had apparently angered Pope by deceptively selling remaindered copies of his translation of the Iliad. Osborne earned his share of praise as well; Thomas Dibdin, writing decades after Osborne's death in his Bibliomania (1809), called him \\"the most celebrated bookseller of his day.\\" Some of this negative reputation has persisted until the present: in a 1997 article, Robert DeMaria Jr. of Vassar College called him \\"relatively crude and rapacious\\", while Peter Martin described him as \\"tasteless and ill-mannered\\" in a 2008 biography of Johnson. In 2004, O. M. Brack gave a more undecided evaluation in Osborne's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: > However, to assess Osborne's character properly is difficult. His undoubted > success as a bookseller provoked an adverse reaction from other members of > the trade who were eager to see his power and influence diminished. Most of > the negative comments that have survived can be traced to Pope and Johnson. > To be singled out by Pope is no distinction as the list of his satiric > victims is extensive, while Johnson, whose lack of social skills is well > documented, is a strange source for Osborne's failures in this regard. After his death on 21 August 1767, Osborne was buried in the cemetery of St Mary's Church in Islington. His will divided his possessions among his wife, Anne; his brother-in-law William Smith; and his nephew William Toll.

The application provides a free alternative to subscription-based video streaming services such as Netflix. Popcorn Time uses sequential downloading to stream video listed by several torrent websites, and third party trackers can also be added manually. The legality of the software depends on the jurisdiction. Following its creation, Popcorn Time quickly received positive media attention, with some comparing the app to Netflix for its ease of use. After this increase in popularity, the program was abruptly taken down by its original developers on March 14, 2014, due to pressure from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Since then, the program has been forked several times with several other development teams such as Time4Popcorn and the Butter Project to maintain the program and produce new features. Time4Popcorn reportedly gained millions of users within four months of launching in 2014 and became the first fork to bring Popcorn Time to Android devices. In September of 2014, Time4Popcorn became available on jailbroken Apple devices, and eventually non-jailbroken iOS devices via a Windows installation tool. Functionality Big Buck Bunny on Popcorn Time 0.3.8 The Popcorn Time interface presents thumbnails and film titles in a manner similar to Netflix. This list of media can be searched and browsed by genres or categories. When a user clicks on one of the titles, the film is downloaded via the BitTorrent protocol. As with other BitTorrent clients, as soon as Popcorn Time starts to download a film, it also starts to share the downloaded content with other users (in technical terms, it seeds the torrent to others in the BitTorrent swarm). It continues to make the downloaded content available to others until the movie is deleted, which is normally done automatically once the application is closed. History Popcorn Time was developed \\"in a couple of weeks\\" by a group from Buenos Aires, Argentina who elected \\"Pochocl√≠n\\" (derived from pochoclo, which means popcorn in Buenos Aires parlance) as their mascot. They believed that piracy was a \\"service problem\\" created by \\"an industry that portrays innovation as a threat to their antique recipe to collect value\\", and also argued that streaming providers were being given too many restrictions and forced to provide inconsistent service between countries, noting that streaming providers in their native Argentina \\"seem to believe that There's Something About Mary [1998] is a recent movie. That movie would be old enough to vote here.\\" Made available for Linux, macOS, Windows and Android, Popcorn Time's source code was downloadable from their website; the project was intended to be free software. Contributors localized the program into 44 languages. =Reception= Popcorn Time became the subject of mainstream media attention for its ease of use, with PC Magazine and CBC News likening Popcorn Time to Netflix, and noting its obvious advantages over Netflix such as the size of its library, and the recent selections available. Caitlin Dewey of the Washington Post said Popcorn Time may have been an attempt to make the normally \\"sketchy\\" ecosystem of torrents more accessible by giving it a clean modern look and an easy-to-use interface. =Legality= The legality of the various Popcorn Time clients matched that of all other BitTorrent clients plus the additional issues that applies to sites like The Pirate Bay and YTS itself, due to the explicit linking to movie content; its website claimed that the software was possibly illegal depending on local laws. In the UK a court order was given in April 2015 to ISPs to block URLs that provided either the Popcorn Time application software (PTAS) or \\"sources of update information\\" (SUI), i.e. pointers to torrent-indexing sites. The court found that, unlike previous cases concerning indexing sites directly, neither websites providing the PTAS nor the SUI could be construed to be \\"communicating a work to the public\\", since neither contained any specific information about any specific work. It considered it entirely probable that both the providers of the PTAS and the SUI could be held to be \\"authorising acts of infringement\\" by users, but this was not the case that the claimants had raised at the hearing. Instead, they had claimed that the providers had been authorising acts of infringement by content-hosting websites, but then that claim had not been made out. The judge, however, found that the Popcorn Time suppliers did \\"plainly know and intend\\" for the application to be \\"the key means which procures and induces the user to access the host website and therefore causes the infringing communications to occur\\"; and on this basis had \\"a common design with the operators of the host websites\\" and therefore shared a joint liability for the copyright infringements (joint tortfeasance). It was therefore appropriate to order the ISPs to block the websites as provided for by section 97A of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988.Eleonora Rosati, Popcorn Time: a blocking order like any other? Birss J's decision in the post-Svensson debate, IPKat blog, April 29, 2015 On May 20, 2015, the government of Israel blocked all access to the official downloads of Popcorn Time, following a lawsuit from its biggest cable and satellite providers for copyright infringement. Although the download sites were blocked, internet users still possessing a copy of the installation file and/or the program were not affected, and there were other sharing sites that distributed installation files. Less than a month later, the government reversed the ban. On August 17, 2015, the Danish website popcorntime.dk was shut down by Danish police and two arrests were made. The case has caused controversy given that the website is not affiliated with the Popcorn Time developer teams but only distributed information about the service. As with other BitTorrent clients, the IP addresses of users of the original app or its forks can easily be determined by third parties. In early 2015, many German Popcorn Time users received demands for damages of ‚Ç¨815. The high amount was justified by the fact that the application not only downloads but also distributes movies, a fact that not all users were aware of.  Cobbler Nevada, LLC v.

The seizure is being contested by the Norwegian member organizations NUUG and EFN. =Discontinuation= On March 14, 2014, Popcorn Time's original website and GitHub repository were abruptly removed, with the developers stating that despite the unexpectedly positive media coverage that the software attracted, they simply wanted to move on, and that \\"our experiment has put us at the doors of endless debates about copyright infringement and copyright, legal threats and the shady machinery that makes us feel in danger for doing what we love. And that's not a battle we want a place in\\". It was later revealed by the Sony leaks that the MPAA did indeed prevent the original developers of Popcorn Time from continuing to work on the program. At the time, the MPAA considered themselves to have \\"scored a major victory in shutting down the key developers of Popcorn Time\\" via an action that required collaboration on three continents, intended to prevent Popcorn Time from becoming a \\"major piracy threat\\". The developers claimed that the majority of their users were those outside of the United States, and that it was \\"installed on every single country on Earth. Even the two that don't have internet access,\\" by users who would \\"risk fines, lawsuits and whatever consequences that may come just to be able to watch a recent movie in slippers. Just to get the kind of experience they deserve\\". They also praised media outlets for not antagonizing them in their coverage of Popcorn Time, and agreeing with their views that the movie industry was anti-consumer and too restrictive in regard to innovation. =Successor= After its discontinuation, the Popcorn Time application was forked by various different groups to continue development of the project. On August 8, 2015, the website of the original Popcorn Time application was redirected to the popcorntime.io website. A few days later, members of the original Popcorn Time project announced that they would endorse the popcorntime.io project as the successor to the original discontinued Popcorn Time.

These groups continued using the name \\"Popcorn Time\\", but other than the Popcorn Time project, these forks are not associated with the developers of the original application. The developers of the original Popcorn Time had members join the Popcorn Time project, and endorsed this as the successor to the discontinued old Popcorn Time.

It is a large, stately evergreen hemiepiphyte and is native to southeastern Asia. Description Ficus altissima is a large, evergreen forest tree, growing to , with a spreading crown and often multiple buttressed trunks and characteristic of its subgenus Urostigma. The bark is smooth and grey, with small pale brown pustules. The branches are spreading and the twigs are hairy and often green when young. The leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate, with entire margins and up to . They are supported on short stalks and have sheathing stipules. The flowers are solitary or in pairs and are in the axils of the leaves. They are concealed inside hollow receptacles which grow into orangish-red, many-seeded. figs following pollination. Distribution Ficus altissima is native to southeastern Asia and many islands in the Pacific. Its range includes the Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, South China and the Malesia region. It was first described by the Dutch botanist Carl Ludwig Blume in 1826 from Java. It has become naturalized in some of the southern counties of Florida. =Common Names= Vernacular names include: * Chinese: È´òÂ±±Ê¶ï gao shan rong * Vietnamese: ƒëa t√≠a (sometimes ƒëa r·∫•t cao: i.e. \\"very tall\\") * Myanmar; \\"Nyaung Moat Seit\\" Ecology Ficus altissima is a \\"strangler fig\\", often starting life as an epiphyte, on trees such as Lagerstroemia (as illustrated above) or palms, sending down roots to the ground which in time grow stout enough to support the growing tree independently. By this time the host tree has been overwhelmed and killed. It can also grow as a lithophyte in a crevice in a rock or a man made structure. It is sometimes planted as a shade tree but has a wide root system and is unsuitably large for most urban areas. Ficus altissima is one of many trees that hosts lac insects, scale insects in the superfamily Coccoidea, from which the dye lac is obtained. It has been planted in southern Florida, where it didn't used to seed because there weren't any native insects available to pollinate the flowers. However, non-native wasps (Eupristina sp.), that have become established in the area, seems capable of pollinating it and the tree is now proliferating and becoming invasive.

He led marches opposing the Government of Venezuela under President Nicol√°s Maduro, seeking \\"to turn the student rebellion into a broader social movement\\". Requesens was arrested in August 2018 but was released on 28 August 2020.  Student politics  Requesens on a TV show debating issues facing professors and students in 2013 In 2011, Requesens was elected the student president of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), where he began his political endeavors, studying political science. Requesens began demonstrations against the Venezuelan government in January 2013 when he helped organize a joint protest of students from UCV and Andr√©s Bello Catholic University. He was still the president in 2014, becoming a leader for the mass protests that year, and facing threats after another student leader at the Universidad Nacional Experimental del T√°chira was killed. At UCV, he used Twitter to hold student debates, and The Washington Post noted he was a talented public speaker. Requesens said in 2014 that his political idol was former Venezuelan president R√≥mulo Betancourt, who is known as the \\"father of Venezuelan democracy\\". According to The Washington Post, he is a \\"social democrat\\" who believes in \\"equality of opportunity\\" and a \\"market economy with social goals\\". =2014 Venezuelan protests= Requesens talking to a police officer during a protest in March 2014 Requesens frequently used technology to organize people; the 12,000 Twitter followers he had at the beginning of 2014 had increased to 450,000 by March, and he was able to assemble protests against the government from his cellphone. The main demands of Requesens' movement were for the release of protesters who had been jailed and justice for protesters killed and allegedly tortured. After rising to notoriety in early 2014, Requesens was pressured by the Venezuelan government to encourage violent protestors to stand down, particularly in the state of T√°chira where the violence broke out. He was also asked to attend meetings with President Maduro, but refused because of the human rights abuses; he then requested that if a meeting were to be held with Maduro, that it would be broadcast live on television. The Washington Post said that Requesens \\"insist[ed] that Maduro free jailed protesters and meet other preconditions\\" before he would meet with him. He believed then that asking for Maduro's removal as president was a \\"dead end\\" and said that the \\"strategy of escalating confrontation will just give the government the chance to discredit us and continue with more repression\\". According to The Washington Post, he was more like Henrique Capriles in \\"tone and strategy\\", and more moderated than the \\"hard-line wing\\" of opposition from Maria Corina Machado and Leopoldo L√≥pez.  National Assembly  Shortly after he was elected in 2015 to the National Assembly, Requesens' sister, Rafaela Requesens, and a friend, Eladio Hern√°ndez, were kidnapped by unknown parties in the state of T√°chira. Requesens was assigned to the National Assembly Commission for Social Development and Integration. In April 2016, amid teaching strikes, Requesens and Miguel Pizarro volunteered to work on the Education Law bill ‚Äî which had not been developed in over a decade ‚Äî to raise teachers' minimum wage and bring standards into law. By 2016, Requesens was calling for Maduro's resignation. Requesens attempted to run for Governor of T√°chira, the state for which he was already a deputy, in 2017. However, the electoral commission refused to accept pre-candidates to the ballot, and so votes in his favor were not counted, something he spoke against in the Assembly the day after the vote. In early 2018, Requesens was part of the faction of the Assembly that formed a coalition called the Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre to ask for free elections in the country, and for Maduro to leave, saying that the opposition and country has to move forward civilly. =Experiences of violence= Requesens and Juan Pablo Guanipa were briefly detained on 30 November 2017 when they tried to cross the border to Colombia. In May 2018, Requesens was one of the politicians to step in when press personnel were being attacked by guards outside the parliamentary buildings, fighting with the soldiers; the same day, Requesens and Carlos Paparoni were attacked and held down when trying to come to the defense of journalists outside the Supreme Court. He rejoined street protests the next day, rejecting elections due later in the week. 2017 Venezuelan protests Requesens at a protest in 2017 Requesens was back on the street in 2017, now as an elected deputy. In April 2017, Requesens was with other young protestors marching on the Ombudsman's office when he was attacked, along with another deputy. He was hit in the head and received deep cuts on his face. According to Jos√© Manuel Olivares, Requesens had to have surgery to fix broken bones including his nose and jaw, and to stitch up his forehead. The march had been calling for the resignations of the Justices of the Supreme Court. In June 2017, Requesens was again attacked, this time by members of the Bolivarian National Guard ‚Äî though he referred to them as \\"colectivos\\" in an interview on ‚Äî who then threw him down a sewer drain, as well as stealing from him and others. The Colombian government issued a communication denouncing the excessive use of violence, especially against politicians, and sought to remind Venezuelan military officials that their Constitution requires them to prevent unnecessary violence towards protestors.  Arrest  On 7 August 2018, Requesens had given a speech in Venezuela's National Assembly blaming Maduro for causing unrest in the nation. In this speech, he used the saying, \\"I refuse to give up\\": > \\"I refuse to give up, I refuse to kneel in front of those who want to break > our morale. Today I can speak from here, tomorrow I do not know. What I want > to reaffirm is that we are going to continue doing everything we can to take > Nicol√°s Maduro out of power.\\" Requesens was arrested that day by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN). He was detained as a suspect in the Caracas drone attack, an alleged assassination plot on the Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are controversial, and irregularities surround the legal proceedings. He has been imprisoned in El Helicoide since his arrest, with allegations of torture to coerce a confession, and delays impeding the legal process and hearings. Requesens' detention has been condemned by the National Assembly ‚Äì as well as international diplomats, politicians and organizations ‚Äì and large protests have been held in Venezuela demanding that he be freed. His relatives and fellow politicians have stated that they believe he was arrested for criticizing Maduro. The National Assembly condemned the detention of Requesens as a forced disappearance. The Twitter hashtag \\"#YoMeNiegoARendirme\\" ‚Äì Spanish for \\"I refuse to give up\\" ‚Äì became a popular slogan for his case, and a creed for the opposition.  Personal life  Requesens' father is a doctor and his mother is an English teacher, his sister is the activist Rafaela Requesens. Requesens is married to Orianna Granati, and they have two young children.

Retrieved from lombard.register.pagesperso-orange.fr on 12 March 2014 Andr√© Lombard Andr√© Lombard's early career in the automobile business involved working with Salmson, and he also acquired a reputation as a competition driver for Salmson. Lombard's final position with Salmson was as Commercial Director, and it was in this capacity that he had a major falling out with the company's Technical Director, √âmile Petit. Petit accused Lombard of having purchased production equipment of poor quality. Bad feeling between the two continued to fester and in 1923 Andr√© Lombard left Salmson: the agreement covering his departure included a five year \\"non- competition clause\\". Start of automobile development Lombard accordingly devoted his energies to competition driving, but he evidently never entirely lost his appetite for automobile manufacturing, and in defiance of the five year clause, just four years after leaving Salmson he presented, at Montlh√©ry, his first model, the Lombard AL1, accompanied by two Aerodynamic (\\"tank\\" bodied in the parlance of the time) AL2s. These were prototypes, but they formed the basis for the Lombard AL3 which followed a year later, and which was the manufacturer's first production model. The cars were developed by Edmond Vareille and used a \\"light voiturette\\" style. Various addresses in the Paris area were associated with the production of the automobiles: the registered head office was at Puteaux. Automobile production Lombard took a stand at the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1926 and exhibited the car they would be selling in 1927. The Lombard AL3 was powered by a 4-cylinder twin-overhead camshaft engine of 1,083cc. Some of the engines on the production cars would be fitted with superchargers. By the time production ended, in 1929, (approximately) 94 cars were recorded as having been produced, almost all of which were AL3s. Production locations Initially the cars were produced by E. Briault in Courbevoie.Georgano: The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile. From 1928 the cars were assembled by The √âmile Salmson sons (Les Fils de √â. Salmson) at Boulogne-Billancourt. Another source indicates that the cars were assembled at Argenteuil by BNC. All the production locations given here were geographically close together, in a district that had become the country's principal centre for automobile production, on the north-western fringes of Paris. When production ended in 1929 it was BNC that acquired the components inventory and a number of half finished Lombards.

Tintori is the wife of Leopoldo L√≥pez, a Venezuelan politician sentenced in 2015 to nearly 14 years in prison for \\"inciting violence\\" during street protests the year before. She has also led groups who have opposed the government of Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro. Early life and education Tintori was born in Caracas, Venezuela on May 5, 1978. Her mother is Venezuelan and her father from Argentina. She studied at Merici Academy. She earned a bachelor's degree in preschool education with a minor in political communications from the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University. Career =Entertainment= In 2001, Tintori was part of the reality TV Show Robinson: La Gran Aventura. The show was a big success in Venezuela. Even though Tintori did not win, this experience helped her build a career in the entertainment industry. Tintori was a television host for RCTV and Televen, a former radio personality for La Mega, Hot 94 and Ateneo 100.7. Eventually, Tintori's face was seen on billboards in Venezuela. The Atlantic described her as \\"a celebrity in her home country, famed for her looks and charisma\\". Tintori was Venezuela's 2003 Kitesurfing National Champion and is the founder of the Prokite Foundation, which works to provide kitesurfing gear to unprivileged kitesurfers. Tintori is also an ambassador for the Socieven Association, which works to raise awareness of the plight of the deaf and blind. She also works with the BFC Foundation for its violence against women campaign and with the Young Foundation for Human Rights. =Human rights= Lilian Tintori holding a flag during a protest in Venezuela. Following the arrest of her husband during the 2014 Venezuelan protests, Tintori became a face of Venezuela's opposition movement. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, she denied interest in politics while telling The Atlantic that \\"Leopoldo is the politician ... I‚Äôm a human-rights activist, a Venezuelan, a mother, and a victim myself, and I‚Äôm very close to the victims of my country\\". She traveled internationally to meet with individuals such as United States vice president Joe Biden, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy and Pope Francis, to seek assistance with the releasing her husband and other political prisoners in Venezuela. President of Venezuela, Nicol√°s Maduro sees Tintori as a threat and has called for her work to be \\"neutralized\\" and described her as a \\"terrorist\\". According to Tintori, Venezuelan authorities often follow her and intimidate her daily. While visiting her husband L√≥pez in prison, she, as well as her mother-in-law, have been forced to undergo \\"intimate\\" strip searches by Venezuelan authorities, with Tintori's children present at times. On 29 August 2017, the scientific police of Venezuela (CICPC) stated that they found 200 million bol√≠vares in cash‚Äìaround 10,000 USD at that time‚Äì split in four wooden boxes in a car belonging to Tintori. Tintori and two vicepresindents of the bank BOD were prohibited from leaving the country during the investigation. Tintori assured that the money was for personal use (to pay a doctor for her mother) and expressed that the Venezuelan government was attempting to prevent her from going on an international tour to meet with European leaders. On 2 September 2017, she was prevented from leaving for Europe, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to tweet his support. Tintori, on June 14, 2017, was awarded the 2017 Palabra Prize. Personal life On 19 April 2007, Tintori married Leopoldo L√≥pez. They have three children: Manuela Rafaela, born in 2009; Leopoldo Santiago, born in 2013; and Federica Antonieta, born in 2018.

History  In 1882, James Harvey Williams and Matthew Diamond founded Williams & Diamond in Flushing, Queens, a drop forging business. The business was relocated to Brooklyn in 1884 and took the name J.H. Williams & Co in 1887. The company was one of the first to offer mass-produced drop-forged hand tools.

He was referred to as \\"Father\\" despite not being an ordained priest. Monti served as a nurse for most of his life and aided the ill in the Santo Spirito hospital in Rome while he was there and also worked to tend to ill people during the Brescia cholera epidemic in 1855. Monti also considered entering the religious life and joined the order of Lodovico Pavoni for a brief period of time though became a religious of his own order later on. The beatification cause opened under Pope Pius XII in 1941 and he became titled as a Servant of God - the first stage in the process for sainthood. Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable on 24 April 2001 on the account of his heroic virtue and later beatified him at Saint Peter's Square on 9 November 2003 on the account of a 1961 miracle he approved. Life Monti's gravestone. Luigi Maria Monti was born in 1825 in Milan as the eighth of eleven children to Angelo (d. 1837) and Teresa Monti. His father died when Monti was twelve. Monti formed a small group of craftsman and farmers at the store he managed devoted to the Sacred Heart. He made a private vow of obedience and to remain chaste to God on 8 December 1846. He and the other members of his group were charged with meeting to conspire against the Austrian forces who were in the area and in 1851 were jailed in Milan for ten weeks. The group was released when it became obvious that the latter was a religious group and not a political one; the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Bartolomeo Carlo Romilli also intervened to secure their release. His spiritual director became the priest Luigi Dossi and the two first met in September 1843. He enlisted in the order that Lodovico Pavoni founded in 1830 and spent six weeks with them as a novice while he studied to become a nurse. He aided the ill during the cholera epidemic in Brescia in 1855 and - with the aid of Dossi - began to set the foundations for a religious order he wished to establish to aid the sick and founded this on 8 September 1857. Monti and his fellow nurse Cipriano Pezzini moved to Rome in 1858 where the two commenced work at the hospital of Santo Spirito. He worked alongside the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin for a brief period of time while in Rome. Monti became certified as a nurse with a diploma at the La Sapienza college. Pope Pius IX - on 4 March 1877 - blessed Monti's work and appointed him as its Superior General. This was a position that he held until his death. The pope desired Monti's order to be aggregated to the Capuchin order - since Monti worked with them for a brief period of time - but Cardinal Luigi Bilio sent a letter to Giovanni Bosco on the pope's behalf requesting that the Salesians of Don Bosco aggregate the order. Pius IX noted that Monti opposed this and so decided the order would not be aggregated at all. The religious left Rome in 1886 and moved to Saronno. In 1882 he met a Carthusian monk who came to see him at the hospital in Rome and at his request assumed care for his four parentless nephews; he opened a home for them at Saronno after he arrived there. Monti died on 1 October 1900 almost blind. His order received papal approval from Pope Pius X in 1904 and his remains were later relocated on 22 September 1940. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Milan in 1941 in an informative process that Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster opened and later concluded in 1950. The theologians approved his spiritual writings on 8 February 1963 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 16 June 1989 and then received the Positio dossier in 1993. Theologians approved the cause on 13 June 2000 as did the C.C.S. on 6 February 2001 and it allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm her heroic virtue and name her as Venerable on 24 April 2001. The process for a miracle spanned from 1964 until 1978 and the miracle in question involved the cure of Giovanni Luigi Iecle - who suffered from an intestinal condition - on 26 December 1961 in Bosa in Nuoro. This process was validated on 1 July 1994 and received the approval of a medical board on 21 February 2002. Theologians approved it as well on 18 October 2002 as did the C.C.S. on 21 January 2003. John Paul II approved the miracle on 12 April 2003 and later beatified Monti on 9 November 2003 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator for this cause is Giovanni Cazzaniga.

The film had its world release on March 10, 2014 at South by Southwest, a VOD release on April 3, 2014, and a theatrical release on May 9. It stars Allie MacDonald as a hopeful young singer terrorized by a killer at a musical theater camp. Plot In 2004, Broadway diva Kylie Swanson opened the musical The Haunting of the Opera (a reference to real-life musical The Phantom of the Opera) to a packed audience. However, that same night, she was murdered backstage by an unknown assailant wearing the mask of the play's villain, Opera Ghost. 10 years later in the present-day, Kylie's children Camilla and Buddy have grown up raised by Roger McCall, a former lover of Kylie's and the producer of a musical theater summer camp on the brink of bankruptcy. When Camilla hears that the camp will be producing a kabuki version of The Haunting of the Opera, she decides that she will sneak into auditions one way or another. She manages to convince a camper overseeing the auditions, Joel Hopton, to let her in and Camilla easily impresses the stage director Artie and wins the lead role of Sofia - much to Buddy's dismay. As the opening day grows closer and closer, Camilla discovers that Artie will only let her perform on opening day as long as she provides him with sexual favors. He emotionally blackmails her by playing her off of Liz Silver, a camper that will do anything to perform on opening night. Camilla tries to ward off Artie's attentions by only making out with him, which disgusts Joel - whom Camilla has largely ignored since the audition. The night before the performance, Artie gives Camilla an ultimatum: either she sleeps with him or he gives the opening night performance to Liz. Camilla initially acquiesces to Artie's overtures, but decides at the last minute that she can't go through with it. After she leaves, Artie is brutally murdered by someone wearing the Opera Ghost mask, but Roger tells everyone that Artie died by car accident. Unwilling to potentially lose a visit from important Broadway agent Victor Brady, who is only willing to watch the performance if Camilla is performing, Roger manages to persuade everyone to perform opening night as planned. That night, Joel tries to warn Camilla that Artie was killed and that the murderer is still out there, but his warnings go largely unheeded and the show begins. All seems well with the musical and Victor until later in the performance, when Opera Ghost kills campers Whitney, Sam, and Sheila, and stops Liz from taking revenge on Camilla for performing on opening night. This causes a gap in the performance, which the cast tries to fill with impromptu music and dancing while Camilla looks for her missing co-star. She instead finds an ever-increasing number of bodies. Camilla manages to intervene when she discovers Opera Ghost trying to kill Roger. This killer is revealed to be Buddy, who says that he did it because he did not want Camilla to get involved in the acting world, which he saw as corrupt. Buddy tells Camilla that Roger is the one who killed their mother in a jealous rage. He spent the past 10 years trying to avenge his mother's death, and he wants to kill whoever who's close to Roger. Roger learns the truth, turns violent, manages to free himself, and attacks Buddy, fatally stabbing him to death. He decides to kill Camilla because her brother wanted to kill him. Roger chases Camilla throughout the camp and corners her backstage. Just as Roger is about to kill Camilla, she finds a buzz saw and kills him and stumbles onto stage. The audience initially assumes that this was all part of the show and applauds what they believe to be the finale. The film then cuts to the Broadway revival of The Haunting of the Opera with Camilla as the lead. As she prepares backstage, Opera Ghost lunges out of the mirror at Camilla, only for it to be a hallucination.

Biography  Rosario Messina was born in 1942 in the Sicilian city of Aci Castello in 1942. His father ‚Äì a farmer ‚Äì died when he was a young man, leaving him the responsibility of the family. He was the eldest of five children and in 1958, he began working for the La Rinascente department store in Catania, first as an apprentice, then as a salesperson and finally as head of department. Simultaneously, he attended evening courses in book-keeping and qualified in record time, managing to complete five academic years in one. Following his experience with La Rinascente, he worked in the local branch of Zanussi-Rex, the most important Italian manufacturer of electrical appliances at that time. In the early 1970s, he was asked to work in the furniture-design sector: he joined the company C&B; (now B&B; Italia) as an account officer for Sicily and Calabria. He then moved to the north of the country as the company's sales manager. In 1976, he started working with Cinova, another leading sofa manufacturing company. He was appointed as the sales manager, responsible for general management. His professional turning point appeared when the soft furnishings company, Bassetti, assigned him a difficult task: he was asked to launch 'the duvet', a product to replace the traditional blanket for beds. It was a difficult undertaking, and made more complex by the opposition from the furniture dealers ‚Äì the elective distribution channel ‚Äì who opposed commercializing a low cost product distributed through other channels. Messina had a Eureka moment and intuitively felt that 'bed with the duvet' as opposed to duvet alone would be an overwhelming success. This ingenious idea led to the foundation of the company Flou in 1978 and the presentation of the bed 'Nathalie' designed by Vico Magistretti, an article that unquestionably was the prototype of a new design direction: the modern textile bed. Flou was a true pioneer in the 'culture of sleep' and rapidly became a leader in the world of furnishings, making an important contribution to enhancing the image of Italian design in the world. = Official appointments = Between 1994 and 1998, Rosario Messina was President of the Gruppo Mobili Assarredo. From 1998, he was President of Assarredo, the trade association of Federlegno-Arredo that groups together the Italian furniture and furnishing industries. He was a member of the steering committee of the Council of Federlegno-Arredo, and was appointed to the same role with the industrial confederation Confindustria Monza e Brianza. In 1999 he was appointed to the most prestigious position as President of Cosmit, the organizing body for Milan Furniture Fair. This is the world's most important furniture exhibition and under his Presidency, the Milan Furniture Fair (and the collateral exhibitions of Euroluce (Lighting), Eurocucina (Kitchens), Salone del Bagno [Bathrooms], Salone del Complemento d'Arredo (Furnishing Accessories), Salone dell'Ufficio (Office), Salone Satellite (Collateral events) progressed from being a simple trade show to a spectacular event, with the promotion of important cultural events that consolidated Milan as the unchallengeable 'Design capital'. The Salon was transformed into a meeting place for questions and answers as well as being a platform for 360¬∞ proposals in all areas of design culture and innovation. The last edition under his management took place in 2011: a total of 321,320 people visited the event (up 7% on 2010 and 2% on 2009) and the 'Satellite Salon' that was actively promoted by Messina; this spin-off initiative started quietly and today is the most prestigious stage for showcasing up-and-coming designers and architects from the specialist educational aspects around the world. In June 2008, during the annual general meeting, Rosario Messina was elected President of Federlegno-Arredo, the organization of Confindustria that represents 2,300 companies in 12 associations (Assarredo [Furnishings], Assobagno [Bathrooms], Assoimballaggi [Packaging], Assolegno [Wood and Timber], Assoluce [Lighting], Assopannelli [Panels], Assufficio [Office], Edilegno [Timber houses], Fedecomlegno [The Italian National Timber Association], Asal Assoallestimenti [Stands and Layouts], Aippl [Wooden flooring and laying], Apil [Lighting]); these represent the entire section of timber-furnishings: from the raw materials to the finished product. He was a councillor on the steering committee of the foundation 'Center for the development of Italo-Russian trade relations\\". On October 30, 2008, the then president of Confundustria, Emma Marcegaglia, appointed him as a delegate of the industrial confederation Confindustria and according to the constitution, he automatically held the position of Vice President of CFI (The Italian industrial confederation). = Prizes, awards and commendations = *1996 \\"Industrialist of the Year\\" Awarded by the Group of Monza e Brianza Journalists during a ceremony hosted in the historical Palazzo Antona Traversi in Meda (Italy) *1997 \\"Official Commander of the Italian Republic\\" *1999 President of Cosmit ‚Äì The organizing committee for the Milan Furniture Fair and the collateral events *2000 \\"Made in Italy Awards\\" ‚Äì New York *2002 \\"26th Silver Jug\\" The city of Giarre, in Sicily.

It was established in March 1912 by a group of former Tsinghua faculty members led by Hu Dunfu, and became one of the most reputable private universities in China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist government closed Utopia along with many other private universities in 1952. Its departments, faculty members, and students were divided and merged into various universities in Shanghai. Founding Hu Dunfu, founder and first president of Utopia In April 1911, the American government established Tsinghua College (now Tsinghua University) in Beijing, using part of indemnity payment made by the Qing dynasty in the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion. In summer, a group of eleven Chinese faculty members at Tsinghua, most of whom were from the Jiangnan region, established the Lida Society () to promote education in China. Hu Dunfu was the head of the society, and other members included Ping Hailan (), Zhu Xiangwan (), and Gu Yangwu (). In November 1911, the eleven members of Lida resigned from Tsinghua after having a disagreement with the American administrators at the college, and left Beijing for Shanghai. Hu Dunfu, the first dean of Tsinghua who had graduated in mathematics from Cornell University, insisted that students of Tsinghua should study more science and engineering, but American teachers, backed by the American ambassador, maintained that they should focus more on the English language and the literature, history and geography of America. They were also angered by the stark contrast in treatment between American and Chinese teachers in Tsinghua; the former were paid nearly ten times as much as the latter, so they were determined to found a university that was academically independent and truly belonged to the Chinese people. In Shanghai, Hu Dunfu was invited by Ma Xiangbo, his former teacher at the Catholic school Coll√®ge Saint-Ignace, to be the dean of Fudan Public School (now Fudan University), which was founded by Ma in 1905. However, Hu soon left Fudan after a student strike at the school. In March 1912, Hu and his colleagues of the Lida Society founded Utopia School () in Nanshi, Shanghai, with Hu as president. The inaugural class had 91 students. Republican era In September 1922, Utopia School was certified by the government as a private university, and changed its name to Utopia University. It had 600 students at the time. In the 1920s, Utopia developed into one of the best private universities in China. It was divided into three schools, for literature, science, and business, which were further divided into nine departments. It also established an affiliated secondary school. The campus occupied an area of 90 mu, and had 15 buildings. A 1920s inspection report of six major private universities in Shanghai by the Chinese Ministry of Education praised Utopia and University of Shanghai as the most outstanding. Nationally, Utopia and Nankai University in Tianjin were considered the best private universities in China. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted, and the Imperial Japanese Army attacked Shanghai in August. During the battle Japanese bombing destroyed many of Utopia's buildings. After the Japanese occupied the Chinese- held areas of Shanghai, Utopia was forced to relocate to the French Concession. It moved several times between temporary accommodations, until settling down on Xinzha Road in September 1939. By this time the university and its affiliated high school had 2,000 students. It also established another secondary school. The university expanded further after the Second World War, becoming the largest private university in Shanghai. By 1948, it had more than 2,700 university students, and 2,500 students enrolled at its two secondary schools. It had four schools (the school of engineering had been established in addition to the original three) and fourteen departments. Among Utopia's students, 39 later became academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Demise In 1949, the Communist Party of China defeated the Kuomintang government in the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China. In October 1952, the new Communist government closed Utopia along with many other private universities. Its business school was merged into Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, its school of literature became part of the newly established East China Normal University, the school of science was merged into Fudan University, and the school of engineering was divided and became part of Tongji University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the new East China Institute of Chemical Technology (now East China University of Science and Technology). Utopia's two affiliated secondary schools remained, and are now known as Datong High School and Wusi (May Fourth) High School. Hu Dunfu, Utopia's founder, went to Taiwan along with the defeated Kuomintang government. He attempted to reestablish Utopia University in Taiwan, but was unsuccessful.

The novel was published on 28 August 2014 in the UK, New Zealand, Australia and Ireland, and on September 2, 2014, in the United StatesPersonal. Amazon.com. and Canada.\\"Personal\\". Leechild.com The plot of the book revolves around Reacher's pursuit of a sniper who has attempted to assassinate the President of France. This book is written in the first person. Synopsis Someone has taken a shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was American-made. The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence? Very few, but John Kott‚Äîan elite American marksman gone bad‚Äîis one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, he‚Äôs out, unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with enough world leaders to tempt any assassin. If anyone can stop Kott, it‚Äôs the man who beat him before: retired Military Police investigator Jack Reacher. And though he‚Äôd rather work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who keeps her cool with Zoloft. But they‚Äôre facing a rough road, full of ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crosses‚Äîand no backup if they‚Äôre caught. All the while Reacher can‚Äôt stop thinking about Dominique Kohl, a young subordinate he once failed to save when he sent her to arrest a suspect, and she was killed, and he swears it won't happen this time. The powerful General Tom O'Day sends him undercover to Paris to discover who's behind the murder attempt; in order to find the culprit and, above all, to save the oncoming G8 meeting which is going to be held in London. Reacher finds out that the dangerous gang using snipers - among whom there's Kott, arguably - has actually got a base in London, namely in Chigwell, where Charlie White, an old man helped by a notorious gang called the \\"Romford Boys\\", runs a bunch of gangsters who do business with Serbians and now are threatening to aim higher at the G8. Reacher, together with Casey Nice, manages to approach White's general quarters, where a giant who goes by the name of Joseph (Little Joey) Green, defends the castle. But Reacher confronts and kills Joey, enters the house and kills Kott, too; then he comes back to the States to meet O'Day, the general who proposed the mission to him; but not to thank him, but to frame him. Kott, White and Green were criminals, but they were not threatening the G8; O'Day wanted Kott simply to become more powerful politically; and he had sold Reacher to him in advance; whether the winner would be Kott or Reacher, he might have pretended to have saved the world. Reacher leaves him alone, but orders him not to say a word or he would raise a scandal and waste him; and a short time after the story he reads that O'Day has killed himself; but Reacher has already left town.

For most of his professional life as a diplomat his career was dogged by unproven allegations that he either leaked classified information to his mother, the writer and communist Katharine Susannah Prichard, or was a spy for the Soviet Union. Early life Ric Throssell was born in 1922 in Western Australia, in the Perth suburb of Greenmount. His father was Hugo Throssell, a winner of the Victoria Cross Retrieved 23 April 2020at Gallipoli in 1915, and son of a former Premier of Western Australia, George Throssell. His mother was the writer Katharine Susannah Prichard. Ric was their only child. He was named after his father's late brother Frank Erick \\"Ric\\" Cottrell Throssell, who was killed at the 2nd Battle of Gaza in 1917. He attended Wesley College, Perth, and was a founding member of the Wesley Hundred, a charitable organisation that worked with the poor. On 19 November 1933, while his mother was on a six-month visit to the Soviet Union, his father Hugo shot himself. (online). Published first in hardcopy 1990. His business ventures had failed in the Great Depression, and he had been offered just ten shillings ($1) by a pawnbroker for his Victoria Cross. In his suicide note he entertained the hope that his wife would now qualify for a war widow's pension, which was approved. Army and diplomatic service Ric Throssell enlisted in the Australian Army in World War II, and was promoted to lance corporal. He was offered the opportunity of officer training on the basis of being the son of a VC winner, but declined on principle. He served in New Guinea. In 1943 he joined the diplomatic service, his first posting being to Moscow in 1945, as Third Secretary. His first wife Bea n√©e Gallacher died suddenly while they were in Moscow. After returning to Canberra, he met and married Dorothy \\"Dodie\\" Jordan in 1947. Like his mother Katharine Susannah Prichard, Dodie was born in Fiji. In the late 1940s he was an adviser to H. V. Evatt in Evatts' capacity as President of the United Nations General Assembly. From 1949 to 1951 he was posted at the Australian Embassy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His mother was a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia in 1919, and remained a member for the rest of her life. Dodie was never formally a member of the party, but had participated in guerrilla training in the Dandenong Ranges as a member of its youth arm, the Eureka Youth League. Because of these associations and the Cold War tensions of the time, Throssell became a person of interest to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). In 1954, the Soviet defector Vladimir Petrov named him as a spy, alleging he had given information to Walter Seddon Clayton (who was later proven to be a Soviet agent with the codename 'KLOD') and he was questioned for a week by the Royal Commission on Espionage, created soon after the Petrov affair. The questioning concerned his contact with Russians in Australia, and whether he had told his mother anything about his work. The Royal Commission eventually concurred in his vehement denials of any intentional espionage, although it stated that he may have inadvertently let drop classified information to people in the circles in which he moved. For example, one of his close friends was Jim Hill (also named by Petrov), brother of the Victorian Communist Party leader Ted Hill, who later broke away to form a Maoist group. Although Throssell was officially exonerated, his career was stymied from that point onwards. On ASIO's advice he was repeatedly denied access to highly classified documents, and was refused promotion in the then Department of External Affairs. In 1955, the Secretary of the Department, Arthur Tange, even wrote to the Solicitor-General asking if there were grounds for having Throssell dismissed from the Public Service; the reply said that \\"no charge against Throssell could possibly succeed\\". Nevertheless, the smears and suspicion continued unabated and Tange maintained a correspondence with ASIO about Throssell. However, he played an important role in administering the Colombo Plan, and in 1962 led the formation of the department's Cultural Relations Branch. In 1974, the new departmental head, Alan Renouf, sought to use his influence to have Throssell security cleared to a higher level, but the CIA threatened to cut security ties with the Whitlam government and the plan foundered.David McKnight, \\"Spies who came in from the Cold War\\", review of Ball and Horner, Breaking the Codes, Sydney Morning Herald, 19 September 1998, Spectrum Books, p. 9s In 1980 he was appointed Director of the Commonwealth Foundation in London, an Assistant Secretary-level position. That post required the unanimous concurrence of all Commonwealth prime ministers. He remained there until ill health forced his retirement in 1983. Spying allegations In 1996, certain transcripts of secret Soviet diplomatic communications known as the Venona decrypts were released in Washington. Before they were released in Australia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade asked Throssell if he wanted his name deleted. He replied that he was as interested as anyone in finally discovering what had been said about him, and approved of the unredacted release. It proved to contain three innocuous references to him, the substance of which had all been canvassed in the Royal Commission 42 years earlier. Nevertheless, Throssell was re-branded a spy on the front page of the Brisbane Courier-Mail under the headline \\"Confirmed: Our Soviet Spies\\", along with a photo of him in the company of British traitors Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The paper later issued an apology. In 1998, Desmond Ball and David Horner published their book Breaking the Codes, which for the first time detailed the full extent of ASIO's case against Throssell. This included a claim that he actively cooperated with the KGB when he was representing Australia in Brazil in the late 1940s. David Horner went on to publish the Official History of ASIO as its lead author and editor. The first volume, the Spy Catchers (2011), discusses Throssell's case: =Attempts to clear his name= Under Freedom of Information laws that had been introduced in 1982, Throssell was now able to gain access to some ASIO documents previously denied him. These painted what he called \\"another self, a secret person portrayed by the anonymous men of the Australian intelligence services\\". He also had considerable dealings with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on these matters.

Later life In 1983, to help fund the production of the film The Pursuit of Happiness, based on a book by his daughter Karen Throssell, he donated his father's Victoria Cross to People for Nuclear Disarmament. The Returned and Services League of Australia bought the medal and presented it to the Australian War Memorial, where it is displayed. Throssell was an active member of Canberra Repertory Theatre as a director, writer and actor. Death His wife Dodie died on 20 April 1999 after a long illness, and he committed suicide later the same day. They were survived by three of their children and five grandchildren. A son with Down Syndrome had died earlier.

Jan Pietersz. van der Lee‚Äôs birth year, which is believed to be around 1545, serves as the factory‚Äôs founding year. = 1545-1860 = Jan Pietersz. van der Lee belonged to what you could call the upper class of Oudewater. He was the proprietor of most ropewalks of Oudewater as the Oudewater ledger of 1579 shows. Under the heading ‚ÄòOther income from ropewalk proprietors‚Äô it reads: ‚ÄòReceived from Jan Pietersz., 15 five-cent pieces for ropewalks previously rented from the city‚Äô. The son of Jan Pietersz. (1580‚Äì1625), a rope maker too, was the first one to inherit the property from his father. After Jan Pietersz‚Äôs death, the family business was handed down to Heijndrick (1620‚Äì1697) and Gijsbert Heijndricksz. van der Lee (1645‚Äì1694). According to records dating back to 1694, they owned a ‚Äòcoarse-thread ropery and ropery house with right of way and right to spin on Agterstraat in Oudewater‚Äô. Gijsbert Heijndricksz‚Äôs three sons Adrianus, Cornelis and Jan took over the company after his death. Jan Gijsbertsz‚Äôs oldest son was Gijsbert, but it was his brother Adrianus van der Lee (1721‚Äì1766) who continued the dynasty. Adrianus‚Äô son Cornelis van der Lee (1753‚Äì1826) took charge of the business in 1787 with the purchase of ‚Äòa ropewalk and farmland with shed and garden, located at the Bieze, with the garden wall leading to the Amsterdamse Veer in Oudewater‚Äô from his uncle Gijsbert van der Lee. = 1860-1919 = From the 16th to the 19th century, the craft of rope making remained pretty much unchanged. There were many steps involved in rope making, and each of these steps was done by hand with the aid of simple tools. In the first half of the 19th century the Dutch shipbuilding industry was booming. Many businesses, including the roperies, benefited from this favourable environment. In the 1860s, a change occurred with the gradual arrival of the industrial revolution which also affected the Van der Lee family. Although Adrianus van der Lee (1787‚Äì1856) called himself a manufacturer, he was in fact a traditional rope maker. It was his son Gijsbert (1819‚Äì1903) who pulled the business into the modern world. In 1880, Gijsbert van der Lee made the brave decision to introduce steam engines into the rope production. He bought an elongated piece of land in the Hekendorp polder just outside Oudewater where the new steam ropery was to be built. In 1886, Gijsbert van der Lee, as stated in the permit issued by the Municipality of Hekendorp, commissioned the construction of a stone and iron building ‚Äòwith a kettle to melt the tar needed for tarring the ropes manufactured in the steam ropery‚Äô. This led to fierce protests from neighbours. At the turn of the century, a mechanised spinning mill was built next to the steam ropery. On 28 December 1903, the founder of the modern rope factory, Gijsbert van der Lee, died at the age of 84 at his villa ‚ÄòKlein Hekendorp‚Äô opposite the factory on the IJsseldijk. Gijsbert‚Äôs sons Adrianus and Cornelis Gijsbertus followed in their father‚Äôs footsteps and turned the ropery into a general partnership named G. van der Lee. = 1919-1938 = On 1 July 1919, Cornelis Gijsbertus left the company and G. van der Lee was passed on to his brother Adrianus (1854‚Äì1920) and his son Gijsbert (1883‚Äì1966). After Adrianus van der Lee‚Äôs death on 13 May 1920, a difficult time started for Gijsbert van der Lee. As part owner of the company, he had to share authority with his three brothers Klaas, Jan and Piet, his sister Marretje, his brother- in-law Arie Beijen and his mother Christina Vriesman. Gijsbert van der Lee bought out his family in 1936, on the condition that Gijsbert‚Äôs brother Piet Van der Lee became the director of the Old Ropery in Vlaardingen. During this period, the way business was done started to change and the first lorry was bought to transport the ropes. = 1960-2013 = In 1960, Wim van der Lee and his manager made old and new rope-making technologies meet. They designed large braiding machines that could manufacture heavy hawsers for the shipping and off-shore industries. The ropes for these hawsers were twisted on the old ropewalk. The industry was faced with a major challenge in 1965 when the first synthetic yarn hit the markets which had many times the resistance of manila, and, additionally, is impervious. With developments in the synthetic industry taking place at breakneck speed, the family decided to buy into synthetic fibre, which meant closing their own spinning mill. On 1 July 1984, Wim van der Lee‚Äôs daughter and son, Saskia and Gijsbert van der Lee, and their cousin Willem Hendrik Schreijgrond, the oldest son of Christina van der Lee, who is Wim van der Lee‚Äôs sister, were appointed as supervisory directors alongside Johan Joseph Breen. Bernhard de Wit was appointed as director. By importing raw materials the family could now specialise. This change in production led to a new factory being built in 1993. Van der Lee‚Äôs product range, which is made using modern scutchers and braiding machines, now largely varies to include all kinds of ropes, yet the old craft still lives on at the G. van der Lee Rope Factory; hawsers for fisheries, water sport and replicas of VOC ships and the ropes are still twisted on the 350-metre long ropewalk. = 2013-present = The G. Van der Lee Rope Factory became part of the Hendrik Veder Group in 2013.

History Tommy Larkin's Gaelic Athletic Club was founded in 1968 with the amalgamation of both the Woodford and Ballinakill GAA clubs. Soon after amalgamation adult hurling flourished with the senior team winning the county title in 1971. However despite the efforts of many tireless workers the club struggled to compete in the late seventies and eighties due in the most part to emigration. In 1990 the club was relegated to the intermediate ranks, this prompted a renewed commitment to coaching at underage level. Since the nineties the club has been one of the strongest at underage level in the county with several titles at Under 12, Under 14, and Under 16, including two F√©ile titles.  Name  The club is named after two local men, both named Thomas Larkin, who played separate yet significant roles in local history. * Tom Larkin of Gurteeny, Woodford. In 1886, during a week-long eviction at a premise known as Saunder's Fort in Woodford, Tom stood up to an RIC constable who was roughly treating a young girl and struck him. Tom was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the overcrowded Kilkenny Gaol where he died of reported neglect in 1887 aged 23. * Fr. Tom Larkin of Ballinakill. Thought of locally as one of the most devoted lovers of all that was Irish: games, music and dancing. He fostered hurling in Ballinakill and in all East Galway when he was Chairman. Fr. Larkin played a leading part in G.A.A affairs in Co. Galway in the 1920s and 1930s and it was he who coached the great Tynagh teams which won ten Co. Galway senior championships and supplied the backbone of the Galway team which won the All- Ireland of 1923. He was also the founder of the Ballinakill C√©il√≠ Band. He died in 1949 aged 58.

Background Pranay Chulet witnessed first-hand the disruption that Craigslist had caused by taking classifieds online and quickly realized there was an opportunity to bring similar disruption to the Indian market as well. Sensing the enormous potential, Pranay moved back to India to start the country‚Äôs first homegrown online classifieds platform, Quikr. In 2008, when the platform was first launched, there was a level of mistrust as Indians were used to being able to touch and feel what they were buying or selling and Quikr allowed people to do just that, by positioning it as a handshake platform where buyers and sellers could meet, chat, bargain and strike deals. His deep understanding of consumer behaviour and market trends in India has made Quikr India‚Äôs leading cross-category classifieds platform. It is currently the largest and broadest cross-category classifieds platform catering to over 30Mn unique visitors every month. It operates in 14 categories and connects buyers and sellers across 1200 cities and towns in India. While he started the company as a conventional playbook based classifieds platform, in the year 2016, he took another bold step and made Quikr the first horizontal classifieds platform to have chosen the verticalization path. He expanded the brand‚Äôs footprint in C2C, Services, Cars, Homes, and Jobs, thereby building categories that have strong growth potential through these verticals. It wasn‚Äôt too long before Quikr pioneered several other innovations including Missed Call service, Quikr Nxt, Maximum Selling Price (MSP), or QuikrScanner amongst many others. His idea was to bridge the gap between aspirations & affordability for Indian consumers and he did exactly that through multiple innovations and industry-firsts. Under his leadership, Quikr became the first and only platform to bring the convenience of e-commerce to pre-owned goods through Quikr Doorstep which facilitates price negotiations, payment, pick-up, and delivery across the country. Today, Quikr‚Äôs business advances the local circular economy, where the business model encourages people to engage in the waste-to-wealth concept. His vision of putting second-hand first is gaining popularity, considering the environmental benefits associated with reusing products. Career The mining town in India where Pranay Chulet grew up had just about 10,000 people and he was the first student from his school to even attempt the admissions test for the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). Acing the test, he successfully qualified as an engineer and moved on to win a gold medal at India‚Äôs premier business school, the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (IIM-C). Shortly after, he started at Procter & Gamble, consequently moving to New York, spending over 11 years in management consulting with a series of companies including Mitchell Madison Group. His work at Walker Digital earned him a US patent in the area of matchmaking between buyers and sellers. Subsequently, Pranay helped large US media companies such as movie studios and publishers evaluate and launch new digital businesses as a Principal at Booz & Co. in New York. While at Walker Digital, Priceline‚Äôs incubator, his entrepreneurial spirit came to fore where he earned a patent for a system that allowed small businesses to provide most relevant online references to prospective customers. Pranay graduated from IIM Calcutta with a Gold Medal in 1996 and earned a B.Tech. from IIT Delhi prior to that. He is an avid follower of films and likes them to the extent that he learned filmmaking at the New York Film Academy.

The cheese is made in two fat content categories: 20+ and 40+. 20+ Kanterkaas contains a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 25% of fat in the dry matter. Twelve days after production, it must have a humidity content of not more than 48.5%. 40+ Kanterkaas has a fat content ranging between 40 and 44% in the dry matter. Twelve days after production, it must have a humidity content of not more than 41.5%. The rind of Kanterkaas and Kanternagelkaas may be 'natural' or treated with a colorless or yellow coating material. In addition to these a red coating material may be used for Kanterkomijnekaas.The preceding sentences contain content from the European Commission and may be reused for commercial or non-commercial purposes provided the following attribution is present: ¬© European Union, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/, 1998‚Äì2014.  Taste  The taste of the cheese changes noticeably as it ages. Plain kanterkaas has a pleasant and sharp to strong flavor. Kanterkomijnekaas is fragrant, flavored, pleasant and mild to strong. Kanternagelkaas tastes fragrant, flavored, pleasant and sharp to strong.

Kurt Walter Bachstitz (4 October 1882 ‚Äì 1949 in The Hague) was a German-Austrian art dealer. He died shortly before his naturalization to the Netherlands. General Information =Until Emigration 1938= Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German Breslau (the present-day Polish Wroc≈Çaw) as his place of birth.NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931. He studied architecture in Paris, London and Vienna where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the First World War he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189 He married Elfriede Pes√© (died in 1918) with whom he had two children ‚Äì a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in Switzerland and a daughter, Margit MarthaFile RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns) who died in South Africa in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa (\\"Lilly\\") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a Protestant. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary Thomas Mann wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a \\"blond-Jewish\\" example of an \\"international culture-capitalistic profiteer\\".Thomas Mann Tageb√ºcher, 1918‚Äì1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, , S. 143 ‚Äì 145 '\\"Der Mensch, blond-j√ºdisch und elegant, Mitte drei√üig, mit Monokel und fetten, wei√üen, manik√ºrten H√§nden, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums.\\" In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in Berlin and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, New York City and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer Walter Andreas Hofer who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for Hermann G√∂ring. In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague. =World War II= Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the \\"Sondernauftrag Linz\\" that was run by Hitler's Special Representative of the planned 'F√ºhrermuseum' in Linz,Looted Art Commission. \\"Munich's Looted Art Bazaar Sueddeutsche Zeitung 25 June 2016, 25 June 2016 Von Catrin Lorch und J√∂rg H√§ntzschelz\\" Hans Posse until his death in 1942.

Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the warNL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915‚Äì1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646) the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities. In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the \\"Wirtschaftsamt\\") as he had failed to register the gallery as \\"non-Aryan property\\". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of G√∂ring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority. Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by Kurt Martin, the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under Robert Heinrich Wagner. 10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015 In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.

They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949.

The gallery's art library was auctioned off. In 2009 the Dutch government restituted the painting \\"Roman Capriccio\\" by Pietro Capelli from the stock of the SNK to Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren. The Restitution Committee of the Netherlands denied though a restitution claim concerning a number of other works, among them the works sold to Hitler (Sonderauftrag Linz). In view of most of these works the Committee argued that these sales had not been made under duress because Kurt Walter Bachstitz had been left \\"undisturbed\\" in 1940 and 1941. The grandchildren applied in 2013 for the re- opening of the case in this regard.Act RC 4.138 In July 2013 the Prussian Heritage Foundation restituted a Tyrolean gothic wall-mounted writing slate (c. 1500) and a large 16th-century Italian bronze mortar.

It is the brightest member of the loose open cluster Collinder 228 and one of the brightest stars in the Carina Nebula. The apparent magnitude is variable from +6.16 to +6.49 with a period of 6 days. Description QZ Carinae is approximately 2,300 parsecs (7,500 light-years) from Earth in the Carina Nebula star-forming region. It is composed of four massive luminous stars, designated A1 and A2, and B1 and B2. The A1/A2 and B1/B2 pairs take no more than 25 years to orbit each other, while the A pair completes an orbit around each other every 20.7 days and the B pair every 6.0 days. The system is bright at x-ray wavelengths primarily due to colliding stellar winds in the two close pairs. Pair A1/A2 contributes the bulk of the x-ray luminosity. Components QZ Carinae A1 is a blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7I with around 40 times the Sun's mass that has expanded to 22.5 times the Sun's radius. With a surface temperature of 32,000 K, it is around 500,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Its partner A2 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B2V with around 10 times the Sun's mass and 6 times its radius. With a surface temperature of 20,000 K, it is around 5,000 times as luminous as the Sun. QZ Carinae B1 is a hot blue giant that is expanding and cooling away from the main sequence. It is of spectral type O8III with around 14.1 times the Sun's mass and 26.9 times its radius. With a surface temperature of 32,573 K, it is around 200,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Partner B2 is a hot main sequence star of spectral type O9V with around 28 times the Sun's mass and 8.9 times its radius. With a surface temperature of 32,463 K, it is around 80,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Star B1 is less massive than B2 and is assumed to have undergone significant mass loss or mass transfer to B2. Together, all four stars have a combined mass 94 times that of the Sun. Variability Star B is a Beta Lyrae variable eclipsing system. It causes the apparent magnitude of the system to vary regularly every 5.999 days from +6.16 at maximum to +6.49 at the primary minimum and +6.43 at the secondary minimum. It was first noted to be variable in 1972 by observers in Auckland.

Discovery  Titanocene dichloride is known to be a potential anticancer drug since the late 1970s. After initial clinical trials against breast and renal-cell cancer were performed with this compound, the search for improved derivatives started. Particularly, lipophilic titanocene dichloride derivatives derived from fulvenes were synthesised in structural diversity and this led to the development of bis[(p-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl]titanium(IV) dichloride, which became better known in the literature under its trivial name of Titanocene Y.  Mechanism of action  Titanocene Y is a cytotoxic apoptosis-inducing and anti-angiogenic drug candidate targeting renal-cell cancer and other solid tumors. The compound is transported via serum albumin selectively into cancer cells and targets their DNA by coordinating strongly to phosphate groups. Additionally, Titanocene Y is able to induce apoptosis via the FAS receptor pathway. Very encouraging is the fact that Titanocene Y is breaking platinum- resistance in human colon and human lung cancer cells, which might make it attractive as a cytotoxic component of future 2nd or 3rd line cancer treatments.  Animal testing  Titanocene Y was tested extensively in vivo; it showed promising results against xenografted human epidermoid carcinoma and prostate cancer, while best results are reached against breast and renal-cell cancer. Titanocene Y can be given in the mouse in high dosages and it shows generally mild toxicity in the form of diarrhea. Titanocene Y is not patent protected and would therefore benefit from non-commercial sponsoring to develop it into a cytotoxic drug candidate for the treatment of advanced renal-cell cancer ‚Äì an area in need of better therapies.

Fort Pitt Beer's distribution network along with other brands, were established throughout Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland.

Fort Pitt Brewing Company, however, remained successfully in business by selling a wide variety of non-alcoholic serial beverages in 27 states from Massachusetts to California. After the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 which led to the repeal of prohibition laws, Fort Pitt soon brought alcoholic beer back to Pittsburgh. Management initially found that the brewing industry had changed significantly since 1920 based upon many technological advances in the brewing process. However, the economics of selling beer had also drastically changed especially in light of the fact that Fort Pitt was able to thrive on pre- prohibition saloon sales which were 60% of draft beer in bars. As a result of the introduction of steel cans into the market, a growing portion of Fort Pitt sales had increased. Fort Pitt played an increasingly larger role through point of sales signs in bars, supermarkets and liquor stores, outer billboards, newspapers, and eventually commercials on radio and television. In fact, the 1935 US Open Golf Championship held at Pittsburgh's Oakmont Country Club, Fort Pitt printed the admission cards including its logo on each ticket. In the 1930s, Fort Pitt Brewing Company acquired the Victor Brewing Company in Jeannette, Pennsylvania. A wholesaler receipt from 1936 priced one case of Fort Pitt Brewing Company's beer at $1.65 at that time. = Pittsburgh‚Äôs #1 = Selling a record 114,000 barrels of beer in 1935, Fort Pitt soon put itself in a position to dominate the local beer market. However, Samuel Grenet, the company's president for nearly three decades died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 67. Without Grenet's vision as well as political and personal connections, led Fort Pitt sales to significantly decline to a record low of 86,000 barrels in 1937. Michael Berardino, with thirty years of experience in the brewing industry, was appointed as the new president. The new management began with an aggressive marketing program in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, Western New York, Western Maryland and Northwest West Virginia. By 1940, as a result of additional upgrades and expansion of the plant located in Sharpsburg, the plant's annual capacity increased to 450,000 barrels. The company looked for another existing plant to acquire which it found in Jeannette, PA. Upon the outset of World War II, the company continued to grow and was estimated as the country's 23rd largest brewery. In 1949, despite competition from national beer brands, Fort Pitt was not only number one in Pittsburgh, but Pennsylvania in total beer sales. The company embarked on another expansion of the Sharpsburg plant costing $3 million. As quickly as the sales had risen, they suddenly dropped off in 1950 to just under 1 million barrels. The sudden decline was blamed on the overall drop in beer sales nationally, an unusually cool summer with less demand for beer, and a regional over supply of beer from the large national brewers. Fort Pitt remained optimistic that the sales would improve at the beginning of 1952 especially with the release of a new Fort Pitt Pilsener beer. Berandino stated that the beer was reformulated in response to a growing demand for beer with pale, dry and less filling characteristics. Berandino also pointed out that Fort Pitt Beer was one of the nation's largest user of imported hops. = 1952 Strike - The Beginning of the End = For the most part, Pittsburgh's three largest breweries, Fort Pitt, Duquesne and Iron City had not experienced major labor problems. In April 1952, all 2,100 of the Pittsburgh area brewery workers went on strike. Although all three of the city's major breweries were adversely affected, the most damaging effect was on Fort Pitt. As a result of this extended strike, national beers were once again introduced into the market in an overabundant supply throughout Western Pennsylvania. The end result was that many of the once loyal beer drinkers switched to the national brands on a permanent basis. According to the prevailing opinion from a local beet tradesman, Fort Pitt's demise was based on a panic in promptly returning the product into the market place ahead of Duquesne and Iron City. All three breweries had significant product warehoused throughout the ongoing labor negotiations between all three local breweries and the unions. While Duquesne and Iron City disposed of all of their outdated product, in stark contrast, Fort Pitt introduced the warehoused beer into the market place in order to take advantage of the pent up demand. Since the beer introduced into the market was spoiled or ‚Äúskunked‚Äù, Fort Pitt lost its longstanding #1 spot in sales throughout Pittsburgh to Duquesne and Iron City. Fort Pitt's sales decreased 40% leaving the company with a financial loss for the first time in over a decade. After the death of Berardino, in August 1957, the company announced it would cease brewing operations at the Sharpsburg plant in order to free more capital to invest in the newly incorporated Fort Pitt Industries. Although it would not be the immediate end of the Fort Pitt brand, the rights were sold to Gunther Brewing Company of Baltimore for 1.3 million dollars, and Gunther Brewing Company acquired the company. = The Clock = The former Duquesne Brewing Company clock which stands on the Pittsburgh South Side Brew House was originally part of a billboard that stood at the base of Mt. Washington overlooking Carson Street in close proximity to the P&LE; Railroad headquarters. The clock had been built by Audichron Company for $12,500.00. The face measured 55‚Äô in diameter and was given a spectacular view of the downtown across the Monongahela River. On July 1, 1938, Fort Pitt President Berardino flipped the switch to turn the lights on for the brand which continued to use the sign for several years before it was rented later by Carling, Ballantine and other companies. In 1960, the clock was purchased by Duquesne Brewing Company and installed on its new brew house where it currently remains today advertising AT&T.; =Publications= Fort Pitt Brewing Company published a 79-page book about baseball titled Aunt Minnie's Scrapbook: Humorous Tales of the Diamond that was authored by Albert Kennedy \\"Rosey\\" Rowswell. A date of publication appears to have been omitted.  2014 Fort Pitt revival  After resurrecting Duquesne Beer in 2010, Mark Dudash, a Pittsburgh native and attorney, obtained ownership of the Fort Pitt name. In the spring of 2014, Dudash will launch Fort Pitt Ale under Fort Pitt Brewing Company. In maintaining its traditional roots in the Western Pennsylvania region, Fort Pitt is crafted in the spirit of the first brewery established by the British Army within the confines of Fort Pitt west of the Alleghenies in 1765. Due to the absence of pure spring water for drinking, beer was generally the preferred beverage for the early pioneers. The heat generated from the brewing process and presence of alcohol served to suppress the growth of contamination bacteria. The brewery supported the troops and settlers until the British Army abandoned the complex in 1772. Fort Pitt is formulated as an ale using two row malt, caramel and English hops, as a recreation of a traditional English ale. Dudash has included the same family of English hops that were transported by the English Army over the mountains of the Allegheny in order to brew the first ale in 1765. The new Fort Pitt has very few similarities to the beer brewed and packaged in the Jeannette or Sharpsburg plant, but instead recreates the taste which the first settlers of Pittsburgh experienced within the confines of Fort Pitt.

It has gained huge appreciation form the India's audience. It also going to air on Zindagi Channel (India) from 16 February 2016 to 10 March 2016 every Monday to Saturday night 9pm.  Plot  Zohab is the main lead male character and is abducted by Nayab's cousin Raza. Zohab is blindfolded and is forced to marry Nayab. The story takes new twists and turns on a speedy pace. Do Qadam Dur Thay is a tale of love affection grief and sorrow, revolving around a married couple and their search for each other. While on the search they bump into one another. They are together for a long time and to make the situation even more dramatic start developing feelings, not knowing that they are lawfully wedded. Nayab Iqbal (Aiza Khan), a beautiful young girl, is the daughter of an officer. Since her parents died, her father's middle-class younger brother looks after her as his own daughter, but his second wife treats her like a servant. Nayab's uncle's less educated son Raza (from his first wife) is the only one who treats Nayab with love and care; he silently loves Nayab, but he cannot marry her due to his lower status, while Nayab considers him as a brother. One day, Raza realises that his stepmother intends to sell off Nayab to an older man on the pretext of marriage, with that older man being a pimp in reality. He makes a hasty decision of rescuing Nayab and himself from this scheming, greedy stepmother. He finds Zohabuddeen (Sami Khan), an educated and wealthy young man managing his family business, to be a suitable life partner for the beautiful and educated Nayab. That very night he gives a bridal dress to Nayab and asks her to be prepared, for they would be leaving soon. Nayab is confused seeing the bridal suit and asks Raza if they would be marrying each other. He does not answer her and rushes off to make preparations. In the dead of the night, Raza and Nayab escape the house. The next morning, Zohabuddeen, fondly called as Zoab by his doting mother and grandfather, is getting ready to leave for work. While he is on the way, his car is accosted by Raza and his friends and they kidnap him and take him away in their car. Nayab, dressed up in her bridal suit, is waiting in an old small house. Raza arrives there with his friends, qazi sahab and Zoab (who is blindfolded). They remove his blindfold and seat him in a chair, with a gun pointed to his head. Raza goes to fetch Nayab, she is worried if he is doing the right thing, he asks her to have trust in him. Qazi sahab says what they are doing is not right, nikaah should be done with consent of the bride and the groom, and not forcibly. Yet they compel him to do the nikaah. Nayab has covered her head and face with a veil, hence both Nayab and Zoab do not see each other's face. They make Zoab sign the marriage document at gun-point. Once the nikaah is done, qazi sahab is escorted away by Raza's friends. Raza hands the Nikaahnama (the marriage document), along with a letter and some money, to Nayab. And he apologises to Zoab for his misbehaviour and makes Zoab promise him that he would take good care of Nayab, and leaves with his friends. Zoab is worried that he cannot take this unknown girl home as his mother is a heart patient and cannot take such shocking news. He tries to leave but Nayab holds his hand, while her face is still hidden under the veil. He has no option but to tag her along. Both do not attempt to make a conversation, as Zoab is worried what to do next and Nayab is shy to initiate any talk by herself. They walk out slowly trying to find a way back, Zoab walking ahead and Nayab holding his hand and following. All the while Zoab thinking how to find a solution of this problem, he starts to smoke a cigarette. Struck by a sudden thought, Zoab puts the burning cigarette on Nayab's clutching hand. Due to the sudden pain, she has to let go of his hand and he makes an escape, leaving her alone in the middle of the road. He runs back to his car, and heads to his office. While she removes her veil and looks around for him. She doesn't even know what he looks like, all she knows about him is the name Zohabuddeen. Tired of walking around in that heavy attire, she sits down on the footpath and reads the letter Raza has given her. In the letter, he states that he has loved her since the day he has set his eyes on her, much before her parents' death. And he would have married her himself, but he could not as he was no match for her as she was beautiful and educated, while he was an uneducated poor man with no money or future. So he found her a match that suited her beauty and brains. While he is on his way to Dubai in search of a living. And he has also provided the address and contact details of Zohabuddeen, in the letter. A beggar woman approaches Nayab and asks for alms. From the money Raza left her, Nayab gives the woman a certain amount and shows her the remaining money, saying that is all she has. The woman advises her not to keep money in open like that, or it could be stolen. Nayab asks the woman if she could help her find a phone to contact her husband. The beggar takes her to the nearest shop with a PCO, where she could make her phone call. But before she could place the call, her money gets snatched away by some local pickpocket, along with Raza's letter and her nikaahnama. And the pickpocket runs away, leaving her empty handed. Nayab asks the beggar woman to take her to her home. The woman takes her to the beggar colony, amidst lewd comments and lustful glances from male beggars. Meanwhile, Zoab talks to his best friend and realises his mistake and goes back to the same spot he had abandoned her, only to find her missing. His friend's talk makes him feel guilty of his action. Nayab spends the night at the beggar woman's tent. The woman protects Nayab from drunken beggars at night and the next morning requests Nayab to leave as the place is neither suitable for her nor safe. She even gives Nayab some money and a pair of her best clothes given to her by some rich woman. Nayab changes into it and leaves her wedding dress as a gift to the beggar woman for her hospitality. While walking on the streets alone Nayab feels dizzy because of hunger and hires a cab to take her to a hospital. She faints in the cab itself. The cab driver brings her to a clinic, where Dr. Salman (Alyy Khan) shifts her to his house behind his clinic. He is smitten by her beauty and innocence while she lays unconscious. She wakes up and asks him why he has kept her in his house and she wishes to leave. He asks her to stay until her health gets better. As days go by, he makes reasons to make her stay longer, even buys her clothes to wear. She promises to return all his favours, once she is capable enough to. Zoab's sister visits his home with her kids to find Zoab all cranky and worried, especially at the mention of his marriage. So, his mother and sister plan to call back his cousin Nisha, from London, to cheer him up. Nisha has been in love with Zoab since college, but has been rejected by him time and again so is heartbroken. Yet, she agrees to give a last try. Zoab is rude and arrogant towards Nisha, even after her long absence. His family encourages her to be strong. Once while visiting Zoab at his office, it starts to rain so Nisha pulls Zoab outside to enjoy the rain. Her brother, who turns out to be Dr. Salman, calls her to tell her that he has finally fallen in love and gives the phone to Nayab telling that his sister wishes to speak to her. Nayab takes the call but due to rain the network reception is not quite clear. So, Nisha hand over her phone to Zoab to talk while she dries her hair. Zoab and Nayab have a small, polite conversation. Dr. Salman proposes marriage to Nayab but she declines saying even if she wants to she cannot accept his proposal, but she does not disclose to him about her marriage. She just says she is in search of someone, and until she finds that person she cannot take any decisions of her life. She requests him to find her a place in Dar-ul-Amaan (women shelter), as she cannot live at his house anymore. Although heartbroken by her rejection, Salman makes arrangements for her to stay at a dar-ul-amaan, where he is a trustee and gives her a reference letter to give at the women shelter. The next morning, Nayab leaves without meeting Salman. Meanwhile, Nisha convinces Zoab to accompany her to Salman's house to meet the girl he has finally found. While Zoab and Nisha are on their way, they encounter Nayab walking with her bag. Zoab driving car rashly sprays Nayab's clothes with mud. Nayab is angry, so Nisha and Zoab get down to apologise to her. They offer to drop her where ever she wishes to go. She asks them to drop her at the dar-ul-amaan. They are surprised as she does not seem to belong to such a place but they still do as she wishes. They drop her and return to Salman's house, to find Salman distraught. Nayab impresses some woman of Dar ul Amaan and force them to sale handcrafts they made. Nayab herself goes to an office for the sale of the crafts. The office turns out to be of Zoab. He is smitten by her beauty. After a lot of forcing Zaob manages Nayab to work as a nurse for his mother. He then confess that he loves her. Nayab rejects saying that she is married which hurts Zoab. On the other hand, Salman confess to her sister that he loves Nayab. Nayab gets kidnapped due to standing against the management of Daarul Aman. She somehow calls Zoab where she finds out that Zoab is Zohab uddin. Zoab rescues her and brings her back home. Nayab finds their Nikahnama (marriage proof) in Zoab‚Äôs drawers and is happy to find him. Nayab starts to get free and close to him since he is husband. Zoab unaware of this feels happy thinking that Nayab loves him and not her husband. Things get worse when Zoab's mother asks him to send Nayab back since she was kidnapped. Salman discovers that Nayab lives in Zoab's house and reaches there with proposal again but gets disheartened when Zoab confess that he loves Nayab. The decision choice is then given to Nayab to choose between these two. Nayab then hears Zoab's mother point of view about her and leaves. Zoab's mother forces him to marry Nisha. Zoab reaches Darul Aman but Nayab refuses to meet him and asks her friends to lie that she is not here. Zoab heartbroken agrees to his mother while still waiting for Nayab.Suddenly Nayab discovers that she is expecting. Her daarul aman friends and the beggar woman ask her to go back to his husband's house. Nayab then reaches there on wedding of Zoab. She reveals about her marriage to Zoab's mother and grandfather. Nayab then starts to leave but Nisha asks Zoab to stop her and calls of her wedding and leaves with her brother Salman wishing a happy life to Nayab And Zoab.

Born to a poor family in a remote village of Odisha, she fought successfully the widely prevalent social taboo against educating women, walked 15 km daily amidst hilly terrain and swamp to the only high school in the entire region to emerge as first woman matriculate of her village and subsequently the first woman law graduate of her region. The life story of Manasi Pradhan has been adopted as documentaries in United States and Israel. Early life and education Pradhan was born to a poor family in a remote village called Ayatapur in Banapur block of Khordha district, Odisha. She was the eldest among two daughters and a son born to Hemalata Pradhan and Godabarish Pradhan. Her father was a farmer and mother a house wife. Female education was considered a major taboo in most rural areas of Banapur then. Girls were rarely allowed to attend high school. After completing her middle school in the village, there was strong pressure to end her studies. Further, there was no high school in the nearby areas. She walked 15 km daily, amidst hilly terrain and swamp, to the only high school in the entire region, to emerge as the first woman to pass high school examination in her village. After completing her schooling from Patitapaban High School in Gambharimunda, the family shifted to Puri for her college education. With little earning from the village farmland, it became difficult to sustain. Soon after passing the intermediate examination, she had to work to support her family and her studies. She earned a B.A. in Economics from Government Women‚Äôs College, Puri, and M.A. in Odia literature from Utkal University. She obtained Bachelor of Laws from G.M. Law College, Puri.

Career She worked with the finance department, Govt. of Odisha and Andhra Bank for a short period but left both to pursue her own passion. In October 1983, at the age of 21, she began her own printing business and a literary journal. In few years time, the business grew exponentially, putting her in the league of few successful women entrepreneurs of her time. Activism In 1987, she founded OYSS Women. The initial motive was to help girl students achieve higher education and develop them as future leaders in the society. OYSS Women has been organizing leadership workshops, education and vocational training camps, legal awareness and self-defense camps, nurturing thousands of young women as prospective leaders in their chosen field. Apart from the above, the organization undertakes numerous activities and events and is widely credited for pioneering contribution in empowering women. The organization is also spearheading the Honour for Women National Campaign. Honour for Women National Campaign In November 2009, she launched the Honour for Women National Campaign, a nationwide movement to end violence against women in India. The movement has been instrumental in galvanizing the nation against women atrocities. The movement employs a multi-pronged strategy to fight the menace of violence against women in India. It uses a plethora of vehicles i.e. women‚Äôs rights stall, women‚Äôs rights festival, women‚Äôs rights meets, women‚Äôs rights literature, audio-visual displays, street plays etc. to raise awareness on legal and institutional provisions to fight atrocities on women. On the other hand, it puts pressure on the state by mobilizing public opinion and sustained campaigning for institutional changes and correctional measures to contain violence against women. In 2013, after a four year long churning involving a series of national seminars, workshops and consultations involving stakeholders from across India, the movement came up with a detailed draft charting its fight to end violence against women. In 2014, the movement released a Four-Point Charter of Demand for all state governments of India. In the same year, it launched Nirbhaya Vahini, consisting of over 10,000 volunteers spread across India to mobilize public opinion and engage in a sustained campaign for implementation of its four-point charter of demand. Four-Point Charter of Demand In 2014, the Honour for Women National Campaign headed by Manasi Pradhan released a four-point charter of demand for all state governments of India. The charter forms a cornerstone of the movement and has led several state governments to make suitable amendments. # Complete clamp down on liquor trade # Self-defense training for women as part of educational curriculum # Special protection force for women security in every district # Fast-track court and special investigating & prosecuting wing for crime against women in every district.

Cherry found that participants were able to detect their name from the unattended channel, the channel they were not shadowing. Moray build his research using Cherry's shadowing task. He was able to conclude that almost none of the rejected messages were able to penetrate the block set up, except subjectively \\"important\\" messages. Neville Moray used Cherry's shadowed dichotic listening task in his 1959 research and was able to conclude that almost none of the rejected messages were able to penetrate the block set up, except subjectively \\"important\\" messages. Personal names, taboo language, and backward language are the \\"subjectively\\" important messages that have been found to date. Moray's 1959 study found a 33% detection rate for personal names, which revealed that participants sometimes notice their name in an ignored auditory channel. This ability to selectively attend to one's own name has been found in infants as young as five months of age and appears to be fully developed by thirteen months of age. Rochelle S. Newman in a 2005 study found that five- month-old infants listened longer to their names when the target voice was 10 dB, but not 5 dB more intense than the background noise. Nine-month-olds also failed at 5 dB, but thirteen-month-olds succeeded. This success in recognizing one's own name in the unattended channel can be explained using Cherry's initial report on dichotic shadowing. Cherry found that the verbal content of the message in the unattended channel was completely blocked, so that the words were treated as merely sounds. This allows the subject to know that something has stimulated the ear whose message is rejected. It may be thought of as a general warning signal, that a sound has occurred to which the subject might need to respond.

Museum history German author Karl May (1842‚Äì1912), wrote many books about the American frontier and Native Americans featuring the fictional characters Winnetou (a Mescalero-Apache Chief) and Old Shatterhand (a white European settler). Mays' books were popular in Germany and created a mystique about the \\"Wild West\\" in German popular culture. The museum opened in 1928 in Radebeul, in the house where May had lived, called Villa Shatterhand. It was founded during a peak of interest in the US frontier and native Americans, fostered in part by the Sarrasani circus, which was headquartered in nearby Dresden, and which was very popular in the 1920s. Sarassani and Native American members of the circus came to the opening, and the Native Americans performed death songs for May. The museum was founded by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named Ernst Tobis, who was a fan of May's work and had travelled to the American frontier, and liked to tell tall tales about his time there. Tobis donated a large collection of artifacts to help found the museum's collection, which included 17 scalps, some of them from Native Americans. When the Nazis took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork. Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and to hear stories from Tobis. After World War II, the original museum was in East Germany and a replica was built in Bamburg in West Germany. A person who called himself Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance became associated with the museum shortly after the war ended. From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the \\"Indianer Museum\\", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government, in part because of the association with the Nazis, but also because the books were viewed as leading people to want to travel, which the government did not allow. During the Cold War placards in the museum in Radebeul and its displays were refactored to describe oppression of Native Americans by the US, as part of Soviet propaganda efforts to rally indigenous people against the West. Some East Germans also did work with the American Indian Movement. Scalp exhibited at the museum The museum in Radebul was given its original name again in 1986, as the East German government moved to reclaim May. The renaming led to an exhibition focused on May in February, which had 4,000 visitors a day, and people waited for three hours outside to get in. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, attendance at the Radebul museum dropped from around 300,000 people per year to around 60,000, as people could travel to the US instead of visiting the museum, which had been one of the only sources of information about Native Americans in East Germany. In 2010, according to the South China Morning Post, US activists began seeking repatriation of the scalps. Berlin-based journalist Mark Worth brought the scalps to the attention of Karen Little Coyote of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, who wrote a letter asking for the scalps to be returned in the fall of 2013. In 2013, the German Museums Association issued a guideline on the care of human remains, listing scalps from peoples who \\"fashioned trophies from the heads of their killed enemies\\" as an exception to \\"human remains acquired in a context of injustice\\". In March 2014, Cecil E. Pavlat, who works on return of artifacts for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, wrote a letter asking for return of the scalps. Later in 2014, the Museum agreed to turn the scalps over to another institution for authentication. The Museum had not returned the scalps as of 2016, saying there were doubts about the original story of the provenance of the 17 scalps, although they did remove them from public display. The director of the museum in Radebul from 1985 to 2014 was Ren√© Wagner; Christian Wacker was appointed director in 2018. The museum received a donation of new artifacts in 2018.

Description The structure was built circa 1877 and is one of three surviving structures in Silver Reef. The building housed the offices of the Wells Fargo Company. The structure was built by local masons George Brooks and Ira McMullin of local red sandstone, with finished ashlar masonry by Brooks in the front and coursed rubble stone by McMullin on the other three sides. A parapet surrounds the single-slope roof on the front and sides. The main level is divided into two equal-sized rooms, each with two front entrances and a rear entrance, with a vault on one side. The basement does not connect to the upper levels. It was used as a stable. The Wells Fargo building was used as a mine supply store in the late 19th century, then for a time as the residence of the Colbath family. Its last use was as offices for the Western Gold and Uranium Company, who added a rear porch structure. The building is owned by Washington County. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 11, 1971.

Her brother, the late Lodi Gyari Rinpoche, the envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and chairperson of International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), raised the profile of Tibet in the global sphere and for leading the ten rounds of Sino-Tibet dialogues until 2010. He was a much-respected diplomat in the global political corridors, representing Tibet and Tibetans for most of his life.  Activism  Gyari was a student leader who represented girl students, international students, Tibetan students, and Tibetan women students through various student groups and committees during her days in Darjeeling and Chandigarh. She worked for the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress in Chandigarh during the same time and joined the central Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) later. TYC is the largest grassroots Non-governmental organization in the Tibetan exile community across the world. Gyari was elected as the executive member of Central TYC and worked as Information Secretary and Joint Secretary for two terms in the late 80s.  Political career  She was elected to the Tibetan parliament in exile at 26 and served for close to two decades, from 1991 to 2011, as a member of parliament and as deputy speaker, the highest position held by a Tibetan woman in the history of Tibet. During her time as MP and Deputy Speaker, she was a part of the major transitions the Tibetan democracy adopted, from the drafting of the charter-in-exile to direct election of Kalon Tripa (Head of the Cabinet) by the people, to revisiting Tibetan political approach, connecting with world leaders and people to the devolution of political power by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In 2011, Gyari announced her decision to run for sikyong (political leader), equivalent to the prime minister of a country, but withdrew later. After the election, she was appointed as the Nangsi Kalon (Home Minister) of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA). During her tenure as CTA Home Minister, the Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy of 2014 was formulated by the government of India, which addressed the many lands and social welfare concerns of the Tibetan refugees. In 2004, she was appointed by the Dalai Lama to be the Chairperson of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD), taking over from Prof. S. Samdhong Rinpoche.  Awards  Gyari is a recipient of the Nari Shakti award presented by International Nepali Sanskritik Parishad, Uttam Nagrik Puraskar by the Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Akademy, and Peace of India award presented by Goa state.

Such was the violence directed at and carried out towards women that Human Rights Watch (HRW) described it as \\"a war within a war\\". HRW has reported that as of March 2013, civil conflict had reignited when the militia, March 23 Movement (M23), resumed hostilities following a ceasefire. Girls from the age of five to women aged eighty have been assaulted and sexually mutilated. Others were raped and their families forced to watch. By 2008 the United Nations (UN) had estimated that up to 200,000 females had suffered from some form of sexual violence. The brutality of the rapes have caused long term health, social, familial, and psychological problems. There have been reports of infants aged one being raped, as well as women in their nineties. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) reported that over 50 percent of survivors believed that the use of rape was a deliberate tactic used for the extermination of the Congolese people. While females have been the primary victims of sexual violence, men and boys are also sexually assaulted. In 2009, several non- governmental organizations including HRW and Amnesty International (AI) reported that the rape of males in the DRC was systematic, and on the increase. The majority of the rapes have been carried out by militias, such as the Lord's Resistance Army, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the Mai-Mai and the Congr√®s national pour la d√©fense du peuple. Since 2009, rapes, killings and human rights violations carried out by the armed forces (FARDC) of the DRC have increased.  Rape as Genocide  \\"Photo: USAID/Leah Werchick; Rape victims who have been successfully reintegrated into their communities assemble in a \\"peace hut\\" near Walungu, South Kivu in DRC.\\" According to Amnesty International, the use of rape during times of war is not a by-product of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In the last quarter of a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return. In the DRC the genocidal rape was focused on the destruction of family and communities. An interview with a survivor gave an account of gang rape, forced cannibalism of a fetus taken from an eviscerated woman and child murder.  Estimates of victims  In 2006 Jean-Marie Gu√©henno reported to the UN that in the preceding six months 12,000 women and girls had been raped. In 2009 it was estimated that there were 1100 rapes per month, with 72 per cent of survivors stating they had been tortured during their assaults. In 2011 alone it was estimated that there were up to 400,000 rapes. In 2013 HRW reported that M23 had killed 44 civilians and had raped at least 61 women and girls near the city of Goma. An article in the American Journal of Public Health gave an estimate of two million victims of rape by 2011. According to statistics of rape victims shown to Shelly Whitman during a visit to Panzi Hospital in Bukavu in 2010, 66 girls under the age of three and 50 women over the age of 65 had been admitted to the hospital for treatment due to sexual violence between January and July 2010. Statistics provided by local health centres show that 13 per cent of all survivors were under fourteen years old. The HRW operative to the DRC, Anneke Van Woudenberg, has said of the widespread use of rape that \\"it has become a defining characteristic\\" of the conflict.  Aftermath  HRW reported that girls aged five to women aged eighty were assaulted with exceptional brutality, with knives and razor blades being used to mutilate the vagina. Families were forced to watch women being sexually assaulted. Survivors of the attacks have reported major health issues as a result of the rapes. 87 percent reported vaginal discharge and 79 percent have reported lower abdominal pains. Fistulas were commonplace among survivors, 41 percent reported the discharge of fecal and urinary matter from the vagina. Psychological trauma includes nightmares and insomnia, with 77 percent reporting that they suffered from these. 91 percent of survivors reported that they lived in fear and felt ashamed over the assaults. At the Saint Paul Health Center in Uvira, in a review of medical records from 658 survivors nine percent returned positive for HIV. Other sexual infections were syphilis, with thirteen percent infected, and a further 31 percent were infected with gonorrhea. Few victims seek medical attention, due to the costs associated with health care, and also due to the fact that should it become publicly known that they were raped, these survivors would then be socially stigmatized. In a report from MSF over 50 per cent of survivors indicated they had been assaulted while at work in the fields. These assaults were usually carried out by groups of men who were armed, women were beaten then raped and left lying on the ground. Others stated they had been assaulted during raids on their villages and a large number of women stated they had been raped in the undergrowth where they had gone to hide when they fled their homes. When surveyed on their opinions as to the motivation behind the sexual violence, 83 per cent believed that poor organization, training and a lack of discipline played a contributing role. 57 per cent believed that the sexual violence was used as a tactic for the deliberate extermination of the Congolese people, from the witness statements MSF came to the conclusion that the \\"Sexual violence has been so clearly linked to the military strategy of warring parties and has occurred in such a systematic way that it is wrong to think of it as a side effect of war\\"  War crimes trials  In 2013 a mass trial of 39 FARDC soldiers began. The men were accused of raping 102 women and 33 girls in the township of Minova following their retreat from Goma after an attack by M23 forces. In 2014 the trial concluded with two convictions for rape and the remaining cleared. Maud Jullien, who works for the BBC has said the result is a \\"great disappointment\\", and lawyers for the survivors believe the ruling will result in discouraging other survivors from coming forward.  International and domestic reactions  Mary Robinson, the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region visiting a hospital in Goma where she was guided through the Heal Africa section which assists victims of sexual violence. The United Nations has stated that the DRC is the centre for the use of rape as a weapon of war, with one study finding that 48 women are raped every hour. In 2009 Eve Ensler travelled to the DRC, and having spoken to survivors of their need for a place to heal proposed the, City of Joy. In 2011, V-Day, in association with Fondation Panzi (DRC), opened the City of Joy. The centre is located in Bukavu, and treats 180 survivors of gender related violence per year. Leah Chishugi, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide, traveled to the DRC. Upon discovering the mass rapes which were ongoing she began to document testimony from survivors. In a two-month period she interviewed up to 500 survivors of sexual assaults. The youngest victim was just one year old, and the eldest was 90 and one victim, aged 14, had already given birth twice, having been forcibly impregnated. Chishugi founded the charity Everything is a Benefit which campaigns on behalf of the survivors of the victims of rape and other human rights abuses during civil conflicts. In 1997, doctor Rachel Kembe, with five other professional women founded the Association nationale des mamans pour l‚Äôaide aux d√©sh√©rit√©s (ANAMAD, National Mothers‚Äô Association to Aid the Dispossessed). By 2007 the centre was treating 2500 survivors of rape, but Kembe has said \\"the number keeps growing\\". ANAMAD has constructed housing for up to 30 IDPs and their families, but says they require more funding as their resources are inadequate. Denis Mukwege and his co-workers have treated an estimated 30,000 survivors of rape since the start of the conflicts. He has reported that women have been shot in the genitals following an assault, and others have had chemicals poured over their genitals following rapes. He believes the use of rape is an \\"effective strategy\\" as people are forced to flee their homes and land.

As a four-year-old he won the Grade I Spring Juvenile Hurdle and then recorded an impressive fifteen- length win in the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. A year later he was fatally injured when falling in the Champion Hurdle. Background Our Conor was a bay horse with a white blaze and four socks bred in County Meath by the Gerrardstown House Stud. He was sired by Jeremy, an American-bred horse who won the Jersey Stakes in 2006 and the Sandown Mile in the following year. Apart from Our Conor, the most successful of his progeny has been the Concorde Stakes winner Yellow Rosebud. Our Conor's dam Flamands won two races and was a granddaughter of Sweet Mimosa who won the Prix de Diane and was a full sister of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Levmoss and the dual Ascot Gold Cup winner Le Moss. As a yearling colt, Our Conor was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sales in September 2010 where he was bought for ‚Ç¨4,500 by Sean Tiernan privately for Noel Hayes, whereafter he went into training with Eoin Griffin in Kilkenny. He subsequently entered the ownership of the Man About Town Syndicate and was sent into training with Dessie Hughes at The Curragh, County Kildare. Racing career =2012 Flat season= Our Connor began his racing career on the flat as a three-year-old in 2012. After finishing unplaced on his debut at the Curragh he recorded his first success when he won a seven furlong maiden race at Roscommon Racecourse on 11 June. He followed up later that month by carrying 129 pounds to victory in a one-mile handicap race at Naas. He continued to run in handicaps at around a mile, finishing third at Leopardstown, second at Galway and third at Listowel. =2012/2013 National Hunt Season= During the 2012/2013 National Hunt season Our Conor was campaigned in novice hurdles and was ridden in all four of his races by Bryan Cooper. On his debut over obstacles he started 8/13 for a maiden hurdle at Navan on 11 November. He took the lead at the second last hurdle and accelerated clear of his opponents to win by eight and a half lengths from Casual Creeper. Three weeks later he was moved up in class for the Grade III Bar One Racing Juvenile Hurdle at Fairyhouse and won by two and a half lengths after taking the lead two hurdles from the finish. Our Conor leads Diakali in the 2013 Spring Juvenile Hurdle at Leopardstown. On 9 February, Our Conor was one of seven four-year-old to contest the Grade I Spring Juvenile Hurdle at Leopardstown and started second favourite behind the Willie Mullins trained Diakali. He was restrained by Cooper in the early stages before moving up to overtake Diakali approaching the last and went on to win \\"comfortably\\" by five lengths. On his final appearance of the season, Our Conor was sent to England for the Grade I Triumph Hurdle on 15 March at the Cheltenham Festival. Starting at odds of 5/1, he tracked Diakali before taking the lead at the second last. He quickly drew away from the field and won by fifteen lengths from the Paul Nicholls-trained Far West. After the race Dessie Hughes said \\"everything went well and he jumped brilliant ‚Äì he's a real one isn't he? I couldn't expect a performance like that. He was on the bit all the way, he was loving it. We've had no problems with him whatsoever. He eats and sleeps and any ground is fine for him. He is certainly a Champion Hurdle horse. He stays, he has foot and he jumps\\". Four days after his win at Cheltenham it was announced that Our Conor had been bought for an undisclosed sum by Barry Connell who had previously attempted to buy the horse after he won at Fairyhouse in December. =2013/2014 National Hunt Season= Danny Mullins took over from Bryan Cooper as Our Conor's regular jockey in 2013/2014. The gelding prepared for the new season with a run on the flat, finishing fourth when favourite for the October Handicap at Naas. He returned to hurdling in December and started 3/1 third favourite behind the reigning champion Hurricane Fly and the Jessica Harrington-trained Jezki in the Grade I Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown. He briefly held the lead after the second last but was soon overtaken and weakened in the closing stages behind Hurricane Fly and Jezki, beaten just under six lengths by the winner. the first three met again in the Irish Champion Hurdle over the same course and distance a month later. Our Conor produced an improved performance, finishing second, a length and a half behind Hurricane Fly, with Jezki in fourth. Our Conor appeared for the second time at Cheltenham when he was one of nine runners for the Champion Hurdle. In a strong field (all nine had won at Grade I level) he was the fourth choice in the betting behind Hurricane Fly, My Tent Or Yours and The New One. Our Conor went to the front from the start and disputed the lead with the pacemaker over the first two hurdles. At the third he fell heavily, sustaining a serious injury to his back. He was attended by veterinary surgeons for several minutes, but his injury was too severe to be treated and he was euthanised. His death drew criticism from the animal rights organisation, Animal Aid which described the Cheltenham course as \\"the most lethal in the country\\"; claims which are completely unfounded and have never been proven by any animal-welfare or horse-racing body.

Grammatical usage  Nirvachanashastra is a heremeneutic device that is used for word-analysis and derivation. The proper understanding of the relation in nirvachana analysis between a noun and some activity, expressed by a finite verb or by mention of a verbal root came to the fore through the study of YƒÅska's Nirukta done in the light of a model of substitution according to which model adesha ('substitution') takes the sthana ('place') of the original sthanin ('place-holder') under the given circumstances. Sthana refers to artha ('meaning'), thus nirvachanas are merely place-holders in semantic space; one gets a different thought if one gets a different sentence to represent the same truth. By using ƒÄde≈õa rather than vikƒÅra, and holding on to varna-samƒÅmnƒÅya sound system, PƒÅ·πáini was able to achieve economy and brevity in the statements of algebraic system. With regard to the rule, requiring the substitution of soft unaspirate consonants in the place of hard consonants, the ƒÅde≈õa that takes place in place of a vowel is not sthƒÅnvit. Panini uses ƒÅde≈õa in the sense of 'substitution' and 'substitute'. Vadha is not an independent root in the Paninian system it is an adesa for the root han-  Upanishadic usage  The Upanishads have given four MahƒÅvƒÅkyas or grand proclamations corresponding to four prescribed practices viz. Upadesha, Adesha, Abhyasa and Anubhava; accordingly the vakya ‚Äì Tat Tvam Asi, appearing in the Chandogya Upanishad, is an Adesha Vakya, a command statement; the shishya or 'disciple' listens to the Upadesha vakya and the Adhesha vakya with full faith and devotion which act is called Sravana ('concentration'). In the Sanskrit phrase - ‡§Ö‡§•‡§æ‡§§ ‡§Ü‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§É ‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø athƒÅta ƒÅde≈õah: neti neti, meaning ‚Äì 'now hence the teaching: not this, not this' of Brihadaranyaka UpanishadII.ii.6, Adesha means 'specific instruction' and not 'substitute'. In the Taittiriya Upanishad(II.iii.1), in the very brief part reading - ‡§Ü‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ, the word, Adesha, refers to the brahmana portion as the self ('trunk')when the sage says that the self constituted by mind is also of a human shape the shape the human shape the mental body takes after the human shape of the vital body. Sankara explains that the word, ƒÄde≈õah here means the brahmana portion of the Vedas, since (in consonance with the etymological meaning of ƒÅde≈õa, command) the brahmana portion inculcates all that has to be enjoyed.  Mercantile usage  Chanakya in his Arthashastra, refers to the then prevalent bill of exchange called ƒÄdesha which was an order to a third person to pay up a sum of money on behalf of the sender of that order; in those days merchant guilds performed the functions of banks. There was considerable use of these instruments, including promissory notes, and merchants in large towns gave letters of credit to one another.  Other usages  Aurobindo explains that the intellectual Asura determines his actions by his reason or ideal, the emotional Asura by his feelings; but the Shuddha determines them by the higher inspiration proceeding from the divine experience in the Vijanana, that is what people often call the Adesha. Keshab Chandra Sen of Brahmo Samaj (and founder of Brahmo Samaj of India) influenced by Christian theology propounded the doctrine of Adesha, according to which God inspires knowledge in some individuals whose word must therefore be considered infallible and true which doctrine not accepted by some members witnessed division in ranks and the formation of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. In the Bhagavad Gita Sloka XVII.22, it is seen that the word ‡§Ö‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•á (ƒÅde≈õkƒÅle) with the dropping of a mƒÅtra i.e. ƒÅ to a (and thus providing negative connotation), refers to wrong time.

She wrote novels, short stories, fairy tales, as well as essays, on Greek mythology, on the history of fashion, and travelogues. Considered to be one of the most accomplished women of Germany of her time, her numerous works gained her a high degree of celebrity. Early years Caroline Philippine von Briest was born in Nennhausen in 1773 (1775 is also mentioned). She grew up at the Nennhausen estate which belonged to her father, Philipp Friedrich August Wilhelm von Briest (1749‚Äì1822), who had served in the Prussian Army. Her mother was Caroline Wilhelmine Zinkow (or Zinnow), and she had a younger brother, August Jakob Friedrich von Briest (1789‚Äì1790). After her mother's death, her father married Marie Friederike Helene von Luck, and they had two children, Caroline Friederike Auguste von Briest and Clara Friederike Charlotte von Briest. The home was frequently visited by literary men from Berlin. Career Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√© Briest first married Friedrich Ehrenreich Adolf Ludwig Rochus von Rochow (1770‚Äì1799), a young officer, who possessed an estate in the neighbourhood, and was attached to a regiment quartered at Potsdam. None of her work during this period was published. Rochow became a gambler and the marriage deteriorated until his wife returned home to her father at Nennhausen with her children, two sons, including Gustav von Rochow, who became Prussian Minister of the Interior and Minister of State, and an illegitimate daughter. She divorced Rochow in 1798 (1799 is also mentioned); he died by suicide in 1799. She married the writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√© in 1803. It was a second marriage for both. Together they had one daughter, Marie Luise Caroline de la Motte Fouqu√© (1803‚Äì1864). Fouqu√© retired from the army with claims of poor health and lived at the Nennhausen estate, publishing his first book in 1804; her first book was published two years later. Several of Briest's novels, her \\"Letters as to the Purpose and Tendency of Female Culture\\" (Berlin, 1811), as well as her \\"Letters on Greek Mythology\\" (Berlin, 1812), are of note. Some of her narrative poems are distinguished for their insight into matters of the human, particularly the feminine, heart. Regarding the literary quality of her works, Arno Schmidt in his authoritative biography of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©, quotes E. T. A. Hoffmann as follows: \\"In the afternoon to see Frau Fouqu√© who bored and displeased me terribly by reading from one of her very bad novels\\" (30 January 1815) - followed by a second similarly dismissive statement. Schmidt continues by commenting: \\"After having read ten of her books I do have to agree with him; the best among them are the novels Roderich and the tale Der Delphin, although they do follow well-known models very closely; in addition, some pieces in her books, for example the poems in Frau des Falkenstein, were not written by her but by her husband.\\"Arno Schmidt: Fouqu√© und einige seiner Zeitgenossen, Haffmans Verlag, Z√ºrich 1993, p. 167 She wrote approximately twenty novels and sixty stories, as well as poems, theoretical tracts and cultural historical essays; there were also romances and comedies. She sought anonymity for some of her work by referring to herself as \\"author of the Roderich novels\\", or using the pseudonym \\"Serena\\". Drei M√§hrchen (1806), Feodora (1814), Frauenliebe (1818) and Die graue Maske (1829) are some of her works with Beytrag zur Geschichte der Zeit (1829/30) considered her most important. Her work has been criticized for abandoning her originality in favour of imitating Motte Fouque's style, hoping to share in his popularity.Jennings (1876), p. 102 Her writings continued until 1829 with her last publication, Resignation.

Built c. 1790, the timber frame barn is probably the best-preserved barn of the period in the state. It is also distinctive for its construction methods and materials, which are rarely seen to survive in New Hampshire. The building's frame is made of oversized timbers, which were hand-hewn and then smoothed with an adze, a rare step not usually taken for barn construction. The building was framed as two separate three-bay English-style barns joined by a bay in the center, giving the frame seven bays in all. The interior layout of the barn matches this construction: the central area has two threshing bays, and there are hay lofts on the outer ends. The barn was built about 1790 by Nathaniel Rolfe, or possibly his brother Benjamin. Rolfe lived in the 1770s house that stands on the property, although it was located north of the barn and moved to its present location about 1888. The Rolfes were third-generation residents of Concord; their grandfather was one of the town's early proprietors. Nathaniel Rolfe operated a large and prosperous farm, and was active in Concord's civic affairs. Later members of the Rolfe family contributed to Penacook's development as an industrial center, but maintained the farm until the 1860s. The barn was then apparently used in conjunction with a Rolfe-owned shop, housing draft horses. The shop closed in 1941, and the property with the barn on it was sold out of the Rolfe family in 1991. In addition to the house of Nathaniel Rolfe, the property on which the barn stands includes a wagon shed from the turn of the 20th century, and a 1998 house that is occupied by the property's caretakers. When the barn was sold with the intent of moving it in the 1990s, the Penacook Historical Society raised funds to acquire the entire property, and now uses it as its headquarters. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

He was one of the most wanted militants and the closest aide of Swat Taliban chief Maulana Fazlullah. He was known for his hawkish views against the opponents. The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced a 10 million rupees bounty on Dauran.  Early life  Shah Dauran, the son of a chowkidar (watchman) at a local fuel station, was the resident of Qambar village of Swat close to Mingora, where he ran a madrasah. Dauran sold bakery products. He gave up selling bakery products and began challenging the writ of the government on radio with threats to people opposing the Taliban.  Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e- Shariat-e-Mohammadi  He joined the Taliban group in 2007 and soon became an important member of its shura (consultative body). His leader Maulana Fazlullah was broadcasting his show on an FM radio channel heard in upper parts of Swat while Dauran used to run his FM channel in lower Swat. Unlike Fazlullah's polite tone, Shah Dauran is said to be harsh in his broadcasts. He went to Afghanistan several times and participated in Afghan jihad.  FM radio or Mullah radio  Shah Dauran often used his FM channel to warn government employees to back the Taliban or leave their service. He also used the radio to claim responsibility for Taliban attacks. On 28 December, he claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing killing 44 people at a polling station in Shalbandai village in Buner district. On another occasion, he proudly announced that Taliban had killed a female dancer, Shabana, in Mingora. It was Dauran who announced to ban girls education in Swat. In his later days, when Fazlullah was hiding from Pak Army, he led the Taliban in Swat.  Death  He died on 17 December 2009 in Bajaur after a protracted illness. The sources said that he was hiding somewhere in Bajaur, was suffering from kidney disease and injuries suffered by him during the fighting in Swat had become gangrenous.

Initially, it was planted by the Department of Agriculture as an experiment in diversification, on land leased from Tony and Betty Pearse for 10 years. The first plantings were a dismal failure, but two hectares were successfully established in 1966. The vines planted in that year, one hectare each of riesling and cabernet sauvignon, grew only very slowly in the cool climate. In 1972, the first commercial vintage was made from the vineyard's grapes by Jack Mann at Houghton in the Swan Valley. The next three vintages were made by Dorham Mann at Sandalford, also in the Swan Valley. They included the 1975 riesling, which, under the Sandalford label, won 12 gold medals and nine trophies. The success of the early vintages encouraged others to set up wineries nearby.

Professor Uri Ra'anan, faculty member at the Fletcher School since 1968, become the first chairman of ISSP. In the creation of the program, he was assisted by his colleague Robert Pfaltzgraff. Upon Ra'anan's departure from the school in 1987 to join Boston University, Pfaltzgraff succeeded him, taking the title of director. He was succeeded by Richard Shultz in 1989. ISSP followed its contemporary developments, in its first 20 years focusing on issues like the Cold War, nuclear proliferation, European security, crisis management, low intensity conflict and intelligence. Shortly after the end of the Cold War, in 1991, the ISSP in cooperation with Columbia University's International Security Policy Program, and the National Strategy Information Center, conducted an extensive curriculum review. This joint effort resulted in the publication of two books: Security Studies for the 1990s (1993) followed by an updated Security Studies for the 21st Century (1997). In them, security specialists were asked to review the curriculum of their subfields in light of the dramatic changes in global politics, with each author providing a syllabus for a graduate course along with analysis essays, and brief critiques. The books advocated for a broadened scope of the field, that had previously over-emphasized deterrence (in the Western alliance and the post-1945), to also include peace missions, non-military instruments of power and the influence of culture and values. In 2005 the Jebsen Center for Counter-Terrorism Studies was established within ISSP. Its purpose was increasing the understanding and competency of counter-terrorism professionals. Two main areas of research were predicting, preventing and preempting terrorist activity, and the role of women and business in the campaign against terrorism. Its activities included the creation of a database that collected historical data on the life paths of hundreds of terrorists and analyzed their letters, wills, and interviews. This information, based on open-source data, was used to identify the factors that tend to predict terrorist acts. Russell D. Howard, a retired U.S. Army general and Founding Director of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, was appointed as the director of the center. The center was funded by Jan Henrik Jebsen, a Norwegian businessman and philanthropist, with a three-year grant of $1.5 million. The center closed in 2008, after three years of activity. Scope and methodology ISSP places security studies within the broader framework of international relations. It offers courses on time-tested subjects, namely role of force, crisis management, military strategy, decision making, intelligence, civil-military relations. It also has followed the contemporary developments, studying salient issues of each period like the Cold War, wars of national liberation, nuclear proliferation, collective security, low- intensity conflict, non-state actors. These studies have benefited of being in conjunction with the other fields of study in the school, including regional studies, and courses of political science, history, economics, and law, as the set of factors that either condition, influence or limit armed conflict. An emphasis is placed in the civil-military exchanges as well as fomenting interactions between US and foreign students. Professor Robert L. Pfaltzgraff highlighted the importance of the international aspect of the school by pointing that \\"It's much more beneficial for the students from the US to have experience with students from elsewhere,\\" arguing that the \\"US national security is set within an international security setting.\\" Activities =Simulex= Since 1974 ISSP has conducted annually an international crisis simulation, called Simulex, that spans over two days. The simulation puts real countries in hypothetical but realistic crisis situations. Students are teamed into the civil and military leadership of each country involved, need to react to sudden and mounting crises, make decisions, and report those to the Control Team, who oversees and manages the evolution of the entire scenario. These decisions can be of economic, military or diplomatic nature. Organizers and participants in the simulation also include members of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, from multiple institutions including the continuing involvement of the United States Army War College. Since the inception of Simulex, Professor Robert Pfaltzgraff has designed the scenarios, which typically reflect contemporary tensions and developments. Notably, Simulex 1989 scenario envisioned the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was played one week before the actual event. =Annual security conference and guest speakers= Front cover of \\"Naval expeditionary forces and power projection : into the 21st century\\", published in 1992 by the Marine Corps University, stemming from a 1991 conference conducted by ISSP ISSP jointly with the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis (IFPA) hold an annual security conference since 1972, focusing on topical issues of contemporary relevance. These conferences have had cosponsors including the U.S. Army, Air Force, the Office of Net Assessment, and the Marine Corps University. Attendance include participants from the U.S. Congress, the military, and academia, as well as other civilians from the U.S. and abroad. ISSP and IFPA have published a book, briefing, or report after each annual conference, outlining the contributions of the participants. In 2013, ISSP and IFPA held their 40th annual security conference, in cooperation with U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The conference, titled \\"Positioning Special Operations Forces for Global Challenges\\", was attended, among other speakers, by Adm. William H. McRaven (USN, commander, USSOCOM), Congressman Buck McKeon (chairman, House Armed Services Committee), Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. ISSP also holds individual speaker series, with civilian policymakers and military commanders invited as guest speakers talking on diverse issues such as the North Korea nuclear program, Nicaraguan insurgency, or the role of the U.S. Air Force in the Gulf War. Some notable speakers have been Gen. David Petraeus, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Gen. Carter Ham, Jamie Morin (Acting Undersecretary of the US Air Force), David Sanger, (Chief Washington Correspondent for The New York Times), Javier Solana (Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union). Advanced programs Besides ISSP's course offering, it also has a program for mid- career military officers, and a doctoral program. =ISS Senior Military Fellows Program= In addition to military personnel enrolling in the standard degrees at the school, every year select field grade officers from all branches of the US Armed Forces are sponsored as fellows to go study at the Fletcher School, in lieu of attending war college. This includes the Marine Corps, which in 1985 started to sponsor Commandants of the Marine Corps as fellows to study at ISSP. Major Jay L. Hatton positively valued this program, pointing that the breadth and depth of Fletcher's educational experience provide the knowledge and analytical skills enabling them to access policy- making or scholarly posts. These include becoming faculty at the Marine Corps University, a staff officer at Headquarters Marine Corps, or working on peacekeeping operations. He also highlighted the value of bringing diversity of views to the school, and the value of the fellow's academic research in informing policy. Graduates from the program have also reached the rank of flag officer. =Doctoral program= ISSP offers a doctoral program. From 1971 to 1991, it awarded 73 PhDs, many being on the Cold War, but also other topics like transnational terrorism, the implications of a multinuclear world, nonviolent resistance movements, counterinsurgency strategy, and crisis decision-making. In the post-cold war period between 1991 and 2013, 112 more PhD dissertations were completed. Dissertation topics included WMD proliferation, counterterrorism strategy and policy, humanitarian interventions, the management of non-traditional crises, strategic information warfare, cyber space, rethinking deterrence, special operations, and the changing dimensions of alliances and security cooperation.

A contemporary writer had stated the work to have been composed in 1784 and that it had been played to Eck by Mozart, although Mozart's widow Constanze stated that if authentic, the work must have been composed earlier. Ludwig von K√∂chel dated the work to 1776 in his catalogue, labelling it K. 268\\\\. A common hypothesis made in the later half of the 19th century was that the piece was based on authentic Mozart material but constructed by a less skilled composer. Cecil B. Oldman believed that the work had stylistic similarities to Mozart's sinfonia concertante for violin and viola, K. 364, and that Eck was the completer of the work, writing in a footnote to p.1469 of The Letters of Mozart and his Family Volume III: Alfred Einstein dated the work to 1780 in his third edition of the K√∂chel catalogue, renumbering it as K. 365b. In a 1978 comparison of this concerto with several known Eck violin concertos, Walter Lebermann confirmed the work's probable attribution to Eck and gave a dating of before 1790. The 1980 sixth edition of the K√∂chel catalogue removed this concerto from the main catalogue and into the appendix for spurious and doubtful works as K.

The Long truss bridge was completed in 1853, and is one of New Hampshire's few surviving 19th-century covered bridges. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is named for Abram (or Abraham) Rowell, an early resident of the area. Description and history Rowell's Covered Bridge is in a rural setting in western Hopkinton, crossing the Contoocook River a short way north of the Contoocook River Dam. The bridge is just under wide and long, and consists of a single span supported by two modified Long trusses resting on granite abutments. The trusses are distinctive in the addition of several arches, which consist of solid timbers that were spliced or butted together, and mortised into other truss members. The bridge's sturdy engineering was demonstrated by the addition of a central pier in the 20th century whose intent was to add strength. The pier, however, acted as a fulcrum, causing the bridge to seesaw under load and weakening its joints. The top of this pier was consequently removed, leaving the bridge largely as designed except for the addition of some metal reinforcing tie rods. The bridge is the third to stand at this site, the oldest known to be standing here in 1793. That bridge was replaced in 1845, but was washed away by flooding in 1852. The present bridge was built in 1853 by Horace Childs. Its design is a variant of a design patented by West Hopkinton native Stephen H. Long, a civil engineer. Long helped further Childs' career as a bridge builder; Childs is known to have built covered bridges all over New England and trained a following generation of builders. The bridge underwent a major restoration in 1965.

Beginning in 1939, it contracted with nine civilian flying schools to provide primary flight training. Primary training consisted of a three-month course of 65 hours of flying instruction. As the United States prepared to enter World War II by expanding its number of flying squadrons, the number of contract primary schools increased.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942‚Äì2002. Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC, Randolph AFB, Texas ASIN: B000NYX3PC According to the contract, the government supplied students with training aircraft, flying clothes, textbooks, and equipment. The Air Corps also put a detachment at each school to supervise training. The schools furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls. From the Air Corps, schools received a flat fee of $1,170 for each graduate and $18 per flying hour for students eliminated from training. The Primary Pilot Training used Boeing PT-17 or Fairchild PT-19 two- seater single-engine training aircraft. Also, the wing controlled specialized schools for Liaison Pilots using the Stinson L-5 Grasshopper, and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) primary training was conducted exclusively at Avenger Field, Sweetwater, Texas. Following the fall of France in 1940, the Air Corps upped its pilot production goal to 7,000 per year. To meet that goal, the Air Corps increased the capacity of its schools and added more contract primary schools. The contract primary pilot schools ended their operations in October 1945. = Lineage= * Established as 36th Flying Training Wing on 17 December 1942. : Activated on 8 January 1943 : Disbanded on 1 November 194536th Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama =Assignments= * Army Air Forces West Coast Training (later, AAF Western Flying Training) Command, 8 January 1943 ‚Äì 1 November 1945. =Stations= * Victorville Army Airfield, California, 8 January 1945 * Santa Ana Army Air Base, California, 21 December 1943 ‚Äì 1 November 1945. =Training aircraft= The primary aircraft used were Boeing-Stearman PT-17 and Fairchild PT-19 twin-seat, single engine trainers.

Description The Telefon was a 1403 gross register ton steel cargo ship built in 1900 by Wood, Skinner & Company Limited at Bill Quay on the River Tyne. She was length overall, beam and depth. Telefon was launched on 30 December 1899. Her triple expansion engine of 144 nhp or was supplied by North Eastern Marine Engineers Ltd of Sunderland and Wallsend and drove a single propeller. Career The ship was built for P A Gr√∏n of Sandefjord, Norway in 1900 and used to carry cargos to the Antarctic whaling ships of Christen Christensen. On one such voyage, carrying coal and empty barrels from Rotterdam, she struck a reef at the entrance to Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands on 26 December 1908. Some sources considered her a total loss as a wreck. Capt Adolfus Andresen, Norwegian owner of the Sociedad Ballenera de Magellanes of Punta Arenas, Chile which used Deception Island as a whale factory ship base, salved the Telefon, putting her aground at Port Foster, Deception Island, where she was eventually refloated and returned to service with the whaling fleet. That resumption of trading was brief as she was acquired in 1910 by The Greenock & Grangemouth Dockyard Co Ltd of Greenock, transferred to the British flag and registered at Grangemouth. The following year she was sold to the Lovart Steamship Co Ltd, Glasgow, under the management of Love, Stewart & Co, Bo'ness, who renamed her Kinneil Fate Kinneil foundered following a collision with the German steamship Denebola on 30 October 1913, west of the Scaw, Denmark in the Skagerrak, while on voyage from Vilajoki, Finland to Bo'ness carrying pit props.

Partly because of the highway, the village center has not been significantly altered since that time. The district includes , with 75 contributing resources. Most of buildings in the district were constructed between the late 18th century and about 1930. It began to develop as a local center of civic and commercial activity in the second half of the 18th century, when a church (no longer extant, now the site of the 1841 Greek Revival Methodist church) was built and the cemetery was laid out. By the early 19th century a cluster of houses had risen in the area. The arrival of the railroad in 1848 spurred additional growth, including the construction of stores such as the 1890 South Middleborough Store at 32 Spruce Street, and the rise of lumbering as an industry. In the 1920s the rise of the automobile led to increased traffic on the Wareham road, and the village grew to serve the business of passing travelers.

Function  CerS3 synthesizes C24-ceramides and ceramides with longer acyl chains, and is found mainly in skin and testis. Specifically, CerS3 synthesizes ceramides containing Œ±-hydroxy (2-hydroxy) fatty acids, which are abundant in skin tissue, where they help maintain the water permeability barrier qualities of the skin. It is found in large quantities in keratinocytes, and this increases during keratinocyte differentiation. In the testes, CerS3 is involved in sperm formation and androgen production. Cers3 gene expression is located within germ cells, where it is massively upregulated during juvenile testicular maturation. This upregulation is correlated with increase in levels of glycosphingolipids containing very long chain (C26-C32) polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA), which are required for spermatogenesis.  Tissue and cellular distribution  CerS3 (T3l) mRNA is strongly expressed in skin, and was also found in brain, lung and kidney. CerS3 is mainly found in the skin and testes. CerS3 is not detectable in the brain or the sciatic nerve. Like other ceramide synthases, CerS3 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum within the cell.  Structure  CerS3 has a molecular mass of 46.2 kDa, 383 amino acids, and six transmembrane domains. Like other ceramide synthases, CerS3 contains a Hox- like domain.

Bohrnstedt (born April 28, 1950) is a former American professional tennis player who played from 1972-1979. He was a 2-time CIF singles champion from Redlands High School (1967,68), and 2-time All-American at USC (1971,72). In 1973, on the ATP tour, he reached the quarterfinals of the Welsh Open on grass, and the semifinals of the U.S. National Hardcourts in Aptos, CA, defeating 1973 U.S. Open men's singles runner-up, world #5 Jan Kode≈°, 6-4, 6-3. In 1974 indoor tournaments he reached the quarterfinals of the Canadian Indoor after defeating Vitas Gerulaitis, the quarterfinals in the Arkansas International, and the semifinals in Salt Lake City. He reached a career-high ranking of World No. 98 in 1977. Altogether he played 101 singles matches at the highest level and 78 doubles matches. His brother David Bohrnstedt played tennis for Southern Methodist University. Tennis career Dick R. Bohrnstedt's most notable tennis achievement is his run in the December version of the 1977 Australian Open, where he won two matches and reached the third round, He upset Onny Parun of New Zealand in the first round, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7, 6-4, followed by John James of Australia, by an identical score. His run came to an end when he faced Vitas Gerulaitis of the United States, losing in straight sets. In doubles he had his best result in 1973, and in 1977, playing at Wimbledon reaching the 3rd round both times. His closest chance at a Quarterfinal came in 1973 when he was partnered with William Brown of the United States. In the first round, he and Brown defeated Guy Fritz of the United States and Harry Fritz of Canada in straight sets. In the second round, he and Brown defeated Luis Baraldi of Mexico and Eduardo Zuleta of Ecuador, again in straight sets. Finally, they played David Lloyd and John Paish, both of the United Kingdom. In a very tight match, they lost 6-8, 6-4, 9-8, 4-6, 4-6; dropping both final sets denied them a quarterfinals berth. In 1977, he partnered with Mike Machette. In the first round, they defeated Pat Dupre, and Steve Krulevitz, both of the United States in straight sets. Bohrnstedt and Machette went on to upset Vijay and Anand Amritraj of India in the second round. 1-6, 6-3, 9-8, 6-3. Finally, they played Wojtek Fibak of Poland and Dick Stockton of the United States. Here they lost their quarterfinals bid, 2-6, 6-8, 6-3, 3-6.

The farmstead consists of three buildings on just under of land. The main house was built c. 1833, and its main block is a 1.5 story center-chimney Cape style structure. The side gable roof is pierced by two gable dormers, and the centered front entry is flanked by full-length sidelight windows and surrounded by wide, flat panels. There are single story ells built both left and right of the main house, whose front is set back from that of the main house and whose back wall is flush with that of the main house. One of these ells, both of which served in the 19th century as kitchens, may have been original, but there is evidence that the second is a later 19th century addition. The left addition has a further, smaller ell which was added in the 20th century, and the right wing has a utility shed addition that resembles the one on the left. The outbuildings of the property are a c. 1940 garage/utility shed, and a c. 1918 barn. These two buildings lie just east of the main house. The shed is a wood frame structure about square, with an asymmetrical gable roof to accommodate a pair of high openings on the south facade. The barn was built to serve the farm's dairying operations, and its design is sophisticated for the period of construction. It is built into a slope, allowing for ground-level access to the basement area, where manure is handled, as well as to the main level. The farmstead was owned for 150 years by a single family. The farmstead was built by Jonathan Richards, probably not long after his marriage c. 1832-3. In 1850 the farm was purchased by Abiel Codding, Jr., a jeweler, probably for his father to work. During the Codding's ownership the house may have been converted for use by two families, as evidenced by the addition of the second kitchen ell. After Abiel Codding, Sr., died in 1881, his son leased the farm to tenant farmers. For much of the 20th century the tenants were members of the Titus family, even as the land changed hands among the generations of Coddings. In 2000 the town purchased the property in order to save it from planned development. Portions of the farm have been set aside for recreational purposes, and the buildings have been rehabilitated. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

Sources for Ireland suggest that there would have been filidh in early Medieval Scotland, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king. At least from the accession of David I a less highly regarded order of bards took over their functions. They probably accompanied their poetry on the harp and harpists are recorded in the reign of Alexander III. James I may have introduced English and continental styles and musicians to the Scottish court. James III's founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood and lutenists began to appear in the royal household accounts from this point. James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle and is said to be constantly accompanied by music. Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver. The king's household contained two dozen musicians, including trumpeters, drummers and string players. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When James VI went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Chapel Royal now began to fall into disrepair, and the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage. Holyrood Abbey was remodelled as a chapel for Charles I's royal visit in 1633, but musical worship in the palace came to an end after the chapel was sacked by a mob. Holyrood would be reclaimed by Charles II and became a centre of worship again during the future James VII's residency in the early 1680s, but was sacked by an anti-papist mob during the Glorious Revolution in 1688. Middle Ages The Queen Mary Harp, one of three surviving Medieval Celtic harps, preserved in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Early Medieval Scotland and Ireland shared a common culture and language. There are much fuller historical sources for Ireland, which suggest that there would have been filidh in Scotland, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and who passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), .R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124‚Äì53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French. After this \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh and they would continue to act in a similar role in the courts of lords in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century.K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220.

Cadell & W. Davies, 1807), p. 766. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8‚Äì12. Walter Bower, abbot of Inchcolm praised him as \\"another Orpheus\\", including mastery of the organ, drum, flute and lyre.M. Brown, James I (East Linton: Tuckwell Press, 1994), , p. 2. James II also demonstrated some musical ability. His marriage to Mary of Guelders, who had been educated in the Burgundian court, meant that she brought the latest ideas of music to the Scottish court.P. J. Potter, Monarchs of the Renaissance: The Lives and Reigns of 42 European Kings and Queens (McFarland, 2012), , p. 125. The story of the execution of James III's favourites by his enemies, including the English musician William Roger, at Lauder Bridge in 1482, may indicate his interest in music. Renaissance monarchs often used chapels to impress visiting dignitaries. James III founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood that was probably designed for a large number of choristers.J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, ecclesiastical\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 431‚Äì2.

In 1501 his son James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir meant to emulate St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald, A. J. Vanderjagt and A. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450‚Äì1650 (Brill, 2003), , p. 163. No piece of music can be unequivocally identified with these chapels, but the survival of a Mass based on the Burgundian song L'Homme arm√© in the later Carver Choirbook may indicate that this was part of the Chapel Royal repertoire. James IV was said to be constantly accompanied by music, but very little surviving secular music can be unequivocally attributed to his court. An entry in the accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland indicates that when James IV was at Stirling on 17 April 1497, there was a payment \\"to twa fithalaris [fiddlers] that sang Greysteil to the king, ixs\\". Greysteil was an epic romance and the music survives, having been placed in a collection of lute airs in the seventeenth century.R.

Early Modern Era A 1564 portrait of David Rizzio, who arrived at the court of Mary, Queen of Scots as a musician Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives.J. Patrick, Renaissance and Reformation (London: Marshall Cavendish, 2007), , p. 1264. The first indication of the use of viols is an entry in the Treasurer's accounts for 1535 for the making of viols. By 1538 there were four viol players in the household, dressed in red and yellow liveries. They were led by Jacques Collumbell, who seems to have been brought to Scotland to train the newly formed consort.I. Woodfield, The Early History of the Viol (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), , p. 209. James V's household contained two dozen musicians, including trumpeters, drummers and string players. These included Thomas de Avarencia, whose services were begged from the Duke of Milan.C. Eddington, \\"Royal Court: 1 to 1542\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 535-7. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver (c. 1488-1558), a canon of Scone Abbey. His complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the Scottish Chapel Royal. James V was also a patron to figures including David Peebles (c. 1510‚Äì79?), whose best known work \\"Si quis diligit me\\" (text from John 14:23), is a motet for four voices. These were probably only two of many accomplished composers from this era, whose work has largely only survived in fragments.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488-1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 118. Also known to be active in this period is John Fethy (c. 1480-c. 1568), who introduced the new five-fingered organ playing technique to the country and was Precentor or Chanter of the Chapel Royal from 1545-66.T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"The Scottish Chapel Royal as cultural intermediary between town and court\\", in H.

Regent Arran, who ruled from 1543 to 1554, employed trumpeters and four viol players, and was entertained by a fool called Robesoun.Melanie Schuessler Bond, Dressing the Scottish Court 1543-1553: Clothing in the Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland (Boydell, 2019), p. 589. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute and virginals, while unlike her father she was a fine singer.A. Fraser, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Book Club Associates, 1969), pp. 206‚Äì7. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.M. Spring, The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 452. She had a stand of musicians for singing part works. These included French, Italian and English musicians. Among these was David Rizzio, later her private secretary until his murder in 1566. Her marriage to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in 1565 has the first references to members of the English Hudson family, with at least five members, who would be violers and singers at the court of James VI.A. Fraser, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Book Club Associates, 1969), p. 133.H. M. Shire, Song, Dance and Poetry of the Court of Scotland Under King James VI (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969, reissue 2010), , pp. 72-3. Other named musicians included Scotsman James Lauder (b. c. 1535), who had studied music in France and returned with the queen from France. He later served her in her imprisonment in England, as did his illegitimate son John Lauder, who played the bass viol.H. M. Shire, Song, Dance and Poetry of the Court of Scotland Under King James VI (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969, reissue 2010), , pp. 76-77. The ruins of Holyrood Abbey, briefly refurbished as a centre of royal worship in the seventeenth century James VI (r. 1566-1625) was a major patron of the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry.P. Le Huray, Music and the Reformation in England, 1549‚Äì1660 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), , pp. 83‚Äì5. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family.T. Carter and J. Butt, The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 280, 300, 433 and 541. He inherited a number of musicians from his mother's court, including James Lauder and members of the Hudson family. Robert Hudson became treasurer of the Chapel Royal in 1587 before retiring to Dunfermline about 1593. Thomas Hudson was an important member of the Castalian Band of poets that gathered around the king and became Master of the Chapel Royal in 1586. William Hudson acted as the young king's dancing master in 1579, indicating that dance music like the pavan and galliards, common in the English Court, had reached Scotland. James Hudson moved on to being an envoy, travelling for the king to London and back. No music can be unequivocally attributed to the family, but several later pieces may be reworkings of their compositions. John Norlie was appointed in their place in 1599.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 107. James VI also employed trumpeters, and one was given new clothes to serve on the ship, the James that took him to Norway to meet his bride Anne of Denmark. William the English trumpeter was given a similar fine costume and a new trumpet in 1599 and sent to Denmark with a gift of hunting hounds.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 34: NRS E23/10. When James VI went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Chapel Royal now began to fall into disrepair, and the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage. Holyrood Abbey was remodelled as a chapel for Charles I's royal visit in 1633. William Laud as Dean of the Chapel Royal attempted to impose the English liturgy on the chapel. The Director of the Scottish Chapel was ordered to London in 1630, where he spent five months copying out twelve part books. He returned to Scotland where he was able to report in 1631/32 that Holyrood was now served by 16 men, six boys and an organist. Members of the Scottish Council and other departments of state were ordered to attend the palace for communion, which was accompanied by the sound of trumpets. This situation was then in place for the king's arrival for his coronation, for which the English chapel royal joined them. However, the attempt to impose an English style liturgy on Scotland that resulted in the National Covenant (1638) and Bishop's Wars (1638-40) meant that musical worship in the palace came to an end after the chapel was sacked by a mob.D. Baldwin, Royal Prayer: a Surprising History (Continuum, 2010), , pp. 44-5. Holyrood would be reclaimed by Charles II after the Restoration, becoming a centre of worship again during the future James VII's residency in the early 1680s, but was sacked by an anti-papist mob during the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and never repaired.D.

The three sisters, very close in age, were artistically inclined.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 115 Immaculata was the intellectual of her family.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 276 Following Habsburg tradition, she was passionate about music, playing various instruments. She was an outstanding pianist.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 97 As well as her native German, she learned French, Spanish Hungarian and Italian. Immaculata was shy and reserved.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, An Unconventional Family, p. 15 The family was wealthy. They lived at the Palais Toskana in Vienna and at Schloss Wilhelminenberg as their country estate. Vacations were spent in Italy where Infanta Blanca owned a rural property near Viareggio. During World War I, Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and the two eldest sons fought with the Austro-Hungarian army. Archduchess Immaculata served as a Red Cross nurse during the conflict.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 52  Exile At the fall of Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated the properties of the Habsburgs. The family lost all their fortune.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 48 Immaculata's two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. The rest of the family moved to Spain. In January, 1919 they arrived in Barcelona where they settled for over a decade. They lived very modestly. Initially they rented a house in which the girls shared a bedroom with their mother and the boys one with their father. The family's economy improved with income coming from revenue from Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria's military patents. The political upheaval in Spain, during the Second Spanish Republic, made the family moved back to Austria. As a condition of their return to Vienna, they relinquished their royal titles. Their former residence, the Palais Toskana had been divided into apartments and the family were able to rent three rooms there. Archduchess Immaculata did not remain in Austria for long.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 218 On 14 July 1932 in Rome, she married an Italian aristocrat, Nobile Igino Neri- Serneri, Patrician of Siena (22 July 1891 - 1 May 1950). The couple settled in Rome at Number 4 Via di Montoro. As the archduchess and her husband were both over forty, their marriage was childless. During World War II they stayed in Rome under increasingly difficult circumstances. After eighteen years of marriage, Igino Neri-Serneri died in 1950. In her widowhood, Archduchess Immaculata joined her sisters, Archduchesses Dolores and Margaretha, in Tenuta Reale, a villa they had inherited at the death of their mother the previous year. Archduchess Immaculata lived there until her death on 3 September 1971, at age 78. Ancestry Notes Bibliography *Harding, Bertita. Lost Waltz: A Story of Exile. Bobbs-Merrill, 1944.
