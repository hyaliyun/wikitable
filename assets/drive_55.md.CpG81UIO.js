The street is named after the International Exhibition held at the Royal Exhibition Building in 1880, and was previously known as Stephen Street from 1837. The street runs roughly north-south and was laid out as part of the original Hoddle Grid.  Geography  Situated in the east of the Melbourne city centre, Exhibition Street is a major thoroughfare for city traffic. At its southern end, Exhibition Street becomes Batman Avenue after its intersection with Flinders Street and the Batman Avenue Bridge. Batman Avenue links the central business district to the Monash Freeway, and the section immediately south of Flinders Street is also known as the Exhibition Street Extension. At its northern end it becomes Rathdowne Street, which runs along the western edge of the Carlton Gardens, Royal Exhibition Building and Melbourne Museum.  History  = Founding as Stephen Street = Stephen Street, as Exhibition Street was originally known, was established in April 1837 as one of the eight north-south streets on Robert Hoddle's original survey of Melbourne. Stephen Street was named as a tribute to Sir James Stephen, the Permanent Undersecretary for the British Colonies in London who was at the peak of his power within the Colonial Office at the time of the naming of the streets in the Hoddle Grid. In 1847, the Eastern Market was opened on the corner of Stephen Street and Bourke Street. It was the second major market in Melbourne, after the Western Market. It was intended to be Melbourne's main fresh food market, but it proved less popular than the Queen Victoria Market, and eventually became closer to an amusement park. It was demolished in 1960. Royal Exhibition Building = Renaming to Exhibition Street = Stephen Street was renamed Exhibition Street by Melbourne City Council on 5 December 1898. It was renamed to celebrate the 1880 International Exhibition and the 1888 Centennial Exhibition, both held at the Royal Exhibition Building during the boom time of Marvellous Melbourne. The change only applied to the portion of Stephen Street north of Collins Street. The remainder was called Collins Place, and kept that name until it became part of Exhibition Street in 1963. = Exhibition Street Extension = The Exhibition Street Extension project was announced by the State Government in 1997 and opened in October 1999,Exhibition Street Extension Transit Australia September 1997 page 213 with CityLink operator Transurban operating the road and collecting tolls from road users. The project included a four lane divided road over the Jolimont railyards, enabling Batman Avenue west of Melbourne Park to be closed. In addition the route 70 tram was removed from Swan Street, and rerouted to dedicated tracks between the sporting precinct and the railway lines, before crossing the new bridge and turning into Flinders Street. The Exhibition Street Extension was not part of the initial CityLink project announcement, as it had been promoted as a bypass that would keep cars out of the CBD.

The highway traveled from Texarkana on the eastern border to El Paso on the western border, via Dallas and Fort Worth, Abilene, and Midland‚ÄìOdessa. SH 1 was approximately long, and was one of the original 25 Texas state highways, which were designated on June 21, 1917. In 1920, the entire length of the highway was designated as part of the Bankhead Highway, a transcontinental Auto trail. In the Texas Department of Transportation's 1939 state highway renumbering, most of SH 1 was redesignated as U.S. Route 80, as well as U.S. Route 67, and others. Most of these highways were replaced by Interstate 10, Interstate 20, and Interstate 30. The only portion of SH 1 that existed after September 26, 1939 was a short spur located in Dallas. Texas State Highway 1 was officially cancelled on August 20, 1952. Due to the highway's historic value, a highway can not be designated as Texas State Highway 1 unless by the order of TxDOT Executive Director or by the Transportation Commission. Texas State Highway 1 had several long spur routes. Most of these were simply numbered as State Highway 1, and were renumbered within a few years. Three of these spurs were separately numbered. They were Texas State Highway 1A, which was a long alternate route of SH 1 that traveled from Abilene to just west of Palo Pinto, Texas State Highway 1B, which was a short spur located in Dallas that was redesignated as SH 1 in 1939, and Texas State Highway 1C, which was a short spur located in Fort Worth that was redesignated at US 80 in 1939. Route description In terms of today's Interstate Highways, the routing of SH 1 is followed by Interstate 10 (I-10) from New Mexico to east of Van Horn, I-20 to west of Fort Worth, and I-30 to Texarkana. U.S. Route 80 in Dallas in 1965. This was formerly SH 1 100px History SH 1 was assigned on June 21, 1917 as one of the original 25 state highways. Known as the Texarkana, Dallas, Fort Worth and El Paso Highway, it crossed from Arkansas at Texarkana and ran west through Dallas, Fort Worth, Albany, Abilene, Big Spring and Van Horn to end in El Paso. On September 5, 1918, it had been extended northwest from El Paso to the New Mexico border. In February 1920, the whole of SH 1 was included in the transcontinental Bankhead Highway, a marked auto trail. In late 1926, the United States Numbered Highways were assigned. State Highway 1 kept its number, but was also assigned U.S. Highway 80 from New Mexico to Dallas and U.S. Highway 67 from Dallas to Texarkana. By 1936, US 80 had been moved off SH 1 west of downtown Dallas. While SH 1 angled northeast on Fort Worth Avenue from Cockrell Hill, crossing the Trinity River on the Commerce Street Bridge, US 80 continued east on Davis Street, turning north on Zang Boulevard and over the Houston Street Viaduct. In downtown, US 80 turned east on Commerce Street (State Highway 15), and US 67, which had joined US 80 along Davis Street, turned east on Elm Street (SH 1). (Commerce Street and Elm Street later became a one-way pair.) On June 21, 1938, SH 1 Spur was designated to Santo. On December 1, 1938, SH 1 Loop was designated in El Paso. On September 26, 1939, SH 1 was truncated to only this short piece west from downtown Dallas. The loop became Loop 16 (El Paso). The spur became Spur 40 (Santo). It split from US 80 (Davis Street) and ran northeast on Fort Worth Avenue and Commerce Street. Upon entering downtown Dallas, it split into the one-way pair of Commerce and Elm Streets, ending at US 80 (Houston Street). In August 20, 1952, the route was renumbered to Loop 260 and signed as U.S. Route 80 Business. Loop 260 was removed from the State Highway System and turned over to the City of Dallas on June 25, 1991, along with most of Loop 354. =Branches= 100px In the original 1917 definition, SH 1 had a split between Abilene and Palo Pinto (west of Mineral Wells). Another split was present between Sulphur Springs and Texarkana, and a branch ran from the northern route at Naples east to State Highway 8 at Douglassville. SH 1 followed State Highway 39 from Greenville to Commerce and went southeast to Sulphur Springs when the route was decided. On February 19, 1918, the southern route between Sulphur Springs and Texarkana had become State Highway 1A, and a new State Highway 1B ran from SH 1 in Naples to Douglasville, and a new State Highway 1C ran southeast from SH 1A at Atlanta to the Louisiana state line. On March 20, 1918, SH 1A extended north from Texarkana north to the Red River (the Arkansas border). The southern route between Abilene and Palo Pinto was improved first. Thus it was designated as part of US 80 in 1926. The north route was redesignated on August 21, 1923 as State Highway 1A, and in 1932 was designated US 80N (later U.S. Highway 80 Alternate), On March 16, 1927, SH 1 was rerouted on the direct route between Sulphur Springs and Greenville, and the old route became part of SH 39 and SH 11. On August 8, 1935, all of SH 1A west of Albany was transferred to SH 15, but that was not effective until September 1 of that year. On October 23, 1935, US 80 and SH 1 were rerouted onto the direct route between Ranger and Weatherford, replacing part of State Highway 89, and US 80 Alternate was extended east to Weatherford; this did not become effective until paving on SH 89 from Strawn to Weatherford was completed. It was unknown what the old route would become, but on November 19, 1935, the section from Weatherford to Palo Pinto was already part of SH 15, and the section from Palo Pinto to Strawn would become part of an extended SH 120. The SH 1A designation was removed in the 1939 general redescription, and US 80A was replaced on September 6, 1943 by State Highway 351 and U.S. Highway 180. The other branches, located east of Dallas, were all renumbered on August 21, 1923: *The section of SH 1A from Commerce east to Daingerfield became part of State Highway 11. This road still carries SH 11. The section of SH 1A from Daingerfield to Hughes Springs became part of State Highway 49 and the section of SH 1A from Hughes Springs east to Atlanta became State Highway 48. *SH 1B was renumbered to State Highway 77. *SH 1C and the section of SH 1A from Atlanta north through Texarkana to the Red River became State Highway 47. On June 24, 1931, the section of SH 47 that replaced SH 1C became an extension of SH 77, and SH 47 was rerouted to Daingerfield, eliminating SH 48. On the September 26, 1939 redescription, SH 11 (which had gone north from Daingerfield) was extended east from Daingerfield along former SH 1A to the Red River, eliminating SH 47. (The short piece of SH 49 became a concurrency.) SH 11 was truncated to Linden on October 13, 1947, when the rest became part of U.S. Highway 59. A branch was designated on Commerce Street in Dallas on March 13, 1931. On November 11, 1933, it was known as SH 1B. This was eliminated on September 26, 1939. Another SH 1C was designated on Lancaster Street on March 17, 1936. This was eliminated on September 26, 1939 (became US 80).

The character was created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino, and made his first appearance in The Flash #106 (May 1959). Piper was originally introduced as an adversary of the Flash / Barry Allen and eventually became a member of the Rogues, a criminal association led by Captain Cold which often battled the Flash. During the crossover event Crisis on Infinite Earths, most of the Multiverse was destroyed, which resulted in the DC Universe being rebooted; moreover Barry died, and Wally West took up the mantle of the Flash. Following the events of Crisis, Piper was re-introduced in The Flash #20 (December 1988) as having reformed and become a champion for the poor. Soon afterward, he became an ally and personal friend of Wally, and an integral member of the Flash family. Following the events of Flashpoint, DC Comics rebooted its universe once again and relaunched its titles in 2011, during The New 52 event. Here, Piper is portrayed as a former member of the Rogues, who has given up being a vigilante and is dating David Singh, Barry's Director at the Central City Police Department. The Pied Piper made his live action appearance in an episode of the first season of The Flash, played by actor Andy Mientus. Mientus returned to the role in an episode of the second season, and two episodes of the sixth season. Publication history Created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, the character made his first appearance in The Flash #106 (May 1959). Following the events of Crisis, Piper was revealed to be gay in The Flash #53 (August 1991). Fictional character biography Hartley Rathaway was born deaf and received assistive technology in the form of hearing implants thanks to research funded by his wealthy father (later it was revealed that the implants were made by Dr. Will Magnus).Flash (vol. 2) #190 (November 2002) He became obsessed with sound, and pursued little else in life; experimenting with sonic technology, Rathaway eventually invented a technique of hypnotism through music, and a way to cause deadly vibrations. Growing bored with his lifestyle, he turned to crime as the Pied Piper and frequently clashed with Barry Allen, the second Flash. Following the events of Flashpoint, DC Comics rebooted its universe once again and relaunched its titles in 2011, during The New 52 event. Here, Piper is portrayed as a former member of the Rogues, who has given up being a vigilante and is dating David Singh, Barry's Director at the Central City Police Department. =Reform= After Allen's death during Crisis on Infinite Earths, Hartley retired from crime to become a socialist champion of the poor and underprivileged. He also came out as one of DC's first openly gay characters, and joked that this was ironic, as he was one of the few villains to have ever \\"gone straight\\". He first realized he was gay when he became attracted to Rod Lauren when watching The Crawling Hand.Countdown to Final Crisis #12 (February 2008) Rathaway becomes a good friend of the Flash, Wally West, and his wife Linda, whom he helps with scientific problems. Sometime later, Piper was arrested for the murder of his parents. Wally was sure Piper could not have committed such an act, but Piper himself seemed to believe himself guilty. Wally eventually discovered that the true murderer was Mirror Master. Unaware of Wally's discovery, Piper broke out of Iron Heights and struck a deal of some sort with former Rogue and FBI agent the Trickster. During this time, Flash asked the Spectre to erase everyone's memories of his secret identity, due to his wife suffering a miscarriage from an attack by Zoom. It was later revealed that Barry Allen had Zatanna tamper with the mind of supervillain the Top, turning him into a hero (the Top had gone on a murderous rampage and Allen believed this was the only way to stop him from causing more harm). As a hero, the Top went insane over the guilt of his earlier deeds. After Allen had died, Wally received a letter from Barry asking him to restore Top's mind if he ever returned. After Wally had Zatanna restore the Top's mind, the Top revealed that when he had been a hero he had attempted to reprogram many of the other Rogues into heroes as well, including the Pied Piper. When the 'good' Rogues went after the remaining 'bad', Top returned to undo his brainwashing on the redeemed Rogues. When the Piper battled the Flash, West unmasked himself, triggering a flood of memories of their friendship and causing the Piper to pass out as his mind repaired itself. When he awoke, Piper appeared to be his old self again and came to Linda's aid. Piper remains the only Rogue to no longer be a villain, save for Magenta. He later had all charges for murder cleared. =One Year Later= One Year Later, Pied Piper was seen in the pages of both The Flash (Vol. 3), and Countdown teaming with a new group of Rogues led by Inertia.Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #11 (June 2007) The team of Rogues has him working with his parents' murderer, Mirror Master. Piper reveals that he has rejoined the Rogues with a plan of infiltrating them, but when Captain Cold, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard successfully murder Bart Allen,Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #13 (August 2007) he and Trickster are forced on the run together. They are pursued by heroes and villains alike in the form of the Suicide Squad, the Question and Batwoman, Poison Ivy and Deathstroke, and eventually Piper's former friend and the newly returned previous Flash, Wally West. Wally confines the two of them at the wedding of Green Arrow and Black Canary, despite the warnings that Deathstroke is planning an all-out assault at the occasion. They manage to escape the wedding assault, while inadvertently picking up Double Down as a passenger. The trio stop at a diner, only to be attacked by the Suicide Squad. Double Down is captured, but Piper and Trickster, using an invisibility field, decide to follow the Squad and free the other captured villains. After encountering and freeing Two-Face, Piper and Trickster are again attacked by Deadshot, who pursues them relentlessly until he succeeds in murdering Trickster. With Trickster's death, the cuffs activate a 24-hour self-destruct, which Piper is able to delay with his flute. When the train they are on is submitted to a border check, Piper flees into the desert. Delirious from the heat, he begins to imagine Trickster's corpse is talking to him. After severing the hand from the rest of the corpse, Piper is brought to Apokolips by DeSaad. Desaad unlocks the shackles, and claims that Piper can channel the Anti-Life Equation and control the planet. Before the Piper can do so, Brother Eye finishes assimilating Apokolips. DeSaad finally gets into Brother Eye's control and convinces Piper to play his flute in order to activate the Anti- Life Equation. Piper agrees to play, but upon hearing that DeSaad was the mastermind behind his recent misfortune, in an almost successful attempt to break his spirit and take control of him, he kills DeSaad with a tune. He plays one final time for Brother Eye, a swan song, \\"The Show Must Go On\\" by Queen, that blows up the merged entity Brother Eye/Apokolips, with him still trapped inside, apparently left to die.Countdown to Final Crisis #9 (February 2008) However, he is later seen alive in the streets of Gotham City, saying that if he was allowed to live for some reason, this time he will play on the side of the angels.Countdown to Final Crisis #1 (April 2008) =Final Crisis= Pied Piper returns in the Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge mini-series. He invades the police precinct, and picks up Trickster's will, which is actually a fake that contains information on the other Rogues, written in invisible ink. Piper later steps into the middle of the fight between Inertia, Zoom and the Rogues, using his flute to paralyze the combatants, and taking the opportunity to revenge himself upon Mirror Master through a kick in the face. Before he can do anything else, Libra appears, and stabs Piper in the shoulder with his spear. Although wounded, Piper is able to contribute in the killing of Inertia by holding him in place for the Rogues using his flute. Piper is later mentioned to have turned himself into the Central City Police Department.Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #3 (November 2008) =The New 52: The Flash and Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion (2011‚Äì2016)= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity.

He can make anyone do what he wants, and can even make himself 'invisible' to the perception of others. Although he focused obsessively on sound-based technology in his early years, he later expanded his scope to more general mechanical tinkering. Initially, he employed his mind control techniques almost exclusively on humans (and occasional animals), but during his incarceration in Iron Heights he became infatuated by the prison's ubiquitous rats and incorporated them into his gimmick, adding another similarity to his legendary namesake. He is able to use nearly anything that can create tones for his sonic manipulations, including touch-tone telephones and grass blade whistles. According to DeSaad, Rathaway's power is based on the manipulation of The Anti-Life Equation. Rathaway also employs a number of devices that can generate or amplify sound for destructive or protective purposes.

The Centre Street Bridge was first constructed in 1834 as a single-level railroad bridge. However, in 1911, almost eight decades later, a second, upper level was constructed for rapid transit. In 1937, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, now part of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson line, was realigned onto railroad tracks along New Jersey Route 21\\\\. The upper level of the bridge was abandoned for this purpose, and was later converted to roadway. At the western end in Newark it ran just south of Park Place, beginning at Center Street. The route headed eastward, crossing over Route 21 and the Passaic River before entering Harrison, where it terminated at Second Street north of New Jersey Railroad Avenue. Eventually, the upper level roadway was designated by the New Jersey State Highway Department as Route 25AD. A spur of the recently designated State Highway Route 25A, the highway department made the roadway a suffixed spur of the highway because of the close proximity.

After 1960, Route 158 did not appear on maps, and the bridge was torn down around 1979. Route description Route 158 began at an intersection with Park Place and Center Street (County Route 508) in the city of Newark. The route went up in elevation, paralleling Park Place until crossing New Jersey Route 21 (the McCarter Highway). The highway continued eastward, crossing the last patch of land between 21 and the river before heading onto the swing bridge. Route 158 crossed as a two-lane bridge into Harrison. The route continued onto land just north of New Jersey Railroad Avenue, where it turned northward along First Street. Route 158 turned eastward onto Essex Street, with the right-of-way ending at Second Street, where the designation ended as well. History =Railroad bridge= Aerial photo of bridge following the removal of the roadway Close-up of the abutments of the Centre Street Bridge in Newark The lower level of the Centre Street Bridge, a continuation of Centre Street in Newark, was first constructed for the New Jersey Railroad, which later became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On September 15, 1834, the bridge opened on a single level for trains. A cutoff around the bridge opened in 1870 and the old route became the Centre Street Branch of the New Jersey Railroad, being cut from the main line to the south when the latter was elevated around 1904. On March 1, 1901, a Pennsylvania Railroad train derailed its rear cars on the bridge at 10:23 that evening. When it derailed, the rear cars were dragged for 100 yards across the trestle. The train, a locomotive and five cars, had just left the Centre Street station when it derailed. The bridge had no guard rails at the time, and the rails hung over the bridge. The cars were disconnected, and the passengers continued to Jersey City. The reason for the cars jumping the rails was not known. In July 1901 the states of New Jersey and New York proposed improvements to several local bridges to the United States Congress. The proposal asked for $45,000 (1901 USD) in improvements of dredging and maintaining the channel of the Passaic River below the bridge. Ten workers, known as sandhogs died during a construction accident.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/02/01/104819420.pdf On April 2, 1911, almost ten years after the proposed improvements, construction began on a new high-speed line in Newark along the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. It was proposed to be completed by the end of the summer in that year, to help commuters to New York City. The same proposal asked for authorization of a proposal for subways in the city by the state of New Jersey. The bridge at the time was made of steel with concrete flooring and pavement. The upper-level was to have a clearance of and there was to be a long drawbridge in the center. The upper level was to be used by the new passenger line and the lower level was to be used for the freight line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The new high-speed line and double-decker Centre Street Bridge was completed on November 18, 1911. The last rail that had to be constructed was completed that very day for the eighty-six Newark-bound trains to run in each direction of that line. The drawbridge's only use was for the freight line that was to go along the lower level of the bridge. As proposed, the upper level was given to the line. On November 25, 1911, the bridge re- opened once again as a double level bridge. connecting to the H&M; to Park Place. Route 25AD (1930s-1953) On June 27, 1937, a proposal was made by the city of Newark and the counties of Hudson and Essex to convert the upper level of the span to a roadway after proposing that the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, now the Port Authority Trans-Hudson, to be moved onto tracks that paralleled Route 21, which was assigned in 1927.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. = Road bridge = Remains of Route 158 from the Newark side The Centre Street Bridge was later designated as a state highway under the public highway system. The New Jersey State Highway Department had recently designated Route 25A, which became Route 58, and later Interstate 280 to the south in the proximity of the bridge. The state highway department a few years later designated the alignment of the upper level span of the bridge as New Jersey State Highway Route 25A-D, which was a suffixed spur of Route 25A. Even with the designation, State Highway Route 25A-D did not connect to its parent or grandparent routes. However, unlike Route 25A, Route 25A-D did not appear in the state laws. The route remained intact along the bridge from Route 21 and Center Street in Newark to Second Street in Harrison until January 1, 1953, when the state highway department completed a second renumbering of state highways in New Jersey. Route 158 appeared in maps along the Centre Street Bridge as a publicly used highway until 1960, when it disappeared from the maps. Route 158's official decommissioning date is currently unknown, but the Centre Street Bridge was torn down around 1979.

In places and time periods where Christians were persecuted or Christianity was outlawed, instances of crypto-Christianity have surfaced. History Various time periods and places have seen large crypto- Christian groups and underground movements. This was usually the reaction to either threats of violence or legal action. =Roman Empire= Secrecy is a motif found in the New Testament, and particularly in Mark's Gospel. According to the Gospels, Jesus was keeping secret his mission or his messianic identity until a certain time, and ordered his disciples to do the same, as e.g. in Mark 9:9, after the Transfiguration \\"Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen\\". This motif has been called \\"the messianic secret\\" and has been interpreted in different ways. Following one interpretation, the historical Jesus wanted to avoid the immediate confrontation with Rome, as Pilate would not have tolerated a popular leader who referred to himself as Messiah. There are also theological interpretations, of mixed historical and theological.David F. Watson, \\"Honor Among Christians: The Cultural Key to the Messianic Secret\\", Fortress Press, Minneapolis, 2010, pp. 1-10, passim. During the initial development of the Christian Church under the Roman Empire followers often had to practice in secret. Official policy under Trajan was to provide Christians with the choice between recanting and execution.Trajan in Pliny, Letters 10.97. The term crypto-Christianity can be applied to that segment of the church population which concealed its Christian beliefs as a means to avoid persecution. In contrast, many Christians, including Polycarp,. chose to retain their beliefs and suffer persecution, due to the fact that Christian doctrine forbade public profession of another religion even while holding a mental reservation against it, which made it stricter than Muslim (taqiyya) or Jewish opinions on the manner, but many did so out of weakness: =Japan= Christianity was introduced to Japan during its feudal era by Saint Francis Xavier in 1550. From the beginning, Christianity was seen as a threat to the power of the sh≈çgun. In 1643, Christianity was banned, all churches were destroyed, all known Christians tortured and demanded to convert to Buddhism or face execution, and all signs of Christian influence were systematically eliminated. The ban was not lifted until 1858. During this period, faithful converts moved underground into a crypto-Christian group called kakure Kirishitan or \\"hidden Christians\\". Crypto-Christian crosses and graves, cleverly styled during these two centuries to resemble Buddhist imagery, can still be seen in the Shimabara Peninsula, Amakusa islands and far south in Kagoshima. Sh≈´saku End≈ç's acclaimed novel Silence draws from the oral history of Japanese Catholic communities pertaining to the time of the suppression of the Church. =Ottoman Empire (Balkans and Asia Minor)= An early attestation and justification of cryptochristianism is found in an epistle of Patriarch Ioannes 14th (ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒôŒî')(1334-1347) of Constantinople to the Christians of Bithynia (Asia Minor). He says that \\"those [christians] who by the fear of punishment [by the muslims] want to believe and practice christianity secretly, they will be also saved, provided they study god's orders as far as possible\\".Ioannes 14th (patriarch), \\"Promittit Nicaeensibus reversuris in sinum ecclesiae remissionem\\" (Œ†ŒπœÑœÑŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ±œÅœáŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒµœÖœÅŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒùœäŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±ŒΩ), published by Franz Miklosich & Josef M√ºller in Acta et Diplomata Graeca Medii Aevi Sacra et Profana (1860), p. 184. Mentioned also in Kitsikis Dimitris, \\"The importance of bektashism-alewism for hellenism\\", Athens, \\"Hekate\\", 2006, p. 47, in Greek language. Due to the religious strife that has marked the Balkan Peninsula and Anatolia, instances of crypto-Christian behavior are reported to this day in Muslim-dominated areas of the former Yugoslavia, Albania, and Turkey. With the threat of retribution for the religious and ethnic conflicts, many Christian minority groups keep their religion private to protect themselves. Crypto-Christianity was mostly practiced following the Ottoman Turkish conquests of the Balkans, but the earliest scholarly record of the phenomenon dates to 1829. Linobamvaki in Cyprus traced their ancestry to both Catholics, Maronites and Greek Orthodox Christians who converted under Ottoman oppression. The Laramans in southeastern Kosovo hailed from the northern Albania highlands and converted after settling in the 18th century. Crypto-Greek Orthodox are reported to many parts of the Ottoman Balkans and Anatolia. A good account of the Crypto- Christians among Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia and the Pontic Alps region (often referred to as Stavriotes), including bibliography on other parts of the Ottoman Empire, is given by F. W. Hasluck.F. W. Hasluck (1929) Christianity and Islam Under the Sultans, ed. Clarendon press, Oxford, vol. 2, pp. 469-474. Further information is in \\"The Crypto-Christians of the Pontos and Consul William Gifford Palgrave of Trebizond,\\" London: Valiorum Reprints, 1988, from Peoples and Settlement in Anatolia and the Caucasus 800‚Äì1900, by Anthony Bryer Crypto-Armenians are believed to represent at least two groups of Armenians living in modern Turkey. One has been Islamized under the threat of physical extermination particularly during Armenian pogroms in 1896 and the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Representatives of a different, much smaller crypto-Armenian group live in separate villages inhabited by Turks and Kurds in Eastern Turkey (on the territories of traditional Armenian homeland). This group differs from the above-mentioned \\"Islamized\\" type by the process and depth of Islamization.The Armenian ethnoreligious elements in the Western Armenia =Middle East= In the first few centuries the Christian religion spread rapidly around the Mediterranean region with Egypt and Syria becoming especially important centers of the religion. Even as the Roman Empire disintegrated between the 5th and 7th centuries, the Christian faith only deepened in the Eastern Mediterranean. During the 7th century the Rashidun Caliphate took over what is now called the Middle East. Initially Christianity was well tolerated though preferential treatment was given to Muslims. However, often the only actual requirement for being considered a Muslim was to profess a belief in God and proclaim Mohammed as his prophet. As a result, many Egyptians, Syrians, and others in the region officially converted to Islam while still adhering to Christian practices. As oppression of Christians arose under the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim, Christian (and Jewish) practices became more hidden. Secretive communities appeared in Egypt during the 11th century and in Morocco in the 12th century under the Almohads rule. Many Crypto-Christian communities existed in Middle-East till the 19th century, as Muslim authorities continued to tolerate minimal requirements of obedience by converts. From late 19th century onward most of crypto-religious groups disappeared as a result of the rise of nationalism in the new Middle Eastern states.Reinkowski M. (2007) Hidden Believers, Hidden Apostates: The Phenomenon of Crypto-Jews and Crypto-Christians in the Middle-East, in Washburn u.a. (Hrsg.): Converting cultures : religion, ideology of transformations of modernity. Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2007 pp. 408 -433 =Soviet Russia and the Warsaw Pact= Many Christian communities in the Soviet sphere of influence during the Cold War had to go underground in so-called Catacomb Churches. After the break-up of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Soviet era in the 1990s, some of these groups re-joined the official above-ground churches, but others continued their independent existence, believing the official churches had been irreconcilably tainted by their cooperation with the previous Soviet- supported regimes. =People's Republic of China= Chinese house churches are unregistered Christian churches in the People's Republic of China which operate independently of the official government-run religious institutions: the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestants, and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association for Roman Catholics. =Intra-Christian cases= In addition to crypto-Christianity, where Christians practiced their faith secretly in an anti-Christian society, there have been instances of crypto-Catholics in Protestant territories where Catholicism was banned and heavily persecuted (such as England from 1558 - see Recusants, and in Ireland - see Recusancy in Ireland), as well as in Eastern Orthodox countries (in particular, territories annexed by the Russian Empire during its expansion, or during the Cold War), and crypto-Protestants in Catholic territories (such as French Huguenots after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes). Protestants in Eritrea, a Christian-majority country, number about 2% of the population and often practice in secret to avoid persecution and torture from the authorities.

The station is owned by the Christian Television Network. KFXB- TV's studios are located on Main Street in downtown Dubuque, and its transmitter is located in extreme southwestern Grant County, Wisconsin (in the Madison television market). History KFXB-TV in Dubuque The station signed on as KDUB-TV on June 1, 1970, on channel 40 as an ABC affiliate. The KDUB call letters was originally used by CBS affiliate KLBK-TV in Lubbock, Texas from its 1952 sign-on until 1961. In 1972, station president and general manager Gerald Green was embroiled in a controversy with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over whether $19,000 he paid to an ABC network representative was a bribe. Green testified that he thought the money was a legitimate expense in obtaining the network affiliation. Green was later exonerated, but the ABC executive was found guilty of extorting payoffs. After encountering financial difficulties, the station went off the air on October 3, 1974. The dormant station was purchased by Lloyd Hearing Aid Corp. of Rockford, Illinois, and returned to the air on September 12, 1976. The first and only television station to be based out of Dubuque, KDUB was originally based in an office building just south of Dubuque, near Key West, Iowa. The station eventually moved into offices on the ninth floor of the former Roshek's Department Store building in downtown Dubuque, and later moved to its current location on Main Street. For a number of years, KDUB and KCRG-TV (channel 9) were in conflict with each other. KDUB eventually won a decision in which the Dubuque cable company was required to black out KCRG when the same shows were shown at the same time on both stations. At one point, KDUB sued claiming that KCRG's interference caused a proposed deal to sell the station to fall through. In early 1995 the station entered into a management agreement with Second Generation of Iowa, owner of Cedar Rapids Fox affiliate KOCR-TV (channel 28). It was then decided to discontinue the ABC affiliation and convert KDUB to a semi-satellite of KOCR (which changed its callsign to KFXA), under the call letters KFXB (the call letter change took place on August 13); most programming was simulcast from KFXA, but KFXB would continue its news operation (at that time, KFXA had no newscast at all). Prior to this, KOCR served as the network's over-the air affiliate for most of the southern portion of the market while Foxnet (which had launched in 1991) served as the network's cable-only affiliate for the remainder of the market, including the cities of Waterloo and Dubuque (it was carried on cable channel 13 in Dubuque); between October 7, 1994 and August 12, 1995, Foxnet was carried on all cable systems in most of Eastern Iowa as KOCR was off the air during that time due to financial issues. The first season of the NFL on Fox was carried by Cedar Rapids CBS affiliate KGAN, which had a greater coverage area than KOCR. After a few years, it was decided to close down the Dubuque news operation, rendering KFXB a full satellite of KFXA. During this time the stations identified themselves as \\"KFXA-KFXB Fox 28/40.\\" In 2004, KFXB's owners, Dubuque TV Limited Partnership sold the station to the Christian Television Network, who switched the station to its primarily-religious programming. Fox programming would continue to be transmitted on KFXA‚Äîwhich would operate as the sole Fox affiliate for northeast Iowa. At that time, KFXB lost its longstanding channel 4 assignment on the Dubuque cable system to KFXA, with KFXB being moved to channel 14. KFXB added cable coverage of the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City areas on Mediacom cable in 2005.

Toulouse-Matabiau station. Participation certificate of the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Midi, issued 4. July 1927 The Compagnie des chemins de fer du Midi (. CF du Midi), also known in English as the Midi or Southern Railway, was an early French railway company which operated a network of routes in the southwest of the country, chiefly in the area between its main line ‚Äì which ran from Bordeaux, close to the Atlantic coast, to S√®te on the Mediterranean ‚Äì and the Pyrenees. The company was established by the Pereire brothers, who thus broke the virtual monopoly held in France by James Rothschild on the slow-paced railway projects taking place in the area of Paris during the 1840s and 1850s. The Rothschild branch of Paris responded by strengthening its grip on the sector with an alliance to the industrialist Talabot. The Pereires in turn founded their financial company Cr√©dit Mobilier. In 1934 the company was merged with the Chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans to become part of the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans et du Midi (PO-Midi). In 1856, the Midi completed its rail line from Bordeaux to Toulouse. In 1857, it continued on from Toulouse through Narbonne to S√®te. This put it in competition with the Canal du Midi, and on 28 May 1858 the railway took over the lease of the canal. Electrification Compagnie des chemins de fer du Midi power station near Artouste In 1909, the Compagnie du Midi launched a vast program of electrification of its lines under the impetus of the engineer Jean-Raoul Paul (1869-1960). It was a huge challenge for the time because it went far beyond the scope of railway operations alone. It was necessary to build infrastructure such as dams, power plants and distribution systems. The company was far from coal production centres, so it was hard to get the fuel required for steam traction, and some coal was even imported from England. The proximity of the Pyrenees made hydropower generation possible and this favoured electrification. The shortage of coal during the war of 1914-1918, and especially its prohibitive cost after the war, provided further impetus for electrification. After investigations in Switzerland and Germany, a system using alternating current (AC) at 12 kV and 16‚Öî Hz was chosen for economic reasons. The three-phase system was rejected as being too complex so a single- phase system was chosen. The narrow-gauge Cerdanya line was electrified from the start because its gradients (up to 6%) were too steep for steam traction. The Perpignan - Villefranche-de-Conflent line (Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales) was chosen as the site for future tests because it provided conditions of both plain and mountain. This was the only line that was not later converted to 1,500 volts. It operated thus until 1971. From 1911, the company tried six different types of overhead line system and chose the American Westinghouse system. This design was very simple and was capable of absorbing temperature variations. Even before the end of the tests, the company became a candidate for the construction of Eastern and Western trans-Pyrenees railways. Electric traction was chosen from the outset, reducing construction costs by allowing steeper gradients and sharper curves. The company then began an intensive electrification programme for the network, including work on the tracks, the construction of hydroelectric plant for the production of electrical energy and the creation of a distribution network for the transport of this energy. On 29 August 1920, the government imposed the 1500 V direct current (DC) system, mainly because the army did not want to use the same system as Germany. The reaction of the Midi was immediate and the company launched, in December 1920, new electrification programmes at 1500 V. From 1923, all facilities operated at 1500 V, except the Perpignan - Villefranche-de -Conflent line. In less than two years, the Midi network had succeeded in converting. The programme of electrification of the Midi was impressive because, in only a dozen years, the electrified network of the Midi formed a coherent whole. The programme ended in 1932, with the exception of the Montauban - S√®te link, which was only switched on in 1935 after the signing of an agreement with the Chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO). =Electric locomotives= Where numbers appear inconsistent, this may be because Midi and SNCF used different numbering systems. ;Alternating current The prototype 1‚Ä≤C1‚Ä≤ locomotive, E 3101 railcar Six prototype locomotives were ordered: Midi numbers first * E 3001 from Thomson and General Electric * E 3101 from AEG and Henschel * E 3201 from Westinghouse, later SNCF 1C1 3900 * E 3301 from Brown-Boveri and SLM Winterthur * E 3401 from Ateliers du Nord et de l'Est * E 3501 from Schneider * Z 23031-23044, railcar, later * Z 23051-23063, railcar, later converted to 1,500 V DC to become ;Direct current SNCF numbers first ** 2C2 3100, previously Midi E 3101-10 ** , previously Midi E 4801-4824 ** , previously Midi E 4001-40 ** , previously Midi E 4501-50 ** , previously Midi E 4101-4190 ** , previously Midi E 4201-4250 ** , previously Midi E 4601-4650 ** , previously Midi E 4701-4717 ** , rebuilds of some BB 4200 and BB 4700 locomotives ** , railcar, Midi Z 23201-215 ** , railcar, Midi Z 23001-015 ** , railcar, Midi Z 23051-063 References Further reading * Minist√®re des travaux publics, Recueil des lois et conventions relatives aux chemins de fer du Nord, de l'Est, d'Orl√©ans, de Paris-Lyon-M√©diterran√©e et du Midi : 1883 √† 1910, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1911, 821 p.

Indian Mountain School is often abbreviated as IMS.http://www.indianmountain.org/podium/default.aspx?t=101965&rc;=0 History In 1916, Francis Behn Riggs purchased land and buildings on the site of the present Upper Campus.http://www.indianmountain.org/podium/default.aspx?t=101967 In 1916, Francis Behn Riggs purchased land and buildings on the site of the present Upper Campus. Educated at Groton and Harvard, Riggs founded an agricultural high school for boys, named the Riggs School. Indian Mountain School assumed its current name in 1922 when it became a boarding school designed to prepare boys for the entrance examinations of secondary boarding schools. Classes and dormitory space were located in a large building adjacent to and south of the present tennis courts; Hadden House served as a gymnasium and faculty housing. Indian Mountain School enrolled eight boys that first year ranging in age from eight to 14. From these beginnings, Riggs gradually constructed the basis of today's school. His curriculum was a traditional one but also included such extras as carpentry and dramatics. The current motto, life through service was adopted from the original Riggs School and applied to the new Indian Mountain School. The farm continued to operate for the benefit of the school kitchen, and boys engaged in an active outdoor life. By 1928, the enrollment had reached 30 boys. In November 1928 the main school building was destroyed by fire but Riggs was able to raise the funds to construct the current brick building in time for the opening of school in September 1929, just months ahead of the Stock Market Crash. At the same time, the school was incorporated as a not-for-profit and chartered under the laws of Connecticut to ‚Äúmaintain forever a school for the training and education of boys and young men.‚Äù The new building, designed for 40 students and their instructors, was full that fall. On July 1, 2003, Indian Mountain School merged with the neighboring pre- kindergarten through fourth grade school, formerly known as The Town Hill School. The Town Hill School began in the 1930s as Mrs. Tracy's school, named for its founder, the wife of a Hotchkiss teacher. In 1938, a group of Hotchkiss parents and others in the community, convinced of the present and future need for a strong elementary school, founded The Town Hill School. Early benefactors provided funds for the original school building, and The Hotchkiss School donated the land. The school opened that first year with an enrollment of 22 children in grades one through eight. Miss Penelope Oyen was Town Hill's first headmistress. She was assisted by Connie Garrity, who became headmistress in 1942 and served Town Hill until her retirement in 1978. The original two-room, two-teacher school had eight grades, which were divided into grades one through four and grades five to eight. In 1946, Indian Mountain School and Town Hill agreed that Indian Mountain would begin offering grades five through nine, while Town Hill would concentrate on grades kindergarten through four. A pre-kindergarten was established for the 1987-1988 school year. Following Connie Garrity's retirement in 1978, the school had a series of short-lived heads of school until Judy Boynton became Head of School in 1992. Judy worked closely with trustees, faculty, and parents to increase enrollment, balance the budget, and improve curricular continuity. Enrollment stabilized between 55 and 65 full-time boys and girls. Judy Boynton resigned in 1997. The school moved to its present 12-acre campus in August 1998. Subsequent to Judy Boynton's departure, there was another period of turnover in the heads of school until the merger with Indian Mountain was agreed in 2003. In 2004, Trish Hochstetter, became the Lower School Head, while continuing her role as the Learning Skills Specialist on the Lower Campus until she resigned in 2014. Rebekah Jordan is now the Head of the Lower School. In July 2006, Mark A. Devey became Indian Mountain's eighth Head of School. Under Mr Devey's leadership, enrollment stabilized, the curriculum was further refined, and the school launched a $7 million capital campaign to finance the construction of a new dormitory building with additional faculty housing, (completed in 2012) and a new Student Center (completed in January 2014) as well as to add to the school's endowment. Jody Soja became the ninth Head of School in July 2015. The school incurred allegations of sexual abuse from the 70s and 80s. Suits were brought forth in the 90s and 2010s. Arts Also known as IMS, Indian Mountain School has established an arts program that offers opportunities for all students. They have created an \\"Electives\\" program, offering courses ranging from Film Production to Digital Photography to Ancient Greek to Monty Python. IMS puts on one musical (in the fall/early winter) and one play (in the winter). Recently, they have put on \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (both 2005), \\"Fools\\" and \\"Damn Yankees\\" (both 2006), and most recently,\\"Harvey\\" by Mary Chase (2007). More than half of the students on the Upper Campus take individual music lessons and over 70 students take guitar. The Mountain Voices(a co-ed singing group for 8th & 9th graders), guitar, jazz band, rock band, percussion ensemble, string quartet, orchestra, drums, etc. For those who are not particularly interested in learning how to play an instrument, there is Music Appreciation. Athletics Indian Mountain School has a gymnasium, seven playing fields and three all-weather tennis courts to accommodate IMS athletes during the fall and spring seasons. A paddle tennis court is used for recreational purposes throughout all seasons. During the winter, athletes make use of the gymnasium, swimming pool, the basketball and squash courts, and the ice hockey rinks at The Hotchkiss School. Additionally, ski teams train and compete at Catamount Ski Area. Notable alumni * John G.

The tail gunner operates a flexible machine gun emplacement in the tail end of the aircraft with an unobstructed view toward the rear of the aircraft. While the term tail gunner is usually associated with a crewman inside a gun turret, the first tail guns were operated from open apertures within the aircraft's fuselage, such as the Scarff ring mechanism used in the British Handley Page V/1500, which was introduced during latter months of the First World War. Increasingly capable tail gunner positions were developed during the interwar period and the Second World War, resulting in the emergence of the powered turret and fire control systems incorporating radar guidance. In particularly advanced tail gunner arrangements, the tail armament may be operated by remote control from another part of the aircraft, such as the American Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, a strategic bomber first introduced during 1955. History Sikorsky Ilya Muromets (model S-25 variant Geh-2, from March 1916) was the first aircraft equipped with a tail gun position The first aircraft to ever have incorporated a tail gunner position was the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets bomber, which became active during the First World War and the last years of the Russian Empire. The Ilya Muromets prototype flew for the first time in 1913, with no guns on board and no rear position for the crew. When the war broke out, in 1914, only a few Ilya Muromets aircraft had been built, but increasing numbers were required because of the war effort. After having entered the mass-production phase and having seen combat all along the first year of war against the fighter planes of the German Empire, a rear-defending position appeared to the Imperial Russian Air Service to be increasingly vital to protect both the plane and its crewmen. Such an arrangement, during March 1916, saw light of day on the model S-25 (variant Geh-2) of the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets bomber plane. This aircraft was the first in history to include on its ending tail area a gunner position. Mass-production of Ilya Muromets bomber commenced, with the final example being completed in 1918, by which time in excess of 80 aircraft had been reportedly completed. Those Ilya Muromets that served after the Russian Revolution were inducted into the Soviet Air Forces. Another example of a First World War era aircraft that equipped with a tail gunner position was the British Handley Page V/1500. It was specifically developed as a heavy bomber by Handley Page, who designed a relatively large four-engined biplane for the era; it was reportedly capable of bombing Berlin from bases in East Anglia.Mason 1994, p. 108. However, the type did not enter service until the very end of the war, during the months of October and November 1918, and thus never saw any kind of combat action. The type did see use in subsequent conflicts, including a pivotal role in ending the Third Anglo-Afghan War, flying from Risalpur to Kabul to drop its payload of four 112 lb (51 kg) bombs and 16 20 lb (10 kg) bombs on the city and the royal palace, reportedly contributing to the Afghan's speedy surrender.Bowyer 1992, p. 142.MacKay & Bruce, Air Pictorial. August 1962. Vickers Virginia in flight Throghout the interwar period, various new military aircraft were introduced that featured a gunner position on their tails; examples included the British Vickers Virginia, introduced to service in 1924,Mason 1994, p. 145. and the Japanese flying boat Kawanishi H3K (developed from the Short Rangoon), brought into service during 1930. One of the first aircraft to operate a fully enclosed tail gun turret was the British Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Performing its first flight during 1936, the Whitley entered service with the RAF, remaining in service until the closing months of the Second World War. The tail gunner position of the Whitley would be revised on later- built models, adopting a more powerful Nash & Thompson power-operated turret mounting four Browning machine guns.Moyes 1967, p. 6. Across the overall history of its use in combat, the tail gunner was most active during the Second World War. For almost every aircraft model in which it was fitted, the tail gun position was constituted of an enclosed compartment inhabited by the gunner. During the Second World War, this extreme tail compartment typically conformed to the inside fixed gunner configuration, in which the gunner operated the articulated mount of autocannon or machine gun fire (usually one or two weapons); examples of aircraft such fitted include the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M bomber plane (which had one Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon), and the American B-17 and B-29 bombers (which were fitted with a mount of two 0.50 Browning M2 machine guns).Donald 1997, p. 155. A row of Halifax bombers under assembly, 1942. Note the rounded turret position towards the end of the tail An alternative arrangement in the form of the hydraulically or electrically powered and fully enclosed gun turret. This configuration typically rotated horizontally and mounting one, two or more automatic firearms; aircraft that featured such tail guns include the later-built variants of the American B-24 bomber (various different turret models were used, all equipped with two 0.50 Browning M2), and several British bombers, including the Avro Lancaster (outfitted with a Nash & Thompson FN-20 turret with four Browning .303 Mark II machine guns),Jacobs 1996Franks 2000, p. 83. and the Handley Page Halifax (featuring a Boulton & Paul Type E Mk III turret that also mounted four 0.50 Browning M2s).Flight 1942, p. 401. During the closing years of the conflict, the American B-29 bombers were equipped with a tail gun position in which the gunner still had a direct view on his target while operating his synchronized weapons, but some other gun positions of this particular model of Boeing bomber were, for the first time in an aircraft, operated from other parts of the plane, each one spotting the target by means of a periscopic viewing system.Brown 1977, p. 80.Williams and Gustin 2003, pp. 164‚Äì166. Following the end of the conflict, the postwar period saw more and more subsequent tail gun positions in aircraft inherited this viewing and sight method, ending afterwards with added radar sights and radar targeting systems, early testing of which had occurred during the Second World War; one such example was the radar-aimed FN121 turret that was fitted to some Lancaster and Halifax bombers was introduced during 1944. Another phenomenon that heavily affected the tail gunner's future came in the form of aircraft such as the de Havilland Mosquito. While many aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high- powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, such as the Avro Manchester and Halifax bombers, de Havilland promoted the concept of a compact bomber that lacked defensive turrets and instead relied upon its speed.Buttler 2004, pp. 74, 77.Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31. Despite pressure by the Air Ministry to arm their proposal, de Havilland made no design changes and built the Mosquito as envisaged.Bowman 2005, p. 11.Buttler 2004, p. 79. When the type commenced introduction 1941, the aircraft was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.Bowman 2005, p. 21. In practice, the Mosquito proved its effectiveness; despite an initially high loss rate, the bomber variants ended the war with the lowest recorded losses of any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command service. Due to its success, aspects such as speed and altitude performance were often prioritised over defensive armaments on future bomber aircraft, such as the widely procured jet-powered English Electric Canberra.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 53.Walker 8 May 1969, pp. 758, 760‚Äì761. The tail gunner was last heavily used in combat during the Vietnam War on the United States Air Force's (USAF) large bombers. By this point, the position has become largely obsolete due to advancements in long-range air combat weapons such as air-to- air missiles, as well as modern detection and countermeasures against such armaments. On 18 December 1972, during Operation Linebacker II, USAF B-52 Stratofortresses of the Strategic Air Command conducted a major bombing campaign against North Vietnam. As the bombers approached the target, they would by heavily engaged by North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, firing barrages of Surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) that exploded around the Stratofortresses.McCarthy 2009, p. 139. After completing its bombing run, Stratofortress Brown III was warned of Vietnam People's Air Force (NVAF-North Vietnamese Air Force) MiGs. Brown III's tail gunner, SSGT Samuel O. Turner, shot down a MiG-21 interceptor, becoming the first tail gunner to shoot down an enemy aircraft since the Korean War. B-52D at the Imperial War Museum Duxford (2006) On 24 December 1972, during the same bombing campaign, B-52 Stratofortress Diamond Lil was attacking railroad yards at Th√°i Nguy√™n when the tail gunner detected a MiG-21 away climbing to intercept.McCarthy 2009, p. 141. The aircraft took evasive action and dropped chaff and flares while the gunner fired around 800 rounds from , causing the MiG-21 to fall, on fire. That incident was the last tail gunner to shoot down an enemy aircraft with machine guns during wartime.McCarthy 2009, . The final combat usage of tail gunners by the United States Air Force occurred in 1991, during the Gulf War. During the conflict, a missile struck a B-52 by locking onto the tail gunner's radar; it is disputed whether or not it was unintentional friendly fire by an F-4 Phantom, or if an Iraqi MiG-29 had successfully fired upon the aircraft. The B-52 escapes heavy damage, but the incident motivated the decision to discontinue use of the position throughout the fleet. On 1 October 1991, Master Sergeant Tom Lindsey became the last USAF tail gunner to serve on a B-52 sortie. Operational practices A Nash & Thompson FN-20 turret fitted to an Avro Lancaster, Imperial War Museum Duxford (2006) The purpose of the tail gunner was principally to act as a lookout for attacking enemy fighters, particularly upon British bombers operating at nighttime. As these aircraft operated individually instead of being part of a bombing formation, the bombers' first reaction to an attacking night fighter was to engage in radical evasive maneuvers such as a corkscrew roll; firing guns in defense was of secondary importance. The British slang term for tail gunners was \\"Tail-end Charlies\\",In the USAAF, the term was adopted as the last bomber in a unit formation, or the last unit formation in a larger bomber stream, both considered highly vulnerable. while in the Luftwaffe they were called Heckschwein (\\"tail-end pigs\\"). Both the specific armament and arrangement of the tail gun varied considerably between countries. During the Second World War, the majority of United States Army Air Forces heavy bomber aircraft, such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Boeing B-29 Superfortress, used a fixed gunner position with the guns themselves in a separate mounting covering an approximately 90-degree rear arc. Typical armament was two 0.50 inch M2 Browning machine guns. In contrast, Royal Air Force heavy bombers, such as the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, used a powered turret capable of 180-degree rotation containing the tail gunner and four 0.303 inch Browning machine guns. A similar arrangement was used in the American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber (but with two 0.50 inch heavy machine guns.) Most British turrets were manufactured by two companies Nash & Thompson and Boulton & Paul Ltd, it was common for the same turret model to be fitted to a number of different aircraft. The majority of wartime German and Italian aircraft, including smaller ground attack aircraft and dive bombers, lacked a tail gunner position; instead, there was commonly a dorsal gun fitted behind the cockpit or ventral gun along the belly of the aircraft replaced the tail gunner position covering the tail. This position was blocked by the fuselage but allowed better weight distribution. In the autumn of 1944, the British began deploying Lancasters fitted with the Automatic Gun-Laying Turret, which was fitted with a 3 GHz (9.1 cm) radar. The image from the radar's cathode ray tube was projected onto the turret's gunsight, allowing the gunner to fire on targets in complete darkness, with corrections for lead and bullet drop being automatically computed. Due to it having the frequency that it did, it might potentially be spotted by any Luftwaffe night fighter fitted with the Funk- Ger√§t 350 Naxos radar detection system, which was primarily used to home in on the earlier H2S bombing radar system's emissions. One important development for the Luftwaffe that never made it onto its larger night fighters or strategic bomber designs, would have been the Borsig firm's \\"quadmount\\", hydraulically-powered Hecklafette HL 131V manned tail turret, fitted with a quartet of the firm's own MG 131 machine guns. Prototype examples of the HL 131V were trialed in the late spring and summer of 1943 on a trio of He 177A-3 examples set aside as the V32 through V34 prototypes. This innovative design never made it to production status, only existing as a series of engineering department mockups with Heinkel and Junkers, among others (for their aircraft designs that were intended to mount them) and as the aforementioned working prototypes. The HL 131V turret's design was advanced for a German-origin manned emplacement, using hydraulic drive to both elevate the turret's side- mount gunmount elevation units through a +/- 60¬∫ vertical arc either side of level, with a capability for horizontal traverse (of the entire turret) of some 100¬∫ to either side, all at a top traverse angular speed of 60¬∫ per second.

Since the development of the medium, inclusion in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial, and in the case of most nude scenes has had to be justified as being part of the story, in the concept of \\"artistically justifiable nudity\\". Many actors and actresses have appeared nude, or exposing parts of their bodies or dressed in ways considered provocative by contemporary standards at some point in their careers. Nudity in film should be distinguished from sex in film. Erotic films are suggestive of sexuality, and usually contain nudity, though that is not a prerequisite. Nudity in a sexual context is common in pornographic films, but softcore pornographic films generally avoid depiction of a penis or a vulva. A film on naturism or about people for whom nudity is common may contain non-sexual nudity, and some other non-pornographic films may contain very brief nude scenes. The vast majority of nudity in film is found in pornographic films. Nude scenes can be controversial in some cultures because they may challenge some of the community's standards of modesty. These standards vary by culture, and depend on the type of nudity, who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the pose, the context, and other aspects. Regardless, in many cultures nudity in film is subject to censorship or rating regimes which control the content of films. Many directors and producers apply self-censorship, limiting nudity (and other content) in their films, to avoid external censorship or a strict rating, in countries that have a rating system. Directors and producers may choose to limit nudity because of objections from actors involved, or for a wide variety of other personal, artistic, genre-bound or narrative-oriented reasons.  Nude photography before cinema  Biograph film The Temptation of St. Anthony. Note the nude actress in an early American motion picture, before the Hollywood Motion Picture Production Code of film censorship. Nudity has almost universally not been permitted on stage, but sheer or simulated nudity may have been. Devices used include use of skin-tight flesh-colored bodystockings to simulate nudity or vital parts to be covered by long hair, for roles such as Lady Godiva.Actresses on the Victorian Stage: Feminine Performance and the Galatea Myth, p.134 by Gail Marshall American actress Adah Isaacs Menken created controversy in 1861 when she wore a flesh-colored bodystocking in the play Mazeppa, based on Byron's Mazeppa, in which she played a Polish man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies.Brooks, Daphne A. \\"Lady Menken's Secret: Adah Isaacs Menken, Actress Biographies and the Race for Sensation\\". Legacy, Volume 15, Number 1 (1998): pages 68‚Äì77. She also posed nude for photographs. Sarah Bernhardt early in her career posed topless on several occasions for French photographer Felix Nadar. She is nevertheless seen with her top covered in surviving stills of these sessions. At least one later topless photograph of the young Bernhardt made in 1873 survives. These nude sessions were not meant for outright public viewing but for the encouraging of theatrical employers or personal guests. Thus nude photos of women like Menken and Bernhardt are known only to scholars and perhaps theater buffs. The actress Kay Laurell wearing a bodystocking in 1910s image. In the 1880s, Eadweard Muybridge, at the dawn of the invention of the motion picture, used a device he called a zoopraxiscope to project a series of successive still photographs. The photos would then be played one after the other giving the illusion of movement. Sometimes the same sequence would be filmed using several cameras. Many of Muybridge's photographic sessions using the zoopraxiscope had nude anonymous models, both female and male.  Early films: the silent era  The first films containing nudity were the early erotic films. Production of such films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. The earliest film containing a simulated nude scene appears to be the 1897 After the Ball by French director George M√©li√®s, in which the director's future wife wears a bodystocking to simulate nudity. Two of the earliest pioneers of such erotica were Frenchmen Eug√®ne Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner (under the name \\"L√©ar\\") directed such films for Pirou. The 7-minute 1899 film Le Coucher de la Mari√©e had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease. Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqu√© films, showing women disrobing. After the Ball (1897) is the earliest known film to show nudity. In Austria, Johann Schwarzer sought to break the dominance of French-produced erotic films being distributed by the Path√© brothers. Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at men-only theatre nights (called Herrenabende). These films were promoted as erotic and artistic, rather than pornographic, but in 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities and its films destroyed.Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf√§nge der √∂sterreichischen Kinematografie. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, . However, copies of at least a half of the films have been found in private hands. Filmarchiv Austria has included four of Schwarzer's works on the Europa Film Treasures site: Das Sandbad (1906), Baden Verboten (1906), Das Eitle Stubenm√§dchen (1908) and Beim Fotografen (1908). The 1911 Italian film Dante's Inferno, directed by Francesco Bertolini, is loosely adapted from Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy and inspired by the illustrations of Gustave Dor√©. In depicting tormented souls in hell, there are frequent glimpses of nude male and female actors (including the first male frontal scenes). Remade many times, the U.S. version, Dante's Inferno (1924) from the Fox Film Corporation, also contains groups of nude figures and scenes of flagellation. Audrey Munson in Inspiration (1915), the first non-pornographic American film containing nude scenes. Inspiration, a silent film released in 1915, is believed to be the first American motion picture with a leading actor in a nude scene. The context of the nudity in the film was that of an artist's model, played by Audrey Munson, at work. Munson appeared nude again in a similar role in the 1916 film Purity. A feature of these films was that Munson was a tableau vivant, not being required to move, and only her backside and breasts were in view. Annette Kellermann, the famous Australian swimming star, appeared fully nude in an active role in Fox's A Daughter of the Gods in 1916. Though shot from the front, most of Kellerman's body is covered by her long hair. Kellerman had appeared in several lost films prior to 1912, but whether she did nude scenes in them is unknown. A couple of her films from 1910, thought to have been lost, have been rediscovered in Australia. Several early films of the silent era and early sound era include women in nude scenes, presented in a historical or religious context. One such film was the anticlerical Hypocrites (1915), directed by Lois Weber, which contained several sequences with Margaret Edwards appearing nude (uncredited) as a ghostly apparition representing Truth. Her scenes were created using innovative traveling double exposure sequences which made her appear as a semi-transparent spirit. In 1917, Fox produced the lavish Cleopatra in which Theda Bara wore a number of risqu√© outfits. Gordon Griffith appeared as a young naked Tarzan in Tarzan of the Apes (1918), making him the first child actor to appear naked on screen. Nell Shipman appeared nude in the Canadian film Back to God's Country (1919). Fox produced The Queen of Sheba in 1921 starring Betty Blythe, who displayed ample nudity even when wearing 28 different diaphanous costumes. There is also a brief moment in D. W. Griffith's Orphans of the Storm (1921 at 43.15 min) to display the debauchery of the French aristocracy. A still of Annette Kellermann from A Daughter of the Gods (1916). Is Your Daughter Safe? (1927) was one of the earliest exploitation films which contained nudity. A compilation of medical documentary films and stock footage of nude scenes dating back to the 1900s, it was presented as an educational film about the dangers of venereal disease, white slavery, and prostitution. Hula (1927) is a feature film of this period in which then-popular star Clara Bow does a nude bathing scene. Exploitation short subjects (three to 15 minutes in length) with comedic plots and frequent nudity were also produced in the silent era. A few have survived to the present such as Forbidden Daughters (13 minutes, 1927), directed by prominent nude photographer Albert Arthur Allen, Hollywood Script Girl (three minutes, 1928), and Uncle Si and the Sirens (eight minutes, c. 1928). These were the forerunners of the \\"nudie\\" comedy feature films that emerged in the late 1950s. Years later, when the Hays Code came into force, these films were considered too obscene to be reshown. Most of these films are now lost. Theda Bara in one of the risqu√© outfits in Cleopatra (1917). In France in the 1920s, short-subject films were made of a topless Josephine Baker performing exotic dance routines. The 1922 Swedish/Danish silent horror film H√§xan contained nude scenes, torture and sexual perversion. The film was banned in the U.S. and had to be edited before it was shown in other countries. The 1929 Russian film Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov featured nudity within the context of naturism, including live childbirth.  U.S. cinema since 1929  = Overview = Filmmaking started in the 1890s, with the first feature-length film being produced in 1906.The Story of the Kelly Gang Nude scenes appeared in films from the start of the new invention. Several Hollywood films produced in the 1910s and 1920s, which contained only brief nudity, created controversy. Various groups objected to these features on moral grounds, and several states set up film censorship boards, arguing that such content was obscene and should be banned. Under pressure, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) created its own censorship agency, the Hays Code, which brought an end to nudity and risqu√© content in films produced by the main Hollywood studios (i.e., MPAA members). The Code was adopted in 1930, and began to be effectively enforced in 1934. At the same time, the Catholic Legion of Decency was formed to keep an eye on the morals conveyed in films and indicate its disapproval by \\"condemning\\" films it considered morally objectionable (theaters would not show a condemned film until this system was defeated in the 1960s). Social and official attitudes toward nudity have eased since those days and the Code came under repeated challenge in the 1950s and '60s. In 1958, the New York Court of Appeals ruled, in the context of prohibition of screenings of films, that a film that merely contains nudity was not obscene. The Code was abandoned in 1968, in favor of the MPAA film rating system. From its early days the presence of nudity in a film has been controversial and even today its presence is invariably noted by critics and censors. Until the 1980s, male nudity was rarely shown on screen. Though female nudity was routinely treated with respect and solemnity, male nudity, when it finally found its way onto the screen, was generally treated humorously and mockingly. Today, though nudity in film is much more common, its presence in dramas is still expected to be justified on artistic grounds. = Pre-Hays Code Hollywood, 1929‚Äì1934 = The silent film era came to an end in 1929. In 1930, the Motion Picture Association of America drew up the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, to raise the moral standards of films by directly restricting the materials which the major film studios could include in their films. The code authorized nudity only in naturist quasi-documentary films and in foreign films. However, the code was not enforced until 1934. After the end of silent films, movies with sound that included brief glimpses of nudity appeared as early as 1930 with All Quiet on the Western Front. Cecil B. DeMille, later known as a family entertainment specialist, included several nude scenes in his early films such as The Sign of the Cross (1932), Four Frightened People (1934), and Cleopatra (1934). The \\"Dance of the Naked Moon\\" and orgy scene was cut for The Sign of the Cross in a 1938 reissue to comply with the production code. Other filmmakers followed suit, particularly in historical dramas such as The Scarlet Empress (1934) ‚Äì which, among other things, shows topless women being burned at the stake ‚Äì and contemporary stories filmed in exotic, mostly tropical, locations. Bird of Paradise, directed by King Vidor in 1932, featured a nude swimming scene with Dolores del R√≠o, and Harry Lachman's Dante's Inferno featured many naked men and women suffering in hell. The early Tarzan films with Johnny Weissmuller featured at least partial nudity justified by the natural surroundings in which the characters lived; in Tarzan and His Mate in 1934, Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan, doubled by Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim) swims in the nude. Under the pretense of being an educational ethnographic film, producers could justify showing half-clad natives in jungle epics and South-Sea-island documentaries. This was often done by editing in stock footage or fabricating new scenes with ethnic-looking stand-ins. Examples of docufiction include Ingagi (1930), notorious for its fake scenes of semi-nude \\"native\\" girls filmed on a back lot. Forbidden Adventure in Angkor (1937) is a 1912 Cambodia documentary with scenes added, for dramatic effect, of two explorers and a dozen topless female bearers, incongruously played by African-American women. The Sea Fiend (1935), re-issued as Devil Monster (1946), is a low-budget South-Sea drama spiced up with stock footage inserts of half-dressed native girls. Other films of questionable authenticity in this subgenre include Moana (1926), Trader Horn, The Blonde Captive, Tabu: A Story of the South Seas (all 1931), Goona Goona aka Kriss, Isle of Paradise, Virgins of Bali, Bird of Paradise (all 1932), Gow aka Gow the Killer (1934, re-released as Cannibal Island in 1956), Inyaah, Jungle Goddess (1934), Legong: Dance of the Virgins (1935), Love Life of a Gorilla (1937), Mau-Mau (1955), and Naked Africa (1957). Due to the diaphanous or sheer nature of 1920s and 1930s fashions, female body parts or virtual nudity, or both, can be on display even when the performer is fully clothed. As a result, when the Hays Code came into force in 1934, studio wardrobe departments had to attire actresses in more conservative as well as contemporary dress. = Hays Code Enforcement Hollywood, 1934‚Äì1960s = Scene of Shirley Mills from Child Bride (1938) Though in place, the Hays Code was not enforced until 1934, spurred on in response to objections voiced by several groups to the content of Hollywood films ‚Äì provoked at least partly by the notorious 1933 Czech film Ecstasy, which was highly controversial in its time largely because of a nude swimming scene by Hedy Lamarr as well as perhaps the first non-pornographic film to portray sexual intercourse,\\"Curiously, Extase is celebrated as the first motion picture containing a nude scene, which it was not, rather than the first to show sexual intercourse, which it was.\\" although never showing more than the actors' faces. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm. The restrictions of the production code were strictly enforced from 1934 until the early 1960s to restrict nudity in films produced by the studios. United States-produced films were also under the scrutiny of moral guardians, such as the Catholic Legion of Decency, which had an influence on the content and subject matter of films in the 1930s and 1940s. They were also subject to constraints of state censorship authorities. These bodies followed inconsistent guidelines through which the film producers had to navigate; with some films being exhibited in cut versions in some states. The Hays Code was so strict that even the display of cleavage was controversial. Producer Howard Hughes created controversy by his emphasis on cleavage, especially that of Jane Russell, first in the 1941 film The Outlaw and also in the 1953 film The French Line. The film was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Russell's \\"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\\" while some of her decollete gowns were regarded to be \\"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage\\". Both films were condemned by the Legion of Decency and were released only in cut versions. Independent film producers ‚Äì i.e., those outside the studio system ‚Äì were not bound by the restrictions of the Hays Code. However, they were subject to state censorship regimes and could be excluded from so-called \\"family\\" theatres. These films claimed to be educational and dealt with taboo topics such as drug parties, prostitution, and sexually transmitted infections. In the course of presenting the message, nudity at times made an appearance. These films, which emerged in the 1930s, were obliged to play in independent theaters or traveled across the United States in \\"roadshow\\" fashion. They were normally low-budget, and described as sensationalized exploitation films. Using this framework, brief nude scenes of women appeared in Maniac (1934) and Sex Madness (1937), and nude swimming sequences in Marihuana (1936) and Child Bride (1938). Child Bride was controversial because it included a topless and skinny dipping scene by 12-year-old Shirley Mills, which was described by Allmovie as \\"gratuitous child nudity\\", though in some versions the topless scene was cut out. Exploitative films with pseudo-ethnographic pretensions continued well into the 1960s. For example, Mau-Mau (1955), presented as a documentary of the violent nationalist uprising in Kenya, played the grind- house circuit. Fabricated scenes filmed in front of a painted backdrop of an African village show nude and semi-clad \\"native\\" women being raped, strangled, and stabbed by machete-wielding maniacs. Other films containing nudity were the early underground 8mm pornographic films and fetish reels which, due to various censorship regimes, had only limited (usually clandestine) means of distribution and were only shown in private until the 1970s. = Nudist films = Nudist films first appeared in the early 1930s as documentaries, Utopian and docu-dramas promoting the healthy lifestyle of the naturist movement in Europe and the U.S. Earliest examples include This Nude World (1933), a narrated documentary filmed in the U.S., France, and Germany, and Elysia, Valley of the Nude (1933), a docu-drama filmed at a nudist camp in Elsinore, California. Throughout the thirties, nudist films like Why Nudism? (1933), Nudist Land (1937), and The Unashamed (1938) flourished in road shows, but disappeared entirely in the forties. The nudist-camp movie was revived in the 1950s with Garden of Eden (1954), the first naturist film shot in color. Changes in censorship laws led to a flood of films such as Naked Venus (1958) directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, Nudist Memories (1959), and Daughter of the Sun (1962) by David F. Friedman, and Herschell Gordon Lewis. Doris Wishman was probably the most active producer/director in the genre, with eight nudist films to her credit between 1960 and 1964, with Hideout in the Sun (1960), Nude on the Moon (1961), Diary of a Nudist (1961), Blaze Starr Goes Nudist (1962), Gentlemen Prefer Nature Girls (1963), Playgirls International (1963), Behind the Nudist Curtain (1964), and The Prince and the Nature Girl (1964). Edward Craven Walker (1918-2000), the inventor of the lava lamp, was a major figure in the naturist movement. He made three nudist films under the name Michael Keatering. They were Travelling Light (1959), Sunswept (1962), and Eves on Skis (1963). Ramsey Harrington produced The Nudist Story (1960) (retitled \\"For Members Only\\" or \\"Pussycat's Paradise\\" for the U.S. market), Arthur Knight produced My Bare Lady (1963) and Leo Orenstein (under the pseudonym Alan Overton) directed Have Figure, Will Travel (1963).Storey, Mark (2003). Cinema Au Naturel: A History of Nudist Film. . Exploitation producer George Weiss also released films such as Nudist Life (1961), which comprised vintage nudist camp footage. In the same year, in England, Harrison Marks released Naked as Nature Intended which starred Pamela Green and was a box office success (Marks soon went to make softcore pornographic and caning/spanking fetish films). Nudist films claimed to depict the lifestyles of members of the nudism or naturist movement, but were largely a vehicle for the exhibition of female nudity. They were mainly shot in naturist resorts, but augmented by attractive glamour models. The nudity was strictly non-sexual and when filmed frontally the members' pubic area was strictly covered by the angle of shot or some clothing or other objects. There was uninhibited exposure of breasts and backsides though. The acting and technical production standards were not very high and the outlets for their exhibition were very limited, as was the size of the audience interested in these films, and many films were re-released several times under new titles, to trick patrons into seeing the films additional times. What audience there was lost interest in these films by the mid-1960s and production ceased. = Nudie-cuties = At the same time, some independent producers produced erotic feature films which openly contained female nudity without the pretext of a naturist context. These nudie-cuties followed the formula of being humorous films with hapless, bumbling males and glorified women. The groundbreaking The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959) directed by Russ Meyer was the first of such films. In that film, the context for the presentation of female nudity was the fantasies of the main character. The film is widely considered the first pornographic feature not confined to under-the-counter distribution, and the film was commercially successful. Russ Meyer made two more nudie-cuties: Wild Gals of the Naked West, and Eve and the Handyman, starring his wife Eve in the title role. For the next few years a wave of such films, known as \\"nudies\\" or \\"nudie-cuties\\", were produced for adult theatres (in the United States sometimes called grindhouse theatres). The films bailed out movie houses that were facing stiff competition from television at the time. Nudie-cutie advertising was packed with tag-lines such as \\"You'll Never See This on TV\\". Films in this genre included Doris Wishman's science fiction spoof Nude on the Moon (1961), the Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman film The Adventures of Lucky Pierre (1961), and Ed Woods horror-nudie Orgy of the Dead (1965), with its bevy of topless dancers from beyond the grave, following his Western screenplay Revenge of the Virgins (1959), which shows a fierce tribe of bare- breasted Indian women hunting a group of treasure seekers. There were very many other similar films and sequels. One of the most renowned nudie-cuties is The Imp-probable Mr Weegee, a pseudo-documentary in which famed crime photographer Arthur Fellig, nicknamed \\"Mr. WeeGee\\", stars as himself. In the film, he falls in love with a store window dummy. Besides Russ Meyer, the only director in this field to go on to critical success is Francis Ford Coppola, who began his career writing and directing a pair of nudie comedies in 1962, Tonight for Sure and The Bellboy and the Playgirls. Harrison Marks's The Naked World of Harrison Marks (1967) and Nine Ages of Nakedness (1969) could be considered late additions to the genre. = Challenges to the Hays Code, 1960‚Äì1966 = Jayne Mansfield nude in Promises! Promises! (1963) In Michael Powell's controversial British film Peeping Tom, released in 1960, a model (Pamela Green) lies back on a bed waiting to be photographed by the killer in a key scene. She undoes her top briefly exposing one of her breasts. The scene is regarded as the first female nude scene in a mainstream postwar English- language feature film, and notably the first such scene for a British film. The movie was panned by critics at the time and it reportedly destroyed Powell's directing career in the UK. The film is now seen as a cult classic; Martin Scorsese re-released it in 1979. Another 1960 release, the American horror film Macumba Love, featured a brief topless scene of June Wilkinson frolicking in the ocean. This segment, which caused a sensation at the time, only was seen in the European release of the film. By now the Production Code had been revised so that it served less as a doctrine of rules and more as a workable set of precautions, including those on sex and nudity, to which filmmakers were advised on the more graphic depictions and given exceptions that could be made. It gave the MPAA the power to label certain films that were seen as containing adult or provocative material as \\"Suggested for Mature Audiences\\".  First major nude scenes in studio films  The unfinished 1962 film Something's Got to Give included a nude pool swim scene with Marilyn Monroe. For the filming of the scene, a body stocking was made for Monroe, and the set was to be closed to all but necessary crew. However, Monroe asked photographers to come in, including William Woodfield, and took off the body stocking and swam in only a flesh-colored bikini bottom. After filming was completed, Monroe was photographed in the bikini bottom, and without it.\\"They Fired Marilyn: Her Dip Lives On\\", Life, June 22, 1962.Marilyn Monroe Pictures: Something's Got to Give. Had the project been completed and released as planned, it would have been the first Hollywood film of the sound era to feature a mainstream actress in the nude. However, this was not the first instance of Monroe being filmed in the nude. In the 1961 John Huston film The Misfits, Monroe, playing the lead female character, drops a sheet during an intimate scene, exposing herself on camera. Huston, however, decided not to include the footage in the final cut, as he believed it was of no value to the story. The script did not emphasize nudity in the 45-second-long love scene, but Monroe thought it was required, seeing that her character is putting on her clothes while being alone in the room, and it made \\"no sense\\" that \\"a woman sitting up in bed, with nobody in the room, [would] pull the sheet up and then try to put a blouse on at the same time\\". Charles Casillo, author of Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon, says the footage was preserved by Misfits producer Frank E. Taylor and has been, as of 2018, in the possession of his son, Curtice Taylor, since 1999. The distinction of being the first mainstream American actress to appear nude in a starring role went to actress Jayne Mansfield in the 1963 film Promises! Promises!, though her pubic area is never visible on film. The film was banned in Cleveland and some other cities, though later the Cleveland court decided the nude scenes in the film were not lewd. Both the original and an edited version enjoyed box office success elsewhere. As a result of the film's success, Mansfield landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for that year. However, Chicago Sun- Times movie critic Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Finally in Promises! Promises! she does what no Hollywood star ever does except in desperation. She does a nudie. In 1963, that kind of box office appeal was all she had left.\\" Mansfield's autobiographical book Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World‚Äîwhich she co-wrote with Mickey Hargitay‚Äîwas published directly after the release of the film. It contains 32 pages of black-and-white photographs from the movie printed on glossy paper.Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World on Amazon.com. Photographs of a naked Mansfield on the set were published in the June 1963 edition of Playboy. The Pawnbroker, released in 1964, breached the Motion Picture Production Code with actresses Linda Geiser and Thelma Oliver (who later became the mystic and yoga teacher Krishna Kaur Khalsa) fully exposing their breasts.World Sex Records . Retrieved 8 March 2009. Allied Artists refused to cut the film and released it to theaters without a Production Code seal. The nudity resulted in a backlash from moral and religious conservatives, including the Catholic Legion (which by that time had become a virtually powerless fringe organization). However, critical and overall public response was positive, and many Catholics rebuked the Legion's condemnation of the film. The National Council of Churches even gave the movie an award for Best Picture of the Year. The 1965 thriller The Collector contained mild nudity of Samantha Eggar and added to the challenge to the blanket prohibition of nudity in films. That same year Paula Prentiss performed a strip-tease in the Woody Allen-scripted comedy What's New Pussycat?, which ended up on the cutting room floor but resurfaced on the pages of Playboy, and Julie Christie appeared nude in the British drama film Darling. U.S. release prints of the film and even later U.S. video and DVD versions cut the nudity.\\"Darling (1965) - Alternative Versions\\". IMDb.com. Retrieved 16 July 2013. In 1966, Michelangelo Antonioni's seminal film Blowup was the first English-language film to show a woman's pubic hair. Antonioni's mod-influenced murder-mystery contained a scene involving two girls undressing before being chased around a studio by a fashion photographer, who wrestles them to the ground and exposes their torsos. There are additional scenes depicting sexuality and partial nudity, as well as blatant drug use. The film was produced in Britain and released to American audiences by MGM without Production Code approval, the first mainstream motion picture containing nudity to be released by a major studio in the US,\\"Blowup\\". IMDB.com. Retrieved 8 August 2012. the first open defiance by a major studio of the Code. That same year the biblical epic based on the book of Genesis The Bible: In the Beginning..., was released by Twentieth Century Fox featuring a nude sequence of Adam and Eve. Another epic, the historical film Hawaii (1966) featured scenes of topless native girls. John Frankenheimer's 1966 sci-fi thriller Seconds contained an extended sequence of full frontal male and female nudity that was deleted from the original American release in which bohemian revelers dance and play in a wine vat. By 1967, the MPAA had abandoned the Production Code altogether, and in November 1968, the voluntary MPAA film rating system was implemented. The rating system has changed in minor ways since its inception, but the type and intensity of nudity continue to be rating criteria. = Sexploitation films in the U.S.A = By the mid-1960s, the novelty of the purely voyeuristic nudie-cutie/nudist camp comedy had dissipated. A new cycle of more realistic sex dramas and gritty, film noir-inspired crime stories (mostly filmed in black-and-white) emerged to dominate the adult market. These films had a much harder edge and dealt with racy subjects such as infidelity, wife-swapping, prostitution, lesbianism, drugs, white slavery, rape, psycho-killers, sex cults, decadence, sadomasochism, and sexual perversion. The films that concentrate on the dark and violent side of sexuality are generally known as \\"roughies\\". Prime examples of roughie sexploitation include: Lewis and Friedman's Scum of the Earth! (1963); Russ Meyer's Lorna (1964); Joseph P. Mawra's misogynistic Olga trilogy, White Slaves of Chinatown, Olga's Girls, and Olga's House of Shame (all 1964); R. Lee Frost's The Defilers (1965); Doris Wishman's Bad Girls Go to Hell (1965); The Sexploiters (1965); The Agony of Love (1966), and Michael Findlay's Body of a Female (1965) and psycho-killer trilogy starting with The Touch of Her Flesh (1967). Sexploitation films initially played in grindhouse theatres and struggling independent theaters. However, by the end of the 1960s they were playing in established cinema chains. As the genre developed during the 1960s films began showing scenes of simulated sex. By the late 1960s, the films were attracting a larger and broader audience, including couples rather than the single males who originally made up the vast majority of patrons. The genre rapidly declined in the early 1970s due to advertising bans, the closure of many grindhouses and drive-in theaters, and the growth of hardcore pornography in the \\"Golden Age of Porn\\". During this period a number of adult films that were sexually explicit received general theatrical releases, including Blue Movie (1969), Mona the Virgin Nymph (1970), Deep Throat (1972), and others. Frost's Love Camp 7 (1968) was the forerunner of the women in prison and Nazi exploitation subgenres which have continued to the present day. Their stories feature women in prison who are subjected to sexual and physical abuse, typically by sadistic male or female prison wardens and guards. The genre also features many films in which imprisoned women engage in lesbian sex. These films discarded all moralistic pretensions and were works of pure fantasy intended only to titillate the audience with a lurid mix of sex and violence, including voyeurism (strip searches, group shower scenes, cat-fights) to sexual fantasies (lesbianism), to fetishism (bondage, whipping, degradation), and outright sadism (rape, sexual slavery, beatings, torture, cruelty). = Sexploitation films in Asia = In Japan, Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh (1964) was the first mainstream film with nudity seen in \\"general release\\" (as opposed to adults-only) theaters. Suzuki was a pioneer of the film noir. His surreal and influential Branded to Kill (1967) contains several scenes of casual nudity (the actors had to wear adhesive patches to avoid censorship problems). In Japan, films called pink films (pinky violent movies) were partly influenced by the Japanese Ero guro films which focuses on sexual corruption, and decadence. Many, such as Shogun's Joys of Torture(by Teruo Ishii)(1968), deal directly with sadomasochism or include fetishistic scenes of female victims being bound. = 1968‚Äìpresent day = In 1968 the Hays Code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system. Since then nudity in various forms has become more common. A number of actresses have appeared nude or partially nude in films, and it has become increasingly common for actresses to appear topless in movies. Notable actresses who have appeared topless include Jane Fonda (Coming Home, 1978), Julie Andrews (S.O.B., 1981), Kate Winslet (Titanic, 1997), Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, 1998), Reese Witherspoon (Twilight, 1998), Rene Russo (The Thomas Crown Affair, 1999), Katie Holmes (The Gift, 2000), and Halle Berry (Swordfish, 2001). In an interview in March 2007, Halle Berry said that her toplessness in Swordfish was \\"gratuitous\\" to the movie, but that she needed to do the scene to get over her fear of nudity, and that it was the best thing she did for her career. Having overcome her inhibitions, she went on to a role in Monster's Ball, which required her to be nude in a sex scene featuring her and Billy Bob Thornton, and which won her an Oscar for Best Actress.Jam Showbiz Movies, 22 March 2007: Halle Berry bares her soul Some actresses prefer not to expose their breasts and use a body double. In 2007, Judd Apatow announced \\"I'm gonna get a penis or a vagina in every movie I do from now on. . . . It really makes me laugh in this day and age, with how psychotic our world is, that anyone is troubled by seeing any part of the human body.\\" On October 11, 2010, the Motion Picture Association of America's Classification and Rating Administration announced that it would specifically note in the future which films contained \\"male nudity\\" in direct response to parental concerns about the content of the movie Br√ºno. Actors and actresses are usually informed of nude scenes well in advance, and nudity waivers require directors to state what will be shown and how it will be presented. This is generally stipulated in the nudity clause of a performer's contract. Actress Anne Hathaway said in an interview with National Public Radio, \\"The director submits a shot list, and you look over them for approval. And a lot of times, if an actor feels the shot demands a lot of them, they'll demand money for it.\\" The tastefulness of nude scenes is hotly debated in the United States. Adding nudity to films may potentially hurt a film's commercial potential.  European cinema since 1929  Austrian actress Senta Berger in Giacomo Casanova: Childhood and Adolescence (1969) Some European films showed more nudity than the American films, due to less strict attitudes about nudity in some parts of Europe. European films exhibited in the United States were not subject to the Hays Code, though some did create controversy. The 1931 Greek film Daphnis and Chloe by Orestis Laskos featured the first nude scene in a European fiction film, showing Chloe bathing in a fountain.Babis, Aktsoglou (c. 2003): CineMythology: Greek Myths in World Cinema , a catalogue published within the frame of the Cultural Olympiad 2001-2004. Gustav Machat√Ω's Extase (1933) with Hedy Lamarr was condemned by Pope Pius XI. It was very controversial on its release in the United States and is credited with contributing to the repressive regime under the Hays Code. Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia (1938), which was produced as Nazi propaganda and a documentary of the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, has an opening sequence noted for its idealized, non- exploitive use of male and female nudity. Another film from Germany, Liane, Jungle Goddess (1956), featured Marion Michael as a topless female variant on the Tarzan legend. Alessandro Blasetti's La cena delle beffe (Dinner of fun, 1941) had Clara Calamai in what is credited as being the first topless scene in an Italian film. It was soon followed by similar scenes in the Italian films La corona di ferro (The Iron Crown, 1941) and Carmela (1942). Other noteworthy European films which contained nudity include Italian film Era lui... s√¨! s√¨! (1951, with then-15 year old Sophia Loren in a harem scene), two of Ingmar Bergman's Swedish films Hamnstad (Port of Call, 1948) and Summer with Monika (1953), Jean-Pierre Melville's French film Bob le flambeur (Bob the Gambler, 1956, with Isabelle Corey, then-age 16), Fran√ßois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player (1960), The Awful Dr. Orloff (1961), a French-Spanish horror film by Jes√∫s Franco, Brigitte Bardot's casual nude scenes in Contempt (1963) by Jean-Luc Godard, the French film The Game Is Over (1966, with Jane Fonda), Luis Bu√±uel's Belle de Jour (1967, with Catherine Deneuve) and Isadora (1968, with Vanessa Redgrave). Makers of the British film The Pleasure Girls (1965) shot an alternate version of a party scene with brief nudity that only appears in the export print. The 1966 British-Italian film Blowup became the first mainstream English-language film to show a woman's pubic hair, although the particular shot was only a few seconds long. (Some sources, such as Playboy's History of Sex in Cinema series, have stated that the pubic hair exposure was unintended). Two Swedish films from 1967, I Am Curious (Yellow) and Inga, were ground-breaking‚Äîand famous‚Äîfor showing explicit sex and nudity. Both were initially banned in the U.S. and were rated X when they were shown in 1968. I Am Curious (Yellow) was banned in Massachusetts, more on the basis of the sexuality than the nudity, and was the subject of prosecution.United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts - Karalexis v. Byrne, 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (Byrne v. Karalexis, 396 U.S. 976 (1969) and 401 U.S. 216 (1971). The film was held not to be obscene. Swedish actress Janet √Ögren in Italian Decamerotico film Racconti proibiti... di niente vestiti (1972) There was a surge in nudity in film in the United Kingdom after 1960. The gritty social drama This Sporting Life (1963) was among the first to include glimpses of male nudity. Judy Geeson's uninhibited nude swim in Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (1967) created a stir at the time. The surreal student protest film If.... (1968) was notorious and controversial for its frontal male nudity (excised by censors), female nudity, sex, violence and homosexuality. Ken Russell's Women in Love (1969) was especially controversial for showing frontal male nudity in a wrestling scene between Oliver Reed and Alan Bates. Glenda Jackson won the Academy Award for Best Actress in that film, the first performer to win for a role that included nude scenes. There was also a long line of sex comedies, beginning with Mary Had a Little... (1961), which were more intended to display nudity than sexuality.McGillivray, David: Doing Rude Things: The History of the British Sex Film 1957-1981, Sun Tavern Fields Books, 1992. . Other British sex comedies included What's Good for the Goose (1969). There apparently are two versions of the film, one being an uncensored version (105 minutes vs. the censored 98-minute version), which shows nudity from Sally Geeson (Judy's sister); this version was released in continental Europe. Other films include Percy and its sequel, Percy's Progress, as well as the Carry On series, which added nudity to its saucy seaside postcard innuendo. Series producer Peter Rogers saw the George Segal movie Loving (1970) and added his two favorite words to the title, making Carry On Loving the twentieth in the series, followed by Carry On Girls, based around a Miss World-style beauty contest. Next in the series was Carry On Dick, with more risque humour and Sid James and Barbara Windsor's on- and off-screen lovemaking.Behind the scenes of Carry Ons.. There was also the science fiction comedy Zeta One (1969) with Yutte Stensgaard and biographical films such as Savage Messiah (1972) which contained a long nude scene with Helen Mirren. Traditionally conservative Hammer Film Productions introduced nudity into their line of horror and fantasy films starting with The Vampire Lovers (1970), Countess Dracula (1971), both featuring Ingrid Pitt, When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970) with Victoria Vetri, Lust for a Vampire (1971), Twins of Evil (1971), et al. The Commedia sexy all'italiana genre of Italian film of the 1970s and early 1980s featured abundant female nudity in a clich√©d form, most of it for the local market, but some for the international market. The Italian-produced Last Tango in Paris (1973), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, was one of the first commercial films to openly contain nudity, and led to the boom of other fashion erotic films, such as the French-produced Emmanuelle (1974) and the Franco-German production Story of O (1975) by Just Jaeckin, the Franco- Japanese production In the Realm of the Senses (1976) by Nagisa Oshima, and the Italian-American produced Caligula (1979) by Tinto Brass. The films of Catherine Breillat, a French filmmaker, are well known for containing explicit nudity. Her film Une vraie jeune fille (1975) contains close-ups of actress Charlotte Alexandra's breasts and vulva and actor Bruno Balp's erect penis, some of which are particularly graphic in nature (including a sequence where an actor attempts to insert an earthworm into Alexandra's vagina). This resulted in the film not officially being released until 1999. Other actresses who have appeared in explicit full-frontal nude scenes in Breillat's films include Caroline Ducey in Romance (1999) and Roxane Mesquida in Sex Is Comedy (2002). Bernardo Bertolucci's film The Dreamers (2003) included extensive full frontal nude scenes, male and female, and graphic sex scenes. Italian actress Gloria Guida, one of the Commedia sexy's icons, in That Malicious Age (1975) European attitudes towards depictions of nudity tend to be relatively relaxed and there are few taboos around it. Showing of full frontal nudity in movies, even by major actors, is common and it is not considered damaging to the actors' careers. In recent years explicit unsimulated sexual intercourse occurs in movies which target the general movie-going audience, albeit those usually labeled 'arthouse' product; for example, Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs and Lars von Trier's The Idiots. The Italian film 1900 (1976), a.k.a. Novecento, includes an explicit scene of the actors Robert De Niro and G√©rard Depardieu, who are shown on either side of the actress Stefania Casini as their penises are briefly fondled and masturbated by her. Another scene features two prepubescent boys undressing, one of whom is shown frontally naked. They then compare the lengths of their penises, and attempt to retract their foreskins, during which one of them becomes fully erect. The Finnish documentary Steam of Life about men in saunas shows nudity throughout the film. In the Dutch movie All Stars 2: Old Stars, the main characters stay in a nudist campsite. Much full frontal nudity is displayed, but not of any of the main characters. The French film Stranger by the Lake (2013) is set on a male nude beach, showing much male full frontal nudity. Although there has been a gradual relaxation of attitudes towards nudity, changes in laws can lead to more stringent criteria. One prominent case involved Walkabout (1971) which includes numerous scenes of full frontal nudity featuring 17-year-old Jenny Agutter which did not pose a problem when submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in 1971 and later in 1998, since the Protection of Children Act 1978 permitted the distribution and possession of indecent images of people over the age of 16; however, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 raised the age threshold to 18 which meant the actress' age was a factor when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes in regards to the law and deemed them to not be \\"indecent\\" and passed the film uncut. Had this not been the case, the film would have been refused classification and it would have effectively made it illegal to possess a copy of the film, including copies that had been purchased legally at the time.  Contemporary trends in Western cinema  Over the years, nudity in film was a source of scandal and provocation; but its presence today is treated largely naturally, frequently with nudity being shown in scenes that naturally require it, such as those that take place in nature or in the bathroom or in love scenes. For example, The Blue Lagoon (1980) shows the awakening of the sexual instinct in two shipwrecked young cousins ‚Äì one male, one female ‚Äì on a tropical island where nudity is a natural part of the environment in which they find themselves. The relationship between a painter and his model, who traditionally poses in the nude, is the context of a number of films. In La Belle Noiseuse (\\"The Beautiful Liar\\", 1991) the painter's model motivates him again after a period of lack of inspiration of the artist. Similarly, in Titanic (1997) Kate Winslet poses nude for Leonardo DiCaprio. These films show the close relationship between film and the traditional art nude in art in films such as The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), where Uma Thurman poses as Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, and Goya in Bordeaux (1999), where Maribel Verd√∫ poses as Goya's The Naked Maja. There are film scenes where nudity, in routine and non-sexual situations, such as mixed shower scenes, has been used to emphasize gender equity in the future, as in Starship Troopers. Another example of the practice involves scenes with a nude swim, also called skinny- dipping, such as Kelly Brook and Riley Steele in Piranha 3D. Toplessness in film is regarded by some as partial nudity, such as Halle Berry in Swordfish.  East Asian cinema since 1929  Female nudity has been fairly common in Japanese cinema since at least the 1960s when the director Seijun Suzuki included nude scenes in his yakuza exploitation films such as Branded to Kill (1967). The actress Reiko Ike headlined a number of exploitation flicks in the early 1970s: Girl Boss Guerilla (1972), Criminal Woman (1973) and Sex and Fury (1973). Nagisa Oshima directed the overtly sexual In the Realm of the Senses in 1976 starring Eiko Matsuda and Tatsuya Fuji. The unexpurgated version of the film has never been shown in Japan, and the film negatives had to be secretly shipped out of the country to France for developing. Eri Ishida appeared naked in Enrai (1981) and Daburu Beddo (1983), before going on to mainstream success. In 1986, Hitomi Kuroki appeared nude in Keshin. In the early 1990s, Loletta Lee appeared nude in a whole series of Hong Kong category III movies, e.g. Girls Unbutton, Crazy Love, and Sex and Zen 2 with Shu Qi. New Love in Tokyo (1994) was notable for having one of the first scenes of uncensored pubic hair. 2000 saw Harumi Inoue strip down for her role in Freeze Me. Full-frontal adult male nudity (in which genitals are fully revealed) traditionally has been taboo in mainstream cinema from East Asia (and for actors of East Asian origin living outside East Asia), in sharp contrast to the situation in mainland Europe, but similar to the US. However, two rare early examples of a challenge to this taboo occurred: first, in the early years of cinema in mainland China, in the black-and-white silent film The Big Road (1934), directed by radical 1930's Chinese film director Sun Yu, which features the full-frontal\\"Sinic Youth: Chinese Films Both Modern and Old Capture the Generation Gap - The Big Road (1934)\\" .

The Chinese Mirror. Retrieved 12 May 2013. a scene described as \\"very advanced for the time\\". Another example of nudity (but with simulated genitals) in East Asian cinema is the Japanese film Hanzo the Razor (1972). It is the first part of a trilogy, depicting Officer Hanzo Itami's foiling of a plot by corrupt officials in Edo period Japan. Simulated male and female genitals are shown in various scenes. There are also scenes showing Hanzo using sexually aggressive tactics in order to extract secrets from women who associated with Hanzo's suspects. However, a number of films from the early 1990s onwards have begun to lift this taboo. Among them are: the notable frequent full-frontal nudity of Hong Kong Chinese females and the brief but particularly notable full-frontal adult male nudity of a Hong Kong Chinese male actor, Chung Lin, who plays the robot version of Japanese scientist Ryuichi Yamamoto, in the 1991 Hong Kong science fiction/comedy film Robotrix (perhaps the first time in Hong Kong cinema that a Chinese adult male's genitals have been fully revealed on camera in a film on general release); the full-frontal male and female nudity of young Hong Kong Chinese actor Tony Leung Ka-fai and young British actress Jane March in the French/Vietnamese film The Lover (1992); the brief view of the genitals of Hong Kong Chinese actor Mark Cheng, as he walks around a room fully naked in the Hong Kong movie Raped by an Angel (1993); the full-frontal appearance of Hong Kong Chinese actor Michael Lam, who was the lead in the Hong Kong/Singapore film, Bugis Street (1995), as his clothes and underwear are torn off by his lover, fully exposing his genitals; a variety of East Asian actors whose genitals are shown in The Pillow Book (1996); of Hong Kong Chinese lead actor Sunny Chan in a bathroom scene as he enters a shower, fully revealing his genitals for a few moments, in the Hong Kong film Hold You Tight (1997), directed by Hong Kong film director Stanley Kwan; of mainland China lead actor Wang Hongwei in the mainland China film Xiao Wu (English title: The Pickpocket, 1998),\\"25th Seattle International Film Festival - Xiao Wu\\".

The 2015 films Unfreedom and The Painted House have nude scenes of the main protagonist actresses.  Animation  In animated films in the U.S., nudity is limited. Only a few mainstream animated films like Fritz the Cat (1972), Fantastic Planet (1973), and Heavy Metal (1981), have contained significant female full frontal nudity. In Japanese cinema, nudity taboos have evolved greatly since the dawn of animation, and anime, the general category of animated films, includes some films with a spectrum of nudity and sexual situations. The Toei Animation films Hols: Prince of the Sun in the 1960s and Tatsu no ko Taro in the 1970s include brief full nudity of their title characters. The popularity of OVA (Original Video Animation) direct-to-video series in Japan has been a major factor in the unique blend of content in Japanese anime. Starting in the mid-1980s when video tape players became common home appliances, themes of nudity and sexual content flourished in Japanese animation with the hallmarks of many modern subgenres being established early with such films and OVA series as Lolita Anime, Cream Lemon and Urotsukid≈çji. Such sexually explicit films or those with significant nudity are referred to as hentai outside of Japan.

It is the successor to the mus√©e fran√ßais du chemin de fer (trans. French national railway museum), the organisation responsible for the conservation of major historical SNCF railway equipment. History In 1961, Mulhouse City Council offered land in Dornach to allow the SNCF to present their historical rolling stock, representative of the company's history. In 1971, the first locomotives were provisionally placed in the old engine shed, Mulhouse-Nord. A second site nearby was opened to the public in 1983 at which stage the museum received 240,000 visitors a year. As attendance declined, it was decided to transfer the collection to the group Culture Espaces, which was already in charge of the Cit√© de l'automobile (French national automobile museum) since 1999. The French national, regional and departmental governments, as well as the City of Mulhouse, financed a renovation at a total cost of 8.6 million euros. The architect Fran√ßois Seigneur designed an exhibition display named Le si√®cle d'or du chemin de fer (The golden century of railway), tracing historical events from 1860 to 1940, in a new hall nearly 6,000 square metres with 25 additional exhibits, bringing the total number in the museum to 103. In semi-darkness, the visitor may discover several sections of similar technology in display cabinets, with mannequins life-size Scultor plastic artiste Rebecca Campeau , that light up as the visitor approaches, including poorer and richer aspects of railway life.

The school's Principal is Honi Faasisila. The school is a registered war memorial.  History  In 1938 Kahibah Public School was established as an Infants (early primary) school in the Kahibah Memorial Hall with an initial enrolment of 33 students and with a single teacher. By 1949 the enrolment had risen to 50 however the school still had only one teacher and a new, more permanent school that catered for all primary ages was needed. After closing for a short time in 1951, with most students transferred to the school at Charlestown, it reopened as a Primary school in 1952. In 1953 land at the present site was acquired and the school opened with four buildings in 1954. In 1955 a further acre of land was acquired and another two buildings were built and occupied by October of that year although the school was not officially opened until 11 August 1956. Two more buildings were added to the school in 1960. After reaching an enrolment peak of approximately 450 in the mid 1970s enrolment has reduced during successive years to the current figure of 252.

At club level she has previously represented Kolbotn, FC Gold Pride, V√•lerenga Fotball Damer and Stab√¶k. With the Norwegian national team Gulbrandsen accrued 183 caps, scored 55 goals and won the 2000 Summer Olympics. Club career Hailing from the Oppeg√•rd area to the South-East of Oslo, Gulbrandsen started her career for Kolbotn. Her team became the Norwegian Cup holders after winning the Cup Final in November 2007. In December 2008 Gulbrandsen announced her transfer to Stab√¶k Fotball Kvinner, formed from the bankrupt Asker FK and other players. On 10 December 2009 FC Gold Pride in Santa Clara, California, playing in the WPS league, announced that Gulbrandsen had signed a contract to play and to take part in coaching and education, starting in March 2010. However, on 7 July 2010, FC Gold Pride announced that Gulbrandsen would be returning to Norway and Stab√¶k FK, effective after the club's 17 July match against Philadelphia. Gulbrandsen cited a desire to begin a transition to a post- soccer career in Norway for her decision.FC Gold Pride and Gulbrandsen Agree to Mutually Terminate Contract After a successful autumn season with Stab√¶k in 2010 she announced her retirement as a football player and joined the Oslo club V√•lerenga as an assistant trainer. She also announced that she was expecting her second child. A highlight video of Gulbrandsen's last league match, in which she assisted two goals and Stab√¶k won the Toppserien league title, can be seen on line from the Norwegian channel TV 2. She retired from her club side Stab√¶k Fotball Kvinner after the 2010 season. In the latter half of the 2011 season Gulbrandsen played some matches as a substitute for the first-division club V√•lerenga, and was later hired as the team's assistant player coach. During 2012 and 2013 she played regularly for V√•lerenga, who had been promoted into the Toppserien. After another brief period of retirement, 33-year-old Gulbrandsen rejoined Stab√¶k as a player in September 2014. She had been working as a television pundit for TV 2 but agreed to help out her former team who had an injury crisis. International career In 1998 Gulbrandsen made her debut for the Norwegian National Team and made regular appearances until the end of 2010. She won a gold medal with the Norwegian national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. In 2005 Norway reached the Final of the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship by beating Sweden 3‚Äì2, with Gulbrandsen scoring two goals and earning a yellow card for hoisting her shirt over her head after scoring the first goal. Gulbrandsen took part in the FIFA Women's World Cup 2007 tournament in China, her third such tournament, when Norway achieved fourth place behind Germany, Brazil and the USA. On 9 June 2008 she was named to the Norwegian roster for the 2008 Summer Olympics that was held in Beijing, China.Dr√∏mmen gikk i oppfyllelse Norway advanced to the quarter-finals where they lost to Brazil. Gulbrandsen was hit in a wrist early in the match but continued playing and discovered only afterwards that a bone had been broken. Gulbrandsen was selected for Norway's team in the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 played in Finland. The team survived the group stage to beat Sweden 3‚Äì1 in the quarter-final, losing to Germany 3‚Äì1 in the semifinal. At the end of the tournament she announced it would be her last championship but she would continue playing to the end of the season at least. In October 2009 she announced that she had decided with her family to continue playing for another season. Veteran national coach Even Pellerud selected Gulbrandsen in Norway's squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2013 in Sweden. In the final at Friends Arena, she had a second half penalty kick saved by Germany's goalkeeper Nadine Angerer. Anja Mittag's goal gave the Germans their sixth successive title. Personal life Gulbrandsen is the daughter of former Norway international footballer Terje Gulbrandsen and Inger Elise Johansen, a former Norwegian champion in Rhythmic Gymnastics. She is married to Espen Andreassen, a former football trainer in Kolbotn women's football club. On 8 June 2006 Solveig Gulbrandsen gave birth to her first child, a son named Theodor. Her second child was born on 19 June 2011, a daughter named Lilly. She is unrelated to the other footballer Ragnhild Gulbrandsen.

RT's first release in 1996 was written by Jesse Vincent, who later formed Best Practical Solutions LLC to distribute, develop, and support the package. RT is open source (FOSS) and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Request Tracker for Incident Response (RTIR) is a special distribution of RT to fulfill the specific needs of CERT teams. It was initially developed in cooperation with JANET-CERT, and in 2006 was upgraded and expanded with joint funding from nine Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in Europe. Technology RT is written in Perl and runs on the Apache and lighttpd web servers using mod_perl or FastCGI with data stored in either MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQLite. It is possible to extend the RT interface using plug-ins written in Perl. History Jesse Vincent, while enrolled at Wesleyan University in 1994, worked for Wesleyan's computing help desk and was responsible for improving the help desk and residential networking software infrastructure. This task included setting up a ticketing system for the help desk. Initially he set up a Linux server to run \\"req\\", but later he identified that the command line interface was limiting usage. Over the next two years he created and maintained WebReq, a web based interface for req written in Perl. Eventually the req portions were removed and what was left became RT version 1.0. A complete rewrite occurred for RT version 2.0 when Jesse started to work on RT full-time in 2001 and founded Best Practical Solutions. Interface An individual RT ticket in the version 3.8 web interface RT has many interfaces for creating and updating tickets. A web interface is available for both logged in users and guest users. It is easily tailored by granting or denying specific permissions to users as well as by adding custom fields and data to tickets. Template callbacks allow the modification of the software's web pages without requiring extensive knowledge. Email is another primary interface to RT and is often the only interface many guest users see. The email system includes support for auto- responses, attachments, and full customization of the rules which govern to whom and when email is sent. Emails are stored in RT as correspondence on a ticket, and the software can make a distinction between public replies and private comments to show them as appropriate. A basic REST-like API and a command-line tool are also provided as another way to interact with RT. Integration * RT integrates with Best Practical's knowledge base application, the RT FAQ Manager (\\"RTFM\\"). As of RT 4.0.0, RTFM's functionality was integrated into RT itself as Articles. * RT also integrates with Best Practical's IT asset management application, \\"Assets.\\" As of RT 4.4.0, this functionality was integrated into RT itself. * RT supports the Networked Help Desk API.

The Navy had been using B-24s with only minor modifications as the PB4Y-1 Liberator, and along with maritime patrol Liberators used by RAF Coastal Command this type of patrol plane was proven successful. A fully navalized design was desired, and Consolidated developed a dedicated long- range patrol bomber in 1943, designated PB4Y-2 Privateer.Baugher, Joe. \\"Convair PB4Y-2 Privateer.\\" American Military Aircraft, 23 August 1999. Retrieved: 13 November 2010. In 1951, the type was redesignated P4Y-2 Privateer. A further designation change occurred in September 1962, when the remaining Navy Privateers (all having previously been converted to drone configuration as P4Y-2K) were redesignated QP-4B. Design and development A PB4Y-2B carrying ASM-N-2 Bat glide bombs. The Privateer was externally similar to the Liberator, but the fuselage was longer to accommodate a flight engineer's station, and it had a tall single vertical stabilizer rather than the B-24's twin tail configuration. The Navy wanted a flight engineer crewmember to reduce pilot fatigue on long duration over water patrols. The single vertical tail was adopted from the USAAF's canceled B-24N design (and was slightly taller on the Privateer) because it would increase stability at low to medium altitudes for maritime patrol. The Ford Motor Company, which produced B-24s for the United States Army Air Forces, had earlier built an experimental variant (B-24K) using a single tail.Baugher, Joe. \\"Consolidated B-24N Liberator.\\" American Military Aircraft. Retrieved: 13 November 2010. Aircraft handling was improved. The single tail design was used on the B-32 Dominator and PB4Y-2 and was slated for the Air Corps' proposed B-24N production model to be built by Ford, but that order (for several thousand bombers) was canceled on 31 May 1945. Defensive armament on the PB4Y-2 was increased to twelve .50-in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns in six power operated turrets (two dorsal, two waist, nose and tail); the B-24's ventral, retractable Sperry ball turret was omitted. Turbosuperchargers were not fitted to the Privateer's engines since maritime patrol missions were not usually flown at high altitude, improving performance and also saving weight. The navigator's astrodome was moved from its (B-24/PB4Y-1) position on the aircraft's upper nose to behind the first dorsal gun turret. Electronic countermeasure (ECM), communication and radar antennas also protruded or were enclosed in fairings at various locations on the fuselage of the Privateer, including a manually retractable AN/APS-2 radome behind the nose wheel well. The Navy eventually took delivery of 739 Privateers, the majority after the end of the war. Several PB4Y-2 squadrons saw operational service in the Pacific theater through August 1945 in the reconnaissance, search and rescue, electronic countermeasures, communication relay, and anti-shipping roles (the latter with the \\"Bat\\" radar-guided bomb). Operational history The Privateer entered U.S. Navy service during late 1944, Patrol Bomber Squadrons 118 and 119 (VPB-118 and VPB-119) being the first Fleet squadrons to equip with the aircraft. The first overseas deployment began on 6 January 1945, when VPB-118 left for operations in the Marianas. On 2 March 1945 VPB-119 began \\"offensive search\\" missions out of Clark Field, Luzon in the Philippines, flying sectored searches of the seas and coastlines extending from the Gulf of Tonkin in the south, along the Chinese coast, and beyond Okinawa in the north. Privateers were used as typhoon/hurricane hunters from 1945 to the mid-1950s. One aircraft, designated BuNo 59415 of VPB-119, went down when it experienced mechanical trouble while investigating a Category 1 typhoon near Batan Island in the Philippines. It attempted to land on the island, but was unable to do so and crashed. It was one of only six hurricane hunter flights that were ever lost, and the only one found.Tannehill, Ivan Ray. The Hurricane Hunters. New York: Dodd Mead, 1955. . Another P4Y-2S, designated BuNo 59716 of Squadron VW-3 (formerly VJ-1), was lost during reconnaissance of Super Typhoon Doris on 16 December 1953. Flying out of NAS Agana, Guam, the Privateer with a crew of nine was tracking Typhoon Doris with sustained winds of 90-95 knots near the small island of Agrihan north of Guam. No sign of the crew nor wreckage of the plane was ever found. U.S. Coast Guard PB4Y-2G. PB4Y-2s were also used during the Korean War to fly \\"Firefly\\" night illumination missions dropping parachute flares to detect North Korean and Chinese seaborne infiltrators. In addition, Privateers were used by the U.S. Navy for signals intelligence (SIGINT) flights off of the coast of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. On 8 April 1950, Soviet La-11 fighters shot down a U.S. Navy PB4Y-2 Privateer (BuNo 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of LiepƒÅja, Latvia. Named the Turbulent Turtle, the aircraft was assigned to Patrol Squadron 26 (VP-26), Det A.\\"Intrusions, Overflights, Shootdowns and Defections During the Cold War and Thereafter.\\" ncnetwork.net. Retrieved: 25 July 2011. The French A√©ronavale was supplied with Privateers via the Mutual Defense Assistance Act, which they used as bombers during the Indochina War and later operated out of Bizerte, Tunisia and Algiers. All U.S. Navy PB4Y-2s were retired by 1954, though unarmed PB4Y-2G Privateers served until 1958 with the Coast Guard before being auctioned off for salvage. The Navy dropped the patrol-bomber designation in 1951 and its remaining PB4Y-2s were redesignated P4Y-2 Privateer. (The earlier XP4Y-1 Corregidor was a completely different design, based on the Consolidated Model 31 twin-engine flying boat.) PB4Y-2s were still being used as drones in the 1950s/early 1960s, designated PB4Y-2K, and P4Y-2K after 1951. They were then redesignated QP-4B under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, becoming part of the new patrol number series between the Lockheed P-3 Orion and the Martin P-5 Marlin.Gordon Swanborough, Peter M. Bowers: United States Navy aircraft since 1911. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland (USA) 1990, p. 106. A number of PB4Ys were supplied to the Republic of China Air Force for use in missions over the People's Republic of China. One was shot down by ground fire on 12 September 1954, near Xiamen, People's Republic of China. The crew of nine were killed. Another was shot down on 15 February 1961 by Burmese Hawker Sea Fury fighter aircraft, near the Thai-Burmese border, killing five members of the crew. Two other crew members were taken prisoner.

Hobby Airport to State Highway 146, northwest of Galveston. For most of its length, SH 3 parallels I-45 and runs alongside the former Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad lines. Route description SH 3 begins in Galveston County, south of La Marque near the Texas City Industrial Complex at a junction with SH 146. The highway heads to the northwest through La Marque intersecting FM 519 and FM 1765 before an interchange with FM 1764 (Emmett F. Lowry Expressway). The highway roughly parallels to the east of I-45 as it heads towards Dickinson. In Dickinson, the highway intersects FM 517 and FM 646 (future SH 99) before entering the League City city limits. In League City, SH 3 has junctions with SH 96 and FM 518, and head northwest into Harris County. The first junction in Harris County is with NASA Road 1, which provides access to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The highway continues to the northwest to an intersection with FM 2351 and passes along the western boundary of Ellington Field. Heading northwest, the highway enters Houston city limits and has a junction with Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway). The highway continues to the northwest through South Houston until it reaches an intersection with Winkler Drive. The highway turns to the west and follows Winkler Drive to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-45. History left SH 3 was one of the original twenty five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Southern National Highway. From 1917, the routing followed present day U.S. Highway 90, from Orange to Houston, U.S. Highway 90 Alternate to Eagle Lake, FM 102 to Columbus, U.S. Highway 90 to Waelder, SH 97 to Gonzales, U.S. Highway 90 Alternate to Seguin, and U.S. Highway 90 through San Antonio to Del Rio. On August 15, 1917, a more direct route along current US 90 between Waelder and Seguin was proposed. On November 21, 1917, the route was decided to go through Gonzales. On February 20, 1918, an alternate route from Seguin through Harwood to Waelder was added. The road at this time also had numerous alternate routes simultaneously marked as SH 3, along with occasionally signed SH 3A routes (although most of those routes were given their own numbers by the 1930s). On August 21, 1923, its route was extended through Sanderson to Alpine, it then headed northwest to Fort Davis, north to Balmorhea, and then west to a final terminus at San Martine, replacing parts of SH 12, SH 17A, and SH 27. In 1926, US 90 was routed over SH 3 to Alpine. On May 1, 1931, SH 3 was rerouted from Alpine to end in Van Horn, replacing part of SH 54, with the old route to San Martine transferred to SH 118, SH 17 and SH 27. SH 3 Spur was created on November 18, 1938 from SH 3 to the Uvalde Fish Hatchery. On May 23, 1939, SH 3 Spur was designated to Langtry. While the routes were marked concurrently, on September 26, 1939, SH 3 was truncated to a small route running from Seguin, Gonzales to Waelder. The two routes designated SH 3 Spur became Spur 1 (Uvalde) and Spur 25 (Langtry). On March 28, 1952, the original route ceased to exist. The present day routing was assigned on August 20, 1952. SH 3 is sometimes referred to as Old Galveston Road, indicating its function as a thoroughfare between Houston and Galveston. Spur routes Numerous spur routes were created along the main routing of SH 3, especially during the 1920s: left State Highway 3-A was a state highway proposed on July 9, 1917, splitting from the main route at Houston and roughly parallelling it to the north through La Grange and ending at San Marcos. On October 8, 1917, the routing had changed slightly, now veering further north from La Grange to Bastrop. On December 17, 1918, SH 20 had been rerouted away from Bastrop, so SH 3A extended west to Austin, replacing a portion of SH 20. On August 21, 1923, this routing had been renumbered as SH 71 west of La Grange and SH 73 (now I-10) east of La Grange. SH 3A was reassigned to an alternate routing of SH 3 that was under construction between San Antonio and Waelder. By 1938, the route was limited to the section between Seguin and Waelder, and on September 26, 1939 was transferred to US 90. left State Highway 3-B was a spur route created on March 19, 1918. The route crossed the main route of SH 3 at Schulenberg. The route travelled south from Schulenberg through Hallettsville to Cuero. On March 17, 1919, SH 3-B extended north through La Grange to Caldwell. On March 18, 1919, a split travelling both southwest to Kenedy and south to Goliad was added. On August 21, 1923, the route was renumbered as SH 72, which was shortened to end in Cuero with the branches south of Cuero cancelled. (parts later US 77). left State Highway 3-C was designated on March 17, 1919 as a proposed spur off of SH 3A, splitting at Fayetteville and traveling northeast through Bellville and Hempstead to Houston. On August 21, 1923, it was cancelled. On July 28, 1924, it was restored, but as SH 73A, on meeting the conditions. On July 27, 1925, it was taken over. (SH 73A became SH 159 on March 19, 1930). left State Highway 3-D was designated on September 18, 1922 as a spur that connected the main route and SH 3A between La Grange and Columbus. On August 21, 1923, the route was still under construction, but had been renumbered as SH 71. left State Highway 3-E was another spur from Uvalde to La Pryor designated on July 16, 1923. On August 21, 1923, it was renumbered as part of SH 55.

He has unsuccessfully run for Congress in Iowa's 1st Congressional District three times, first against Congressman Jim Leach in 1982 (Leach 59.2% - Gluba 40.8%) and again in 1988 (Leach 60.7% - Gluba 38.4%). In 2004 he was nominated to run against incumbent Congressman Jim Nussle and was defeated (Nussle 55% - Gluba 44%). In 2006, Nussle decided to not seek another term in Congress, but instead run for the office of Iowa governor as Tom Vilsack was not seeking another term for that office. Gluba, Rick Dickinson of Dubuque, and Bruce Braley had declared themselves candidates to be the representative for the Democratic leaning district that includes Dubuque, Davenport, and Waterloo as its largest cities. Braley later won the primary, and subsequently won the seat in the November 2006 general election. On August 31, 2007, Gluba officially filed as a candidate for mayor of his hometown of Davenport, Iowa. He faced former mayor Phil Yerington and at-large Alderwoman Jamie Howard in the primary. On primary day, October 9, Gluba won, receiving 4,784 votes, or 45.33%. Gluba faced Yerington, who placed second with 3,495 votes, or 33.12%, in a runoff held on November 6, 2007. Gluba defeated Yerington, with 10,544 votes or 62% percent. In 2009 and 2011 Gluba ran for a second and third term as mayor unopposed. In 2013, he won election to a fourth term with 65% of the vote. Gluba has also worked as a real estate broker with RE/MAX River Cities. Inc., Bettendorf, Iowa.

Nicknamed \\"Hairy Star\\", he ranks 62nd among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 26th among the 72 Earthly Fiends.  Background[edit]  Kong Ming owns a manor at Mount White Tiger () located in Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong) with his father Squire Kong and younger brother Kong Liang. He is nicknamed \\"Hairy Star\\", which suggests he could inflict terror like a comet, which in Chinese mythology is believed to bring bad luck if spotted shooting through the sky. When Song Jiang goes on the run after killing his mistress Yan Poxi in a fit of anger, he first takes refuge in the house of the nobleman Chai Jin. Then he is invited to the Kong Family Manor by Squire Kong, where he is asked to be instructor of the Kong brothers in martial arts. Meanwhile, Wu Song has killed Inspector Zhang Mengfang, Instructor Zhang and Jiang the Door God in Mengzhou, who conspired to murder him, as well as the family members of Inspector Zhang. He meets the couple Zhang Qing and Sun Erniang, who advise him to seek refuge with the bandits at Mount Twin Dragons. He is dressed as an itinerant priest with his hair let down so as to cover the tattoo mark of exile on his face as he travels to the stronghold. Passing by Mount White Tiger, Wu Song eats in an inn which has only some simple food to offer. Kong Liang comes in with a group of men and, to the chagrin of Wu, is served with tasty dishes and drinks. Unwilling to take the inn keeper's explanation that Kong's food came from his own house and he merely cooked for him, Wu beats him up. Kong Liang intervenes and is thrashed by Wu. Kong flees and comes back searching for Wu with his brother Kong Ming and more men. Finding Wu lying drunk in a creek, they seize him and take him back to their manor, where he is tied to a tree and flogged. Coming to check on the din, Song Jiang is surprised to find the fellow to be Wu Song, whom he has befriended in Chai Jin's house. He asks that Wu be released. Delighted to meet the famous tiger slayer, the Kongs make peace with Wu.  Becoming an outlaw[edit]  After their father died, the Kong brothers get into a dispute with a wealthy landlord and kill him. They then set up a bandit stronghold on the top of Mount White Tiger. But their uncle living in nearby Qingzhou is arrested due to their connection by order of the governor Murong Yanda. In their attack on Qingzhou to rescue their uncle, the Kongs face Huyan Zhuo, an imperial general who has fled to Murong after his defeat by the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh in the hopes of redeeming himself by wiping out the local bandits. He easily captures Kong Ming in a one-on-one fight. Kong Liang seeks help from the bandits of Mount Twin Dragons and Mount Plum Blossom. The bandits conclude that Huyan is a formidable warrior and send Kong to Liangshan to seek help. At Qingzhou Song Jiang, who comes with a military force, captures and wins over Huyan. They then rescue Kong Ming and his uncle. The Kong brothers are absorbed into Liangshan.  Campaigns and death[edit]  The Kong brothers are appointed as chief guardians of Liangshan's central camp after the 108 Stars came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. They are in effect the bodyguards of Lu Junyi, just like L√º Fang and Guo Sheng are to Song Jiang. Kong Ming participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.

It is used in robotics by some legged or wheeled robots to estimate their position relative to a starting location. This method is sensitive to errors due to the integration of velocity measurements over time to give position estimates. Rapid and accurate data collection, instrument calibration, and processing are required in most cases for odometry to be used effectively. The word odometry is composed from the Greek words odos (meaning \\"route\\") and metron (meaning \\"measure\\"). Example Suppose a robot has rotary encoders on its wheels or on its legged joints. It drives forward for some time and then would like to know how far it has traveled. It can measure how far the wheels have rotated, and if it knows the circumference of its wheels, compute the distance. Train operations are also frequent users of odometrics. Typically, a train gets an absolute position by passing over stationary sensors in the tracks, while odometry is used to calculate relative position while the train is between the sensors. More sophisticated example Suppose that a simple robot has two wheels which can both move forward or reverse and that they are positioned parallel to one another, and equidistant from the center of the robot. Further, assume that each motor has a rotary encoder, and so one can determine if either wheel has travelled one \\"unit\\" forward or reverse along the floor. This unit is the ratio of the circumference of the wheel to the resolution of the encoder. If the left wheel were to move forward one unit while the right wheel remained stationary, then the right wheel acts as a pivot, and the left wheel traces a circular arc in the clockwise direction. Since one's unit of distance is usually quite small, one can approximate by assuming that this arc is a line. Thus, the original position of the left wheel, the final position of the left wheel, and the position of the right wheel form a triangle, which one can call A. Also, the original position of the center, the final position of the center, and the position of the right wheel form a triangle which one can call B. Since the center of the robot is equidistant to either wheel, and as they share the angle formed at the right wheel, triangles A and B are similar triangles. In this situation, the magnitude of the change of position of the center of the robot is one half of a unit. The angle of this change can be determined using the law of sines.

Bao, a skilled fighter who uses a broad-bladed sword, is nicknamed \\"God of Death\\" as he likes to kill and plunder. He leads a bandit gang on Mount Deadwood () in Kouzhou (ÂØáÂ∑û; believed to be present-day Guan County, Shandong). Joining Liangshan The imperial military officers Shan Tinggui and Wei Dingguo capture Liangshan's Xuan Zan and Hao Siwen at Lingzhou (ÂáåÂ∑û; present-day Ling County, Shandong), who have come with Guan Sheng to head them off before they set out on the mission to exterminate their stronghold by order of the Song court.

To preserve himself from utter destruction the khan threw himself into the arms of the Afghans. The tract in which Andkhoy stands is fertile, but proverbially unhealthy; the Persians accounted it \\"a hell upon earth\\" by reason of its scorching sands, brackish water, flies and scorpions. Renovation of Andkhoy started in 1959, mainly at the eastern parts of the old town. The original plan of the infrastructure was reconditioned and reduced to half its volume of the developments to take place. The property owners refused to sell their land for further developments and the plan consequently failed. The infrastructure remained poor; for example, in 1973 only 13% of the houses had access to electricity and only at night. Lack of sanitary drinking water remained a major problem.

McClelland Barclay (1891 ‚Äì 18 July 1943) was an American illustrator. By the age of 21, Barclay's work had been published in The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, and Cosmopolitan. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve in 1938 and following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor he went on active duty. At the time of his death, in 1943, he was a Lt. Commander. Early life and education Born in St. Louis in 1891, Barclay's mother died when he was 17. He was sent to Washington, DC, to live with his aunt and uncle, Edward and Lucy McClelland, after whom he had been named. He studied first at the Art Institute of Chicago, and later at the Art Students League in New York City, where he studied figure drawing with George Bridgman and illustration with Thomas Fogarty. Barclay also attended The St. Louis Museum of Fine Arts (now known as the School of Art, Washington University); there he studied under the school's founder, Halsey Ives. He was also a student in the Corcoran School of Art in Washington DC. Artwork During World War I, Barclay was awarded a prize by the Committee on National Preparedness in 1917 for his poster \\"Fill the Breach.\\" The next year, he designed naval camouflage under the direction of William Mackay, Chief of the New York District Emergency Fleet Corporation. McClelland Barclay painting a portrait of Husband E. Kimmel During the 1920s and 1930s, Barclay's images were selected for use by art directors for the nation's most popular periodicals including Collier's, Country Gentleman, Redbook, Pictorial Review, Coronet, Country Life, The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan, and a host of movie magazines. During the 1930s, he began painting movie poster art for Hollywood studios, including Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox. Barclay was considered a superstar in the film industry during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Barclay was one of the first artists to paint World War II pin-up girl, Betty Grable. In 1930, the General Motors Corporation selected Barclay's \\"Fisher Body Girl\\" for a series of advertisements, and she quickly became as popular as \\"The Gibson Girl\\" and \\"The Christy Girl\\". He used his second wife Helene, 19 years old, as the model for the iconic Fisher Autobody image. Helene later appeared in magazine advertisements and was so well published with her languid body plastered across the country on billboards, that she was recognized wherever she went. He also illustrated advertisements for A&P;, Eaton Paper Company, Elgin Watches, Humming Bird Hosiery, and Lever Brothers, amongst others. He also illustrated advertisements for Whitman's Chocolates, Texaco, and Camel and Chesterfield brand cigarettes. Because Barclay was known for his illustrations of \\"striking women\\", he earned a judging position at the Miss America 1935 pageant. His posters and camouflage designs earned him Naval commission. Barclay was a member of the Art Students League, the Chicago Art Club, the Society of Illustrators, the Association of Arts and Industries, and the Artists Guild. The Nightclub Singer Barclay did not limit himself to painting. In the late 1930s, he set up a small company to reproduce jewelry and fabricate utilitarian figures for ashtrays, bookends, desk sets, lamps, and other articles for home and office use. These products were fabricated out of cast grey metal with a thick bronze plate finish and they retailed for just a few dollars. The company, which he named the McClelland Barclay Arts Products Corporation, made him little money. In 1944, a year after his death, Barclay was awarded the Art Directors Club Medal, \\"in recognition of his long and distinguished record in editorial illustration and advertising art and in honor of his devotion and meritorious service to his country as a commissioned officer of the United States Navy.\\" He was also posthumously inducted in the Society of Illustrators' Hall of Fame.

In mid-1940, Barclay prepared experimental dazzle camouflage designs for Navy combat aircraft, but evaluation tests revealed that pattern camouflage was of little use for aircraft. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Barclay completed the first of many recruiting posters for the Navy. Navy Relief show poster by Barclay (1943). On October 19, 1940, Barclay reported for active duty. He served in the New York Recruiting office, illustrating posters for the next two and a half years. These images would become some of the most recognizable recruiting images of World War II. Barclay was determined to be a front-line combat artist. In March 1943, he told the San Francisco Examiner, \\"A camera cannot catch the human element of a fight, the sweat and blood and courage our boys expend every time they face the enemy.\\" In 1941 he volunteered for this position, but was rejected. Eventually he would serve in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters on the , , , and the . Promoted to Lt. Commander, Barclay worked on further assignments until July 18, 1943, when he was reported as missing in action. The USS LST-342 he was aboard was torpedoed in the Solomon Islands. On board, sketching and taking photographs at the time, Barclay's body was not recovered. Barclay was awarded the Purple Heart Medal posthumously.

Outside of Brownsville, it parallels the Rio Grande. It is the southernmost Texas state highway. History 100px SH 4 was one of the original twenty-five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Del Rio ‚Äì Canadian Highway. From 1917 the routing mostly followed present-day U.S. Highway 83 from Perryton, Childress, to Aspermont. From there, it followed present-day FM 610 and SH 70 to Blackwell. It then continued down present-day U.S. Highway 277 into San Angelo and Sonora and Del Rio. On February 7, 1919, SH 4 was rerouted to end at Uvalde, and the old route from Sonora to Del Rio was cancelled. On April 22, 1919, the branch to Del Rio was restored. The road at this time also had numerous alternate routes simultaneously marked as SH 4, along with occasionally signed SH 4A routes (although most of those routes were given their own numbers by the 1930s). On August 21, 1923, the eastern branch from Sonora to Uvalde was renumbered as part of State Highway 55. The section of SH 4 from Childress to Aspermont was cancelled, The section from Aspermont to San Angelo was renumbered as SH 70, and the section south of San Angelo became part of SH 30. On September 9, 1927, SH 4 was extended through Aspermont to Hamlin, was concurrent with SH 92 from Hamlin to Stamford, SH 30 from Stamford to Abilene, and SH 7 from Abilene to Santa Anna, and took over SH 107 from Santa Anna to Brady. On December 6, 1927, SH 4 was rerouted on new construction from Hamlin to Anson, eliminating the concurrency with SH 92 and part of the concurrency with SH 30. On August 6, 1929 (not official until September 1, 1929), U.S. Highway 83 was extended into Texas, and SH 4 was rerouted to match US 83, following SH 30 to Ballinger, Texas, replacing SH 23 to Junction, new construction to Uvalde, replacing SH 55 to Catarina, new construction (cancelling the portion of SH 55 from Catarina to Artesia Wells; this would be restored as SH 189 on November 30, 1932) to Laredo, replacing SH 12B to Pharr, and replaced part of the now severely reworked SH 12 to Brownsville. The old route from Brady to Santa Anna was changed back to SH 107. On November 30, 1932, SH 4 was rerouted through Hidalgo. On January 19, 1935, this route was swapped with SH 48. On February 11, 1935, SH 4 was extended to Boca Chica. On September 26, 1939, the route was turned over to U.S. Route 83, with the only remaining portion of SH 4 being the current routing from Brownsville eastward, now known as the Boca Chica Highway. On May 29, 1997, SH 4 was extended southwest over the old route of US 77 and US 83 to the Gateway International Bridge.  Route description  SH 4 begins at the Gateway International Bridge in downtown Brownsville, travelling northeast on International Blvd. A mile later, it reaches I-69E/US 77/83. This first section was previously the final stretch of US 77 and 83 before they were rerouted to the southeast around downtown to the Veteran's International Bridge. SH 4 continues northeast, passing the intersection with Farm to Market Road 1418, until it reaches an intersection with SH 48 at Boca Chica Blvd. SH 4 turns east onto Boca Chica Blvd. About a mile to the east is the cutoff for Farm to Market Road 2519, which leads to the Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport. SH 4 continues east, passing along the north side of the airport grounds and meeting intersections with Farm to Market Roads 313 and 511. SH 4 exits Brownsville continuing east near the southern side of the Port of Brownsville. This section passes a few historical landmarks, including the site of the Battle of Palmito Ranch, site of the final battle of the American Civil War. The highway continues east-northeast, past Boca Chica Village and SpaceX South Texas Launch Site, until it reaches a stop sign at Boca Chica Beach and Brazos Island State Park.

Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, it is \\"the authority, privilege, or permission, to perform an act or function. In a broad sense, a faculty is a certain power, whether based on one's own right, or received as a favour from another, of validly or lawfully doing some action.\\" The most common use of the term is in the context of 'priestly faculties', which is the permission given to a priest by his diocesan bishop or religious superior, legally permitting him to perform the Sacraments. Normally, a priest's faculties only permit him to celebrate within his own diocese or religious institute. Eastern Orthodox Church In the Eastern Orthodox Church a bishop formally grants priestly faculties by giving a priest chrism and an antimension. He may withdraw faculties by demanding the return of these items. Church of England In the Church of England (whose canons have the status of national law) the \\"faculty jurisdiction\\" is set out in the Care of Churches and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1991, and the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015. A faculty is the required permission to carry out works on the church and its curtilage; in most cases this is required instead of planning permission, although both are required for major external work. The parish has to prepare a petition for the faculty and the chancellor of the diocese may grant the faculty after due consideration. Where the work is listed on Schedule 1 List A, no faculty is required and where it is on List B the faculty may be granted by the archdeacon rather than the chancellor.

He was born at K√∏sahaugen in Sigdal in Buskerud, Norway. Erik left Norway in 1879. His brother Peder followed him to America in 1880, and his mother Anne and sister Berte followed in 1885. The brothers were early settlers in the Souris River Valley of North Dakota, arriving in May 1883. They staked a claim to property on both the north and south sides of the Souris River. With the coming of the Great Northern Railway during the summer of 1886, Erik Ramstad agreed to relinquish of land on the south side of the Souris River, retaining sites north of the river. The Great Northern roundhouse and the Minot business district were both built on this southern acreage.Haugland, Brynhild A History of Ward County (Minot State University, Minot, N.D. 1927) Both Erik and Peter Ramstad remained active in the development of Minot. In 1886, the first Lutheran church service within Minot was held at the Peter Ramstad home. First Lutheran Church in Minot was built in the early 1900s on land originally belonging to Erik Ramstad. Erik Ramstad was also involved in local politics for many years, served as president of the Scandinavian American Bank, and was co-owner of the Great Northern Lumber Company.The Sigdalslag 1914-1920 (Sigdalslag in America. 1997. pages 141-143) Erik Ramstad later donated part of his remaining property, which became the site of Minot State University.

Kahibah is the closest suburb to Glenrock Lagoon, and is drained by Flaggy and Little Flaggy creeks which flow into Glenrock Lagoon 2 km to the east. The suburb's name is from the Aboriginal name word \\"Ky-yee-bah\\", which meant either a place for games or to be active and eager. The local Aboriginal people, the Awabakal people, had camps in the area of Glenrock Lagoon, and named the area \\"Pillapay-Kullaitaran\\", meaning \\"Valley of the palms\\". In a letter dated 12 October 1842, to W. Kirchner of Sydney, Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt describes a walk through the valley on his way from Newcastle to Redhead via Charlestown. On this walk he described the view of the lagoon from a high vantage point. That vantage point is today known as \\"Leichhardt Lookout\\", which is on the Great North Walk.The Letters of F. W. Ludwig Leichhardt, Volume II ed. M. Aurousseau, The Hakluyt Society 1968, p. 532 The township of Kahibah was gazetted on 27 February 1894. This township is not to be confused with a proposed village \\"Kahibah\\" approved by the Surveyor-General Office in 1865 which was to be located on the northern side of the entrance of Lake Macquarie where the suburbs of Pelican and Blacksmiths now exist. In 1880 a coal rail line was built to Redhead with the line being extended to Belmont in 1916. A station was built at Kahibah. On 8 April 1971 at 1710 the last rail passenger train to Belmont via Kahibah left Newcastle Station with the rail line closing to all coal traffic on 21 December 1992. Since then the line has been redeveloped to a cycleway called \\"The Fernleigh Track\\". The first section from Adamstown to Kahibah was opened on 2 February 2003. The second stage, Kahibah to Whitebridge was opened on 7 May 2005. On 21 October 1922 the Memorial Hall was opened in Hexham Street. It has also been known as the \\"Soldiers' Memorial Hall\\". Within the hall were two honour rolls of men and women that went to World War I and World War 2. These honour rolls now reside in the Kahibah Public School Memorial Hall. Over the life of the hall it served as a school, picture theatre, library, play group (last meeting December 1995). The hall was demolished in 1996 to make way for home units. In 1938 a school was established, in the Memorial Hall but it was not until 20 October 1954 that Kahibah Public School was moved to its current location. The Great North Walk passes Kahibah on its way from Newcastle to Sydney. Each section of the track is named. The first 25 km of the walk from Newcastle to Teralba, Lake Macquarie is known as the Yuelarbah Track.  History  The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land.

Obsolete by the end of the war, Coronados were quickly taken out of service. Only one known example remains, at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Design and development After deliveries of the PBY Catalina, also a Consolidated aircraft, began in 1935, the United States Navy began planning for the next generation of patrol bombers. Orders for two prototypes, the XPB2Y-1 and the Sikorsky XPBS-1, were placed in 1936; the prototype Coronado first flew in December 1937. After trials with the XPB2Y-1 prototype revealed some stability issues, the design was finalized as the PB2Y-2, with a large cantilever wing, twin tail with very marked dihedral, and four Pratt & Whitney R-1830 radial engines. The two inner engines were fitted with four-bladed reversible pitch propellers; the outer engines had standard three-bladed feathering props. Like the PBY Catalina before it, the PB2Y's wingtip floats retracted to reduce drag and increase range, with the floats' buoyant hulls acting as the wingtips when retracted. The price of the PB2Y-2 was US$300,000, or approximately three times that of the PBY Catalina.Burney 2015, pp. 82‚Äì87. Development continued throughout the war. The PB2Y-3, featuring self-sealing fuel tanks and additional armor, entered service just after the attack on Pearl Harbor and formed most of the early-war Coronado fleet. The prototype XPB2Y-4 was powered by four Wright R-2600 radials and offered improved performance, but the increases were not enough to justify a full fleet update. However, most PB2Y-3 models were converted to the PB2Y-5 standard, with the R-1830 engines replaced with single-stage R-1830-92 models. As most existing PB2Y-3s were used as transports, flying low to avoid combat, removing the excess weight of unneeded superchargers allowed an increased payload without harming low-altitude performance. Operational history RAF Darrell's Island, Bermuda. Coronados served in combat in the Pacific with the United States Navy, in both bombing and antisubmarine roles. PB2Y-5 Coronados carried out four bombing raids on Wake Island between 30 January and 9 February 1944. However, most served as transport and hospital aircraft. The British Royal Air Force Coastal Command had hoped to use the Coronado as a maritime patrol bomber, as it already used the PBY Catalina. However, the range of the Coronado (1,070 miles) compared poorly with the Catalina (2,520 mi), and the Short Sunderland (1,780 mi). Consequently, the Coronados supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease were outfitted purely as transports, serving with RAF Transport Command. The 10 aircraft were used for transatlantic flights, staging through the RAF base at Darrell's Island, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, though the aircraft were used to deliver vital cargo and equipment in a transportation network that stretched down both sides of the Atlantic, from Newfoundland, to Brazil, and to Nigeria, and other parts of Africa. After the war ended five of the RAF aircraft were scrapped, one was already lost in collision with a Martin PBM Mariner and the last four were scuttled off the coast of Bermuda in 1946. Coronados served as a major component in the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS) during World War II in the Pacific theater. Most had originally been acquired as combat patrol aircraft, but the limitations noted above quickly relegated them to transport service in the American naval air fleet also. By the end of World War II, the Coronado was outmoded as both a bomber and a transport, and virtually all of them were quickly scrapped by the summer of 1946, being melted down to aluminum ingots and sold as metal scrap, or used as targets for fighter gunnery practice.

Tamponade is a useful method of stopping a hemorrhage. This can be achieved by applying an absorbent dressing directly into a wound, thereby absorbing excess blood and creating a blockage, or by applying direct pressure with a hand or a tourniquet. There can, however, be disastrous consequences when tamponade occurs as a result of health problems, as in the case of cardiac tamponade. In this situation, fluid collects inside the pericardial sac. The pressure within the pericardium prevents the heart from expanding fully and filling the ventricles, with the result that a significantly reduced amount of blood circulates within the body. If left unchecked, this condition will result in death. Bladder tamponade is obstruction of the urinary bladder outlet due to heavy blood clot formation within it.Page 352 in: It generally requires surgery. Such heavy bleeding is usually due to bladder cancer. Pressing bone wax into bleeding bone is considered hemostasis by tamponade, as opposed to methods which physically or biochemically activate the clotting cascade.

U.S. Soccer Development Academy 2013-2014 In 1871 a St. Mary's biology instructor initially discovered a federal- and state-listed endangered species, the dwarf trout lily, on the school's campus. History The Chapel of the Good Shepherd at the center of the campus On June 3, 1858, in a small rented building in Faribault, Minnesota, the Rev. Dr. James Lloyd Breck established the Episcopal mission school and seminary from which Shattuck-St. Mary's School has developed. When it opened, there were 45 young girls and boys and six divinity students. About this time, the newly established Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota selected Henry Benjamin Whipple as its first bishop. In 1860, Whipple took over the reins of the school, changing Breck's ambitious plan for \\"Bishop Seabury University\\" into \\"an honest school.\\" In 1864, the school moved to its present site on the bluffs above the Straight River. With this change, the institution became a boarding school for young men and boys. In 1865, Tommy Crump, an English divinity student recently returned from the Civil War, started drilling the boys with sticks, beginning a military program that lasted for more than a century; during this time the campus was known as Shattuck Military Academy. In 1866, Whipple opened a school for girls, St. Mary's Hall, in his home in downtown Faribault. The girls remained there until 1872 when Whipple moved to a new house and St. Mary's Hall was turned over to a board of trustees. By 1883, St. Mary's had also outgrown its downtown facilities, and a grand, ornate building, often called \\"the Castle on the Rhine\\", was built on the bluffs, less than half a mile south of Shattuck. That building burned in 1924, and the limestone structure that stands today was built less than a year later. Both schools saw rapid growth during the next few years. James Dobbin, who succeeded Breck in 1866 and served as Rector of Shattuck School until 1914, was responsible for the construction of many beautiful limestone buildings, including the first Whipple Hall and the present Shumway Hall. In 1901, Dobbin founded St. James School for younger boys about half a mile north of Shattuck. In 1932, Seabury Theological Seminary merged with Western Theological Seminary and moved to Evanston, Illinois. In 1972, the three schools, Shattuck, St. Mary's and St. James, were joined into what is known today as Shattuck-St. Mary's. In 1974, the military program was discontinued and the St. James campus was sold. In 1988, the residential and academic programs were reconfigured so that the Middle School students (grades 6‚Äì8) were at the St. Mary's campus and high school students (the Upper School) were at the Shattuck campus. Later, grade 9 moved to the Middle School, and St. Mary's Hall became solely a girls' dorm once again. In the early 1990s, facing serious financial concerns and declining enrollment, Craig Norwich was hired, a decision that permanently changed the course of the school. Norwich created the model of \\"centers of excellence.\\" The school owned the only ice arena in Faribault and Norwich decided to use that to its advantage to create a world- class hockey program. Jean Paul (J.P.) Parise and 1980 Gold Medal USA Olympic Hockey Team strength & conditioning coach Larry Hendrickson were also instrumental in starting the SSM Elite hockey program. The model used to build the program has been replicated and flourished under former president Nick Stoneman, and is one of the main reasons for the school's success. The \\"center of excellence\\" model has been expanded to include soccer, figure skating, golf, pre-conservatory music, bioscience, engineering, and a vocal performance program. The school has grown 50% in the last 6 years, with students from 31 countries and 39 states. In mid-2009 the Saint James campus was reacquired. It is used for faculty housing, and part of it is rented out to the Cannon River STEM School for grades K‚Äì8. In September 2012 the school opened Fayfield Hall, a new science, technology, engineering, and math building and home to the BioScience and Engineering Centers of Excellence. 2012 Sex Abuse Scandal In October 2012, former Shattuck-St. Mary's drama teacher Lynn Seibel was charged with 17 counts of criminal sexual conduct in relation to sexual abuse, both in class and in the dorm where he was a dorm parent, of six male students between 1999 and 2003.https://www.twincities.com/2012/10/07/former-shattuck- st-marys-teacher-charged-with-sexually-abusing- students/https://www.startribune.com/ex-shattuck-st-mary-s-teacher-sentenced- for-abusing-students/226501031/ The abuse included group masturbation, naked dance parties, and in-class viewing of pornography, and targeted young men in the school's hockey program.https://www.twincities.com/2012/10/07/former- shattuck-st-marys-teacher-charged-with-sexually-abusing-students/ https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/19117747 SSM had dismissed Seibel in 2003 following the discovery of more than 14,000 pornographic images on his work computer,https://www.twincities.com/2012/10/07/former-shattuck-st-marys- teacher-charged-with-sexually-abusing-students/ including images of minors,https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/19117747 but ESPN's Steve Delsohn concluded, after a 7-month investigation, that the school failed to live up to its reporting obligations.https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/19117747 Per Delsohn's 2017 report for ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines,\\" although there was no legal requirement for the school to report Seibel's possession of child pornography, \\"school officials are mandated to report child sex abuse if they suspect it. By the time they found all the child pornography, there had been multiple reports of naked dance parties‚Äîa bunch of teenage boys naked with Seibel with them. There was the allegation and the report to the school that Seibel had sexually touched at least three Shattuck students. Years later, when then-headmaster Gregory Keifer was being deposed as part of the litigation, he said the red flags were flying that Seibel had a sexual interest in students. Then they find the child pornography, and a lot of it. At that point, if you suspect child sex abuse, and you are a school official, you are mandated to report it.\\"https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/19117747 An independent Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) investigation reached the same conclusion: \\"an MPR News investigation has found several teachers and top administrators did know about some of Seibel's alleged sexual behavior but failed to notify police.\\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/03/05/shattuck-st- marys-former-teachers-claim-seibels-alleged-sexual-abuse-of-students-known-not Per the criminal complaint, Seibel told police that the school was aware of his sexual behavior, and that interim headmaster Dennis Brown had told him, \\"Lynn, you're a sick man. You need to do something about it.\\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/03/05/shattuck-st-marys-former- teachers-claim-seibels-alleged-sexual-abuse-of-students-known-not The failure of both Seibel and the school to \\"do something about it\\" led to at least six civil actions against the school, three of which had been settled as of April 2017.https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/19117747 In 2013, Seibel pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 52 months in prison.https://www.startribune.com/ex-shattuck-st-mary-s-teacher-sentenced- for-abusing-students/226501031/ He was released in 2015 and as of April 2017 was living within a few miles of SSM.https://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2017/04/with-espn-documentary-shattuck- scandal-returns-to-view/ Academics The Upper School, which includes students in grades 10‚Äì12 as well as postgraduates, is located on the Shattuck campus. Opportunities include commitment to a Center of Excellence, extracurricular sports, the arts, the honors program, college counseling, and senior leadership and service projects. Upper School Located within St. Mary's Hall, less than half a mile from the Upper School, the Middle School program provides students from grades 6‚Äì9 with an identity distinct from that of the upperclassmen. Middle School curriculum includes solid preparation in the major disciplines for high school and college work. In addition, a number of team-building activities and social events, as well as family style seating for lunch, help foster a strong, supportive community. Middle School =Global education= In 2013, SSM embarked on a three-year partnership with Beijing Bayi School which culminated in the creation of a satellite campus known as SSM-Bayi in Beijing, China. The program offered classes preparing students for the Chinese Huikao examinations as well as a traditional American curriculum featuring Advanced Placement courses and preparation for SAT tests. SSM-Bayi students also had the opportunity to attend summer sessions at the main SSM campus in Faribault. The first contract between the two school lasted until July 2014. Although the partnership on this project has ended, SSM will continue to maintain a globally focused curriculum at the main campus and pursue the creation of further campuses around the world. About SSM-Bayi Subsequently, SSM has established a branch in Suzhou, China, which lasted just one year. It also planned a campus in Shenzhen, China, but that too failed even before it opened. There is currently a campus in Forest City, Johor, Malaysia. In its second school year (August, 2019), the student population is predominantly from mainland China though it has small numbers of students from other countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and Korea) along with the children of faculty (mostly Americans). =Blended Learning= In the past several years the school has made a foray into blended learning for grades 11‚Äì12, a model of education that allows teachers to combine the physical classroom with its online counterpart in order to create individualized learning experiences. The extra time not spent in the classroom allows students involved in the Blended Program to pursue other scholastic interests, including independent research projects, product development, and internships. Blended Learning Program The school has received attention for its work in developing a Blended Learning curicculum, including a grant from the E.E. Ford Foundation and presentations on the subject at the Online Education Symposium for Independent Schools. Shattuck-St. Mary's School OESIS East Coast 2014 =BioScience= The BioScience Program is an experiential academic program for students who intend to pursue a career in medicine, biomedical engineering, or scientific research.

Mathematics in electronics Electronics engineering careers usually include courses in calculus (single and multivariable), complex analysis, differential equations (both ordinary and partial), linear algebra and probability. Fourier analysis and Z-transforms are also subjects which are usually included in electrical engineering programs. Basic applications A number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks. These include *Faraday's law of induction: Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage (emf) to be \\"induced\\" in the coil. *Gauss's Law: The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity. *Kirchhoff's current law: the sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node or the sum of total current at a junction is zero *Kirchhoff's voltage law: the directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a circuit must be zero. *Ohm's law: the voltage across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current flowing through it.at constant temperature. *Norton's theorem: any two-terminal collection of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor. *Th√©venin's theorem: any two-terminal combination of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor. *Millman's theorem: the voltage on the ends of branches in parallel is equal to the sum of the currents flowing in every branch divided by the total equivalent conductance. * See also Analysis of resistive circuits. Circuit analysis is the study of methods to solve linear systems for an unknown variable. *Circuit analysis Components There are many electronic components currently used and they all have their own uses and particular rules and methods for use. *Electronic components Complex numbers If you apply a voltage across a capacitor, it 'charges up' by storing the electrical charge as an electrical field inside the device. This means that while the voltage across the capacitor remains initially small, a large current flows. Later, the current flow is smaller because the capacity is filled, and the voltage raises across the device. A similar though opposite situation occurs in an inductor; the applied voltage remains high with low current as a magnetic field is generated, and later becomes small with high current when the magnetic field is at maximum. The voltage and current of these two types of devices are therefore out of phase, they do not rise and fall together as simple resistor networks do. The mathematical model that matches this situation is that of complex numbers, using an imaginary component to describe the stored energy. Signal analysis * Fourier analysis.

SH 5 parallels US 75 along its length and runs alongside the former Houston and Texas Central rail line. SH 5 was created in 1959 when the new route of US 75 was established to the west. Historically, SH 5 extended into and through Plano and Richardson. Route history The current version of SH 5 was established on April 29, 1959 initially as a replacement for the former routing of U.S. Highway 75 from Richardson north to McKinney when US 75 was rebuilt further to the west. The route was extended north to Howe on October 27, 1967 to replace another portion of US 75 that had been upgraded on a new route just to the west. Between 1987 and 2018, the southern terminus was moved northward as portions of the highway were returned to local cities: First, ending at SH 190 on May 28, 1986, then ending at the northern Plano city limit on October 28, 1987, at the Exchange Parkway in Allen on March 27, 2003, and finally, at FM 2786 (Stacy Rd.) on January 25, 2018. Previous routes leftSH 5 was one of the original twenty-five state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the North Texas Highway. From 1917 the routing mostly followed present day U.S. Highway 87 from New Mexico to Amarillo. It continued on, routed along present day U.S. Highway 287 to Wichita Falls, and from there following present day U.S. Highway 82 to Texarkana. On September 17, 1923, SH 5 Loop through Avery was designated. In 1926, U.S. Highway 385 was routed over SH 5 from New Mexico to Amarillo, and U.S. Highway 370 to Henrietta. On February 26, 1930 SH 5 Loop through Kirkland was designated. On September 16, 1937, SH 5 Loop was designated from SH 5 to SH 30 in Wichita Falls. On February 20, 1939, SH 5 Spur was designated from SH 5 to Annona. While the routes were marked concurrently, the remainder of SH 5 kept its numbering until September 26, 1939, when SH 5 was truncated to a route running from north of Amarillo to near Hartley. SH 5 Loop and SH 5 Spur became Loop 6 (Kirkland), Loop 11 (Wichita Falls), Spur 23 (Annona), and Loop 37 (Avery). SH 5 was finally cancelled on September 14, 1944 as it was never built (temporary route replaced by SH 354), only to be reassigned in its new location on April 29, 1959. left On February 5, 1918, an intercounty highway was designated from Estelline to Farwell. On February 19, 1918, this was redesignated as a state highway and designated as SH 5A, a branch of SH 5. It was listed as such until August 21, 1923, when it was renumbered as SH 86. That same day, SH 5A was used again as a spur routing from SH 5 south and east via Annona to Avery. On July 18, 1924, the section south of Annona was cancelled. This road was erroneously omitted from the March 19, 1930 log, so was unnumbered that day. On November 30, 1932, The former SH 5A was added to the state highway log, but was renumbered as SH 180\\\\. left SH 5B was a branch designated on May 22, 1918 from SH 5 in Clarksville southeast to SH 5 in Annona. It was cancelled on August 21, 1923. left SH 5C was designated on January 20, 1919 as a branch of SH 5 from Bonham to Garland. On July 18, 1922, this was renumbered as SH 5C. On August 21, 1923, it was renumbered as SH 78. left SH 5D was designated on February 19, 1923 from the New Mexico border to the Oklahoma border. On August 21, 1923, it was renumbered as SH 56. Related routes South of Dallas, US 75 was supplanted by Interstate 45, though US 75 retained its designation until 1987.

Vargas accused Filner of being a part of the culture of corruption of Washington, pointing out that Filner had paid his wife more than $500,000 in campaign funds for consulting services performed from their condominium in Washington. Filner in return argued that Vargas had controversial payments to his brother-in-law, who was a lobbyist for realtors. Filner defeated Vargas 51%‚Äì43%, with Danny Ramirez getting 6% of the vote. Business career (2007‚Äì2009) After leaving the State Assembly in 2006 due to term limits, Vargas took a job with a home, auto and small business insurance company, where he was tasked with creating jobs and outreach in diverse San Diego Communities as part of the company's diversity initiative.

Overview  Maradhoo is located in the middle of the island chain on the Western side of Addu City. To the North are Hankede followed by Hithadhoo's Gaukendi, Rujjehera, Abuhera, RAF, Maamendhoo and Mainland Hithadhoo. To the South are Maradhoo-Feydhoo, Feydhoo and Gan island. The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. It has a population of 3289 and is ranked 17th in terms of population in Maldives. Mardhoo's location makes it strategically important for the atoll as the main bridging point between the main industrial island Gan and the atoll's administrative capital Hithadhoo. Maradhoo is a larger island in Maldivian terms. The southern part, towards Feydhoo, has a separate administrative division and is regarded as a separate island named Maradhoo-Feydhoo, even though it is physically attached to Maradhoo island itself. Maradhoo's landscape mainly features palm trees and tropical shrubs as in other islands in Addu Atoll. The island consists of small roads, close lanes, large number of closely built houses, only a few have a second floor. Green vegetation surrounds most of the housing compounds, especially coconut palm and banana trees, and are regarded as part domestic agriculture. Maradhoo has four wards and 2 districts: *Maradhoo District: The north towards Hankede is called Venbolhofushi (which is geographically a separate island) pop ~ 1200 *Maradhoo District: The central area is called Egganburi, pop ~ 1400 *Maradhoo District: Further south is called Valiburi, pop ~ 1200 *Maradhoo-Feydhoo District: the southest is feydhooburi, now known as Maradhoo-Feydhoo pop 1100. NOTE:Though wards are known to common like this, since old times the official names were RANDHOO(valiburi) and MAARANDHOO(egganburi) The northeast end of the island is a place of historical importance, where the British navy had a major slipway and marine maintenance base. This area is now being used by a private company as a slipway and serves as a major maintenance and docking center for Dhonis, Ships and other sea- going vessels throughout the atoll as well as nearby atolls. In fact it is the only such facility in the atoll. Another significant structure is Bondoge ( literally meaning 'Big house'), which was used as a criminal detention center by British RAF forces during and after the second world war. After the RAF left Addu Atoll, Bondoge was used as a theater by locals and is now an administrative building containing a Kids Club called Club Goadhiyya. This building stands as the largest building in the island. Maradhoo is the main fishing village in the atoll and supplies fish to nearby Maradhoo-Feydhoo and Feydhoo. Maradhoo also has good house reef with plenty of varieties of fish and multi-colored corals and is a famous diving point for divers who come to Addu Atoll. Maradhoo Inside is a place in the interior atoll, before the island Maradhoo. Demography Tourism Tourism development at Addu City, after the presidential elections in 2008 there is a free opportunity to invest in the tourism industry. The fourth president of Maldives ‚ÄúMohamed Nasheed‚Äù gives the possibility for the Addu citizens, foreign investors to start at \\"local\\" Islands guesthouses, hotels, resorts, dive,- & watersport centers and other tourism related companies at Addu City. Addu city will be a ‚Äúnon typical‚Äù Maldivian tourist place where tourists can spend their time in a local environment and can explore the Maldivian way of living.

The album was later rereleased on March 19, 2002 by Hopeless Records, featuring a slightly different cover art. Although the album only sold 300 copies in its first week of release, it has sold 370,000 copies worldwide, with 310,000 sold in the United States, as of November 2010. The title 'Sounding the Seventh Trumpet' takes its name from the Book of Revelation, specifically referencing chapter 11 and the sounding of the last (seventh) trumpet, showing the end of the world. Valary DiBenedetto (M. Shadows' future wife) performs vocals on the track \\"The Art of Subconscious Illusion.\\" The album was released on vinyl for the first time in 2008 in the US. Production Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was recorded in November 2000, with a budget of only $2,000. When the band members got into the studio, The Rev recorded all the drums in one take, and the other members of the band added their parts to what he had laid down. Zacky Vengeance played lead guitar originally. When Synyster Gates joined the band in early 2001, they recorded a heavy metal version of \\"To End the Rapture\\", with Gates playing lead guitar. This version was first seen on the Warmness on the Soul single, and was later featured on the re-release of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. This is the only album to feature bassist Justin Sane, who is also credited as playing piano in the original releases. He was briefly replaced by Dameon Ash as a touring bassist after the touring cycle, who was then replaced by Johnny Christ. Release The release date of this album is theorized in many sources. On the band's official website, it's given as January 31, 2001. However, on archived versions of the website, news updates explain that the album, distributed by Lumberjack Distributions, was originally planned for a late April 2001 release. Due to unknown reasons, it had to be pushed back multiple times, at first for a June 10, then for a June 20 release. A Loudwire article about the album's 17th anniversary gives July 24 as the actual release date. On Spotify album's page, it's given as March 19, 2002. Reception Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was generally well received by critics. Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five and wrote: \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet is a magnificent album that is suitable for any fan of metal music, as Avenged Sevenfold has a firm grasp on all that is extreme.\\" The review also praised the tracks \\"Darkness Surrounding\\" and \\"We Come out at Night\\" as being \\"...excellent metalcore masterpieces, as the vocal harmonies add to these cuts to evolve the songs into fully atmospheric sonic blasts.\\" Videography Avenged Sevenfold later released the Warmness on the Soul, which featured a video for the single \\"Warmness on the Soul\\". The video depicted the band wandering through city streets as M. Shadows' wife, Valary, searched for them. There is a heavy metal version of \\"To End the Rapture\\" which was released on the reissue of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet after it was bought by Hopeless Records.

The complex is located near the Wienerberg, on the Wienerbergstra√üe and near Triester Stra√üe. The complex is built in the High- tech style. The twin building is the tallest building in the newly built quarter, which is currently mostly a series of apartment and office buildings. Construction began in 1999 and finished in 2001. The highrise has 37 floors above ground and office space of over 100,000 square metres. The tower is composed of two building halves connected at an obtuse corner. One is 138 metres high, the other 127, and they also connect through several bridges. The architect was Massimiliano Fuksas, and the project was financed by Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie AG and the Immofinanz Immobilien Anlagen AG. Inside there is a conference centre and ten-screen movie theatre as well as a number of caf√©s and restaurants. Its garage has 1,000 parking places. The Vienna Twin Town lies on the city edge of Vienna, directly next to the recreation area of Wienerberg with a golf course nearby.

A portrait of Herman Moll by William Stukeley (1723) Origin and early life Moll's exact place of origin is unknown, although his birth year is generally accepted to be the year 1654. He moved to England in 1678 and opened a book and map store in London. He produced maps from his studies of the work of other cartographers.Barber, p. 190.Reinhartz. Due to Moll's important work in Dutch cartography and the fact that he undertook a journey in his late years on behalf of the Netherlands, it is assumed he originated from Amsterdam or Rotterdam. The name \\"Moll\\" occurred not only in the Netherlands however but also in the north German area, which may suggest a German origin. Dennis Reinhartz's biography assumed that Moll came from Bremen, and other more recent works assume Germany as well.Barber, p. 190.Reinhartz. Cartographic work =Early years in London= Moll produced his earliest maps from studying cartographers such as John Senex and Emanuel Bowen.Reinhartz, p. 55. He probably sold his first maps from a stall in various places in London. From 1688 he had his own shop in Vanley's Court in London's Blackfriars. Between 1691 and 1710 his business was located at the corner of Spring Gardens and Charing Cross, and he finally moved along the River Thames to Beech Street where he remained until his death. In the 1690s, Moll worked mainly as an engraver for Christopher Browne, Robert Morden and Lea, in whose business he was also involved. During this time he also published his first major independent work, the Thesaurus Geographicus. The success of this work likely influenced his decision to start publishing his own maps. =Work as an independent publisher= A New Map of Europe According to the Newest Observations (1721) A new map of the whole world with the trade winds (1736) In 1701 he published A System of Geography, the first of his own publishing. Although it contained no fundamental changes in the presentation of his previous work, it helped him to assert himself as a freelance cartographer. Over the years, the work itself as well as individual maps were of influence on other publishers, as they were frequently copied and re- issued. In the years that followed he brought out several volumes including Fifty-six new and accurate maps of Great Britain, a book of maps of the British Isles. Then came The Compleat Geographer which was an update to A System of Geography. He issued forty-two monochrome maps designed without the usual text, as by not using his usual colours he could produce them at significantly less expense than comparable works, and went through many new editions. In 1711 he began his Atlas Geographus, which appeared in monthly deliveries from 1711 to 1717, and eventually comprised five volumes. This included a full geographical representation of the world in colour maps and illustrations. Moll's subscribers. As with his earlier works, the Atlas Geographus was eagerly copied and imitated. In 1710 he began producing artfully crafted pocket globes. These were each a pair of globes, with the larger, hinged celestial globe encircled a smaller globe. On the latter he often included the route of Dampier's circumnavigation. These globes are very rare today.For a picture of what is likely a Moll pocket globe, or at least very similar, see External Links. In 1715 Moll issued The World Described, a collection of thirty large, double-sided maps which saw numerous editions. In these maps Moll's skill as an engraver is particularly clear. These were bound separately and then later sold in the form of atlases in a joint venture between a number of other publishers. The series included two of the most famous Moll maps: A new and exact map of the dominions of the King of Great Britain and To The Right Honorable John Lord Sommers...This Map of North America According To Ye Newest and Most Exact Observations. These were distinctive for their elaborate cartouches and images, and are known respectively as the Beaver Map and the Codfish Map. As with much of his work, Moll used these maps to publicize and support British policy and regional claims throughout the world.Reinhartz, p 37, pp 135-6.Barber, p 190. The Codfish Map shows in its cartouches a scene from the cod fisheries off Newfoundland. Since the beginning of the 16th century the cod fishery there was an important economic factor for the European colonial powers. At the time of issue, the battle over fishing rights was one of the central points of contention in the North American policy of France and England. With its depiction of the processing of freshly caught cod for shipment to Europe, Moll highlighted for subscribers and viewers the importance of this sector for his native England.Reinhartz, p 37, pp 135-6. Moll labelled the Atlantic Ocean as the \\"Sea of the British Empire\\" and stressed the British claims to fishing rights off the coast of Newfoundland. In a West India map from the same series, he wrote in the southwestern corner of Carolina the words \\"Spanish Fort Deserted\\" and \\"Good Ground\\". On many of its North American maps - including on the Beaver Map - he drew particular attention to major ports streets, because he knew that was a sufficient infrastructure detail, communicating that for the further expansion of English power it was very important.Reinhartz, p 37, pp 135-6. Pritchard argues that the Beaver Map was \\"one of the first and most important cartographic documents relating to the ongoing dispute between France and Great Britain over boundaries separating their respective American colonies ... The map was the primary exponent of the British position during the period immediately following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.\\"Pritchard. His maps were also used by other powers to attempt support for their claims. One of Moll's maps of the island of Newfoundland, published in the 1680s, showed Pointe Riche, the southern limit of the French Shore. to be situated at 47¬∞40' north latitude. In 1763 the French attempted to use this map to establish their claim to the west coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, arguing that Point Riche and Cape Ray were the same headland. Governor Hugh Palliser and Captain James Cook found evidence to refute Moll's claim and in 1764 the French accepted the placement of Pointe Riche near Port au Choix. However, all political considerations aside, Moll's maps were in his lifetime and after very influential, and are still among the most sought-after aesthetic engravings in the history of cartography. Contemporaries William Dampier's voyages Moll was quite involved in the contemporary intellectual life. He was friendly and acquainted with Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and William Dampier, both socially and also probably through the Royal Society.Preston, p. 230.Reinhartz. His relationship with Dampier, especially, was mutually very beneficial. Moll had access to the latest data and observations from Dampier's many voyages, allowing his to be the first to accurately portray the great ocean currents, and Dampier in turn had his best- selling books illustrated by Moll.Preston, p. 239. Daniel Defoe was another contemporary with whom Moll exchanged ideas, and for whom he provided illustrations and maps. Another acquaintance, Jonathan Swift, went so far as to include him in his famous book Gulliver's Travels, having Lemuel Gulliver remark in chapter four, part eleven: \\"I arrived in seven hours to the south- east point of New Holland. This confirmed me in the opinion I have long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least three degrees more to the east than it really is; which I thought I communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and gave him my reasons for it, Although he has rather chosen to follow other authors.\\" Death and legacy Moll died on 22 September 1732, as noted in his obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine.Reinhartz, p. 25.

Olin was a right-handed submarining relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians from 1988 to 1992. Olin died in a 1993 boating accident while still an active MLB player. Early life Steve Olin was born on October 4, 1965 in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in nearby Beaverton. He graduated from Beaverton High School in 1984, and was recruited by baseball coach Jack Dunn to attend Portland State University. Career In 195 career games, Olin pitched 273 innings and posted a win‚Äìloss record of 16‚Äì19, with 48 saves, 118 games finished, and a 3.10 earned run average (ERA). He earned his final win on September 9, 1992 against the Milwaukee Brewers. Olin won the game in relief when Cleveland scored two runs in the top of the ninth. Death Olin was killed in a boating accident during spring training of 1993 on Little Lake Nellie in Clermont, Florida. The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever Tim Crews and seriously injuring Bob Ojeda. Crews, who was piloting the boat, was legally drunk at the time; Olin and Ojeda only had negligible traces of alcohol in their bodies. It was the first death of active major league players since Thurman Munson in 1979. In response to the accident that took Olin and Crews in 1993, the Indians wore a patch on the sleeves of their jerseys. It consisted of a baseball with their numbers on it. Olin's #31 is on the left, with an arrow above. Crews' #52 is on the right, with a star above it. Remembrance The Beatles song \\"Yellow Submarine\\" was played before each of submariner Olin's appearances for the Indians in home games. Garth Brooks' song \\"The Dance\\", a favorite of Olin, was played when the Indians clinched the 1995 American League Central Division. Before the game, manager Mike Hargrove phoned the Indians scoreboard room requesting that it be played when the Indians clinched.

The term literally means \\"worthy of worship or veneration\\",.. and is thus, in this more general sense, also applied to certain healing plants, primordial creatures, the fravashis of the dead, and to certain prayers that are themselves considered holy. The yazatas collectively are \\"the good powers under Ahura Mazda\\", who is \\"the greatest of the yazatas\\"..  Etymology  Yazata is an Avestan-language passive adjectival participle derived from yaz-; \\"to worship, to honor, to venerate\\", from Proto-Indo-European *yeh‚ÇÇ«µ- (‚Äúto worship, revere, sacrifice‚Äù). The word yasna or yagna‚Äì \\"worship, sacrifice, oblation, prayer\\" ‚Äì comes from the same root. A yaza+ ta is accordingly \\"a being worthy of worship\\", \\"an object of worship\\" or \\"a holy being\\". As the stem form, yazata- has the inflected nominative forms yazat≈ç, pl. yazat√•≈ãh≈ç. These forms reflect Proto-Iranian *yazatah and pl. *yazatƒÅhah. In Middle Persian the term became yazad or yazd, pl. yazdƒÅn, continuing in New Persian as izad. Related terms in other languages are Sanskrit y√°jati \\"he worships, he sacrifices\\", yajat√°- \\"worthy of worship, holy\\", yaj√±√° \\"sacrifice\\", and perhaps also Greek ·ºÖŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ hagios \\"devoted to the gods, sacred, holy\\". In scripture The term yazata is already used in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and believed to have been composed by Zarathustra himself. In these hymns, yazata is used as a generic, applied to Ahura Mazda as well as to the \\"divine sparks\\" that are in later tradition the Amesha Spentas. In the Gathas, the yazatas are effectively what the daevas are not; that is, the yazatas are to be worshipped while the daevas are to be rejected. The Gathas also collectively invoke the yazatas without providing a clue as to which entities are being invoked, and‚Äîgiven the structure and language of the hymns‚Äîit is generally not possible to determine whether these yazatas are abstract concepts or are manifest entities. Amongst the lesser Yazatas being invoked by name by the poet of the Gathas are Sraosha, Ashi, Atar, Geush Tashan, Geush Urvan, Tushnamaiti, and Iza, and all of which \\"win mention in his hymns, it seems, because of their close association with rituals of sacrifice and worship\\".. In the Younger Avesta, the yazatas are unambiguously divine, with divine powers though performing mundane tasks such as serving as charioteers for other yazatas. Several yazatas are given anthropomorphic attributes, such as cradling a mace or bearing a crown upon their heads, or not letting sleep interrupt their vigil against the demons. At some point during the late 5th or early 4th century BCE, the Achaemenids instituted a religious calendar in which each day of the month was named after, and placed under the protection of, a particular yazata. These day-name dedications were not only of religious significance because they ensured that those divinities remained in the public consciousness, they also established a hierarchy among the yazatas, with specific exalted entities having key positions in the day- name dedications (see Zoroastrian calendar for details). Although these day- name dedications are mirrored in scripture, it cannot be determined whether these day-name assignments were provoked by an antecedent list in scripture (e.g. Yasna 16), or whether the day-name dedications provoked the compilation of such lists. Relatively certain however is that the day-name dedications predate the Avesta's Siroza (\\"30 days\\"), which contain explicit references to the yazatas as protectors/guardians of their respective days of the month. In tradition The 9th‚Äì12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition observe the yazatas (by then as Middle Persian yazads) in much the same way as the hymns of the Younger Avesta. In addition, in roles that are only alluded to in scripture, they assume characteristics of cosmological or eschatological consequence. For instance, Aredvi Sura Anahita (Ardvisur Nahid) is both a divinity of the waters as well as a rushing world river that encircles the earth, which is blocked up by Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) thus causing drought. The blockage is removed by Verethragna (Vahram), and Tishtrya (Tir) gathers up the waters and spreads them over the earth (Zam) as rain. In stories with eschatological significance, Sraosha (Sarosh), Mithra (Mihr), and Rashnu (Rashn) are guardians of the Chinvat bridge, the bridge of the separator, across which all souls must pass. Further, what the calendrical dedications had begun, the tradition completed: at the top of the hierarchy was Ahura Mazda, who was supported by the great heptad of Amesha Spentas (Ameshaspands/Mahraspands), through which the Creator realized (\\"created with his thought\\") the manifest universe. The Amesha Spentas in turn had hamkars, \\"assistants\\" or \\"cooperators\\", each a caretaker of one facet of creation. In both tradition and scripture, the terms 'Amesha Spenta' and 'yazata' are sometimes used interchangeably. In general, however, 'Amesha Spenta' signifies the six divine emanations of Ahura Mazda. In tradition, yazata is the first of the 101 epithets of Ahura Mazda. The word also came to be applied to Zoroaster, though Zoroastrians today remain sharply critical of any attempts to deify the prophet. In a hierarchy excluding either Ahura Mazda or the Amesha Spentas amongst the yazatas, the most prominent amongst those \\"worthy of worship\\" is Mithra, who \\"is second only in dignity to Ohrmazd (i.e. Ahura Mazda) himself.\\". Outside of the traditional yazatas, local and foreign deities may have been incorporated into local religious practice in various distant terroities of the Persian Empires. This may be true in Armenia, the Kushan Empire, Sogdia, China, and other regions were Zoroastrianism may have been practiced, though evidence of such deities corrupting Orthodox tradition is scant. In the present day In the 1860s and 1870s, the linguist Martin Haug interpreted Zoroastrian scripture in Christian terms, and compared the yazatas to the angels of Christianity. In this scheme, the Amesha Spentas are the arch-angel retinue of Ahura Mazda, with the hamkars as the supporting host of lesser angels. At the time Haug wrote his translations, the Parsi (i.e. Indian Zoroastrian) community was under intense pressure from English and American missionaries, who severely criticized the Zoroastrians for--as John Wilson portrayed it in 1843--\\"polytheism\\", which the missionaries argued was much less worth than their own \\"monotheism\\". At the time, Zoroastrianism lacked theologians of its own, and so the Zoroastrians were poorly equipped to make their own case. In this situation, Haug's counter-interpretation came as a welcome relief, and was (by-and-large) gratefully accepted as legitimate. Haug's interpretations were subsequently disseminated as Zoroastrian ones, which then eventually reached the west where they were seen to corroborate Haug. Like most of Haug's interpretations, this comparison is today so well entrenched that a gloss of 'yazata' as 'angel' is almost universally accepted; both in publications intended for a general audiencecf. .cf. . as well as in (non-philological) academic literature.cf. .cf. . Amongst the Muslims of Iran, Sraosha came to be \\"arguably the most popular of all the subordinate Yazatas\\", for as the angel Surush, only he (of the entire Zoroastrian pantheon) is still venerated by name..

A survey administered during the 2012 Big Gay Out festival determined that those who stayed longer were more knowledgeable and positive toward condom culture and felt that the Get it on! message was an empowering one. Survey participants also said the program \\"helped to educate men about safe sex\\" and \\"helped them feel good about having safe sex.\\" In 2014, Get It On! was dropped and LYC was adopted as the main message. Love Your Condom (LYC) is New Zealand Aids Foundation‚Äôs social marketing programme for gay and bisexual men. It addresses a complex mix of attitudinal, behavioural and social change amongst a community that can be difficult to define and reach. The LYC Social Marketing team talks about the programme‚Äôs history, the challenges they face and what keeps them loving what they do. In 2017, New Zealand Aids Foundation dropped Love Your Condom and created a new campaign called Ending HIV. It has a goal of ending new HIV transmission in New Zealand by 2025. The campaign highlight key points including: * Playing safe. Which means safe sex with the use of condoms and taking PrEP. * Testing Often. Most HIV transmissions happen with people who don't know they have HIV and have unprotected sex. Testing often will diagnose people with HIV and get them onto treatment which will help stop spreading HIV. * Treat Early. Treating early not only protects personal health, but it also reduces the chance of transmitting HIV to another person. * Ending HIV Stigma. Stigma refers to prejudice and discrimination towards people living with HIV, their friends, partners and whƒÅnau. Even though HIV stigma was at its peak during the early days of the AIDS epidemic, many people living with HIV still experience prejudice on a daily basis.

Biography King was born in Detroit, Michigan. King left the Baptist faith that he had been baptized into at the age of 12. He grew up with an interest in African culture and began African studies at the age of 16. At the age of 20, King traveled to Haiti in 1954 to study the Haitian culture and Haitian Vodou and, in 1955, to Europe and North Africa, often as a part of the Katherine Dunham Dance Company. In 1959, just before the Cuban revolution, he traveled to the Matanzas region of Cuba and became the first documented African-American to be initiated into the Yoruba priesthood of Obatala, where he was named \\"Efuntola Oseijeman Adefunmi\\". Efuntola means \\"the whiteness (of Obatala) is as good as wealth (or honor).\\" Adefunmi means \\"the crown has given me this (child).\\" Upon his return to the United States, he founded the Order of the Damballah Hwedo in Harlem New York, then the Shango Temple, and later incorporated the African Theological Archministry. That organization would come to be called the Yoruba Temple. In 1970, along with several other devotees, Oba Adefunmi created the Oyotunji village in Beaufort County, South Carolina.http://www.oyotunji.com Oba Adefunmi's black nationalist stance drew large criticism from within the ranks of the Cuban Santer√≠a priests because of his strident opposition to certain aspects of their religion, aspects which - he felt - did not keep with the traditional form of the Yoruba religion. This eventually led to his break from the Cuban form of Ifa (Santeria-Lukumi). To replace his former teachers, Adefunmi journeyed to Yorubaland in Africa, where he was welcomed and initiated as a babalawo in Ile-Ife.

It has a maximum depth of . On the north side is U.S. Highway 27 and across from that is Lake Jackson. The lake has no public access directly, although it is connected by a short canal to Lake Jackson, which has a public boat ramp. Activities on the lake include boating and fishing. A golf course overlooks the southwest side and various businesses adjoin it on the north, along US 27. A hotel, Inn on the Lakes, is on its north shore. Historic Harder Hall, partially renovated but abandoned because of the developer's financial problems, is on the northwest shore. History In 1928 Harder Hall, a classic Spanish Style hotel and golf resort, was built on the shore of Little Lake Jackson. It was built in Sebring because the city was a stop on the railroad. In 1953 it was bought by Victor and David Jacobson and partners Larry Tennenbaum and Sam Levy. In 1954 Victor commissioned golf course architect Dick Wilson to transform the golf course into a championship layout. Among the major tournaments held at Harder Hall Hotel were the Haig & Haig, a PGA event played by both Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicholas. Other famous guests of the hotel were Paul Newman, Steve Mcqueen, Ali MacGraw and Mario Andretti. With head pro Ben Roman Victor started the first golf school in the world. Victor and Eva Jacobson also operated Harder Hall Golf and Tennis Camp at the hotel between 1967 and 1980. This was the first and last co-ed, teenage golf and tennis camp in a resort hotel ever and drew campers from all over the world. Victor operated this hotel until the 1981 when he sold it. The building has been abandoned ever since. Several renovation projects were started but halted. Several times Harder Hall barely escaped demolition. Currently the building is still unfinished.

Described as \\"the greatest batsman ever known until the appearance of W. G. Grace\\", the right-handed batsman Pilch played 229 first-class matches between 1820 and 1854 for an assortment of counties, including Kent, Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex, as well as Norfolk and Cambridge Town Club (aka Cambridgeshire). An early pioneer of batting, Pilch's advert of the \\"Pilch poke\\", or art of playing the ball forward, was an early manifestation of modern batting practices. Though his statistics reflect by modern standards as fairly ordinary, the ten centuries he amassed throughout his entire club and first-class playing career were considered \\"remarkable\\" in the context of round-arm bowling and poorly maintained cricket pitches encountered during the period. He was also known for his success at single-wicket matches, defeating Tom Marsden in 1833. He came from a cricketing family: nephew William Pilch and brothers Nathaniel and William all played first-class cricket. Early life He was the son of Nathaniel Pilch and Frances Fuller, who were married at Brisley and later returned to live there. Fuller Pilch followed in the footsteps of his two elder brothers, Nathaniel and William, and became a professional cricketer. His first appearance at Lord's was a three-day match in July 1820, playing for Norfolk. He then went to Sheffield to play cricket and earn his living as a tailor. Cricketing career Writing in 1862 in his Scores and biographies, Arthur Haygarth called Pilch \\"the best batsman that has ever yet appeared\\". The main characteristic of Pilch's batting was his forward play, a shot that was called 'Pilch's poke'. Haygarth further wrote : \\"His style of batting was very commanding, extremely forward, and he seemed to rush to the best bowling by his long forward play before it had time to shoot or rise, or do mischief by catches\\". By the late 1820s he had become the finest batsman in England and acquired the nickname, \\"the non pareil [unrivalled] hitter\\".Gideon Haigh, 'Moniker Mania' in Wisden 2015 at p.46. William Lillywhite was known as \\"the non pareil bowler\\". He appeared 23 times in Gentlemen v Players matches. In 1833, in highly publicised single wicket matches, he twice defeated Tom Marsden, the other prominent batsman of the time. In 1835, he moved to Town Malling in Kent and received a salary of 100 pounds a year. There he kept a tavern attached to the cricket ground. Pilch moved to Canterbury in 1842 where he kept the Saracen's Head. He served as the first groundsman of the St. Lawrence Ground from 1847 to 1868. As to the question of how Pilch would compare with the greatest of his successors, Wisden editor Sydney Pardon wrote in W. G. Grace's obituary in the 1916 Wisden : A story is told of a cricketer who had regarded Fuller Pilch as the final word in batting, being taken in his old age to see Mr. Grace bat for the first time. He watched the great man for a quarter of an hour or so and then broke out into an expression of boundless delight. 'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'. Pilch died at Canterbury in 1870. He never married. Legacy Pilch is remembered on the village sign at Horningtoft In June 2008 it was reported in The Times that Pilch's grave at St. Gregory's churchyard in Canterbury was preventing the development of the churchyard into a Canterbury Christ Church University concert hall, as it could not be located for removal.The Times, 25 June 2008 In the following month, the grave was located through the use of an old photograph and the memories of local people. Pilch appears in the Flashman novel Flashman's Lady by George MacDonald Fraser. In the novel Pilch is caught and bowled by Flashman in a fictional game set at Lord's between Rugby Old Boys and Kent in 1842. Fuller Pilch is mentioned in the song \\"Gentlemen and Players\\" on the 2009 cricket concept album The Duckworth Lewis Method, created by Irish duo Thomas Walsh and Neil Hannon.

It inspired the widespead commissioning of groups of matching portraits of famous men from history (Uomini Famosi) to serve as moral role models. With its inception in the circle of Cicero,Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, \\"The Early Beginnings of the Notion of \\"Uomini Famosi\\" and the \\"De Viris Illustribus\\" in Greco-Roman Literary Tradition\\", Artibus et Historiae 3.6 (1982), pp. 97-115. various ancient works bear the titles De Viris Illustribus or De hominibus illustribus, including: * Cornelius Nepos' De Viris Illustribus, from which Aulus Gellius draws an anecdote of Cato the Elder; Cornelius Nepos also produced a Liber De Excellentibus Ducibus Gentium (Lives of Eminent Commanders). * Suetonius' fragmentary Lives include grammarians, rhetoricians, historians, and poets. * An anonymous De Viris Illustribus probably dating to the first half of the 4th century is a compilation of 86 brief biographies of individuals important to Roman history, from the legendary Alban king Proca to Cleopatra.Christoph F. Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius: A Historical Commentary (University of North Carolina Press, 1994), p. xlix. The compilation draws on Livy, through intermediaries such as an epitome and Florus, or on sources such as Nepos and Hyginus. This work was initially attributed to Aurelius Victor, under the name De Viris Illustribus Romae. * Jerome's collection of Christian biographies, De Viris Illustribus, contains 135 brief notices. * Gennadius of Massilia's De Viris Illustribus, who continued Jerome's work. During the Middle Ages the inspirational series took two paths: the specifically Christian models were enshrined in hagiography, in which miracles attracted the attention and the qualities exemplified by martyrs were those of fortitude, faith and obedience. On the secular side, the worldly models were contracted and codified in the Nine Worthies, chivalric exemplars of valiant courtoisie, the instructive models of aristocratic courtly behavior.Horst Shroeder, Der topos der Nine Worthies in Literatur und bildender Kunst (G√∂ttingen) 1971 is the standard survey. The literary biographies were reflected in illustrated versions in illuminated manuscripts, tapestry and other media. With the revival of classical learning in the Italian Renaissance, a broader, carefully selected group of men of renown from the distant and recent past, outstanding for their statecraft or their learning emerged \\"almost simultaneously\\" in the Italian cities of Milan, Naples, Siena, Padua,Theodor E.

Joost-Gaugier, \\"Poggio and Visual Tradition: 'Uomini Famosi' in Classical Literary Description\\" Artibus et Historiae 6.12 (1985), pp. 57-74, p. 57f In literature the theme was revived by Petrarch in his De Viris Illustribus, a collection of 36 short biographies On Famous Men and by Boccaccio, inspired by him, in his De Casibus Virorum Illustrium (\\"On the Fates of Famous Men\\"), a collection of 56 biographies. Boccaccio also wrote a feminine complement to it, De mulieribus claris (\\"On Famous Women\\"), containing 106 biographies. Leonardo Bruni published translations of Plutarch's Lives. The humanist Poggio Bracciolini urged in his essay De Nobilitate Liber (\\"Book on Nobility\\"), that the Romans should be emulated \\"for they believed that the images of men who had excelled in the pursuit of glory and wisdom, if placed before the eyes, would help enoble and stir up the soul.\\"Quoted in Christiane L.

A series of instructive uomini illustri portraits was painted for Azzo Visconti in Milan, and was mentioned by Giorgio Vasari, but is now lost, together with a series in Naples, but important early series of portraits of famous men survive in the Palazzo Pubblico, SienaNicolai Rubinstein, \\"Political ideas in Sienese art: the frescoes by Ambrogio Lorenzetti and Taddeo di Bartolo in the Palazzo Pubblico\\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 21 (1958) pp 179-207. and in the Sala Virorum Illustrium (\\"Hall of Illustrious Men\\") (or Sala dei Gigantihttps://www.musei.unipd.it/sites/musei.unipd.it/files/1_gioCAMuseo_Giganti.pdf) in the Reggia Carrarese, Padua. The Giovio Series of portraits of literary figures, rulers, statesmen and other dignitaries, many of which were made from life, was assembled by Renaissance historian and biographer Paolo Giovio (1483‚Äì1552) but was subsequently lost. It is represented today by the set of copies made for Cosimo I de' Medici in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The genre continues today, not so much in universal biographical dictionaries, which verge on factual prosopography, but in collections of inspirational biographies such as Profiles in Courage.

RD2201A The RCA Lyra RD2201 The 2201 is one of, if not the oldest Lyra made by RCA/Thomson. Originally sold with a 32MB CF card, it has a 1\\" √ó 3/4\\" backlit monochrome display, software five band graphic equalizer, and an external power jack. This series of players requires a proprietary CF reader used in conjunction with specific media players in Windows in order to write files to the card. A supported setup would take a blank CF card, recognize the correct reader attached to the PC, and then while syncing songs to the device, convert them to an encrypted version of RealAudio, MP3, MP3Pro, and later WMA format that is unrecognizable to any other device. It also drops a folder title 'Pmp' onto the root level of the device, which contains the boot image, a config file, and one or more executable, wma.exe, mp3.exe, or rlm.exe. modified versions of the wma.exe program, capable of playing unencrypted WMA files. This can be used in conjunction with a non-certified CF reader, making the device usable again to anyone who lost theirs and cannot acquire a new one. The only requirement then is to convert your MP3 files to WMA, using any number of free converters. The device also supports much larger CF cards than it original shipped with, up to at least 512MB. At these sizes though, boot time becomes significantly long, as the Lyra scans the entire card before presenting you with any menu. With only 250MB of files, spread across roughly 100 tracks, this can be over a minute. The 2201 also supports custom splash screens via third party software. The RCA logo can be replaced by overwriting the screen.bit file in the Pmp folder. See How To Create Lyra Screen BIT Designs for more information. An updated version, the RD2204A, was sold with a 64MB Compact Flash card. This version supports Compact flash cards up to at least 2GB. Like the RD2201A, boot times increase with the size of the card. The RD2204A can also be used with a third party CF reader, provided that the user installs the RCA software on the PC. Lyra PDP-2860 The most popular of the Lyra series was the Lyra PDP-2860, which was also one of the first portable media players capable of playing MPEG-4 encoded videos. The PDP-2860 is remarkably similar to the Lyra RD2780. The device was manufactured having a hard drive with a maximum capacity of 20GB but could also work with a 60GB hard drive which had to be installed manually. Battery life was reported to last for up to 3 hours of video and 6 hours of audio playback. One of the more popular features of this digital audio player was its ability to record live television through the RCA ports on your television set. The player's LCD display had a resolution of 320√ó240 pixels with 16 million colors. It was also possible to view photos on the display screen while audio was playing. PDP-2860 The PDP-2860 was also UMS-capable, meaning that it could act as a portable external harddrive with no additional software or driver installation. x2400 The Lyra x2400 is a portable audio/video recorder and player with a 3.5\\" LCD screen. It has a CompactFlash slot, audio out, built-in speaker and RCA A/V inputs. Recorded video is compressed with an XVID encoder. The included software, Blaze Media Encoder, can transcode from most popular video and audio formats. x3030 The Lyra x3030 features a 30 GB hard drive with support for many audio and video formats. Included is a DIVX encoder which can translate most video formats into smaller more efficient formats. =Issues= There is no provision to randomly play video clips, as the user may wish to do for a music video jukebox. The DiVX converter gives its output file with the .divx extension, which the Lyra rejects as incompatible. However, all the user has to do is rename the file with a .avi extension to make it work. The first documentation to be shipped spoke of a system tray resident icon and program to manage the device. No such software exists in the distribution, and they have since revised their documentation to remove all mention of it.

Their music is heavily influenced by Celtic themes, and can be compared to folk rock music. The band has sold over 500,000 albums. Known for their left-wing politics, their lyrics often speak out against the Mafia and fascism. Biography The Modena City Ramblers were formed in 1991 by a group of friends that wanted to play traditional Irish music. The first to join were Alberto Morselli, Giovanni Rubbiani and Alberto Cottica (still in Lontano da dove), Chris Dennis (formerly a member of Nomadi), Filippo Chieli, Franco D'Aniello and Luciano Gaetani from 'Abazia dei folli. On Saint Patrick's Day in 1991, during a concert in a pub in Modena, they chose the name Modena City Ramblers. The name was an homage to Dublin City Ramblers, an Irish band.Alberto Morselli in his biography In 1992, they were joined by bassist Massimo Ghiacci (formerly in the band Plutonium 99). During the evening of 1 March they recorded their first demo. During a concert at a pub in Carpi, Stefano \\"Cisco\\" Bellotti sang \\"The Wild Rover\\" for the first time.Stefano \\"Cisco\\" Bellotti in Clan Banlieue ‚Äì 12 years of songs, concerts, interviews, journeys, videos At this time the Modena City Ramblers became an open company, and have remained so during throughout their history, with almost all members who have left the band returning sporadically to play with the group. Their most famous concert was performed as the opening act for the Pogues in Modena. Their repertoire has since expanded considerably, including traditional Italian songs as \\"Bella ciao\\", \\"Fischia il vento\\", and \\"Contessa\\". The singer of the group Cisco along with producer Kaba Cavazzuti who also became \\"a new member of the Modena City Ramblers after changes in the original line-up\\", released the album of the ‚Äòbrother band‚Äô Casa del Vento, titled \\"900\\" which came out in February 2001. Members The band's lineup has changed many times since their formation. After the first album, singer Alberto Morselli left the band; in 1996 Francesco Moneti replaced Marco Michelini, and Giovanni Rubbiani and Alberto Cottica left the band in 2001. Singer Stefano \\"Cisco\\" Bellotti left the band in 2005 after fourteen years.

Morrow made a committee motion to hold Enron in contempt for failing to respond to committee document subpoenas; the motion carried. Toward the end of his tenure in the California Senate Morrow sponsored the controversial \\"Students Bill of Rights,\\" which was modeled on David Horowitz's Academic Bill of Rights. Morrow introduced the bill \\"to help protect students in our public education system from harassment and abuse.\\" However, some critics alleged that the bill's vaguely worded requirements‚Äîe.g., to respect the \\"unsettled character\\" of the social sciences and humanities‚Äîdenied the distinction between plausible theories and implausible theories, giving theories like Holocaust denials an academic respect not warranted by the evidence.\\" This criticism was given further support when Morrow publicly claimed the bill \\"treats all ideological perspectives the same.\\" In addition, the bill required social science and humanities faculty to \\"provide students with dissenting sources and viewpoints.\\" Given the bill's vague criteria, some critics alleged that this requirement could be used to force faculty to cover implausible theories in their classes. Though the bill gained some media attention, it never made it out of committee. Morrow lives in Oceanside with his wife, Barbara, and his son Will, from a previous marriage. Morrow is an avid outdoorsman.

The word in English may refer to any of various clergy, depending upon the usage of the particular church in question. Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches Portrait of an Orthodox protodeacon wearing the distinctive burgundy skufia, by Ilya Repin, 1877 (Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow). Protodeacon is an honorific rank given to certain married deacons in Eastern Christian churches. In the Russian Orthodox Church it is an honorary title given to married deacons, as a mark of which, the clergyman is entitled to wear a burgundy-colored skufia. The equivalent rank for Hierodeacons‚Äîi.e., monastic deacons‚Äîis Archdeacon. The senior deacon of a cathedral or principal church may be awarded the title of protodeacon. In the Greek usage, the chief deacon who is attached to the person of a bishop is called an archdeacon. In the Slavic usage a protodeacon or archdeacon wears a distinctive orarion (deacon's stole). The title of protodeacon is an award, not a distinctive order of ministry; so while a man may be ordained a deacon, he is said to be 'elevated' to the rank of protodeacon. This elevation may be awarded only by the deacon's own ruling bishop. The rite of elevation is identical for both a protodeacon and an archdeacon, and is normally done during the Little Entrance of the Divine Liturgy. A protodeacon has precedence when serving with other deacons, regardless of the date of his own ordination to the diaconate. If several protodeacons serve at the same time, their order of precedence is determined by the date of their elevation. In the Archieratikon (Slavonic: Chinovnik), the liturgical book containing the services as celebrated by a bishop, the term Protodeacon is used to refer to the senior-ranking deacon who is serving, regardless of whether or not he has actually had that rank bestowed upon him. Latin Church In the Roman rite, the senior Cardinal Deacon is the Cardinal Protodeacon of the Holy Roman Church. He has the privilege of announcing the new pope's election and name (once he has been ordained to the episcopate) in the Habemus Papam announcement given from the central balcony at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City State. In the past, during papal coronations, the Protodeacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his successors have followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal Protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased. However, the Protodeacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. ‚ÄúActing in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.‚Äù The current Cardinal Protodeacon is Renato Martino.

A mix of riverside condominiums, shopping, restaurants, hotels, a large public plaza and urban parkland make Eau Claire one of Calgary's most popular areas. Contained within Eau Claire is the city's Festival District. The area, which was developed from reclaimed industrial land, fronts the Bow River and sits immediately north of 3rd Avenue South. North of Eau Claire is Prince's Island Park, a large urban park on an island in the Bow River and the site of many summer festivals, including the Calgary Folk Music Festival, Carifest, Shakespeare in the Park and various busking happenings. Within Eau Claire is Eau Claire Market and a variety of pubs and restaurants. It is also located on the city's large network of pedestrian pathways and trails, along the Bow River pathway. History The name Eau Claire derives from one of Calgary's original industries - a sawmill transplanted from Eau Claire, Wisconsin and staffed by mostly Norwegian mill workers. The area on the banks of the Bow River was selected in 1886 for its easy access to fallen timber. The community was subsequently named for the Eau Claire Lumber Company. Eau Claire Plaza, at the core of the Festival District is currently undergoing a major modernization and redevelopment to better integrate it with the city, Prince's Island, Eau Claire Market, Barclay Mall and the other surrounding hotels, restaurants and businesses. The community has an area redevelopment plan in place. Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Eau Claire had a population of living in dwellings, an 8.2% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012. Residents in this community had a median household income of $80,210 in 2000, and there were 21.8% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2000, 32.7% of the residents were immigrants. A proportion of 98% of the buildings were condominiums or apartments, and 38.7% of the housing was used for renting. It is represented in the Calgary City Council by the Ward 7 councillor. Eau Claire Market Eau Claire Market Eau Claire Market is the focal point of the neighbourhood. It sits immediately south of the Bow River and was built on former industrial land. The mall is home to several unique and \\"one of a kind\\" shops and galleries, a six screen Cineplex Odeon multiplex, a food court and several restaurants. To coincide with the reconfiguration of Eau Claire Plaza, plans are currently in development to demolish and completely rebuild the market which has declined in popularity in recent years. The new market will likely cater to a larger and more diverse demographic to better serve the residential community at large. The redeveloped market will enclose the entrance to the future underground 2 Street SW Station, part of the Calgary Green Line. Taking design inspiration from the Central Library, the north end of the market will feature a tunnel portal integrated in the building, leading the CTrain to north- central Calgary via a new bridge over the Bow River. Construction of the station is expected to begin in 2024.

From 1942 through 1950, Voiselle played for the New York Giants (1942‚Äì47), Boston Braves (1947‚Äì49) and Chicago Cubs (1950). He batted and threw right-handed. While born in Greenwood, South Carolina, Voiselle grew up in the nearby town of Ninety Six. He received special permission from the National League to wear the number 96 on his jersey as a way to honor his hometown. At the time, this was the highest number ever worn in major league baseball. Voiselle debuted with the Giants in 1942 and reached the big leagues full-time in 1944. Nicknamed \\"Big Bill\\", in his rookie season, he led the NL in innings pitched and strikeouts, and finished third with a career-high 21 wins. He made his only All-Star appearance that season and finished fifth in MVP voting. To top it off, The Sporting News named him the National League Pitcher of the Year in the first season of the award. Voiselle suffered a minor sophomore jinx in 1945, winning 14 but with a high 4.49 ERA. After many prominent major leaguers returned from World War II, his role with the Giants was reduced. He also was on the end of a $500 fine from Giants manager Mel Ott for allowing St. Louis Cardinals batter Johnny Hopp to get a hit on an 0-2 count during a June 1 game at Sportsman's Park. Voiselle was eventually traded to the Boston Braves for another wartime star, Mort Cooper, in the 1947 midseason. In 1948, Voiselle won 13 games for the Braves Champions Team as the third starter behind Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain. In the World Series against the Cleveland Indians, Voiselle came into Game 3 as a relief pitcher and he got the start in Game 6, taking the loss, 4‚Äì3. Most concede that Voiselle and the Braves out-pitched and out-hit the Indians, but the team was eliminated 4‚Äì2. Voiselle pitched 10.2 innings in the Series and surrendered three earned runs for a 2.53 ERA. After that, he pitched one more season with the Braves, winning just seven games, before being traded before the 1950 season to the Chicago Cubs for infielder Gene Mauch. Voiselle only spent a half a season with the Cubs, during which he failed to record a victory in 19 appearances (seven starts). It would end up being his last year in the majors, though he continued pitching for a significant number of minor league clubs. In a nine-season career, Voiselle posted a 74‚Äì84 record with 645 strikeouts and a 3.83 ERA in 1373 innings. Voiselle died in Greenwood, South Carolina, just two days after his 86th birthday.

Charles VII at the Parliament de Paris, in 1450, by Jean Fouquet In France under the Ancien R√©gime, the lit de justice (, \\"bed of justice\\") was a particular formal session of the Parliament of Paris, under the presidency of the king, for the compulsory registration of the royal edicts. It was named thus because the king would sit on a throne, under a baldachin.Jean Rey, Histoire du drapeau, des couleurs et des insignes de la monarchie fran√ßaise, Vol. 2, Paris 1837, p.40 In the Middle Ages, not every appearance of the King of France in parlement occasioned a formal lit de justice. It was the custom of Philip IV and his three sons, Charles V, Charles VI, and Louis XII to attend sessions of various parlements regularly. Description A lit de justice in Paris was normally held in the Grand'Chambre du Parlement of the royal palace on the √éle de la Cit√©, which remains the Palais de Justice even today. The king, fresh from his devotions in Sainte-Chapelle, would enter, accompanied by his chancellor, the princes du sang, dukes and peers, cardinals and marshals, and take his place upon the cushions on a dais under a canopy of estate (the lit) in a corner of the chamber. The records of a lit de justice of Charles V, May 21, 1375, gives an impression of the panoply of personages: the Dauphin, the duc d'Anjou brother of the King, the Patriarch of Alexandria, 4 archbishops, 7 bishops, 6 abbots, the rector and several members of the University of Paris, the Chancellor of France, 4 princes of the blood, several comtes and seigneurs, the Provost of Merchants and the echevins of the city of Paris, \\"several other wise and notable folk and a great crowd of people\\".Encyclop√©die Five cushions formed the lit: the king sat on one, another formed a back, two more supported his arms and a cushion lay under his feet. Peers and prelates were ranged on benches at his right and left. Before the king, a large space was kept empty, that the king might discuss matters privately. To preserve order, it was forbidden for anyone to leave his seat or approach the lit without being called. The king needed only speak a few preliminary words, followed by the formula mon chancelier vous dira le reste (\\"my chancellor will tell you the rest\\"), whereupon the chancellor seated at his feet would read aloud the rest of the royal declaration, such as the declaration of a regency or of a king's majority, or declarations of war or peace. The lit de justice equally served to cow recalcitrant parlements, imposing the sovereignty of the king. Later practice In the Middle Ages, a lit de justice was the setting for trials of great aristocrats for major crimes. In the 16th century, it began to be manipulated for enforcing the registration of royal edicts. In the 17th century, it was rarely used but was revived under Louis XV, raising controversy among the parliamentary noblesse de robe, mindful of their threatened prerogatives. The lit de justice, as it was revived in 1527, was intended by the royal party as an expression of royal justice, with hazy and immemorial antecedents in the open-air gathering of nobles presided over by enthroned Merovingian kings. In the king's presence the parlements lost its usual quality of judge, to take the role of counsellor following the principle adveniente principe, cessat magistratus (\\"with the arrival of the king, magistratures cease\\"). As relations between Henri III and the Parliament of Paris became strained, the king used his presence in the lit de justice to enforce his will upon a recalcitrant court. Absolutist propaganda asserted that a lit de justice in its origins could take place before any parlement though, in practice, the appearance of Charles IX before the Parliament of Rouen to enforce the enregistration of his Edict of Amboise (1563) was an innovation intended to discount the legislative role of the Parliament of Paris.See Mack P. Holt, \\"The King in Parlement: The Problem of the Lit de Justice in Sixteenth-Century France\\" The Historical Journal 31.3 (September 1988:507-523). He and the Queen Mother made a tour of parlements‚ÄîDijon, Bordeaux, Toulouse‚Äîto enforce the registration of the Edict throughout France.Holt 1988:519 From the reign of Louis XIII it was confined to the Parliament of Paris. In his Memoirs, the Duc de Saint-Simon describes in detail a lit de justice held during the Regency of the Duke of Orl√©ans on August 26, 1718 at the Tuileries Palace. The lit was used to enact an edict respecting the French currency over the parlements' objection as well as stripping the Duke of Maine of his control over the child King Louis XV's education and of the rank of prince du sang.The Memoirs of Louis XIV, His Court and the Regency by the Duke of Saint-Simon The last such session was in May 8, 1788, under Louis XVI, at Versailles. https://archive.org/details/litdejusticetenu00fran_0/page/n1/mode/2up Notes External links *Encyclop√©die: \\"Lit de justice\\" article in the Encyclop√©die, ou dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers.

Biography Born to a lyric singer father and a pianist mother (Clarisse Leite), Baptista studied classical piano from 1955 to 1959, double bass from 1962 to 1963, and acoustic guitar from 1963 to 1965. In 1966 he formed the influential Os Mutantes band with his brother S√©rgio Dias and Rita Lee, where he played bass guitar, keyboards and sang. Baptista left the band in 1973 due to disagreements with the other members of the band and the excessive use of LSD. In 1974 he tried to work as a musical producer, with no success. This motivated him to try a solo career, and in the same year, he released the album L√≥ki?, which is considered his best work. Baptista recorded two albums with the band Patrulha do Espa√ßo between 1977 and 1978, and later resumed his solo career. In 2006, Os Mutantes reunited without Rita Lee, and Baptista played with his brother S√©rgio and the drummer Dinho Leme 33 years after originally leaving the band. In 2007 Baptista left the band again to pursue personal projects. Baptista currently lives with his wife Lucinha Barbosa in the city of Juiz de Fora, where he spends most of his time painting, singing and writing songs. He is a vegetarian.

Lowari Top is a relatively low pass, by far the lowest pass to enter Chitral, the rest all being 12,000 to 15,000 feet. Lowari Top is closed by snow from late November to late May every year. During this time, jeeps cannot cross so men must travel by foot. This is dangerous, as there are high mountains on each side of Lowari Top, and a deadly avalanche can come at any moment without warning. Every winter a few people are killed by avalanches while crossing Lowari Top. Their bodies are buried under the snow and it is only when the summer comes and the snow melts that their bodies are found and their fate learned. Nevertheless, Lowari Top remains popular because it is the shortest route from Chitral to Peshawar. The other way would be down the Kunar River to Jalalabad through hostile Afghan Territory or the much longer route across Shandur Top to Gilgit. Lowari Top crosses the Hindu Raj Mountains, a spur of the higher Hindu Kush. On the Chitral side of Lowari Top are the people of Ashret, who speak the Palula language and were assigned by the Mehtar of Chitral to be the guardians of Lowari Top. On the Dir side reside Khowars, some of whom make their living as porters carrying loads across Lowari Top. In 1954, the Mehtar of Chitral was killed when his airplane crashed into Lowari Top. The word \\"Top\\" is believed not to be the English word \\"top\\" but a word from an ancient language no longer spoken there. The Lowari Top is one of the four major mountain passes to enter Chitral. The others are the Dorah Pass from Badakshan in Afghanistan, Shandur Top from Gilgit, and Broghol from the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan. The Lowari Tunnel was constructed beneath Lowari Pass by Sambu, a South Korean company in 2009. However, the tunnel was abandoned shortly thereafter and has since fallen into disrepair. The tunnel is functional as of December, 2019 and comprises over 8.5 Kilometres in length.

The format of The Art of War is a socratic dialogue. The purpose, declared by Lord Fabrizio Colonna (perhaps Machiavelli's persona) at the outset, \\"To honor and reward virt√π, not to have contempt for poverty, to esteem the modes and orders of military discipline, to constrain citizens to love one another, to live without factions, to esteem less the private than the public good.\\" To these ends, Machiavelli notes in his preface, the military is like the roof of a palazzo protecting the contents. Written between 1519 and 1520 and published the following year, it was Machiavelli's only historical or political work printed during his lifetime, though he was appointed official historian of Florence in 1520 and entrusted with minor civil duties. Format The Art of War is divided into a preface (proemio) and seven books (chapters), which take the form of a series of dialogues that take place in the Orti Oricellari, the gardens built in a classical style by Bernardo Rucellai in the 1490s for Florentine aristocrats and humanists to engage in discussion, between Cosimo Rucellai and \\"Lord Fabrizio Colonna\\" (many feel Colonna is a veiled disguise for Machiavelli himself, but this view has been challenged by scholars such as MansfieldHarvey C. Mansfield, Machiavelli's Virtue, Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1996, (a&b;)194, (c)191 & 196.), with other patrizi and captains of the recent Florentine republic: Zanobi Buondelmonti, Battista della Palla and Luigi Alamanni. The work is dedicated to Lorenzo di Filippo Strozzi, patrizio fiorentino in a preface which ostentatiously pronounces Machiavelli's authorship. After repeated uses of the first person singular to introduce the dialogue, Machiavelli retreats from the work, serving as neither narrator nor interlocutor. Fabrizio is enamored with the Roman Legions of the early to mid Roman Republic and strongly advocates adapting them to the contemporary situation of Renaissance Florence. Fabrizio dominates the discussions with his knowledge, wisdom and insights. The other characters, for the most part, simply yield to his superior knowledge and merely bring up topics, ask him questions or for clarification. These dialogues, then, often become monologues with Fabrizio detailing how an army should be raised, trained, organized, deployed and employed. Background Machiavelli's Art of War echoes many themes, issues, ideas and proposals from his earlier, more widely read works, The Prince and The Discourses. To the contemporary reader, Machiavelli's dialogue may seem impractical and to under-rate the effectiveness of both firearms and cavalry. However, his theories were not merely based on a thorough study and analysis of classical and contemporary military practices. Machiavelli had served for fourteen years as secretary to the Chancery of Florence and \\"personally observed and reported back to his government on the size, composition, weaponry, morale, and logistical capabilities of the most effective militaries of his day.\\"Christopher Lynch, \\"Introduction,\\" in The Art of War trans. Christopher Lynch (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), xiv. However, the native fighting force he assiduously oversaw was struck a catastrophic defeat in Prato in 1512 which led to the downfall of the Florentine republican government. Military strategy and science Machiavelli wrote that war must be expressly defined. He developed the philosophy of \\"limited warfare\\"‚Äîthat is, when diplomacy fails, war is an extension of politics. Art of War also emphasizes the necessity of a state militia and promotes the concept of armed citizenry. He believed that all society, religion, science, and art rested on the security provided by the military.Art of War, Machiavelli, p. 234 Critique However at the time he was writing, firearms, both technologically and tactically, were in their infancy and the overwhelming of enemy missile-armed troops, of artillery even, between salvos, by a charge of pikes and sword and shield men would have been a viable tactic. In addition Machiavelli was not writing in a vacuum; Art of War was written as a practical proposition to the rulers of Florence as an alternative to the unreliable condottieri mercenaries upon which all the Italian city states were reliant. A standing army of the prosperous and pampered citizens that would have formed the cavalry would have been little better. Machiavelli therefore \\"talks up\\" the advantages of a militia of those arms that Florence could realistically muster and equip from her own resources. However, his basic notion of emulating Roman practices was slowly and pragmatically adapted by many later rulers and commanders, most notably Maurice of NassauNiccol√≤ Machiavelli, Art of War, Trans. Ellis Farnesworth. Da Capo press edition, 2001, with introduction by Neal Wood. and Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. They would lay the foundations for the system of linear tactics which would dominate the warfare of Europe and the world until after the Napoleonic Wars. While Machiavelli's influence as a military theorist is often given a back seat to his writings as a political philosopher, that he considered Dell'arte della guerra to be his most important work is clear from his discussions of the military science and soldiery in other works. For example, in The Prince he declares that \\"a prince should have no other object, no any other thought, nor take anything as his art but that of war and its orders and discipline; for that is the only art which is of concern to one who commands.\\"Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince trans. Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. (Chicago: U Chicago Press, 1985), p. 14. In the course of the sixteenth century twenty-one editions appeared and it was translated into French, English, German, and Latin. Montaigne named Machiavelli next to Caesar, Polybius, and Commynes as an authority on military affairs. Although in the seventeenth century changing military methods brought other writers to the fore, Machiavelli was still frequently quoted. In the eighteenth century, the Marshal de Saxe leaned heavily on him when he composed his Reveries upon the Art of War (1757), and Algarotti‚Äîthough without much basis‚Äîsaw in Machiavelli the master who has taught Frederick the Great the tactics by which he astounded Europe. Like most people concerned with military matters, Jefferson had Machiavelli's Art of War in his library, and when the War of 1812 increased American interest in problems of war, The Art of War was brought out in a special American edition.\\"Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age edited by Peter Paret (Princeton University Press, 1986), p. 27. This continued interest in Machiavelli as a military thinker was not only caused by the fame of his name; some of the recommendations made in the Art of War‚Äîthose on training, discipline, and classification, for instance‚Äîgained increasing practical importance in early modern Europe when armies came to be composed of professionals coming from the most different social strata. This does not mean that the progress of military art in the sixteenth century‚Äîin drilling, in dividing an army into distinct units, in planning and organizing campaigns-was due to the influence of Machiavelli. Instead, the military innovators of the time were pleased to find a work in which aspects of their practice were explained and justified. Moreover, in the sixteenth century, with its wide knowledge of ancient literature and its deep respect for classical wisdom, it was commonly held that the Romans owed their military triumphs to their emphasis on discipline and training. Machiavelli's attempt to present Roman military organization as the model for the armies of his time was therefore not regarded as extravagant. At the end of the sixteenth century, for instance, Justus Lipsius, in his influential writings on military affairs, also treated the Roman military order as a permanently valid model. Themes The content and format of The Art of War are strangely at odds. In the opening pages, after Cosimo has described his grandfather's inspiration for gardens in which the conversations are set, Fabrizio declaims that we should imitate ancient warfare rather than ancient art forms. However, the Art of War is a dialogue in the humanist tradition of imitating classical forms. Machiavelli himself appears to have fallen into the trap for which Fabrizio criticizes Bernardo Rucellai. Despite this inherent contradiction, the book lacks much of the cynical tone and humour that is so characteristic of Machiavelli's other works.Mansfield, Harvey C. \\"Machiavelli's Virtue\\" p. 191 and 196.Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, Fortune is a Woman: Gender and Politics in the Thought of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984), 68‚Äì69.

The region is divided into several neighbourhoods, the Central Business District, Eau Claire, Chinatown, East Village, and the West End. There are a number of districts within Downtown Calgary as well, most of them being within the Central Business District. Downtown Calgary is bordered by 14th Street W. on the west, the Bow River and Prince's Island Park on the north, the Elbow River on the east and the CPR mainline tracks on the south. The neighbourhoods of the Beltline and Mission to the immediate south are often considered part of downtown, due to the high concentrations of businesses, high population densities, and occurrence of retail and nightlife opportunities, but strictly speaking they are not technically part of downtown. The population of Calgary's downtown has grown substantially in recent years, growing by several thousand between 2011 and 2016. With the population of the five combined downtown neighbourhoods surpassing 18,000 , Downtown Calgary now has a significantly larger population than that of other Canadian cities of similar size, such as Ottawa and Edmonton.(Census tract number 5050048.00) http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd- pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T;=1601&SR;=51&S;=94&O;=A&RPP;=25&PR;=0&CMA;=505&CSD;=0 While downtown Calgary continues to grow, the Beltline neighbourhood to the immediate south, with a population of 21,958 , is taking up the majority of residential development in inner city Calgary. Calgary Transit's CTrain light rail system runs down 7th Avenue S. through the middle of downtown in an east- west direction, and the ride is free on this section. The future Green Line will run underground through downtown under 2nd Street, in a north-south direction. Neighbourhoods =Commercial core= Calgary's dense business area comprises the bulk of the downtown community. It is a core of skyscrapers. , eight of the ten tallest buildings in western Canada, and a few of the tallest in the country, are in Calgary. It is arguably the densest downtown area of any city of its size in North America. Many of the buildings are connected via an long network of elevated walkways and bridges. The system, known as the \\"+15\\" is the largest of its kind in the world. The area surrounding the Stephen Avenue Walk is Downtown Calgary's primary retail area. Stephen Avenue (8th Avenue SW) is a pedestrian mall lined with historic buildings containing stores, restaurants, cinemas, and drinking establishments. Immediately adjacent to the outdoor portion of Stephen Avenue is an indoor complex of two shopping malls.

The East Village is an area to the east of the Downtown Commercial Core. This area was plagued by crime and homelessness for a long time. However, the area has seen a great amount of redevelopment since the late 2000s. In 2007, the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation began construction on $357 million worth of infrastructure upgrades to the neighbourhood, bringing all streets above flood plain levels, upgrading sewers and storm drains, and building plazas. The neighbourhood has since become a new hot-spot for the downtown area, playing host to the award- winning RiverWalk, several restaurants in the historic Simmons Mattress Factory building, and several new condo towers, with several more under construction.

They are also available with rubberised undersides, as an alternative to bare feet for yoga. Toe socks are designed and available for both men and women, although traditionally targeted toward women.  History  The original concept of toe socks may be attributed to Ethel Russell (also known as Ethel Wynhym) of Pennsylvania. On June 14, 1969, she filed a copyright with the United States Copyright Office for two drawings of footwear which she termed, \\"mitten toe socks\\" and \\"glove socks\\".

Toe socks became popular in the United States during the 1970s and made a comeback in the 1990s as a novelty item worn by adolescents. During the 1970s, it was fashionable for girls to wear clogs or buffalo sandals with toe socks. In colder weather, they may be worn with flip- flops. During this time, such socks were typically knee high in length with bright stripes and glittery threads in their design. They also had a practical value in keeping the feet warm, including the spots between the toes. Sandra Magnus in toe socks (STS-135). By 2004, toe socks were available in plain colors and being adopted as normal footwear. They have even been worn in outer space ‚Äì notably by astronaut Sandra Magnus on the International Space Station during the STS-135 mission in 2011.  Variants  Japanese tabi socks One of the earliest variants of toe socks is the Japanese tabi, dating back to the 16th Century. These are split-toed socks with two compartments ‚Äì one smaller compartment for the big toe, and a larger compartment for the four remaining toes. This allows them to be worn with Z≈çri or geta sandals. Modern variants of toe socks are designed primarily for either comfort or athletics. In 2004, a patent was filed with the Intellectual Property Office in the United Kingdom for a product called \\"toe socks\\"; however, their description differs: \\"A half sock which covers the toes to provide comfort under footwear. Preferably the socks are unseen when worn with mules or slingback shoes.\\" Variants have also evolved to include compression socks and other specialty performance models for professional sports as well as uses which require high durability. In sports, athletic versions of toe socks may be useful to triathletes who suffer from frequent interdigital friction blisters. One version of sock referred to as \\"toe socks\\" is actually a reverse version ‚Äì this is a covering for the foot and ankle with the toes cut out, leaving them bare.

(KFBC/KGB was an amateur station that was not full-time.) In 1928, the station was facing bankruptcy, so it was sold to Thomas Sharp (who founded Sharp Health Care in San Diego). In 1931 KFSD became an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network. In 1939 KFSD was slated to move from the U.S. Grant to a former country club east of downtown called \\"Emerald Hills\\". But the station did not move until 1948 due to the proximity of Emerald Hills to the Chollas Naval towers. In 1948, when KFSD moved to Emerald Hills, the facility was outfitted with the finest equipment available, primarily from RCA. Emerald Hills was built to completely house the KFSD studios, transmitter, and offices. From Emerald Hills, San Diego's first FM station signed on the air in 1948: KFSD-FM. In 1953, KFSD-TV (now KGTV, and not directly related to today's KFSD) became the second TV station to sign on the air in San Diego, at channel 10 on the VHF band. In 1961, 600 KFSD was changing formats, so it was decided to change the call letters. The owners at the time fed facts about San Diego and its people into a new device called a computer, which was then asked to give them the perfect call letters for the station. The computer gave them the call letters KOGO. Thus, in 1961 the legendary San Diego station known as KOGO was born. In 1972, Time Life Broadcasting (owners of KFSD, KOGO since 1961) sold the combo, but due to FCC regulations at the time the stations had to be split off. 600 KOGO was sold to Retlaw (Walter spelled backwards) which was Disney's Broadcast division. Channel 10 was sold to McGraw Hill Publishing and the call letters were changed to KGTV (which stands for KOGO-TV). The station at 94.1 FM got back the callsign KFSD, but was sold many times over; it was primarily a classical music station. The FM outlet changed callsigns to KFSD, then KXGL (for the Eagle), then to KJQY (for KJOY), and finally to KMYI. The AM station was changed to KOGO Radio 60, then to KOGO Radio 6, then to KOGO Radio 6, the radio magazine. The Shadacks (Ed and his nephew Tom) took over KOGO and 106.5 KPRI, and ran both of the stations into the ground by 1982. In 1983 both stations changed calls to KLZZ-AM-FM (went under the name \\"Class FM/AM\\"). KLZZ flopped, and that is when Edens Broadcasting bought the stations and turned both of them into CHR stations Q-106 (KKLQ-AM-FM). In the early 1990s, Par Broadcasting purchased the stations and ended the simulcast, flipping the AM station to a talk format on April 25, 1994. Par bought back the call letters KOGO for 600. The KOGO callsign, during the hiatus, was used in Ventura, California on the 1590 AM frequency (now KVTA). At that time, 1590 was owned by Jack Woods (formerly Charlie of Charlie and Harrigan on KFMB and KCBQ). In 1997, Par Broadcasting sold its San Diego stations to Jacor/Citicasters, who in turn merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 1999. KOGO was reunited with its original FM sister in 1998 when Jacor/Citicasters purchased the radio properties of Nationwide Communications. As of 2018, Emerald Hills is still the home of the KOGO transmitter and its two-tower directional array. The KOGO towers are twin 410-foot self-supported Ideco towers. The original 1948 RCA BTA-5F 5 kilowatt transmitter is still in place but no longer used; it is being acquired by a private collector. The BTA-5F was designed by John Vassos, the father of American art deco design; the 5F was named \\"The Train\\" by Vassos, as it looked like a train speeding by. Most of the others have either been destroyed, partially scrapped, or put into private collections. The 1170 KCBQ BTA-5F was scrapped and most of the parts given to KOGO; the pieces of KCBQ's transmitter are still at KOGO for the BTA-5F. There are three remaining complete RCA BTA-5F's: KRKD/KIIS (Brad Hollander collection), WFIL (Mike Dorrough collection), and WIBW Topeka. KOGO programming began simulcasting on KUSS on November 7, 2011. This simulcast ended on November 16, 2012 at 7:00 pm, when KOGO-FM began airing a stunt of Christmas music. This was most likely due to the fact that, unlike many other talk radio stations in the United States that simulcast programming on the FM dial, the FM simulcast never improved KOGO's ratings. On October 14, 2014, KOGO added three news blocks to its program schedule. Sports KOGO was the co-flagship station of the San Diego Fleet of the now-defunct Alliance of American Football alongside KLSD. The AAF did not complete its inaugural 2019 season. Until 2012‚Äì2013, KOGO was the official broadcast home for the San Diego State Aztecs basketball and football programs. However, some basketball games were transferred to KLSD if the football team was also playing at the same time, or if it is a weekday early-evening game on the West Coast. As of the 2013‚Äì2014 season, Aztec football and basketball games now air on The Mighty 1090. KOGO carried San Diego Padres games from the team's debut in the National League in 1969 through 1978, then again in the early 2000s (decade), before losing the rights to XEPRS-AM in 2003. KOGO was also the radio home of the San Diego Chargers in the early 1980s. Ted Leitner handled play-by-play with Pat Curran in the booth. Pre and post game show duties were handled by Randy Hahn and Jim Laslavic. The games were eventually simulcast on KLZZ 106.5 FM. In 1985, XETRA took away the broadcast rights and Leitner was replaced by Lee Hamilton, who had come in from Phoenix. California wildfires During the California wildfires of October 2007, news, information, and talk from KOGO was simulcast on every San Diego-area station owned by Clear Channel from the night of October 21 to the evening of October 24. KOGO dropped all commercial breaks during this period. KOGO was also simulcast on Channel 24/7 of XM Satellite Radio, which the service uses for emergency information. Non- fire programming returned on the night of October 24 at 11 p.m. with the syndicated Coast to Coast with George Noory. News In May 2009, KOGO's newscasts outside of morning and early evening were being produced by Los Angeles sister station KFI. It was also disclosed that some newscasts in the evening were \\"taped\\".

The film, directed by Shaun Peterson, made its world premiere at the Austin Film Festival in 2001, and has spent several years playing festivals and special engagements. The cast includes Ian McConnel, screenwriter Connor Ratliff, and veteran character actor Holmes Osborne (Donnie Darko, Affliction, That Thing You Do!). Plot Living In Missouri is a Comedy Of Manners which tells the story of Ryan, Amy, and Todd, whose humdrum Midwestern lives are starting to come apart at the seams. Personal betrayals abound when childhood friendships, broken-down marriages, and long-repressed desires come into conflict over the course of one tumultuous Missouri autumn. Ryan and Todd have been best friends since the 7th grade, and time has not been kind to either of them. Ryan is now married to Amy, with two young children and a 9-to-5 job he hates. The sexually frustrated Todd still lives in the basement of his parents' house, works in a video store, and secretly envies Ryan's married life. Meanwhile, Amy is stuck in the middle, balancing career and family with almost no help from Ryan, whose selfish behavior is quickly destroying what's left of their marriage. When Amy secretly turns to Todd for a shoulder to cry on, the two of them begin meeting regularly to discuss her marital woes. Todd misinterprets Amy's attention for love, and believes that they are actually \\"having an affair,\\" which leads to a series of painful misunderstandings, ending in disaster. Living In Missouri is a challenging, darkly comic film, shot on location in Missouri and Kansas. Boasting a colorful cast of supporting characters, the film veers from dark humor to intense drama, at each turn authentically capturing the bizarre spirit of the Suburban Midwest. Production =Writing= Living In Missouri was written while Connor Ratliff was actually living in Great Britain, where he was an acting student at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. The screenplay was developed using some unorthodox strategies: during the writing process, the main characters of Ryan, Todd, and Amy actually had ‚Äúreal‚Äù identities on the Internet. In early 1998, Ratliff created a website, Ryan Johnson's Star Wars Prequel Rumors, which featured journal entries from the fictional Ryan, who described his day- to-day activities and often wrote at length about his wife and best friend. The site also contained often-erroneous predictions and rumors relating to the world of science fiction movies. The site attracted thousands of curious and often irate sci-fi fans who often took issue with ‚ÄúRyan‚Äù and his renegade brand of web journalism. In a bizarre turn of events, several media outlets were fooled by the site, and many of Ryan‚Äôs rumors began to appear in print, most prominently in SPIN magazine. Ratliff used the website as a kind of ‚Äúcharacter workshop‚Äù to help develop the characters while fleshing out the screenplay, and several key events in the film first appeared as entries in Ryan‚Äôs web journal. When the first draft of the screenplay was completed, he contacted director Shaun Peterson, whom he had been friends with since high school. Peterson put his own self-penned project, Climax, Kansas, on hold to helm Living In Missouri. =Filming= In October 1999, Peterson and Ratliff left their respective homes in L.A. and London, and met in the American Midwest to prepare for the imminent shoot. The last feature film made in Jefferson City, Missouri, was 1961‚Äôs Hoodlum Priest (directed by a young Irvin Kershner), so the creative team was dealing with a community that was not accustomed to dealing with the rigors of independent movie-making. For five weeks, the crew remained in one small, furnished house that served as living quarters, production office, and a primary location for the movie. There were the usual problems associated with low-budget cinema‚Äîa frenzied shooting schedule, unforeseen technical glitches, sheer physical exhaustion‚Äîand a few cases of bad luck. With several key scenes to be filmed in ‚ÄúRyan and Amy‚Äôs house,‚Äù the crew returned one day to find all of the dining room furniture had suddenly disappeared. It turns out that while the filmmakers were out on location, the landlords had entered the premises to remove some of their belongings, leaving an empty space in the middle of Ryan and Amy‚Äôs living room area. Panic ensued, and the remaining scenes had to be cleverly re-imagined in order to avoid massive continuity errors. On the whole, however, local businesses and townspeople were curious and helpful, if somewhat bewildered by the scope of the enterprise. Aside from the occasional visit from a local hoping to land a speaking role, most people remained distant and allowed filming to go on without interference. Throughout the shoot, the weather remained consistent, if unexpectedly sunny for the middle of November. Filming wrapped in early December, just days before a storm front moved in, bringing heavy snowfall. =Editing= When Ratliff returned to England shortly after filming, Peterson was left to finish the film with minimal resources and almost no money. Arriving in L.A. with 40 hours of footage, Peterson began to assemble the film using a home computer system. While new technology allowed the feature to be completed without the pressure of a high-priced editing suite, Peterson and editor Ford were faced with technical challenges dealing with bugs in the system. Simple tasks often took days as they dealt with malfunctioning software. After months of problem solving, the film finally began to take shape, developing into a drama, mixing dark comedy with scenes of sadness. Release Living In Missouri was an Official Selection at the 2001 Austin Film Festival, where it was one of only 11 films in competition and was also chosen to be the subject of a panel discussion with cast & crew. The AFF is the first festival to focus on the contribution of the screenwriter, and 2001's honorees were Lawrence Kasdan (writer/director of Grand Canyon, Mumford, The Big Chill; writer of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back and Gary David Goldberg Family Ties, Brooklyn Bridge). The panel discussion drew a curious and appreciative crowd that was particularly interested in learning more about the process of making a low- budget feature film in the era of digital video. Cast and crew members shared anecdotes about the shooting process, and gave provided a little bit of technical advice for any prospective filmmakers thinking about how to get started. The Q&A; was followed by a blitz of publicity stunts‚Äîtravelling concession stands offering FREE SNOWCONES served by the \\"real\\" characters from the film, FREE DONUTS in the morning, and free Living In Missouri trading cards were given to everyone who attended the screenings. The stunts caught people's attention, and sparked a range of reactions‚Äîone Hollywood producer called the campaign \\"ingenious,\\" while the security officers at the Omni hotel dubbed it \\"a public disturbance\\" and ordered the unauthorized snow cone stand removed from the lobby immediately. Following the two successful Austin screenings, the film played at two other festivals in the same month: the Seattle Underground Film Festival, where it won BEST FEATURE FILM, and the Ashland Independent Film Festival, where it won the award for BEST ACTING ENSEMBLE. It went on to win a total of 10 awards at festivals in San Francisco, New York, L.A., Rhode Island, and Kansas City.

Its members exercised political power in the Bernese city-state in the 16th and 17th century. Its most prominent member was the writer Albert Bitzius, known as Jeremias Gotthelf. The family was established in Bern by Theodor Bitzius, probably a native of Lausanne, who became a citizen of Bern in 1522. The name is probably derived from Sulpitius. His son Theodor Bitzius (1534‚Äì1598) became a member of the state government (Kleiner Rat) in 1584; his many children established all subsequent branches of the family. The Bitziuses held senior legislative and governmental offices such as Landvogt or Schultheiss up until the first half of the 17th century. The last Bitzius to hold such offices was Abraham Bitzius (1614‚Äì1669). In the second half of the 17th century, the Bitzius family lost its patrician privileges (Regimentsf√§higkeit). Many of its members became engaged in crafts and trades such as goldsmithing, and served as clergy. Albert Bitzius (1797‚Äì1854), who published as Jeremias Gotthelf, belonged to the fourth generation of Bitzius pastors. Other notable family members included Gotthelf's wife Henriette Bitzius-Zeender (1805‚Äì1872), their son Albert Bitzius (1835‚Äì1882, a leading liberal politician and pastor), and their daughter Henriette R√ºetschi-Bitzius (1834‚Äì1890, a writer).

The religion had its background in two earlier movements in the nineteenth century, Shaykhism and B√°bism. Shaykhism centred on theosophical doctrines and many Shaykhis expected the return of the hidden Twelfth Imam. Many Shaykhis joined the messianic B√°b√≠ movement in the 1840s where the B√°b proclaimed himself to be the return of the hidden Imam. As the B√°b√≠ movement spread in Iran, violence broke out between the ruling Shi ªa Muslim government and the B√°b√≠s, and ebbed when government troops massacred them, and executed the B√°b in 1850. The B√°b had spoken of another messianic figure, He whom God shall make manifest. As one of the followers of the B√°b, Bah√° ºu'll√°h was imprisoned during a subsequent wave of massacre by the Persian government against B√°b√≠s in 1852, was exiled to Iraq, and then to Constantinople and Adrianople in the Ottoman Empire. Amidst these banishments, in 1863 in Baghdad, Bah√° ºu'll√°h claimed to be the messianic figure expected by the B√°b's writings. Bah√° º√≠s consider the Baha'i religion to start from Bah√° ºu'll√°h's statements in 1863. At the time of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's death the tradition was mostly confined to the Persian and Ottoman empires, at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa. Leadership of the religion then passed on to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's son, who was appointed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and was accepted by almost all Bah√° º√≠s. Under the leadership of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution. After the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 1921, the leadership of the Bah√° º√≠ community was passed on to his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, who was appointed in  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will. The document appointed Shoghi Effendi as the first Guardian, and called for the election of the Universal House of Justice once the Bah√° º√≠ Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful. During Shoghi Effendi's time as leader of the religion there was a great increase in the number of Baha'is, and he presided over the election of many National Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, and because he was childless he had found it impossible to appoint another Guardian after himself to succeed him. In 1963 the Universal House of Justice was elected. Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion. See Bah√° º√≠ Faith by country for further information per country. Shaykhi movement In Islam, the Mahdi is a messianic figure who is believed to be a descendant of Muhammad who will return near the end of time to restore the world and the religion of God. While both Sunni and Shi ªa groups believe in the Mahdi, the largest Shi ªa group, the Twelvers, believe that the Mahdi is the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al- Mahdi, who is believed to have gone into occultation since 874 CE. In the Twelver view the Twelfth Imam first went into a \\"Minor Occultation\\" between 874 and 941 CE where the Hidden Imam still communicated with the community through four official intermediaries. The \\"Greater Occultation\\" is then defined from the time when the Hidden Imam ceased to communicate regularly until the time when he returns to restore the world. =Shaykh Ahmad al- Ahs√°'√≠= The Shaykhi movement was a school of theology within Twelver Shi ªa Islam that was started through the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahs√°'√≠. Shaykh Ahmad's teachings included that the Imams were spiritual beings and thus, in contrast to the widespread Shi ªa belief, that the Imams existed within spiritual bodies, and not material bodies. He also taught that there must always exist the \\"Perfect Shi ªa\\" who serves as an intermediary between the Imams and the believers, and is the one who can visualize the consciousness of the Hidden Imam. In 1822 he left Iran and went to Iraq due to the controversy that his teachings had brought. There he also found himself at the centre of debate, thus deciding to move to Mecca, he died in 1826 on his way there. =Siyyid K√°zim-i-Rasht√≠= Before the death of Shaykh Ahmad, he appointed Siyyid K√°zim of Rasht to lead the Shaykh√≠ movement, which he did until his death in 1843. Siyyid K√°zim formulated many of the thoughts that were ambiguously expressed by Shaykh Ahmad including the doctrine of salvation history and the cycles of revelation. His teaching brought a sense of millenarian hope among the Shaykhis that the Hidden Imam may return. Siyyid Kazim did not leave a successor, but before his death in December, 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi, who according to his prophecies would soon appear. B√°b Shrine of the B√°b in Haifa, Israel Siyyid  ªAl√≠-Muhammad, who later took on the title the B√°b, was born on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz to a merchant of the city; his father died while he was quite young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle ·∏§√°j√≠ M√≠rz√° Siyyid  ªAl√≠, who was also a merchant. In May 1844 the B√°b proclaimed to Mulla Husayn, one of the Shaykhis, to be the one whose coming was prophesied by Shaykh Ahmad and Siyyid K√°zim and the bearer of divine knowledge. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Siyyid K√°·∫ìim had recognized the B√°b as a Manifestation of God. These eighteen disciples were later known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq. The B√°b initially attracted most of the followers of the Shaykh√≠ movement, but soon his teachings went far beyond those roots and attracted prominent followers across Iran. His followers were known as B√°b√≠s. The first accounts in the West of events related to the history of the B√°b and his followers appears January 8, 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports not published in the newspapers. This was an account of the first Letter of the Living to be dispatched from the presence of the B√°b - the second Letter of the Living and first Babi martyr, Mull√°  ªAl√≠-i-Bast√°m√≠. The British diplomat who recorded these events was Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, then Ambassador to Istanbul, and it included an enclosure from the Governor of Kirm√°nsh√°h protesting the arrest in Ottoman lands of a Persian mull√°. Follow-up exchanges continued from January into April where diplomatic records of events end. Ottoman state archives affirm his arrival in Istanbul where he is then sentenced to serve in the naval ship yards at hard labor - the Ottoman ruler refusing to banishment him as it would be \\"difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas.\\" The first public account was published Nov 1, 1845 in the London Times. It was centered on events in Shiraz when the last Letter of the Living, Qudd√∫s returned after traveling with the B√°b. The story was also carried from Nov 15 by the Literary Gazette which was subsequently echoed widely in other countries. After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the B√°b's arrest. After being under house arrest in Shiraz from June 1845 to September 1846, the B√°b spent several months in Isfahan debating clergy, many of whom became sympathetic.Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal, 257. Among the most unexpected of those who embraced the Cause of the B√°b was a brilliant theologian who bore the title of Vahid‚Äîmeaning ‚Äúunique‚Äù. A trusted advisor to the Shah, Vahid had been sent to interrogate the B√°b on behalf of the king, who wished to secure reliable firsthand information about the movement that was sweeping his land. Upon learning of Vahid's conversion, the Shah called for the B√°b to be brought to Tehran. The Prime Minister‚Äîfearing that his own position might be fatally undermined should the Shah also fall under the B√°b‚Äôs influence‚Äîhalted the B√°b‚Äôs escort outside Tehran, then ordered instead that he be imprisoned in the remote fortress of M√°h-K√∫, near the Turkish border. The excuse given to the Shah was that the B√°b‚Äôs arrival in the capital might lead to great public distress and disorder. During the B√°b‚Äôs incarceration in the fortress of M√°h- K√∫ in the province of Azarbaijan close to the Turkish border, he began his most important work, the Persian Bay√°n, which he never finished. He was then transferred to the fortress of Chihr√≠q in April 1848. In that place as well, the B√°b's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. Hence the Prime Minister ordered the B√°b back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the B√°b on trial for blasphemy and apostasy. B√°bism was also spreading across the country, and the Islamic government saw it as a threat to state religion, even going so far as to send military forces against the B√°b√≠s. Communities of B√°b√≠s established themselves in Iran and Ir√°q, and in 1850 reached several cities of Azarbaijan. Coverage in newspapers in the West reoccurred in 1849 including in the French journal Revue de l'Orient. In the fall of 1850 newspaper coverage fell behind quickly unfolding events. Though the B√°b was named for the first time he had in fact already been executed. In mid-1850 a new Prime Minister, Amir Kabir, ordered the execution of the B√°b, probably because various B√°b√≠ insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The B√°b was brought back to Tabr√≠z from Chihr√≠q, so that he could be shot by a firing squad. On the morning of July 9, 1850, the B√°b was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch. The B√°b and a companion (a young man named Anis) were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot. After the order was given to shoot and the smoke cleared, the B√°b was no longer in the courtyard and Anis stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall.Numerous eye- witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result. Sir Justin Shiel, Queen Victoria's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, wrote to Lord Palmerston, the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on July 22, 1850 regarding the execution. The letter, can be found in its original form as document F.O. 60/152/88 in the archives of the Foreign Office at the Public Records Office in London. The soldiers subsequently found the B√°b in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed. He was tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the B√°b and his companion were killed. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals. The remains, however, were rescued by a handful of B√°bis and were hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported by way of Isfahan, Kirmansh√°h, Baghdad and Damascus, to Beirut and thence by sea to Acre, Israel on the plain below Mount Carmel in 1899. In 1909, the remains were finally interred in a special tomb, erected for this purpose by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land in Haifa, Israel. The Shrine of the B√°b remains an important place of pilgrimage for Bah√° º√≠s. The Shrine is a protected site and in 2008 was listed on UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. While the B√°b claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation. A constant theme in his works, especially the Persian Bayan was that of the great Promised One, the next embodiment of the Primal Will, whom the B√°b termed He whom God shall make manifest, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth. The B√°b's writings have an emphasis on recognizing a future prophet, \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\", when he arrives. Before his death, the B√°b had been in correspondence with two brothers, Bah√° ºu'll√°h and Subh-i-Azal who, after the death of many prominent disciples, emerged as the mostly likely leaders. In a letter sent to Subh-i- Azal, then aged around nineteen, the B√°b appears to have indicated a high station or leadership position. The letter also orders Subh-i-Azal to obey the Promised One when he appears; in practise, Subh-i-Azal, however, seems to have had little widespread legitimacy and authority. Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the meantime, while in private hinted at his own high station, in public kept his messianic secret from most and supported Subh-i-Azal in the interest of unity. In 1863 in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of B√°b√≠s as \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\" and his followers began calling themselves Bah√° º√≠s. Bah√° ºu'll√°h Bah√° ºu'll√°h was born on November 12, 1817, in Tehran. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's father was entitled M√≠rz√° Buzurg while he served as vizier to Im√°m-Virdi M√≠rz√°, the twelfth son of Fat‚Ä≤h Ali Shah Qajar. M√≠rz√° Buzurg was later appointed governor of Burujird and Lorestan, a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when Muhammad Shah came to power. After his father died, Bah√° ºu'll√°h was asked to take a government post by the new vizier Haji Mirza Aqasi, but he declined the position. At the age of 28, Bah√° ºu'll√°h received a messenger, Mull√° Husayn, telling him of the B√°b, whose message he accepted, becoming a B√°b√≠. Bah√° ºu'll√°h began to spread the new cause, especially in his native province of N√∫r, becoming recognized as one of its most influential believers. The accompanying government suppression of the B√°b's religion resulted in Bah√° ºu'll√°h's being imprisoned twice and enduring bastinado torture once. Bah√° ºu'll√°h also attended the Conference of Badasht, where 81 prominent Babis met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Babis who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the B√°b's message began a new dispensation, Bah√° ºu'll√°h took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. In 1852, two years after the execution of the B√°b, the B√°b√≠s were polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against the Shah, Nasser-al-Din Shah while the other, under the leadership of Baha ºu'll√°h, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Bab√≠ cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living. The militant group of Babis was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total Babi population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a \\"Husayn Jan\\", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group. Bah√° ºu'll√°h met briefly with a couple of the radical Babi leaders and learned of an assassination plan. He condemned the plan, but was soon asked to leave Tehran by the authorities. In the vacuum of leadership on August 15, 1852 about 3 Babis attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire B√°b√≠ community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand B√°b√≠s followed. Amidst the general violence some B√°b√≠s were imprisoned in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l (Black Pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran. According to Bah√° ºu'll√°h, perhaps the lone survivor, it was during his imprisonment in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a Maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a Messenger of God and as the One whose coming the B√°b had prophesied. Map of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's banishments The government later found Bah√° ºu'll√°h innocent of complicity in the assassination plot, and he was released from the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l, but the government exiled him from Iran. Bah√° ºu'll√°h chose to go to Iraq in the Ottoman Empire and arrived in Baghdad in early 1853. A small number of Babis, including his half-brother Subh-i-Azal, followed Bah√° ºu'll√°h to Baghdad. An increasing number of B√°b√≠s considered Baghdad the new centre for leadership of the B√°b√≠ religion, and a flow of pilgrims started coming there from Persia. In Baghdad people began to look to Subh-i-Azal for leadership less and less due to his policy of remaining hidden, and instead saw Bah√° ºu'll√°h as their leader. Subh-i-Azal started to try to discredit Bah√° ºu'll√°h and further divided the community. The actions of Subh-i-Azal drove many people away from the religion and allowed its enemies to continue their persecution. On April 10, 1854 Bah√° ºu'll√°h left Baghdad in order to distance himself from Subh-i- Azal and as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the Babi community; he left with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, north- east of Baghdad, near the city Sulaymaniyah. For two years Bah√° ºu'll√°h lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan living the life of a Sufi dervish. At one point someone noticed his remarkable penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. During his time in Kurdistan he wrote many notable books including the Four Valleys. In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Subh-i-Azal, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family, thus searched for Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and pleaded with him to come back to Baghdad, which he did in 1856. Bah√° ºu'll√°h remained in Baghd√°d for seven more years. During this time, while keeping his perceived station as the Manifestation of God hidden, he taught the B√°b's teachings. He published many books and verses including the Book of Certitude and the Hidden Words. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's gatherings attracted many notables, both locals and Iranian pilgrims, giving him greater influence in Baghdad and in Iran. His rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian B√°b√≠ community gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. They were eventually successful in having the Ottoman government call Bah√° ºu'll√°h from Baghdad to Constantinople. Before he left Baghdad on the way to Constantinople, Bah√° ºu'll√°h camped for twelve days in the Garden of Ridv√°n near Baghdad starting on April 22, 1863. During his stay in the garden a large number of friends came to see him before he left. It was during his time in the Garden of Ridv√°n that Bah√° ºu'll√°h declared to his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God. Today Bah√° º√≠s celebrate the twelve days that Bah√° ºu'll√°h was in the Garden of Ridv√°n as the festival of Ridv√°n. After travelling for four-month over land, Bah√° ºu'll√°h arrived in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (now Istanbul). Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from Baghdad was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually the penal colony of Akk√°, Ottomon Empire's Palestine (now Acre, Israel). Bah√° ºu'll√°h and his family, along with a small group of B√°b√≠s, stayed in Constantinople for only four months. Due to his refusal to build alliances with the Ottoman politicians, Bah√° ºu'll√°h had no means of resisting pressure from the Iranian ambassador to exile him further away, and Sultan Abd√ºl√¢ziz banished Bah√° ºu'll√°h to Adrianople (current-day Edirne), which was a site for the exile of political prisoners.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in Adrianople with his brothers and companions of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. During the month of December 1863, Bah√° ºu'll√°h and his family embarked on a twelve-day journey to Adrianople. Bah√° ºu'll√°h stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years. In Adrianople Bah√° ºu'll√°h made his claim to be Him whom God shall make manifest more public through letters and tablets. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's assertion as an independent Manifestation of God made Subh-i-Azal's leadership position irrelevant; Subh-i-Azal, upon hearing Bah√° ºu'll√°h's words in a tablet read to him, challenging him to accept Bah√° ºu'll√°h's revelation, refused and challenged Bah√° ºu'll√°h to a test of divine will at a local mosque, but he lost face when he did not appear. This caused a break within the B√°b√≠ community, and the followers of Bah√° ºu'll√°h became known as Bah√° º√≠s, while the followers of Subh-i-Azal became known as Azalis. Starting in 1866, while in Adrianople, Bah√° ºu'll√°h started writing a series of letters to world rulers, proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions. His letters also asked them to renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Some of these leaders written to in the coming years include Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III of France, Czar Alexander II of Russia, Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland, N√°siri ºd-D√≠n Sh√°h of the Persian Empire and the rulers of America. Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h The disagreements between the Bah√° º√≠s and the Azal√≠s allowed the Ottoman and Persian authorities to exile Bah√° ºu'll√°h once again. Bah√° ºu'll√°h and his family left Adrianople on August 12, 1868 and after a journey by land and sea arrived in Acre on August 31. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions on, and held very trying times for, Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Mirz√° Mihd√≠, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after Sultan  ªAbdu'l- ªAziz's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bah√° ºu'll√°h lived in the house of Mazra'ih. The final years of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's life were spent in the Mansion of Bahj√≠, just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in Acre and Bahj√≠, Bah√° ºu'll√°h produced many volumes of work including the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas. On May 9, 1892 Bah√° ºu'll√°h contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on May 29, 1892. He was buried in a Shrine located next to the Mansion of Bahj√≠ in Israel. During his lifetime, communities of Bah√° º√≠s were established in Armenia, Burma, Egypt, Georgia, India, Lebanon, (what is now) Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° Bah√° ºu'll√°h was succeeded by his eldest son,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Designated as the \\"Center of the Covenant\\" and Head of the Faith, Bah√° ºu'll√°h designated him in his will as the sole authoritative interpreter of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writings.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment. This imprisonment continued until  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s own release as a result of the \\"Young Turk\\" revolution in 1908. The remains of the B√°b were buried on March 21, 1909 in a six-room mausoleum made of local stone. Following his release he led a life of travelling and speaking especially 1910‚Äì1913, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° died in Haifa on November 28, 1921 and is now buried in one of the front rooms in the Shrine of the B√°b, in Haifa, Israel. During his lifetime communities of Bah√° º√≠s formed in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United States of America. Shoghi Effendi  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Will and Testament is the charter of the Bah√° º√≠ administrative order. In this document  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° established the institutions of the appointed Guardianship and the elected Universal House of Justice. In that same document he appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as the first Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated the sacred writings of the Faith; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bah√° º√≠ community; developed the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the Faith, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice. Custodians With the unexpected passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the faith was left without a clear candidate for Guardian. The Hands of the Cause, appointed by Shoghi Effendi, took the necessary administrative roles at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, and organized the election of the Universal House of Justice, from which they excluded themselves from membership. By the time of the election of the Universal House of Justice, Bah√° º√≠ communities had been established in many of the countries of the world. Seventy nations had organized their communities to elect National Spiritual Assemblies. Universal House of Justice After the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, it then ruled that given the unique situation and the provisions of the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, it was not possible to appoint another Guardian. The Universal House of Justice today remains the supreme governing body of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and its nine members are elected every five years. As recently as 2001 the number of countries with organized communities electing National Spiritual Assemblies was 182.Baha'i World Statistics 2001 by Baha'i World Center Department of Statistics, 2001-08The Life of Shoghi Effendi by Helen Danesh, John Danesh and Amelia Danesh, Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi, edited by M.

Cloughjordan, officially Cloghjordan ( , ), is a town in County Tipperary in Ireland. It is in the barony of Ormond Lower, and it is also a parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe.Parishes of Killaloe Diocese. The town is situated in the north-western part of Tipperary close to the Offaly border. It is almost equidistant from Nenagh, Roscrea and Birr and is close to Ireland's largest river, the Shannon, and Lough Derg. Poet and patriot Thomas MacDonagh, a native of Cloughjordan, described it as a place \\"in calm of middle country\\". Unusually for a town of its size (the 2002 Census Records places the population at 431), it has three churches ‚Äì Roman Catholic (SS Michael and John's, built in 1898), Church of Ireland (St Kieran's, 1837) and Methodist (1875). Cloughjordan is in the D√°il constituency of Offaly which incorporates 24 electoral divisions that were previously in the Tipperary North D√°il constituency. History Developed at the intersection of travel routes between Nenagh, Birr, Borrisokane and Moneygall, the village of Cloughjordan began as an inhabited settlement during the Norman lordship of Ireland of the 13th and 14th centuries when the De Marisco family were allotted land in Ormond under the overlordship of the Butlers by King Henry II. One unit of the De Mariscos (Morris or Morrissey in modern terms) moved into this area, took over the territory and built a stone castle and manor house guarded by a moat surrounding the dwelling. There is a story which relates that the first De Marisco, who resided here, was a Norman knight who had travelled to the Holy Land to take part in a Crusade against the Saracens. He is said to have brought back a stone from the River Jordan which he built in over the doorway of this castle and it was from that stone that the village got its name ‚Äì the Stone of Jordan ‚Äì Clogh Shi√∫rd√°in ‚Äì Cloughjordan. Cloughjordan was further developed in the late 17th century by Cromwellian grantees when Colonel John Harrison, an officer in Cromwell's army, was granted an estate of of land around Cloughjordan in payment for his military services. Harrison built a house, now known as Cloughjordan House, at the site of the original Norman Castle of De Marisco and incorporated the old castle into the new building, in which one wall of the castle, about seven and a half feet thick (2.2 m), is still in existence to this day. Cloughjordan was then remodelled in the late 18th century to include a square in front of the Church of Ireland on the east-west main street. In 1909 Cloughjordan was one of the first villages in Ireland, after Carlow and Birr, to provide its own rural electrification scheme. The ESB took over the supplying of electricity to the town in 1948. Renewing connection with Jordan In October 2019, several hundred people gathered in Cloghjordan, to celebrate the revealing of a piece of public art to mark the 800-year old connection between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the village of Cloghjordan. The piece of art known as \\"The Friendship Stone\\" was sourced by the Government of the Kingdom of Jordan and presented to the people of Cloughjordan by the Jordanian Irish Association. A group of residents from Cloghjordan then travelled to Jordan to experience the local culture and visit several historical sites. The group was entertained at the Irish Embassy in Amman.https://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/roundup/articles/2019/10/04/4180507-friendship- stone-art-piece-unveiled-in-cloughjordan/ Transport Cloughjordan railway station opened on 5 October 1863. It is on the Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy railway line, at Ballybrophy it joins the main Dublin-Cork railway line, rail services are provided by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. A January 2012 national newspaper article suggested that Iarnr√≥d √âireann was expected to seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line however an enhanced timetable was in force on a trial basis during 2012. The service was again reduced from February 2013. The station is very likely to close down in 2018 with the closure of the Limerick to Ballybrophy line as the demand for the service is very low and the line is unviable. In such a case the rail service will be replaced with a bus service Ken Daly Bus Hire operates limited minibus services between Cloughjordan and Birr, Nenagh and Roscrea. Each return service operates once every week. Local Link Tipperary operates bus service No. 854 between Roscrea railway station and Nenagh which stops at Templemore Road, Cloughjordan. The service operates seven days a week and also links Cloughjordan to neighbouring communities of Shinrone, Moneygall and Toomevara. https://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/roundup/articles/2019/09/19/4179895-new- daily-services-from-local-link/http://locallinktipperary.ie/2019/09/17/local- link-tipperary-announces-2-new-daily-bus- services/http://locallinktipperary.ie/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/854-timetable.jpg Education Historically, Cloughjordan National School opened in 1876. Its first teachers were Joseph and Mary Louise MacDonagh, parents of Thomas MacDonagh, succeeded by Denis Costello, father of Michael Joe Costello. Nowadays, Cloughjordan children have cr√®che and primary schooling but as yet no secondary school in the town. First Steps childcare centre opened in 2010 offering cr√®che and preschool facilities in the former Macra na Feirme hall on Lower Main Street. Kilruane has a Montessori pre-school. There are two primary schools in Cloughjordan: Number One School is located on Templemore Road, east of the town centrehttp://www.cloughjordan.ie/primary1/index.htm and Number Two School is located on Lower Main Street, west of the town centre. There is no secondary education provision in the town: local students travel to schools in neighbouring Nenagh, Borrisokane and Birr or further afield. Eco Village  The eco-village has a working group known as the Village Education Research and Training (VERT), which is committed to running courses based in the eco- village encouraging best practice in sustainable living. Also with a base in the eco-village is Cultivate, an organisation committed to sustainable living and learning. Sport and Leisure Kilruane MacDonagh's GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Cloughjordan also has a soccer club that competes in the North Tipperary & District League. Cloughjordan is on the route of the Ormond Way part of the Beara-Breifne Way, a long distance walking and cycling trail between the Beara Peninsula in County Cork and Blacklion in County Cavan. A free 5km Parkrun takes place in Knockanacree Woods each saturday. The woods are managed by Coillte which supports a local community initiative to improve walking paths and recreation facilities. Ormond Foxhounds are based at kennels in nearby Modreeny.

The corrective procedures for buttock augmentation and buttock repair include the surgical emplacement of a gluteal implant (buttock prosthesis); liposculpture (fat transfer and liposuction); and body contouring (surgery and liposculpture) to resolve the patient's particular defect or deformity of the gluteal region. Moreover, in the praxis of sexual reassignment surgery, the prosthetic and liposculpture augmentation of the buttocks can be performed on transsexual and transgender women to enhance the anatomic curvature of the gluteal region in order to establish the markedly feminine buttocks and hips that project more (to the rear and to the side) than do masculine hips.  Background  The functional purpose of the buttocks musculature is to establish a stable gait (balanced walk) for the man or the woman who requires the surgical correction of either a defect or a deformity of the gluteal region; therefore, the restoration of anatomic functionality is the therapeutic consideration that determines which gluteoplasty procedure will effectively correct the damaged muscles of the buttocks. The applicable techniques for surgical and correction include the surgical emplacement of gluteal implants; autologous tissue-flaps; the excision (cutting and removal) of damaged tissues; lipoinjection augmentation; and liposuction reduction ‚Äî to resolve the defect or deformity caused by a traumatic injury (blunt, penetrating, blast) to the buttocks muscles (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus), and any deformation of the anatomic contour of the buttocks. Likewise, the corrective techniques apply to resolving the sagging skin of the body, and the muscle and bone deformities presented by the formerly obese patient, after a massive weight loss (MWL) bariatric surgery procedure; and for resolving congenital defects and congenital deformities of the gluteal region.  Surgical anatomy of the buttocks  ;Muscular origins and insertions Gluteoplasty: The surgical anatomy of the gluteus maximus muscle, as considered for a buttock-lift surgery. Anatomically, the mass of each buttock principally comprises two (2) muscles ‚Äî the gluteus maximus muscle and the gluteus medius muscle ‚Äî which are covered by a layer of adipose body fat. The upper aspects of the buttocks end at the iliac crest (the upper edges of the wings of the ilium, and the upper lateral margins of the greater pelvis), and the lower aspects of the buttocks end at the horizontal gluteal crease, where the buttocks anatomy joins the rear, upper portion of the thighs. The gluteus maximus muscle has two (2) points of insertion: (i) the one-third (1/3) superior portion of the (coarse line) linea aspera of the thigh bone (femur), and (ii) the superior portion of the iliotibial tract (a long, fibrous reinforcement of the deep fascia lata of the thigh). The left and the right gluteus maximus muscles (the butt cheeks) are vertically divided by the intergluteal cleft (the butt-crack) which contains the anus. The gluteus maximus muscle is a large and very thick muscle (6‚Äì7 cm) located on the sacrum, which is the large, triangular bone located at the base of the vertebral column, and at the upper- and back-part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted (like a wedge) between the two hip bones. The upper part of the sacrum is connected to the final lumbar vertebra (L5), and to the bottom of the coccyx (tailbone). At its origin, the gluteus maximus muscle extends to include parts of the iliac bone, the sacrum, the coccyx, the sacrosciatic ligament, and the tuberosity of the ischium. Like every pelvic- area muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle originates from the pelvis; nonetheless, it is the sole pelvic muscle not inserted to the trochanter (head of the femur), and is approximately aligned to the femur and the fascia lata (the deep fascia of the thigh); the tissues of the gluteus maximus muscle cover only the rear, lateral face of the trochanter, and there form a bursa (purse) that faces the interior of the thigh. =Innervation= The motor innervation of the gluteus maximus muscle is performed by the inferior gluteal nerve (a branch nerve of the sacral plexus) and extends from the pelvis to the gluteal region, then traverses the greater sciatic foramen (opening) from behind and to the middle to then join the sciatic nerve. The inferior gluteal nerve divides into three (3) collateral branches: (i) the gluteus branch, (ii) the perineal branch, and (iii) the femoral branch. The first ramification ‚Äî the gluteus branch ‚Äî is a branch nerve that is very close to the emergence of the inferior gluteal nerve to the area, next to the inferior border of the pyramidalis muscle. As it arises, the inferior gluteal nerve then divides into four (4) or more fillets (bands of nerve fibres) that travel (in a crow's-foot configuration) between the gluteus maximus muscle and its (front) anterior fascia; the thickest nerve-bands are the superior-most and the inferior-most fillets. The superior-most fillet runs almost vertically, near the sacrum, and innervates the superior portion of the gluteus muscle; the inferior-most fillet, which has the greatest calibre, travels very close and parallel to the sacrotuberous ligament; the inferior-most fillet provides fine-gauge branch- nerve ramifications that innervate the gluteus muscle through its anterior (front) face. In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon creates the implant-pocket ‚Äî either for the gluteal prosthesis or for the injections of autologous fat ‚Äî by undermining the gluteus maximus muscle with a dissection technique that avoids the sacrum, the sacrotuberous ligament, and the tuberosity of the ischium; which, if accidentally cut, might isolate the posterior (back) portion of the muscle and lead to denervation, the loss of nerve function and of innervation. Thursday, 14 February 2019 =Vascularization= The superior gluteal artery, the inferior gluteal artery, the superior gluteal veins, and the inferior gluteal veins irrigate the gluteus maximus muscle with arterial and venous blood. The vascularization, the entrance of the blood vessels to the muscle tissues, occurs at the anterior (front) face of the muscle, very close to the sacrum. As the arteries and the veins enter the mass of the gluteal muscle, they divide into narrower blood-vessel ramifications (configured like the horizontal branches of a tree), most of which travel parallel to the muscle fibres. In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon effects the implant-pocket undermining of the gluteus maximus muscle by carefully separating the muscle fibres to avoid severing the pertinent blood vessels, which would interfere with the blood irrigation of the muscle tissue. Therefore, to create an implant-pocket, either for a gluteal prosthesis or for lipoinjection, a low-angle muscle-dissection is performed in order to avoid the risk of severing any major branch ‚Äî superior or inferior ‚Äî of the gluteal artery, which travels very close to the sacrum and to the sacrotuberous ligament.  Surgical procedures  =Surgical therapy= While the resolution of the defects and deformities of the gluteal region can be realized surgically, the assessment of the degree of severity of the injury organizes treatment therapies into three types: (i) buttocks augmentation, (ii) buttocks reduction, and (iii) contour irregularity treatments that combine surgery and liposculpture (liposuction and fat-injection). =Buttocks augmentation treatments= Gluteal implants The augmentation of the buttocks is realized with a gluteal implant, which is emplaced under each gluteus maximus muscle; the insertion of the buttock prosthesis is through a midline incision (5‚Äì8-cm-wide) over the tailbone (coccyx). Augmentation with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess adipose fat in the lower portion of the trunk, the buttocks and thighs, the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body fat. Post-operatively, because of the cutting (incising) into the flesh of the tailbone muscles, the full healing of the augmented tissues can be approximately 6‚Äì8 months, in the course of which the gluteal-muscle tissues relax, and the settled buttocks prostheses are integrated to the gluteal region. The implantation procedure can be performed upon a patient who is either sedated or anaesthetized, either under general anaesthesia or under local anaesthesia. The usual operating-room time for a buttocks augmentation procedure is approximately 2 hours. The procedure can be managed either as an overnight in-patient treatment or as a hospital outpatient treatment. Given the nature of the surgical incisions to the gluteus maximus muscles, the therapeutic management of post-surgical pain (at the surgical-wound sites) and normal tissue-healing usually require a 4-6-week convalescence, after which the patient resumes his or her normal-life activities. Lipoinjection The augmentation and contouring of the buttocks with autologous-fat transfer (lipoinjection) therapy is realized with the excess adipose-fat tissue harvested from the abdomen, flanks, and thighs of the patient. In 1987 Dr. Eduardo Krulig, a Venezuelan Plastic Surgeon describes the technique, using the name \\"Lipoinjection\\" for the first time, mentioning the regions of the body where the technique is useful. The gentle liposuction applied to harvest the autologous fat minimally disturbs the local tissues, especially the connective-tissue layer between the skin and the immediate subcutaneous muscle tissues. Then, the harvested fat is injected to the pertinent body area of the gluteal region, through a fine-gauge cannula inserted through a small incision, which produces a short and narrow scar. Lipoinjection contouring and augmentation with the patient's own body fat avoids the possibility of tissue rejection, and is physically less invasive than buttocks-implant surgery. Therefore, depending upon the health of the patient, the convalescence period allows him or her to resume daily, normal- life activities at 2-days post-operative, and the full spectrum of physical activity at 2-weeks post-operative. Furthermore, the liposuction harvesting of the patient's excess body fat improves the aesthetic appearance of the body fat donor-sites. Nonetheless, physiologically, the human body's normal, health-management chemistry does resorb (break down and eliminate) some of the injected adipose-fat tissue, and so might diminish the augmentation. According to the degree of diminishment of the volume and contour caused by the fat- resorption, the patient might require additional sessions of fat-transfer therapy to achieve the desired size, shape, and contour of the buttocks. Body contouring The augmentation of the buttocks, by rearranging and enhancing the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal region, is realized with a combined gluteoplasty procedure of surgery (subcutaneous dermal-fat flaps) and liposculpture (fat-suction, fat-injection). Therapeutically, such a combined correction-and-enhancement procedure is a realistic and feasible lower-body-lift treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive weight loss (MWL) in the course of resolving obesity with bariatric surgery. In the case of the man or woman who presents under-projected, flat buttocks (gluteal hypoplasia), and a degree of gluteal- muscle ptosis (prolapsation, falling forward), wherein neither gluteal-implant surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal region, the application of a combined treatment of autologous dermal-fat flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic contour. =Buttocks reduction treatments= The methods for reducing the size of the buttocks include the varieties of liposuction, such as lipectomy (with and without ultrasonic enhancement) to reduce excess body fat, and superficial liposculpture, to reshape, refine, and re-establish the natural contour of the body. The usual buttocks-reduction treatment is lipectomy with applied tumescence and anaesthesia, wherein the body fat is harvested by aspiration (suction) through a small-gauge cannula (2‚Äì4 mm) that is inserted through a small incision, either to the intergluteal sulcus (the butt-crack), or to the upper area of the gluteus maximus muscle proper. Ultrasonic lipectomy Ultrasonically-assisted liposuction can quickly remove a large volume of body fat for the correction of a notable occurrence of lipodystrophy, a deposit of adipose fat to the buttocks and related anatomic areas. The ultrasonic liposuction machine liquefies the excess fat tissue, and so more readily facilitates its removal with conventional suction-lipectomy. The quick fat- harvesting allowed by the ultrasonic lipectomy technique has eliminated the larger (long and wide) surgical incisions that once were required for removing a large volume of adipose tissue. Nonetheless, because of the sensitivity of the gluteal-region tissues, the skin of the pertinent donor-site is cooled in order to prevent ultrasonic heat damage caused by the liquefying and removal of the excess adipose fat. Superficial liposculpture Reshaping the buttocks with liposculpture is performed with a small cannula (2 mm) specifically for contouring superficial body fat, the configuration of which (number of open ports) is determined by the type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of the buttocks into an athletic form. The study Contouring the Gluteal Region with Tumescent Liposculpture (2011) indicated that effective, gluteal- region contouring is best achieved by tailoring the liposuction-reduction and the lipoinjection-augmentation techniques to the anatomic topography of the body areas to be corrected. Furthermore, the study Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women: Enhancement and Augmentation (2011) indicated that natural contours of the buttocks and the thighs are effectively achieved with a combined gluteoplasty of selective liposuction and lipoinjection, which reduces the need for aggressive surgical procedures, decreases the risk of medical complications, abbreviates wound-recovery-time, and lessens post- operative scarring. Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial liposculpture facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.  Surgical technique  =Surgical contouring of the gluteal region= Pre-operative matters To meet the functional requirements and the aesthetic expectations (body image) of the patient, the plastic surgeon establishes a realistic and feasible surgery plan by which to correct the anatomic contour deficiencies of the gluteal region. The surgeon and the patient determine the location of the surgical-wound scars, and determine the best operative position, to allow the proper exposure of the pertinent anatomy to be corrected. Because the surgical procedure requires the tumescence and anaesthesia of the gluteal-region area to be corrected, the physician and the anaesthesiologist determine the volumes of the anaesthetic and tumescent fluids to be administered to the patient during the procedure, and so avoid the risks of drugs overdose and toxicity. Intra-operative matters Once the patient is atop the operating table, the surgeon positions him or her to best expose the pertinent gluteal-region area that is to be corrected or contoured, or both; the usual operative position is the prone (face down) position, but the patient can also be positioned laterally (on his or her side). The surgical correction plan can be delineated and marked to the patient's body when he or she is awake (before sedation or anaesthesia) or it can be delineated when the patient is on the operating table (already sedated or anaesthetized). In operative praxis, the second option allows the plastic surgeon greater freedom to properly manipulate the patient into the position best suited for performing the body-contouring surgery. Operative matters Once the patient is in the operative position, the surgeon begins the liposuction correction by making incisions to the marks of the surgical- correction plan, and then infiltrates (injects) a solution of anaesthesia- and tumescence-inducing drugs, usually a combination of lidocaine and epinephrine. The volume of the anaesthetic-tumescent solution is gradually infiltrated to the pertinent gluteal area, in order to avoid the nerves and the deeper anatomic structures of the gluteus maximus muscle. The particular anatomic features to be contoured determine the types of cannula (gauge, size, grade) used to effect and control the harvesting of excess adipose fat from the patient's body. For a lipoinjection augmentation, the surgeon first dissects and prepares the augmentation-pocket to which will be injected the autologous fat-tissue. The surgical creation (muscle dissection) of the augmentation- pocket avoids the gluteal innervation (superior gluteal nerve and inferior gluteal nerve) and the vascular system (venous and arterial) of the gluteus maximus muscle. Afterwards, the surgeon sutures the dissection-incision and secures it with adhesive tape to ensure that the augmentation-pocket remains open, as dissected, ready to receive the injections of adipose fat. For the revision of scars, with surgery and injections of autologous fat, or with allopathic synthetic fillers, the surgeon applies subcuticular closures to the incision wounds, which then are bandaged. Post-operative matters After completing the surgical corrections and the lipoinjection contouring of the pertinent area(s) of the gluteal region, the surgeon thoroughly examines the patient to ensure his or her general recovery from the operation; and examines each surgical incision to ascertain that it is correctly sutured and taped, in order to facilitate the uneventful healing of the gluteus-muscle tissues, without medical complications. The patient is advised to avoid exercise and strenuous physical activity until 3-weeks post-operative; how to properly care for surgical-incision wounds; and how to wear a compression garment that will keep in place the surgically corrected tissues, and so ensure their healing as a whole anatomic unit of the gluteal region. Follow-up and convalescence The physician advises the patient who has undergone a surgical contouring of the buttocks with gluteal implants, that, although immediate results can be observed, the final, corrected body contour usually is observed at 6-months post-operative, and at 1-year post-operative, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient's body. The liposculpture patient usually requires approximately 6 months, and occasionally 1 year before producing the final, corrected body contour. For both procedures, at approximately 1-month post-operative, marked aesthetic improvement is noticeable in the corrected body areas, as is the elimination of the initial, post-operative weight gain caused by the body's retention of the infiltrated, anaesthetic and tumescent, fluids. The patient is advised to wear a compression garment to contain swelling and to immobilize the corrected tissues, so that they heal as one anatomic unit of the gluteal region. Moreover, throughout the convalescence, to facilitate shrinking the skin to the new, corrected body contour, and to resolve unevenness, wrinkles to the skin, and localized swelling, the continual application of massage and (occasional) ultrasound treatments can facilitate the diminishment of the post-operative conditions. Complications The surgical and liposculpture contouring of the human body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological ‚Äî unmet body image expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical ‚Äî uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic ‚Äî toxic reactions to the anaesthesic and the tumescent drugs; and the nervous ‚Äî paresthesia, localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region. The medical complications possible to a surgical buttocks augmentation procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include infection, surgical-wound dehiscence that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, seroma (a pocket of clear serous fluid), capsular contracture, asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the sciatic nerve, and paresthesia (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a liposculpture buttocks augmentation include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, abscess (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), cellulitis (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia. =Dangers= Like most medical procedures, buttock augmentation come with risks some of which can be life-threatening. A total of 413 Mexican plastic surgeons reported 64 deaths related to liposuction, with 13 deaths caused by gluteal lipoinjection. In Colombia, nine deaths were documented. Of the 13 deaths in Mexico, eight (61.6 percent) occurred during lipoinjection, whereas the remaining five (38.4 percent) occurred within the first 24 hours. In Colombia, six deaths (77.7 percent) occurred during surgery and three occurred (22.2 percent) immediately after surgery. Secondary lymphoedema of the lower extremities has been reported as an unusual side effect of liquid silicone injection on the hips and buttock while thromboembolism, implant displacement and explosion has also been listed as some of the dangers. The surgical and liposculpture contouring of the human body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological ‚Äî unmet body image expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical ‚Äî uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic ‚Äî toxic reactions to the anaesthesic and the tumescent drugs; and the nervous ‚Äî paresthesia, localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region. The medical complications possible to a surgical buttocks augmentation procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include infection, surgical- wound dehiscence that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, seroma (a pocket of clear serous fluid), capsular contracture, asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over- correction, injury to the sciatic nerve, and paresthesia (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a liposclupture buttocks augmentation include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, abscess (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), cellulitis (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.  Unmet expectations  In the surgical praxis of body contouring therapy, the patient's body-image expectations can be different from the contoured body that is the outcome of the performed surgical operation. Such unmet aesthetic expectations can be avoided at the pre-operative consultation stage, whereby, with informed consent, the physician and the patient jointly establish a realistic and feasible surgery plan to achieve a mutually satisfactory corrective outcome (functional and aesthetic) of the operation to the gluteal region, the buttock- and thigh-areas.  Contour problems  Contour problems of the corrected gluteal region can be prevented with the operational use of small- gauge cannulas (ca. 2.0 mm) specifically for superficial liposuction; and with the application of cross-pattern harvesting of the excess body fat, to avoid removing too much adipose fat tissue, which might disfigure the contour of the patient's fat-donor area. The possible contour problems that might arise from ultrasonic liposuction are skin burns and hypertrophic scarring, which might occur if the fat-donor area skin is not cooled and protected during the fat harvest. To that end, the infusion of a tumescence-inducing solution to the fat-donor area(s) assists in cooling the patient's skin during the ultrasonic lipo-harvesting; likewise, the application of moist towels, a skin protector, and the constant cooling-fluid infiltration of the cannula in an integrated sheath.  Drug complications (anaesthetic and tumescent)  The infiltration of a solution of anaesthesia- and tumescence-inducing drugs can present medical complications such as a fluid overload of the tissues, the inadequate replacement of the infiltrated solution, and the partitioning (separation) of a single infiltration into several pools, which then are removed by suction lipectomy. Moreover, during anaesthesia, maintaining the patient's stable blood pressure can be difficult, which increases the possibility of bleeding, and the possibility that anaesthetic toxicity can occur if excessive doses are administered by infiltration; the symptoms are manifested as central nervous system (CNS) occurrences of drug-induced anxiety, apprehension, restlessness, nervousness, disorientation, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, nausea, vomiting, shivering, and seizures; likewise, as manifestations of drowsiness, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest. Furthermore, the toxicity symptoms of a tumescence-inducing drug (e.g. epinephrine) might cause such CNS symptoms, for which reason the operative application of a tumescent drug is limited throughout the operation.  Numbness (paresthesia)  Post-operatively, local areas of numbness (paresthesia) might occur in the contoured portion(s) of the gluteal region, and might perdure for a long time after the surgery. Hence, the patient is advised to facilitate the re-sensitizing of the numb area(s) with applications of gentle massage, to prevent the development of a neuroma complication, and to alleviate pain. Nonetheless, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient, he or she can recover in full at 2-years post-operative. =Outcome= The outcome of a buttocks-contouring procedure depends upon the specific defect or deformity that can be effectively corrected with liposculpture, ultrasonic or not. Nonetheless, depressed scars and deep morphological defects are difficult to correct because of the curvature of the buttocks as an anatomic unit, and because of the scar-contracting elements of the tissues across the gluteal curvature. In such a case, although the injection of (autologous or artificial) tissue fillers to correct the defect or the deformity might be impermanent ‚Äî it usually will remedy the functional and aesthetic shortcoming(s) required by the patient, which is the therapeutic purpose of gluteoplasty.

Lord Vaikundar, the Incarnation, is the combination of the Ultimate God, Trimurti and Narayana. In Akilam immediately after the Incarnation of Vaikundar, he was viewed simultaneously as the Ultimate God, Narayana, and as son of Narayana. As per the earlier deed Narayana had to destroy Kaliyan, but due to the boons that kaliyan claimed Narayana has destroy him in form of Pantaram. And as per the promise made by Kaliyan, he would only be destroyed, if he give torture to any Pantaram. To overcome all these, such a unique way of Incarnation was planned. Akilathirattu narrates that the Avatar (incarnation) of Vaikundar is the combination of Ultimate God, Trimurti and Narayana. *The Soul (Ekam) - The Soul of Ultimate God (compare with Parameshwara/God-father of Abrahamic religions), Trimurti *The Avatar of Narayana - Lord Narayana incarnate himself (Note, that according to Vedic scriptures, Form of Vishnu, inner spirit of Vishnu, and His Holy Names and Lilas are non-different.) The Soul \\"Ayya\\" - Ultimate God The Soul of Vaikundar is that of the Paramatma or the Ultimate God, and it was viewed that the Ultimate God or Ekam (the God beyond Consciousness), incarnates here in the world. The Thiru Nadana Ula which was told by Sivan, which was a part of Akilam states it clearly. \\"An assemblage was rended by getting a great Assemblage which arose with its own intention and by the rended assemblage there formed a great world of righteousness and by which the kali is destroyed as its age is over.\\" Here the 'great assemblage' (assembled of the whole which exists in a globular shape) represents the Ekam or the Ultimate God which is beyond Consciousness, the 'rended assemblage' represents Vaikundar, and the ‚Äòworld of righteouseness‚Äô represents Dharma Yukam. This verse says that Vaikundar was the one by which Dharma Yukam created, and Vaikundar was rended by getting the power of Ekam without which kali would not be destroyed. Immediately after the ceremony of avatar of Vaikundar, Narayana called Vaikundar \\"Your self is Sivan, your self is Vethan, your self is Thirumal and your self is the austerity, your self is Brahman and your self is the whole which exists.\\" Vaikundar was also called as Muthalvan, which in Tamil means the one who formed first. Also as per the boons that Kaliyan claimed, Narayana or any other else could not destroy Kaliyan. This is also the reason which paves the way for the soul of the Ultimate Being to come as Vaikundar. During the Katuvai Sothanai, Vaikundar says that, \\"Iam the one who created the Ekam and I am in every thing which exists. Since the trimurti was concealed into my self, myself is the soul of all living beings‚Äù. Also, in the event of the Marriage of the Deities, Vaikundar unified into himself Sarasvathi, Laksmi, Parvathi, in addition to the ‚ÄòGoddess of Earth‚Äô (Poomadanthai) and by which it was clearly stated that Vaikundar is the incarnation of Ekam, ‚ÄòThe Ultimate‚Äô, which is beyond all these. The Avatar of Narayana The spirit of Narayana was in which the Ultimate soul is installed. So on the other hand Vaikundar was viewed as Narayana, the Murthi Stage (i.e. the God with supreme consciousness). A verse in Akilam states that \\"The day on which Narayanar came as Vaikundar.\\" Also as soon as the Santror was born, (see:Santror Pirappu) the Seven Virgins felt that they had lost their purity. They tried to assemble the Ganges (water) into a ball, but cannot. They not even look the face of their sons. They started performing austerity that Narayana who was the one who deceived them should marry them, and rule the world along with them. This was accepted by Thirumal. And for this reason Vaikundar marry the Seven Virgins during his Avatar. This is the part at which Ayya Vikundar is highly focused as Narayana in Akilam. Also, when Kroni was fragmented into six, Sivan told Narayana, \\" All the six fragments will take birth as Asuras in each Yukams and you have the responsibility to destroy him by taking birth in world.\\" This is elaborated in Akilam One. Then, Akilam says that in the Dharma Yukam Vaikundar rule the world along with the Seven Virgins and Santror Makkal. Accordingly, it was stated that Vaikundar is Narayana himself incarnate. Also Vinchai is the part where this view could be ultimately found Vaikundar as a son of Narayana. Both in the First as well as the Muttappathi Vinchais, Vaikundar was called by Narayana with a high fatherly affection. And also Vaikundar called Narayana as Father. In this fact, it is notable that before the incarnation (i.e. before the soul of Ekam and spirit of Narayana installed into the body) Narayana in the sea, called the body as \\"My dear son\\", because the body was given birth by Veiyelal in the dynasty of Santror, the children of Narayana. Vaikundar took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga. I (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of Akilattirattu Ammanai with the grace of God! ‚Äú ‚ÄòO‚Äô Lord you took avatar for Pandavas and eliminated their enemies. You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of Kaliyan.

A non-membrane associated splice variant of VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1), sFlt-1 binds the angiogenic factors VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and PlGF (placental growth factor), reducing blood vessel growth through reduction of free VEGF and PlGF concentrations. In humans, sFlt-1 is important in the regulation of blood vessel formation in diverse tissues, including the kidneys, cornea, and uterus. Abnormally high levels of sFlt-1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.  Structure  Structural comparison of sFIt-1 and FIt-1. sFlt-1 is a truncated form of the VEGF receptor Flt-1. Though sFlt-1 contains an extracellular domain identical to that of Flt-1, it lacks both the transmembrane and intercellular domains present in Flt-1. Instead, sFlt-1 contains a novel 31 amino acid C-terminal sequence. sFlt-1 is composed of 6 immunoglobulin-like domains, with a binding site for VEGF and PIGF within the second domain from the N-terminus. A sequence of 10 basic amino acids form a binding site for the anticoagulant heparin in the third domain from the N-terminus. sFlt-1 has a pI of 9.51, giving the protein a positive charge at physiological pH.  Biological function  Comparison of mechanism of action of sFIt-1 and FIt-1. Because sFlt-1 lacks the transmembrane domain that typically embeds tyrosine kinase receptors in the cell membrane, sFlt-1 travels freely in the blood circulation, and thus can travel from the tissue in which it is originally secreted to other areas of the body. As it contains the same extracellular domain as Flt-1, sFlt-1 competes with Flt-1 to bind VEGF and PIGF, effectively reducing serum concentrations of these two angiogenic growth factors. Though sFlt-1 can effectively dimerize, its lack of a kinase domain means that no tyrosine phosphorylation occurs upon ligand binding. As a result, sFIt-1 effectively sequesters agonists of FIt-1, and has been implicated as a regulator of this receptor in the kidney, liver, and brain.  Role in preeclampsia  = The placental factor theory of preeclampsia = Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. Normally, during early formation of the placenta, extravillous cytotrophoblasts, a type of specialized fetal cell, enter the spiral arteries of the uterus. This invasion spurs remodeling of the epithelial layer of these uterine arteries, increasing their conductance and decreasing their resistance to meet the increase blood flow demands of pregnancy. Specifically, invading cytotrophoblasts achieve this change by down-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules characteristic of epithelial cells and up-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules characteristic of endothelial cells in a process known as pseudovasculogenesis. In preeclamptic patients, this arterial transformation is incomplete, as cytotrophoblasts fail to completely switch their adhesion molecule expression pattern to an endothelial form. The balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and their receptors, including VEGF-A, PIGF, Flt1, and sFlt1, is thought to mediate this process. In women who develop preeclampsia, the sFlt-1 to PlGF ratio is higher than in normal pregnancy. sFlt-1 produced in the placenta is thought to circulate in the maternal bloodstream to act on distant tissues, explaining the multi-system endothelial dysfunction observed in women with preeclampsia. In-vitro studies have linked sFlt-1 treatment to a pattern of vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction identical to the syndrome produced when cells are incubated with serum from preeclamptic patients. Additionally, adenoviral transfer of the sFlt-1 gene to pregnant rats has been shown to produce a syndrome similar to preeclampsia. = Preeclamptic regulation of sFlt-1 = Though sFlt-1 is produced in small amounts by endothelial cells and monocytes, the placenta is theorized to be the major source of sFlt-1 during pregnancy. sFlt-1 mRNA shows strong expression in the placenta, and serum concentration of sFlt-1 falls significantly in patients after delivery of the placenta. Expression of sFlt-1 is stimulated by hypoxic conditions. In healthy pregnancies, the placenta develops in a hypoxic environment, leading to a 20-fold increase in sFlt-1 expression. In early-onset preeclamptic patients, this increase is estimated to be up to 43 times more pronounced, and may be spurred by conditions of poor uterine profusion leading to more severe local hypoxia. Inhibition of nitric oxide signaling has also been associated with elevation of serum sFlt-1 in a rat model of preeclampsia; this stimulus may represent a secondary factor contributing to sFlt-1 trends in human preeclampsia as well. In addition to short-term regulation by oxygen and nitric oxide levels, genetic differences also influence Flt-1 gene splicing and resulting sFlt-1 expression levels. Women with histories of preeclampsia continue to show elevated serum levels of sFlt-1 up to 18 months postpartum, suggesting a genetic basis of sFlt-1 expression independent of pregnancy-related stimuli. = Clinical significance = PlGF and sFlt-1 concentrations measured by immunoassay in maternal blood improve the prognostic possibilities in preeclampsia, which is typically diagnosed solely on the basis of clinical symptoms, proteinuria, and uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. Notably, increases in sFlt-1 and decreases in PIGF and VEGF can be detected at least five weeks before the onset of preeclamptic symptoms, potentially facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment. sFlt-1 changes are most predictive of early-onset preeclampsia; cases of preeclampsia incident late in pregnancy typically are accompanied only by small decreases in PIGF. However, sFlt-1 elevation is also associated with other obstetric conditions such as non-preeclampsic interuterine growth retardation of the fetus, limiting its use as a discriminatory biomarker for preeclampsia. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity of sFlt-1 testing is generally considered too low to enable it to serve as an effective predictor of preeclampsia. sFlt-1 involvement in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia may explain several demographic trends in incidence of the condition. The human Flt-1/sFlt-1 gene is located at 13q12; the association of fetal trisomy-13 with higher rates of preeclampsia could theoretically be explained by the additional copy of the gene. Additionally, primiparous women have higher baseline levels of sFlt-1, a trend which could potentially explain the higher incidence of preeclampsia among first-time mothers.

Baptised in the newly established Swiss Protestant Church in London on 11 August 1765, Francis Hobler, as he was commonly known, held the respected position of principal clerk to the Right Hon. Lord Mayor of London during the early-to-mid-19th century. As chief clerk, his duties were to provide informed legal counsel in the areas of criminal law and the statutes and civic customs of the city of London. Hobler held this position for the majority of his life, which included numerous changes to the civic chair. He retired in 1843 due to ill health. Revered for his intellect and wit, Francis Hobler was once described as a \\"fine, tall, upright, powdered-headed gentleman of the old school, always neatly, though somewhat eccentrically dressed, in a closely buttoned-up black coat, drab breeches and gaiters, which seem to be essential to, and form a part of his very existence\\". (The Illustrated London News, 1843) Fluent in English, French, Spanish, German and Latin, he was known for his punctuality, compassion and excellent memory. His vivid recollection of past events is best evidenced by an incident which occurred at Mansion House, where a young thief was facing a charge of burglary. \\"We have seen each other before now.\\" (questioned Hobler) \\"No we haven't old boy\\" was the impudent reply upon which, quietly turning on his seat, Mr. Hobler said, \\"I think I've an invite of yours\\" and opening a drawer took out and read, to the great merriment of his listeners, a card printed in the hand writing of the prisoner in red ink, soliciting the four of his friends' attendance at a public-house in the Borough, to get \\"gloriously drunk\\" and which had been taken from his person on a commitment to Bridewell many years before as a rogue and vagabond.\\" (The Illustrated London News, 1843) Francis Hobler also appears on more than one occasion in the writings of Charles Dickens and George Augustus Sala. \\"The Lord Mayor threw himself back in his chair, in a state of frantic delight at his own joke; every vein in Mr. Hobler's countenance was swollen with laughter partly at the Lord Mayor's facetiousness, but more at his own; the constables and police officers were (as in duty bound) in ecstasies at Mr. Hobler and the Lord Mayor combined; and the very paupers, glancing respectfully at the beadle's countenance, tried to smile, as even he relaxed.\\" (The Last Cab- Driver, And The First Omnibus Cad. Sketches by Boz, Charles Dickens, 1835) Francis Hobler and his wife Mary Furby had four children, one of whom was solicitor and author Francis Hobler, Jnr (circa 1793-1868). His youngest son George Hobler (1800‚Äì1882) was an Australian pioneer who introduced the first Devon cow to Australia. Francis and Mary also had two daughters, Charlotte Elizabeth Hobler (born circa 1795) and Mary Ann Hobler (circa 1810-1850). James Francis Helvetius Hobler died in Pentonville, London on 21 January 1844 (aged 78). He is buried at Highgate Cemetery along with his wife Mary and eldest son Francis.

It is one of four notorious murder cases that took place in an infamous area of Glasgow known as the Square Mile of Murder, which lies around Charing Cross, \\"situated where Sauchiehall Street is coming to an end as a shopping centre and giving way to well-built terraces\\". The case revolved around the brutal murder of one Jessie McPherson, a servant, in 17 Sandyford Place, Glasgow, Scotland, in July 1862. McPherson's friend Jessie McLachlan later stood trial, accused of having murdered McPherson. The Sandyford case was the first Scottish police case in which forensic photography played a role, and the first case handled by the detective branch of the Glasgow Police. The case was heard at the Glasgow Circuit Court between Wednesday 17 and Saturday 20 September 1862. During the trial, McLachlan resolutely declared her innocence, and accused the father of the woman's employer, one James Fleming, age 87, of having committed the crime, perhaps in a fit of passion when McPherson refused his amorous advances. The summing-up of the evidence, delivered by Judge Lord Deas, lasted for more than four hours and, after nineteen minutes' deliberation, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict. Before sentence was passed, a final statement was read on behalf of the prisoner, giving her detailed account of what had happened on the night of the murder. However, the Judge denounced it as a \\"tissue of wicked falsehoods\\" and sentenced her to death, which was to be carried out by hanging on 11 October 1862. However, due to a public outcry, in an unprecedented action, a Court Commission was appointed to investigate the evidence in the case. The commission did not declare her innocent, but did commute her sentence to life imprisonment. McLachlan served 15 years in Perth General Prison before being released on ticket-of-leave on 5 October 1877. She emigrated to the United States and married again. She died in Port Huron, Michigan, on New Year's Day in 1899. The case is given a passing mention in the last chapter of E.C. Bentley's 1913 detective novel Trent's Last Case, in the thirteenth chapter of Dorothy Sayers' 1937 detective novel Busman‚Äôs Honeymoon, and in the third chapter of Gladys Mitchell's 13th Mrs Bradley crime novel, When Last I Died, published in 1941. It was recounted by Jack House in his 1961 book Square Mile of Murder, which was dramatised by the BBC in 1980. The murder, trial and aftermath are covered in scrupulous detail in Heaven Knows Who (1960) by Christianna Brand, otherwise known as a respected writer of mysteries. There are two references to this case in Seeing is Believing (also published as Cross of Murder) a Sir Henry Merrivale novel by Carter Dickson (aka John Dickson Carr) first published by Morrow (US, 1941) and Heinemann (UK, 1942). In Chapter 20 there's quite a long account of the Sandyford Murder Mystery. The third episode of Scotland's Murder Mysteries, titled \\"Jessie McLachlan\\", details the case with notes from modern experts and is produced by STV Productions.

It is often called 'Roof of the World'. Shandur top is located in Gilgit Baltistan and has a flat plateau and can be crossed between late April and early November. The grade is very gradual, and the area is crossed by plentiful small streams during summer. During the annual 'Shandur Polo Festival,' there are polo matches played in Shandur Polo Ground on Shandur Top, between the local teams of Ghizer, Gilgit-Baltistan and the guests teams from Chitral. Approximately seven matches are played in the three days of the festival usually held on July 7th to 9th every year. The final match is played on July 9th between Teams A of Gilgit and Chitral. History It was established by the ruler of Chitral Mehtar HH Shuja Ul Mulk . The polo ground was named \\"Mas Junali\\", because in the Khowar language ‚Äòmas‚Äô is the word for ‚Äòmoon‚Äô and ‚Äòjunali‚Äô is the word for ‚Äòpolo-ground‚Äô. Shandoor LakeSo Mas Junali became a source of relation between the people of Chitral District and Ghizer District. The Shandur Polo Festival opens a door step to the people of the world to enjoy their selves. Many of the people from entire world come here to watch polo match played between Chitral and Ghizer.Polo is an equestrian sport with its origin embedded in Central Asia dating back to 6th century BC At first it was a training game for cavalry units or other Elite troops. To the warlike tribesmen who played polo with as many as 100 players to a side, it was a miniature battle. It became a Persian national game in the 6th century AD. From Persia, the game spread to Arabia, then to Tibet, China and Japan. In China, in the year 910, death of a favourite relative in a game prompted Emperor Apaochi to order beheading of all players. Ali Sher Khan Anchan Maqpoun used to play Polo at Shandoor when Chitral was briefly occupied by Sher Ali Anchan. The Princes and political agents of Chitral also enjoyed playing Polo in Shandur. Historically, polo being the king of games was played between small kingdoms, villages and rival groups of Chitral and Gilgit. From 1936 onwards polo tournaments were held annually at Shandur at the patronage of the British. The three-day Shandur Polo Festival has developed steadily in recent years into the massive celebration of mountain polo that it is today. Since 1982 the matches are being arranged by Chitral administration , levies, Chitral scout and police. GB teams participated as guests team .

There is also a term Polentagraben which refers to the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. The term first appeared during World War I, when neutral Switzerland stood between the warring German Empire and the French Republic. Etymology The first part of the term is derived from the Swiss German name for hashed potatoes, r√∂sti, which originated in the canton of Bern and is considered typical of Swiss German cuisine. Graben has both the concrete and abstract meaning of \\"rift\\", with the Saane/Sarine river valley in the bilingual canton of Fribourg separating the linguistic areas. The Swiss- French use a similar expression: barri√®re de r√∂s(ch)ti, literally \\"r√∂sti barrier\\", or rideau de r√∂s(ch)ti \\"r√∂sti curtain\\" (reminiscent of the Iron Curtain). Just like R√∂stigraben it has become a familiar facetious expression used whenever differences arise, e.g. the different voting results. Definition The Sarine in Fribourg Geographically the line stretches from the Jura Mountains (canton of Jura and Bernese Jura) in the north along Lake Biel, Lake Neuch√¢tel and Lake Morat through the Swiss plateau, then crosses the Swiss Alps and the Rhone valley, separating Lower and Upper Valais, and finally reaches the Italian border between the municipalities of Evol√®ne and Zermatt. Folklorists lay emphasis on the importance of the parallel Br√ºnig- Napf-Reuss line further in the east, separating the historic Alemannic (East) and Burgundian (West) spheres of influence. *In social and foreign policy, the Romands tend to favour government regulation (influenced by the centralistic political mentality prevailing in France) and an active foreign policy (somewhat discarding Switzerland's neutrality), especially in relation to the European Union. *In transportation, environmental protection, and drug control, the difference is not as marked. In recent years, however, the differences in politics seem to be weakening as the urban areas of German- speaking Switzerland vote similarly to French-speaking Western Switzerland, predominantly in Northwestern Switzerland. By analogy, the term Polentagraben is used to refer to cultural and political differences between Italian- speaking Ticino and German-speaking Switzerland. The canton of Ticino is seen as strongly supportive of traditional social values, largely because of its cultural and geographical isolation from the rest of the country. Concerning affairs of foreign policy, the Swiss Italian-speaking population usually votes along with the German Switzerland citizens.

Early life  Backderf grew up in Richfield, Ohio, the son of a chemist. He attended Eastview Junior High and Revere High School, where one of his classmates was future serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Backderf graduated high school in 1978, and began attending the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. The following summer he worked as a garbageman back in his hometown. Backderf later transferred to, and graduated from, Ohio State University. Backderf was immersed in the punk movement during the late 1970s. He began as a political cartoonist, for the Ohio State Lantern, then professionally at The Evening Times, the evening counterpart of The Palm Beach Post, in West Palm Beach, FL. He worked as a staff cartoonist at the Cleveland Plain Dealer in the late 80s. In the mid-1990s Backderf worked in the newsroom of the Akron Beacon Journal.  Work  =The City= Backderf's comic strip The City appeared in over 140 publications, mostly free weekly newspapers, starting with the now-defunct Cleveland Edition in 1990, including: The Village Voice, The Chicago Reader, Cleveland Scene, Miami New Times, Houston Press, Pittsburgh City Paper, The Providence Phoenix, and Washington City Paper. In 2014, Derf announced that he was discontinuing The City to focus on graphic novels. Strips from The City were collected in The City: The World‚Äôs Most Grueling Comic Strip (SLG Publishing, 2003) and a four-volume series of comic books, True Stories (Alternative Comics, 2015, 2016, 2018). =Graphic novels=  Punk Rock & Trailer Parks  Backderf wrote Punk Rock & Trailer Parks (SLG Publishing, 2010), a 152-page graphic novel set in 1980, during the punk rock heyday in Akron, Ohio, a music scene that produced such acts as Devo, Chrissie Hynde, and The Cramps. Punk Rock & Trailer Parks is a fictional story that follows one remarkable young man named Otto who, through talent, wits and sheer chutzpah becomes a star in the Rubber City punk scene and has memorable meetings with underground luminaries of the day, including Wendy O. Williams, Stiv Bators, Lester Bangs, and The Clash. Punk Rock & Trailer Parks was featured in the 2010 edition of Best American Comics (Houghton Mifflin).  My Friend Dahmer  My Friend Dahmer (Abrams Comic Arts, 2012) is the culmination of a comic book project first started in 1994, shortly after Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison. Derf's first Dahmer story appeared in Zero Zero #18 (Fantagraphics, July 1997). Derf then pitched the project as a 100-page graphic novel, but failed to find a publisher. He then self-published a scaled-back 24-page My Friend Dahmer comic book in 2002. The original self- published comic book was nominated for an Eisner Award and was adapted and staged as a one-act play by the NYU Theater Dept., p. 2 The final 224-page incarnation was nominated for Ignatz, Harvey, and Reuben Awards, received an Angoul√™me Award and was named by Time magazine as one of the top five non- fiction books of 2012.

Art style  Backderf's art has been compared to Robert Crumb, with his use of black to \\"project character and menace\\" praised.Harrison, John. \\"My Friend Dahmer\\", Headpress 25: William Burroughs & the Flicker Machine, Headpress, 2003 p.76-9. Derf cites Crumb as an influence, along with Mad Magazine and Spain Rodriguez. He cites Expressionism as the inspiration for his usage of heavy ink, but feels the major influence on his work is the imagery of punk. Backderf has contributed to many well-known national publications, including Playboy, The Wall Street Journal and The Progressive. His illustrations have also appeared on posters, T-shirts, and CD covers. = Exhibitions = Backderf's work has been displayed in many galleries and museums both in the United States and abroad. In 1995, he had a large solo show at Altered Image Gallery in Cleveland, and in 1999 the Akron Art Museum put on a retrospective of his work, titled \\"Apocalyptic Giggles: The Industrial Cartoon Humor of Derf.\\" The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at the Ohio State University established a Derf Collection of original art and papers in 2011. Awards Backderf has won over 50 awards for his newspaper work, including a prestigious Bronze Medal from the Society of Newspaper Design. He was a member of the newsroom team for the Akron Beacon Journal that was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1995. In 2006 Derf won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for cartooning. He received the Prix R√©v√©lation at the 2014 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival in France. In 2016, he won an Eisner Award for lettering for Trashed.

The supermarket banner was created by Shopwell Inc., whose roots can be traced to Daitch Crystal Dairies (established 1919).http://www.company- histories.com/The-Food-Emporium-Company-History.html Shopwell Inc. was acquired by The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P;) in 1986 and at the time, the company operated the upscale, gourmet banner stores in and around New York City; Westchester County, NY; and Fairfield County, CT. The Food Emporium grew throughout the 1990s, converting many of its New York-area A&P; stores to The Food Emporium and expanding the chain to New Jersey. The 2000s brought new, stronger competition to the New York area, and the chain shrank, receding mostly to Manhattan. At the time of A&P;'s liquidation in 2015, The Food Emporium had 11 stores. The banner was acquired from bankrupt A&P; in late 2015 by Key Food Stores Co-op, Inc., which currently operates seven of The Food Emporium stores. History =Early origins= Food Emporium's history starts in 1919, when Louis Daitch founded Daitch Crystal Dairies, a public company trading on the American Stock Exchange. Over the years, he opened shops in the New York City area selling butter and eggs. Following World War II, Daitch Crystal Dairies enjoyed tremendous growth in the new supermarket format, emerging in the 1950s as a significant chain. In 1955, Daitch and its 34 stores (in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk counties, and in Connecticut, merged with Shopwell Foods' chain of 18 Westchester County supermarkets. Shopwell was founded by Sigmund Rosengarten, who entered the supermarket business as a butcher. The supermarket chain (known under variations of the Daitch and Shopwell names) underwent a period of significant expansion. Within a year, seven new stores were opened and nine more were added by acquiring the Diamond K chain. Daitch's supermarket chain peaked in 1962 with 103 stores, but the company's growth was not focused. It attempted to launch a chain of convenience stores called Shop-Quik and in 1970 opened Shopwell Plaza in Westport, Connecticut, a shopping center that included Daitch's attempt at running a package (liquor) store. In 1973, Daitch changed its name to Shopwell Inc., now headed by Rosengarten's son Martin Rosengarten, who was aided by his sons, Jay and Glen. A year later, the company entered Vermont and Massachusetts; opening a combined seven stores. The venture did not work out, however, and in 1976 the company sold off these units, incurring an $800,000 loss. Following their failure in New England, the Rosengartens took stock of their situation. First, they concluded that for Shopwell to succeed it needed to focus on being a regional chain. The company reached a turning point during a 1979 management meeting. The participants made a chart with the names of the three Rosengartens at the top and 33 vice-presidents listed below them. When asked to whom they reported, the vice-presidents pointed at one another, but no one pointed to the three in charge. The chart became known in company lore as the \\"spaghetti chart.\\" Shopwell was clearly in need of massive reorganization. The number of vice-presidents was reduced to just 12, and Martin Rosengarten turned over active control of the chain to his sons, who were both in their thirties. They began to close stores located in unprofitable areas and allowed other leases to expire, so that the chain was reduced to 65 units. The company also conducted some market research, which revealed the unpleasant truth that Shopwell stores had no discernible image; customers patronized Shopwell stores out of convenience. =Food Emporium launch in 1979= During the course of trimming the size of the chain, the Rosengartens noticed that the remaining stores were mostly located in upper income neighborhoods, such as Manhattan's Upper East Side and in Westchester County. Not only did it make sense to cater to the higher-income customer, the Rosengartens also recognized that no supermarkets in the area were doing much upscale marketing, leaving the business to smaller shops like Zabar's and Balducci's. From these insights came the idea of the Food Emporium format, which would mix regular and specialty items on the same shelves, rather than following the lead of other supermarkets, which at best offered a small gourmet corner. Elsewhere in the country the concept was already being refined, pioneered by Byerly Foods in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1973. Grand Union was already in the process of developing specialty supermarkets in the New York market, making Shopwell's decision to launch the Food Emporium format in 1979 a timely one. By the end of 1983, Shopwell had converted 17 of its 55 stores to the Food Emporium format. Another seven would be converted over the next two years, but the conversions proved costly. It took about 18 months for a Food Emporium to attain profitability, rather than the industry average of around eight months. Shopwell also tried moving into the economy sector of the supermarket trade, an effort that failed. A One Stop Shop cash-and-carry store opened in 1984 and closed that same year. As a result of these and other factors, Shopwell lost $3.4 million in 1985 on sales of $464 million, and the Rosengarten brothers in 1986 (their father retired the year before) announced they were looking to sell the company. =A&P; takes over= The Rosengartens announced the sale of Shopwell to A&P; in 1986 for $64 million. A&P;, which acquired 91.5 percent of Shopwell's common shares, picked up 25 Shopwell stores, 3 Value Center Stores, 2 distribution centers, and a dairy, but the main the reason it acquired Shopwell was to add The Food Emporium format to its portfolio. A&P; was in the process of developing a format similar to The Food Emporium, called \\"A&P; Food Bazaar\\"; A&P; ditched the concept in favor of buying Shopwell and growing The Food Emporium chain. In 1985, in an effort to strengthen its position in Canada, A&P; acquired Dominion Foods and used The Food Emporium name in some stores soon after the acquisition. This format garnished well into the mid-1990s. After A&P;'s 1983 purchase of the Kohl's Food Stores chain in Wisconsin and Illinois, many of those stores were re- branded as Kohl's Food Emporium; new stores were opened as such. The Food Emporium remained the primary format of the Kohl's stores until the Midwestern chain folded in 2003; the Kohl's department store chain was not affected. =A&P; bankruptcy and Key Food takeover= A&P; entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 12, 2010, and exited on March 13, 2012. On September 11, 2012, A&P; announced its intention to sell its 16 The Food Emporium stores as part of its plan to return to profitability.http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120911/RETAIL_APPAREL/120919975 A&P; puts Food Emporium up for salehttp://www.northjersey.com/news/169422396_A.html A&P; to sell off Food Emporium stores The stores, as a chain, did not attract enough interest, and a few were sold piecemeal to Morton Williams and CVS, while leases were not renewed at others. On July 20, 2015, A&P; announced that it was filing for bankruptcy for a second time. The company liquidated in late 2015, selling as many stores as possible to competitors, and closing the remainder. At the time, The Food Emporium operated 11 stores in Manhattan, and one in New Canaan, Connecticut. Almost stores were sold to other operators, with the exception of the unprofitable 59th Street Bridgemarket store and One other store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Key Food Coop. acquired the trademark and rights to The Food Emporium brand name and intellectual assets, including the website and mobile app during the A&P; bankruptcy auction. Key Food also acquired four The Food Emporium stores during the liquidation. The other The Food Emporium stores were purchased by Morton Williams, Gristedes, and Acme Markets. Key Food affiliates run the eight stores currently in operation, of which four are Food Emporium stores acquired from A&P;, and three are additional stores opened by Key Food. In popular culture The Food Emporium is known for its late 1980s- early 1990s slogan, \\"Someone Made a Store Just for Me\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB6zOdfigS0 References External links * Official website Category:The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company Category:American companies established in 1919 Category:Retail companies established in 1919 Category:Supermarkets of the United States Category:Economy of New Jersey Category:Economy of New York (state) ","title":"The Food Emporium"},{"id":"2359626","text":"Bloody Bones is a bogeyman figure feared by children and is sometimes called Rawhead, Tommy Rawhead, or Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones.

Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1902 ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 117.

Dictionary of the English Language. (Vol. 2, 1777 ed.) The stories originated in Great Britain where they were particularly common in Lancashire and Yorkshire,Wright, Elizabeth Mary (1913). Rustic Speech and Folk-Lore. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press. p. 199.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. pp. 338-339. . and spread to North America where the stories were common in the Southern United States.Frederic Gomes Cassidy and Joan Houston Hall (1985). Dictionary of American Regional English. Harvard University Press. p. 486. Folklore Bloody Bones is sometimes regarded as a water demon haunting deep ponds, oceans and old marl pits (which often became filled with water to form ponds) where it dragged children into the depths, much like the grindylow and Jenny Greenteeth. Children were told to \\"keep away from the marl-pit or rawhead and bloody bones will have you.\\" Ruth Tongue said in Somerset Folklore that he \\"lived in a dark cupboard, usually under the stairs. If you were heroic enough to peep through a crack you would get a glimpse of the dreadful, crouching creature, with blood running down his face, seated waiting on a pile of raw bones that had belonged to children who told lies or said bad words. If you peeped through the keyhole he got you anyway.\\" As quoted in Briggs, Katharine (1967). The Fairies in Tradition and Literature. Routledge. p. 68. Old Bloody Bones is a Cornish version of Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones according to F. W. Jones in Old Cornwall. Old Bloody Bones inhabited Knockers Hole near the village of Baldhu. There was said to have been a massacre in the area, and it is suggested that he was a ghost or evil spirit attracted by the carnage.As retold in Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. p. 316. . In the Southern United States, Rawhead and Bloody Bones are sometimes regarded as two individual creatures or two separate parts of the same monster. One is a skull stripped of skin that bites its victims (Rawhead) and its companion is a dancing headless skeleton (Bloody Bones). In one cautionary tale a gossip loses his head to the monster as punishment for his wicked tongue. Legends about Bloody Bones eventually made their way into African-American tradition as well as spreading to other parts of the United States.\\"Bloody Bones: A History of Southern Scares\\" Deep South Magazine Popular culture In the opening of \\"An Evening's Entertainment\\" (published 1925), English ghost story writer M. R. James mourns the loss of unrecorded folklore tales, citing \\"Rawhead and Bloody Bones\\" as an example of such a case where the name survives but the tale behind the name is lost. \\"We hear, indeed, of sheeted spectres with saucer eyes, and ‚Äî still more intriguing ‚Äî of 'Rawhead and Bloody Bones' (an expression which the Oxford Dictionary traces back to 1550), but the context of these striking images eludes us. Here, then, is a problem which has long obsessed me; but I see no means of solving it finally. The aged grandams are gone, and the collectors of folk-lore began their work in England too late to save most of the actual stories which the grandams told. Yet such things do not easily die quite out...\\" In the novel Cold Days, in The Dresden Files series, a Rawhead is a creature native to the Never-Never. It appears as a large, skinless creature with a gaping many-jawed mouth. Its form is made from the discarded remains of pigs and cows, the bodies of children, and grown adults if it gets large enough to consume them. The short story \\"Rawhead Rex\\" was first published in Clive Barker's Books of Blood Vol. III. In the story Rawhead is accidentally awakened by the townsfolk of the rural town of Zeal, Kent. He goes on a murderous rampage killing and eating townspeople, including numerous children, and the Vicar of the town. He is a giant nine-foot-tall humanoid creature with a giant, sharp-toothed head. It is finally defeated by a talisman depicting a pregnant woman, the antithesis of the monster and the only thing it fears. The story was later turned into the movie Rawhead Rex (1986) which Barker has disowned, although he is the credited screenwriter. In the television series Supernatural (Season 1, Episode 12 \\"Faith\\"), Dean and Sam rescue two children hiding in a cupboard in the basement of a house. Sam leaves with the children just before Dean is attacked by the Rawhead and thrown to the ground. Despite the fact that they are both in a puddle of water, Dean uses his taser to electrocute the Rawhead, killing it and severely injuring himself. Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a song called \\"Rawhead and Bloodybones\\" on their album Peepshow, which starts out, \\"Bad words or bad deeds/unpunished invite grief.\\" Rawhead and Bloody Bones appear in a Hellboy and the B.P.R.D. story in England. \\"Bloody bones gon' get you\\" is repeated as the outro in Yelawolf's 2017 song 'Shadows' (ft Josh Hadley, on the Trial By Fire album); sung by Nashville-based gospel quartet, the McCrary Sisters. In Laurell K. Hamilton's 1996 novel Bloody Bones, Magnus Bouvier explains to Anita Blake how his family captured and imprisoned Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones in order to feed off of its magical blood and increase their own power. In Susanna Clarke's 2004 novel Johnathan Strange and Mr Norrell, the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair refers to \\"raw head and bloody bones\\" as one of a number of shapes he might have to take in the event of magical combat, implying that this is a form which the Faeries take to achieve certain ends, rather than a distinct sort of creature from Faerie beings.

A convert to Roman Catholicism, her later works frequently featured Catholic themes and beliefs. Her last name rhymes with \\"skies,\\" not \\"keys.\\" Life and career Frances Parkinson Wheeler was born in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her mother, Louise Fuller Johnson, was the daughter of Edward Carlton Johnson, who was born in Newbury, Vermont. In 1868, Louise married her first husband, James Underhill, a New York lawyer, and they had a son, James Underhill, Jr., who eventually became a geological engineer and lived in Colorado. In 1878, Louise became a widow. She then married Classics scholar John Henry Wheeler, a graduate of Harvard (B.A. 1871; A.M. 1875) and the University of Bonn (PhD 1879), who taught at Bowdoin College before being appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia. Their only child, Frances Parkinson Wheeler, was named after paternal grandmother Frances Cochran Parkinson Wheeler. Illness forced John Henry Wheeler to resign his professorship and the family moved to Newbury, Vermont, where John Henry Wheeler died. Louise then married Boston lawyer Albert Pillsbury. The couple divorced in 1897. When Louise Fuller Johnson Wheeler Pillsbury was sixty-seven years old, she married a twenty-two year old Newbury dairy farmer named William Taisey. Frances learned to read from her grandmother Wheeler. She said the most valuable education she received was a year she spent in Europe in 1895. Her formal education was mainly received at Miss Winsor's School in Boston. She attempted but failed to gain admittance to Bryn Mawr College. On June 8, 1904, eighteen-year-old Frances married forty-year-old Henry (Harry) Wilder Keyes. Harry Keyes, a Harvard graduate, was from Haverhill, New Hampshire. He inherited Pine Grove Farm (formerly called the General Moses Dow Farm) from his father. He was also a banker and Republican politician who served one term as Governor of New Hampshire (1917-1919) before his election to the United States Senate (1919-1937). Frances Parkinson Keyes relates her story of their courtship in her first autobiography, Roses in December and her story of their marriage in her second autobiography, All Flags Flying. According to Keyes, before their marriage, she extracted a promise from Harry that should they have a daughter she would be given the opportunity to attend college. Frances and Harry had three sons together: Henry Wilder Keyes, Jr. (b. 1905), John Parkinson Keyes (b. 1907), and Francis (called Peter) Keyes (b. 1912). All three sons attended Harvard University. Keyes began writing while living at Pine Grove Farm. Her first article, \\"The Pride and Form of Mourning\\" was published in November 1917 in a New York magazine called The Chronicle. It endorsed the idea that women who had lost a loved one in the war should wear a gold star as a symbol of their sacrifice. Next came the publication of her sketch of her grandmother Frances Parkinson in The Granite Monthly, a New Hampshire magazine that went on to publish more of Keyes's historical sketches and a few of her stories. Greater success was achieved with the publication of her article \\"Satisfied Reflections of a Semi-Bostonian\\" in the Atlantic Monthly in December 1918. Her first novel, The Old Gray Homestead was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1919. After moving to Washington, D.C., Keyes wrote a series of articles for Good Housekeeping magazine titled \\"Letters from a Senator's Wife.\\" These were eventually collected into a book by the same name, one of three nonfiction books she wrote about her experiences in Washington. (The others were Capital Kaleidoscope and All Flags Flying. Her 1941 novel All That Glitters is also about Washington politics.) A Keyes work was featured in The Delineator for June 1922 In 1934 Keyes received an honorary Litt.D. from Bates College. Upon her spouse's death in 1938, she wrote books and magazine articles prolifically. Her novels are set in New England, Virginia, Louisiana, Normandy and South America, reflecting her upbringing and extensive travel. In the 1950s, she purchased the historic Beauregard House in New Orleans‚Äô French Quarter and became a fixture of New Orleans life. The house was built by the grandfather of chess master Paul Morphy, whose life is the subject of Keyes' book The Chess Players. The circumstances of the house's construction and early habitation are told in that book. Many of Keyes' books are set in south Louisiana, and she eloquently described societal life and conventions in her historical novels. Keyes' novel Blue Camellia tells about the development of areas in south Louisiana from swampland to productive rice farms. The River Road concerns sugar plantations of the Mississippi River Delta and Crescent Carnival (her first Louisiana novel) tells the history of Carnival since the 1890s (with a good deal about Creole culture and its decline during that period). Once On Esplanade: A Cycle Between Two Creole Weddings is a fictionalized biography, originally written for teenage girls, of the Creole woman who provided Keyes with much of her understanding of Creole life between the Civil War and the First World War. She went to great lengths to research her subject matter and ensure the historical, geographical, linguistic and even scientific accuracy of her writings. Many of her books include a dozen or more real people among the characters, many famous, some obscure and some even still living at the time she wrote them into her books (with their permission, of course). Keyes traveled on location to learn about her topics and enlisted local historians and residents to assist her. The meticulousness of her detailed accounts make her novels valuable tools for learning about a time long past and customs that have died away. Keyes' former residence in Washington, D.C. Modern readers will find her depictions of African-American characters generally regressive and simplistic, and there are occasional patches of the pre-World War II fashionable anti-Semitism in her Jewish characters. Some of her Irish and Italian characters are clich√©d, or even burlesques of stereotypes. While Keyes was a popular author of the 1940s and 50s, existing editions of her books are becoming rare, and many libraries have removed her books from their shelves. There are a number of fan discussion sites devoted to her work, especially her Catholicism, which appeals to her many Catholic fans. Keyes' conversion to Catholicism can be traced through her writings. As her world expanded from that of an educated New Englander to an increasingly sophisticated political wife and international traveler, so did her interest in the Catholic religion. She met many devout Catholics who were leaders beyond the realm of the Church. In the introduction to \\"Tongues of Fire,\\" her book about Christian missionaries fueled by the Holy Spirit, she humorously notes that it may have been during the hour-long sermons of the Congregationalist church that she \\"took her first steps toward Catholicism.\\" Keyes died in 1970, at the age of 84, in New Orleans. Louisiana and Mississippi Valley novels The first of Keyes' novels set in Louisiana was Crescent Carnival, which tells the story of three generations of two intertwined families. The Breckenridges are Protestants, while the Fontaines are Catholic Louisiana Creoles, and the plot hinges on the way that pride and misfortune conspire with cultural and political differences to keep prospective lovers from marrying. The cycle of failure only ends with two people have the courage to defy the odds and accept their love for each other. Carnival celebrations‚Äîmostly Carnival balls, but also including Mardi Gras parades‚Äîform the backdrop of many scenes. An incident involving two Mardi Gras parades facing off when they nearly collide is based on a true story, as recorded by Robert Tallent in his book, Mardi Gras. The River Road is set against the backdrop of an old family sugar plantation, and the d'Alvery family that struggles to keep it viable between the two world wars. The River Road is notable among Keyes' books for the tragic endings of two out of the three marriages chronicled in the novel. Most characters do not experience a 'happy ending'. In the UK, The River Road was published as two volumes, The River Road (Parts I-VI of the U.S. publication) and Vail d'Alvery (Parts VII- XI of the U.S. publication). San Francisco Plantation House in 1938 Steamboat Gothic is a true Gothic novel set along Louisiana's famed River Road. The plantation home which inspired this novel is still in existence; it is called \\"San Francisco\\", with mid-Victorian architecture reminiscent of a steamboat. Set between 1865 and the Great Depression, Steamboat Gothic discusses the change in transportation methods from steamboat to railroad and the effect the change had upon the plantations along the River Road. In the UK, the novel was published in two volumes, Steamboat Gothic in 1952 and Larry Vincent in 1953. The first book covers a period from 1869 to 1895, and the second a period from 1897 to 1930. Eyre & Spottiswoode published both titles in the UK. Mrs. Keyes also lived for a time in one of the plantations along the River Road. \\"The Cottage\\" was located north of the area known as Duncan's Point and was the setting for her novel, The River Road. \\"The Cottage\\" burned to the ground in the 1960s. However, the ruins of the place still remain. Blue Camellia is set in the prairie country of South Louisiana and takes place on a rice farm. The protagonist and his wife are transplanted Midwesterners who arrive in Cajun country and see the Cajun culture through the eyes of outsiders. Dining room at Antoine's The murder mystery Dinner at Antoine's, set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, became Keyes' biggest seller (and was also her only mystery, apart from the England-set The Royal Box, which has a few of the same characters). The plot is an interesting twist on the \\"Least Likely Person\\" concept of the murder mystery and is notable for \\"playing fair\\" with the reader: all the clues you need to solve the mystery are embedded in the novel. A subplot involving diplomatic and political manipulation made use of Keyes' experiences in Washington, D.C., as a Senator's wife. Madame Castel's Lodger is a fictionalized biography of General P. G. T. Beauregard. Keyes' other Civil War novel is The Chess Players a highly fictionalized biography of Paul Morphy, the world chess champion who was born in New Orleans. Keyes' Louisiana novels are loosely tied together by bits of common background that pop up in various books. Antoine's Restaurant appears at least briefly in all but Blue Camellia. General Beauregard also appears in each of the books set before 1900, and is mentioned in some way in all but one of the others (again, the exception is Blue Camellia). Paul Morphy is the lead character in The Chess Players and is discussed in several other books. A slightly ribald anecdote about a panicked Creole bride on her wedding night is told in The River Road and is mentioned in Once on Esplanade, Madame Castel's Lodger, The Chess Players and others. The Villere family are at center stage in Once on Esplanade and reappear (especially Madame Claiborne n√©e Villere, Keyes' friend) in most of the other Louisiana books. The reader has the sense of a single, unified narrative world underlying the entire Louisiana set of novels. Her Louisiana novels contained lengthy forewords or postscripts detailing her background research (including bibliographies) and listing the many people who provided her with information and/or inspiration. Beauregard-Keyes House Her home in New Orleans, the Beauregard-Keyes House in the Vieux Carr√©, is now a museum. Formerly lived in, but not owned by, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard, Keyes restored the mansion to its Victorian glory, and her studio remains on display, complete with manuscripts. Now known as the Beauregard- Keyes House and Garden, the museum contains extensive Keyes correspondences, as well as her collections of dolls, fans, adult-sized costumes collected on her world travels and rare porcelain veilleuses, a kind of teapot in which the contents‚Äîanything from tea to milk‚Äîare kept warm by a small votive light. The veilleuse has the added bonus of serving as a nightlight and it was most commonly utilized at bedtime. Mrs. Keyes' mentioned the use of a veilleuse in several of her novels. Her veilleuse collection was and is one of the most extensive in the world, second only to one in Trenton, Tennessee.

Geography Ascoli Satriano, Carapelle, Foggia, Orta Nova, Cerignola are nearby towns. History Ordona lies near the ancient site of Herdonia or Herdoniae, a Roman town where Hannibal fought a major battle against the Roman Army. The ruins of Herdonia were discovered in the years after the Second World War, and remain only partially excavated; they are a short drive from the present-day town. The ancient centre, founded by the Daunians, immediately enjoyed a noteworthy development and saw its maximum splendour. Its economic decline began during the 4th Century BC. The construction of defensive walls during this period suggests a period of battles with other centres in the region, probably comprising clashes with the Greek hegemonic cities in the territory, among them neighbouring Taranto.http://www.initalytoday.com/apulia/ordona/index.htm It passed over to the Romans, with the rest of Apulia, after the wars of the Greek-Messapian League, commanded by King Pyrrhus of Epirus (280-275 BC). Herdonia was a protagonist during the Second Punic War (219-202 BC) and in particular, during the events linked to the war's most famous battle at Cannae on 2 August 216 BC. According to the Roman historian Livy, after the Battle of Cannae the City passed to Hannibal, but then was soon recovered by the Romans, in 214 BC; it was taken once more by the Carthaginian General Hannibal who demolished it completely and saw its population transferred to Metaponto and Turi. From this moment on, the city did not recover until its insertion along the Via Traiana route, a coastal alternative of the Via Appia (Appian Way), at the beginning of the 2nd Century AD. Today‚Äôs central habitation began in the 9th Century, but had difficulties in developing due to terrible conditions in the territory. In fact, during the Medieval era, the Tavoliere delle Puglie (Apulian Table) lost its agricultural vocation and became a main transhumance for sheep arriving from all of central Italy. The Jesuits took over the centre and tried to push Ordona‚Äôs economy by reclaiming part of its territory and allowing families to settle here. In 1774, Ordona became part of Royal Bourbon property, allowing important new reclamation work to take place throughout the entire 19th Century. Remains from the Roman Erdonia are situated in the following areas: the Forum, the Augustea Basilica, a part of the Via Traiana route where one can visit the remains of shops and the Market (Macellum), the remains of a temple from the Imperial era, the Amphitheatre and thermal baths with mosaic flooring. Below this level, in the area of the Basilica, finds uncovered tombs and houses from the Daunian city. The diffusion of Christianity is testified by the remains of a Paleochristian Basilica from the 6th Century AD. Today‚Äôs digs have still not touched all the various levels and the Herdonia site could still reserve many surprises for archaeologists and enthusiastic visitors. Economy Ordona's economy is agricultural.

It is a successor of the Yamna culture, Catacomb culture and Poltavka culture. It is co-ordinate and probably closely related to the Andronovo culture, its eastern neighbor. Whether the Srubnaya culture originated in the east, west, or was a local development, is disputed among archaeologists. The name comes from Russian —Å—Ä—É–± (srub), \\"timber framework\\", from the way graves were constructed. Animal parts were buried with the body. Distribution The Srubnaya culture occupied the area along and above the north shore of the Black Sea from the Dnieper eastwards along the northern base of the Caucasus to the area abutting the north shore of the Caspian Sea, west of the Ural Mountains. Historical testimony indicate that the Srubnaya culture was succeeded by the Cimmerians and Scythians. Characteristics The Srubnaya culture is named for its use of timber constructions within its burial pits. Its cemeteries consisted of five to ten kurgans. Burials included the skulls and forelegs of animals and ritual hearths. Stone cists were occasionally employed. Srubnaya settlements consisted of semi-subterranean and two-roomed houses. The presence of bronze sickles, grinding stones, domestic cattle, sheep and pigs indicate that the Srubnaya engaged in both agriculture and stockbreeding. Language The Srubnaya culture is generally considered to have been Iranian. It has been suggested as a staging area from which the Iranian peoples migrated across the Caucasus into the Iranian Plateau. Physical type Physical remains of Srubnaya people have has revealed that they were massively built Europoids with largely dolichocephalic skulls. Skulls from the early (Pokrovskiy) phase of Srubnaya are purely dolichocephalic, and very similar to those of the earlier Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture, Abashevo culture and Sintashta culture, and the western areas of the contemporary Andronovo culture. They differ from the less dolichocephalic skulls of the Potapovka culture. With the expansion of the Srubnaya culture onto the southern steppe, Srubnaya skulls become less dolichocephalic, probably through the absorption of elements from the earlier Yamnaya culture and Poltavka culture. In later phases however, dolichocephaly increases again among the Srubnaya. The physical type of the Srubnaya is very similar to that of the succeeding Scythians, suggesting that the Scythians were largely descended from the Srubnaya.  Genetics  A reconstructed hut of the Srubnaya culture. In a study published on 10 October 2015, 14 individuals of the Srubnaya culture could be surveyed. Extractions from 100% of the males (six men from 5 different cemeteries) were determined to be of Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a1. Extractions of mtDNA from fourteen individuals were determined to represent five samples of haplogroup H, four samples of haplogroup U5, two samples of T1, one sample of T2, one sample of K1b, one of J2b and one of I1a. A 2017 genetic study published in Scientific Reports found that the Scythians shared similar mitochondrial lineages with the Srubnaya culture. The authors of the study suggested that the Srubnaya culture was ancestral to the Scythians. In 2018, a genetic study of the earlier Srubnaya culture, and later peoples of the Scythian cultures, including the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, was published in Science Advances. Six males from two sites ascribed to the Srubnaya culture were analysed, and were all found to possess haplogroup R1a1a1. Cimmerian, Sarmatian and Scythian males were however found have mostly haplogroup R1b1a1a2, although one Sarmatian male carried haplogroup R1a1a1. The authors of the study suggested that rather than being ancestral to the Scythians, the Srubnaya shared with them a common origin from the earlier Yamnaya culture. In a genetic study published in Science in 2018, the remains of twelve individuals ascribed to the Srubnaya culture was analyzed. Of the six samples of Y-DNA extracted, three belonged to R1a1a1b2 or subclades of it, one belonged to R1, one belonged to R1a1, and one belonged to R1a1a. With regards to mtDNA, five samples belonged to subclades of U, five belonged to subclades of H, and two belonged to subclades of T. People of the Srubnaya culture were found to be closely related to people of the Corded Ware culture, the Sintashta culture, Potapovka culture and the Andronovo culture. These were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic. The genetic data suggested that these cultures were ultimately derived of a remigration of Central European peoples with steppe ancestry back into the steppe.

Early life and family Thompson was born Catherine Louise Fink in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1909, the second of the four children of Leo George Fink (1874‚Äì1939), a Jewish, Austrian-born pawnbroker and jeweler, and his American born wife, Harriet Adelaide \\"Hattie\\" Tetrick, a Christian (died 1954). Thompson's parents were married on November 29, 1905, in East St. Louis, St. Clair County, Illinois.Biographical endnotes from Sam Irvin's biography of Thompson, Kay Thompson: From Funny Face to Eloise, published 2010 by Simon & Schuster; accessed May 15, 2014.Kay Thompson biography at eloisewebsite.com; accessed May 15, 2014. Thompson's siblings were: Blanche Margaret Hurd (1907‚Äì2002), George \\"Bud\\" Fink, Jr. (1911‚Äì1952) and Marian Antoinette Doenges (1912‚Äì1960). Radio work Thompson began her career in the 1930s as a singer and choral director for radio. Her first big break was as a regular singer on the Bing Crosby-Woodbury Show Bing Crosby Entertains (CBS, 1933‚Äì34). This led to a regular spot on The Fred Waring-Ford Dealers Show (NBC, 1934‚Äì35) and then, with conductor Lennie Hayton, she co-founded The Lucky Strike Hit Parade (CBS, 1935) where she met (and later married) trombonist Jack Jenney. Thompson and Her Rhythm Singers joined Andr√© Kostelanetz and His Orchestra for the hit series The Chesterfield Radio Program (CBS, 1936), followed by It's Chesterfield Time (CBS, 1937) for which Thompson and her large choir were teamed with Hal Kemp and His Orchestra.\\"kaythompsonwebsite.com\\" , page 67~73.\\"Kay Thompson - \\"All Over Nothing at All\\" (1937) - YouTube\\"\\"1937 Kay Thompson - Carelessly - YouTube\\"\\"1937 Kay Thompson - There's A Lull In My Life - YouTube\\" For her motion picture debut, Thompson and her choir performed two songs in the Republic Pictures musical Manhattan Merry-Go-Round (1937). In 1939, she reunited with Andr√© Kostelanetz for Tune-Up Time (CBS), a show that was produced by radio legend William Spier (who later married Thompson in 1942). On an installment of Tune-Up Time in April 1939, 16-year-old Judy Garland was a guest. It was at this time that Thompson first met and worked with Garland, developing a close personal friendship and professional association that lasted the rest of Garland's life.

Standing, from left: Ronald Reagan, Nick Adams, Lloyd Bridges, Mickey Rooney, Edgar Bergen, Jack Carson, Ralph Bellamy, Kay Thompson, Dean Jones. Seated, from left, Carolyn Jones and Dick Powell. In 1943, Thompson signed an exclusive contract with MGM to become the studio's top vocal arranger, vocal coach, and choral director. She served as main vocal arranger for many of producer Arthur Freed's MGM musicals and as vocal coach to such stars as Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Frank Sinatra, and June Allyson. Some of the many MGM musicals Thompson was the vocal arranger for include Ziegfeld Follies (1946), The Harvey Girls (1946), Till the Clouds Roll By (1946), Good News (1947), and The Pirate (1948). As a film actress, Thompson only played one major role: that of fashion editor Maggie Prescott in the musical Funny Face (1957) for Paramount Pictures. Reunited with producer and songwriter Roger Edens and director Stanley Donen, her colleagues from MGM, Thompson garnered critical praise for her stylish turn as an editor based on real-life Harper's Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland, opening the film with her splashy \\"Think Pink!\\" and performing duets with Astaire and Hepburn. In a December 6, 2006, interview on Turner Classic Movies, Donen said that Funny Face was made at Paramount with a primarily MGM crew, including Donen, Edens and Thompson, because Paramount Pictures would not release Hepburn for any film except one made at Paramount. Thompson only acted in one additional feature film, 1970's Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon, because, according to its star Liza Minnelli, Thompson disliked the slow speed of movie production.Robert Osborne: \\"Why didn't she do more movies?\\" Liza Minnelli: \\"She didn't like it [filmmaking]... It was too slow\\", Private Screenings, TCM, December 11, 2010; accessed May 15, 2014. Night Club Thompson left MGM in 1947 after working on The Pirate to create the night club act \\"Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers\\", with the four Williams men as her backup singers and dancers. They made their debut in Las Vegas in 1947 and became an overnight sensation. Within a year, they were the highest paid nightclub act in the world, breaking records wherever they appeared. She wrote the songs and Robert Alton did the original choreography for the act. Eloise Thompson, who lived at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, became most notable as the author of the Eloise series of children's books. The Eloise character was developed by the author based on her childhood imaginary friend and alter ego, with a voice in which Thompson spoke throughout her life, according to her biographer, filmmaker Sam Irvin. Thompson's goddaughter, Liza Minnelli, was often speculated as a possible model for Eloise. The four books in the series, each illustrated by Hilary Knight, are Eloise (Simon & Schuster, 1955), Eloise in Paris (Simon & Schuster, 1957), Eloise at Christmastime (Random House, 1958) and Eloise in Moscow (Simon & Schuster, 1959). They follow the adventures of a precocious six-year-old girl who lives at The Plaza. All were bestsellers upon release and have been adapted into television projects. Thompson composed and performed a Top 40 hit song, \\"Eloise\\" (Cadence Records, 1956).\\"kaythompsonwebsite.com\\" , page 337~339. Whitburn, Joel. The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 3rd ed. New York: Billboard Publications, 1987, page 304.\\"Kay Thompson sings - YouTube\\"\\"RARE Novlety Record \\"Eloise\\" by Kay Thompson - YouTube\\" A fifth book, Eloise Takes a Bawth, was posthumously published by Simon & Schuster in 2002, culled from Thompson's original manuscripts once slated for 1964 publication by Harper & Row. However, in 1964 Thompson was burned out on Eloise; she blocked publication and took all but the first book out of print.Amy Benfer. \\"Will the real Eloise please stand up?\\", salon.com, June 1, 1999. Recordings As a singer, Thompson made very few records, starting with one side, \\"Take a Number from One to Ten\\", on a 1934 session by the Tom Coakley band. In 1935, she recorded four sides for Brunswick (\\"You Hit The Spot\\", \\"You Let Me Down,\\" \\"Don't Mention Love To Me,\\" and \\"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\\"), and another four sides for Victor. The 4 Brunswick sides are excellent examples of mid-1930s sophisticated New York cabaret singing. She later recorded for Capitol, Columbia, Decca, and, most importantly, for MGM Records, which issued her only complete album of songs, in 1954. In February 1956, Thompson wrote and recorded the song \\"Eloise\\" at Cadence Records with an orchestra conducted by Archie Bleyer. The song debuted on March 10, 1956, and became a Top 40 hit, selling over 100,000 copies. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Thompson mentored the solo career of the young Andy Williams. She helped land him a regular singing spot on NBC-TV's new late-night series, The Tonight Show, hosted by Steve Allen. She got her friend Archie Bleyer to add Williams to the roster of artists on his label Cadence Records where she wrote many of the songs he recorded, including the 1958 Top 20 hit \\"Promise Me, Love\\". In 1963, Thompson paired the Christmas song \\"Holiday Season\\"--a song she had written and first performed in 1945-- with the 1942 Irving Berlin Christmas song Happy Holiday, and gave it to Williams to sing. This medley arrangement and recording became a very popular hit, and has since been covered by many artists. Although it had been denied for decades, Williams claimed in his 2009 memoir, Moon River and Me (Viking Press), that he and Thompson had been secret lovers for several years, despite the age gap between them. She later recorded a spoken-word album for Signature Records, Let's Talk About Russia, which detailed her adventures in Moscow. Signature released a single of two songs by Thompson, \\"Dasvidanya\\" and \\"Moscow Cha Cha\\". She served as an adviser to Patti Page's 1957 television series, The Big Record. Thompson kept busy with nightclub and television performances, as well as overseeing her successful \\"Eloise\\" franchise. She returned to live in New York in 1969. Immediately following the death of Judy Garland in 1969, Thompson appeared with goddaughter Liza Minnelli in Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon (1970). In 1974, Thompson directed a fashion show at the Palace of Versailles, featuring a performance by Minnelli and the collections of Halston, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, and Anne Klein. Death Thompson eventually moved into Minnelli's Upper East Side penthouse. On July 2, 1998, she was found unconscious in bed and rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital, where she was officially pronounced dead, aged 88. Personal life Thompson was married twice: * Jack Jenney, trombonist and bandleader, married 1937, divorced 1939 * William Spier, radio producer, married 1942, divorced 1947 After her second marriage failed, Thompson began a secret affair with Andy Williams (who was half her age) from 1947 to 1961.Sam Irwin, Kay Thompson: From Funny Face to Eloise (NY: Simon & Schuster, 2011),167-323.

Thompson moved to Rome and never remarried. Legacy *The original soundtrack to Funny Face has been remastered and reissued as an expanded 60th anniversary edition, with eight alternate tracks, including four featuring Thompson. Most of her work for MGM has been preserved and released on Rhino/Turner Classic Movies original soundtrack series, including little-known contributions she did for films such as Meet the People (1944) and Abbott and Costello in Hollywood (1945). Her 1930s recordings are available on the CD \\"Kay Thompson: Queen of Swing Vocal & Her Rhythm Singers\\" (Baldwin Street Records), produced and annotated by Ted Ono. The rest of her recording career is compiled on the 3-CD box set \\"Think Pink! A Kay Thompson Party\\" (Sepia Records), produced and annotated by Thompson biographer Sam Irvin. * In 2003 Thompson was posthumously inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. * Minnelli recreated Thompson's nightclub act for her 2009 Tony Award-winning Broadway event, Liza's at the Palace. A CD cast recording, a PBS television special, and a DVD followed. Liza's at the Palace opened at New York's Palace theater, an affectionate salute to Thompson, her godmother. Supported by a quartet of singer-dancers standing in for the original Williams Brothers, Minnelli performed songs (with the original vocal arrangements) from Thompson's act, including \\"Clap Yo' Hands\\" \\"Kay Thompson & Fred Astaire - Clap Yo' Hands - Song from Funny Face (9 of 10) - YouTube\\"\\"Liza's At The Palace - Clap Yo' Hands - YouTube\\" and \\"Hello, Hello\\".\\"Kay Thompson Website\\"\\"kaythompsonwebsite.com\\" , page 244, 311.At The Palace - Hello, Hello - YouTube\\" * There is an exhaustively-researched list of all of Thompson's hundreds of credits for radio, TV, movies, stage, books, and music at the \\"Kayographies\\" tab at Kay Thompson Website.

Completed just before the beginning of World War I, the ship saw no action and was sunk by a magazine explosion in 1916 with the loss of 248 officers and enlisted men. The Italians blamed Austro-Hungarian saboteurs for her loss, but it may have been accidental. Leonardo da Vinci was refloated in 1919 and plans were made to repair her. Budgetary constraints did not permit this, and her hulk was sold for scrap in 1923. Design and description The Conte di Cavour class was designed to counter the French dreadnoughts which caused them to be slower and more heavily armored than the first Italian dreadnought, .Giorgerini, p. 269 The ships were long at the waterline and overall. They had a beam of , and a draft of .Gardiner & Gray, p. 259 The Conte di Cavour-class ships displaced at normal load, and at deep load. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272 They were powered by three sets of Parsons steam turbines, two sets driving the outer propeller shafts and one set the two inner shafts. Steam for the turbines was provided by twenty Blechynden water- tube boilers, eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both fuel oil and coal. Designed to reach a maximum speed of from , Leonardo da Vinci only reached a speed of using . The ships carried enough coal and oilGiorgerini, pp. 268, 272 to give them a range of at . =Armament and armor= Layout of the main armament The main battery of the Conte di Cavour class consisted of thirteen 305-millimeter Model 1909 guns, in five centerline gun turrets, with a twin-gun turret superfiring over a triple-gun turret in fore and aft pairs, and a third triple turret amidships.Hore, p. 175 Their secondary armament consisted of eighteen guns mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull. For defense against torpedo boats, the ships carried fourteen guns; thirteen of these could be mounted on the turret tops, but they could be positioned in 30 different locations, including some on the forecastle and upper decks. They were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.Giorgerini, pp. 268, 277‚Äì278 The Conte di Cavour-class ships had a complete waterline armor belt that had a maximum thickness of amidships, which reduced to towards the stern and towards the bow. They had two armored decks: the main deck was thick on the flat that increased to on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The second deck was thick. Frontal armor of the gun turrets was in thickness and the sides were thick. The armor protecting their barbettes ranged in thickness from . The walls of the forward conning tower were 280 millimeters thick.Giorgerini, pp. 270‚Äì272McLaughlin, p. 421 Construction and service Leonardo da Vinci, named after the artist and inventor,Silverstone, p. 300 was built by the Odero Shipbuilding Co., at their Sestri Ponente, Genoa shipyard. She was laid down on 18 July 1910, launched on 14 October 1911, and completed on 17 May 1914. The ship saw no combat during the war and spent most of it at anchor.Giorgerini, p. 272 Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to actively deploy the fleet. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro- Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.Halpern, pp. 141-142, 150 =Sinking= The upside-down hulk of Leonardo da Vinci under repair She capsized in Taranto harbor,Giorgerini, pp. 272, 277 in of water,Allen, p. 23 after an internal magazine explosion on the night of 2/3 August 1916 while loading ammunition. Casualties included 21 officers and 227 enlisted men.Whitley, pp. 157‚Äì158 The subsequent investigation blamed Austro-Hungarian saboteurs, but unstable propellant may well have been responsible.Caruana, pp. 426‚Äì427 The Regia Marina wanted to raise the ship and rejected initial plans to demolish the wreck with explosives. They ultimately settled on a plan to make the ship's hull airtight and raise it using compressed air and pontoons. This required that the ship's coal, ammunition, and gun turrets be removed or cut loose, respectively, by divers to reduce her weight. A further complication was that the largest drydock in Taranto had a maximum depth of only and the upside-down Leonardo da Vinci drew . This meant that her funnels had to be cut off as well.Allen, pp. 24‚Äì26 All of this preparation required over two years and the ship was refloated on 17 September 1919. A deep channel had been dredged from her location to the drydock and she was moved there. A special wooden framework had to be built to support her, still inverted, after the water in the drydock had been drained. Her decks were not designed to handle the stresses involved in her unique situation and had to be reinforced to withstand the weight of the hull and preliminary repairs were made in preparation for righting her. A deep spot in the harbor was dredged for this task and some of ballast were added in spots calculated to assist in the righting effort. The primary work was done by of water pumped into the ship's starboard sideAllen, p. 26 and she was successfully righted on 24 January 1921.Whitley, p. 158 The Regia Marina planned to modernize Leonardo da Vinci by replacing her amidships turret with six anti-aircraft guns, but ultimately lacked the funds to do so and sold her for scrap on 22 March 1923.Preston, p. 176 Footnotes References    * Further reading * * External links * World War I Document Archive: Ship Photo Gallery * A na√Øve ex-voto (votive painting playing the same role as a church ship in Italian culture) depicting the explosion on board the ship is in the chapel of Trecastagni (Sicily), donated by a sailor who \\"miraculously\\" escaped the blast.

Biography Before becoming part of Medeski, Martin & Wood, Martin was part of the New York City Brazilian scene in the 1980s. He performed regularly with Pe De Boi, Batucada and several Bob Moses bands for over a decade. He also joined Chuck Mangione's touring group for three years. Most notably he has developed as a percussionist for The Lounge Lizards and with the John Lurie National Orchestra, and has collaborated with artists such as John Zorn, DJ Logic, Dave Burrell and Miho Hatori. He has also started his own record label, Amulet Records, specializing in eclectic percussion albums. Martin has also collaborated with Iggy Pop, Eyvind Kang, Chris Whitley, DJ Olive, Ikue Mori, John Scofield, Maceo Parker, Calvin Weston, Marty Ehrlich, and Min Xiao-Fen. Martin also sometimes goes by the moniker Illy B. The most notable releases as Illy B include the Illy B Eats series of breakbeat records. DJ Logic convinced Martin to record a breakbeat album for DJs and other producers to use and remix. At the last minute, Martin decided to place an insert which invited remixers to submit their mixes for a follow up compilation, Drop the Needle. Along with his percussion work, Martin is a visual artist. He does printmaking, painting, pencil drawings, and pastel drawings, among other mediums. His work has been displayed in several galleries and is also on the packaging of many Medeski Martin & Wood albums, most notably the cover of Shack-man. 2006 was a prolific year for Martin; he created new chamber compositions for John Zorn's Tzadik label, he released Out Louder on MMW's new label Indirecto, he produced many new artworks, and published a drum book entitled Riddim: Clave of African Origin. on DVD *\\"Billy Martin's LIFE ON DRUMS\\" (VongoleFilms.com) *\\"Billy Martin IN CONCERT\\" (VongoleFilms.com) Discography =Bob Moses= *Visit with the Great Spirit (1983, Gramavision) *Drummingbirds (1984, Amulet) *The Story of Moses (1987, Gramavision) *Time Stood Still (1993, Gramavision) =Ned Rothenberg= *Overlays (1991, Moers) *Real and Imagined Time (1995, Moers) =John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards= *Live in Berlin Vol. 1 & 2 audio and film (1991) *The John Lurie National Orchestra ‚Äì Men with Sticks (1993) *Get Shorty soundtrack (1995) *Fishing with John soundtrack (1998) *African Swim/Manny and Low soundtrack (1999) *The Legendary Marvin Pontiac (1999) =Medeski Martin and Wood= *Notes from the Underground (1991, Amulet) *It's a Jungle in Here (1993, Gramavision/Ryko) *Friday Afternoon in the Universe (1995, Gramavision/Ryko) *Get Shorty soundtrack (1995) *Shack-man (1996, Gramavision/Ryko) *Farmer's Reserve (1996, Indirecto/Amulet) *Wim Wender's The End of Violence soundtrack (1997) *Great Jewish Music: Serge Gainsbourg (1997, Tzadik) *Great Jewish Music ‚Äì Burt Bacharach (1997, Tzadik) *Great Jewish Music: Marc Bolan (1998, Tzadik) *Combustication (1998, Blue Note) *Last Chance to Dance Trance (1999) *Tonic (2000, Blue Note) *The Dropper (2000, Blue Note) *Uninvisible (2002, Blue Note) *End of the World Party (2004, Blue Note) *Voices in the Wilderness (2003, Tzadik) *Let's Go Everywhere (2008) *Radiolarians 1 (2008) *Radiolarians 2 (2009) *Radiolarians 3 (2009) *Radiolarians: The Evolutionary Set (2009) *The Stone: Issue Four (2010) ‚Äì CD to benefit The Stone; live in Japan *20 (March ‚Äì December 2011) ‚Äì collection of tracks (released monthly); celebrating MMW's 20 year anniversary *Free Magic (2012) ‚Äì acoustic live album, recorded in 2007 *Juice (2014) =Iggy Pop= *Avenue B (1999, Virgin) =Oren Bloedow= *Luckiest Boy in the World (1998, Knitting Factory Works) =Chris Whitley= *Perfect Day (2000) =John Scofield= *A Go Go (1998, Verve) *Out Louder (2006, Indirecto) =Samm Bennett and Chunk= *Life of Crime (1991, Knitting Factory Works) =As soloist and chamber music composer= *Starlings (2006, Tzadik) *Black Elk Speaks (2001, Amulet) *Solo Live Tonic (2002, Amulet) =Illy B Eats= *Illy B Eats Vol. 1 ‚Äì Groove Bang and Jive Around (2001, Amulet) *Drop the Needle (2001, Amulet) *Antidote (2002, Amulet) *The Turntable Sessions Vol. 1 (2002, Amulet) *Illy B Eats Vol. 2 (Amulet) *Illy B Eats Vol. 3 (Amulet) =Socket= *January 14 & 15 (2005, Amulet) =Dave Burrell= *Consequences (2006, Amulet) =G.

Licensed to Tijuana, the station broadcasts at 92.5 MHz on the FM radio band. XHRM's concession is held by the Mexican company Comunicaci√≥n XERSA, S.A. de C.V., and XHRM is one of three Tijuana/San Diego stations programmed by Local Media San Diego LLC.http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050804/news_1b4radio.html The station's studios are in San Diego's Sorrento Valley district, with transmitting facilities located atop Mount San Antonio in Tijuana.  History  XHRM was tentatively assigned in 1967 to Jos√© Luis Rivas Marentes, with the proposed frequency of 99.3 MHz.DOF 7 October 1967 Rivas Marentes, doing business as Radio Moderna Mexicana, S.A., obtained the concession‚Äînow for 92.5 FM‚Äîon January 19, 1972; while other concessions had been issued earlier, XHRM is recognized as Baja California's first FM station.\\"Radio\\", Instituto Cultural de Baja California 92.5 FM debuted in February 1979 as San Diego's first Urban contemporary FM station, featuring soul, rap, and gospel music. Although owned by a Mexican company (as required by Mexican law), it was programmed by a U.S. company. At the time, it was the only San Diego station managed by blacks and programmed specifically for the black community. XHRM became one of the first stations in the U.S. to regularly play Freestyle songs as a part of their playlist. The combination of Latin-based Freestyle songs along with the station's original mainstream R&B; sound was a success and was the station's signature for the decade. In 1988 and 1989, a dispute opened between the US programmers and the Mexican concession holders. In January 1988, the Tijuana transmitter was toppled in a storm; it took nine months to build a new permanent tower, during which time XHRM's power was drastically cut and the station lost its national advertising accounts. The station's studio equipment also began to fail, which exacerbated its problems. The programmers ceased to pay their monthly fees in a last-ditch effort to get Radio Moderna Mexicana to bail them out. In November 1989, Radio Moderna Mexicana ordered the US programmers to cease operating the station for non- payment. The station, now operated directly by the concessionaire, then changed to \\"Power 92-5\\", playing soft rock and dance music (in essence, a Rhythmic Top 40) and whose flip predated another station that would later flip to the same format in April 1990, XHITZ, who would become XHRM's sister station. By May 1990, XHRM returned to their Urban direction and rebilled itself as \\"Hot 92.5.\\" By that point, however, XHITZ had already made inroads by luring listeners to their station. XHRM later suffered a tragic setback when Rivas Marentes, the founding owner, died in a plane crash near Hermosillo that September. On June 29, 1993, the format changed to modern rock as \\"92.5 The Flash\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-07-02.pdf In January 1998, due to low ratings, the station shifted towards a AAA format, and rebranded as \\"Independent Radio 92/5ive\\", though this resulted in lower ratings. On September 7, 1998, at 7 PM (after XETRA-FM became its sister station), KMCG (\\"Magic 95-7\\") and its R&B; format were moved to the 92.5 frequency.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-09-04.pdf The format would soon evolve to rhythmic oldies under program director Rick Thomas. An on-air slogan, \\"San Diego's Old School\\", highlighted the oldies aspect of the programming. Magic 92.5 went to #1 again in 2007 and remained there for several years. By late 2009, a San Diego company, Finest City Broadcasting, was the programming operator of not only XHRM, but also two other Mexican-licensed stations, XHITZ and XETRA-FM. In January 2010, Local Media of America acquired most of the assets of Finest City Broadcasting, including these programming rights.http://www.thomabravo.com/2010/01/07/thoma-bravo-backed-local-media-of- america-acquires-finest-city-broadcasting/ Local Media of America changed their name to Local Media San Diego LLC in February, 2011.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35222698 In September 2011, XHRM promoted one of its on-air personalities, Todd Himaka, to music director.http://www.vocus.com/invocus/media-moves/radio-moves/new- music-director-announced-for-xhrm-in-san-diego/ In following months, the station began leaning towards Rhythmic AC. This followed Z90.3, Channel 933, and Q96 all tweaking their formats in the Contemporary hit music direction, away from Mainstream Top 40/Dance Top 40, mostly to compete with KEGY. In December 2012, XHRM picked up new competition in the form of KSSX, which happens to reside at the 95.7 frequency that was the previous home of XHRM's current format. On October 6, 2015, Midwest Television (owners of KFMB and KFMB-FM) announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, forming an entity known as SDLocal to manage their collective cluster of stations. The intent of this agreement is to \\"[preserve the] local ownership and operation of San Diego's top-rated radio stations\\". The agreement ended at the end of 2016. Local Media San Diego eventually acquired KFMB and KFMB-FM outright from Tegna, Inc. on March 17, 2020, with KFMB (AM) being concurrently divested to iHeartMedia; Tegna had purchased Midwest Television's stations in 2018. Current On January 10, 2013, the station changed its slogan to \\"The Beat of San Diego.\\" On the same date, the station introduced a new logo. Currently, the station's playlist consists of classic soul and R&B; from the late 1960s to the 1990s (with occasional tracks from the 2000s), disco and classic dance tracks from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, some old school hip-hop and new wave tracks, and no current songs, though the station has added many recent songs from artists such as Bruno Mars and Pharrell Williams. In a nod to their previous rhythmic oldies format and \\"San Diego's Old School\\" slogan, XHRM carries an \\"Old School Block Party\\" program on Saturday nights.http://www.magic925.com/on-air/ External links *Station's official web site *XHRM at radio-locator.com * References Category:Radio stations in Tijuana Category:Rhythmic adult contemporary radio stations Category:Radio stations established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Mexico ","title":"XHRM-FM"},{"id":"2359777","text":"is a 1997 Japanese thriller film written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, starring K≈çji Yakusho, Masato Hagiwara, Tsuyoshi Ujiki and Anna Nakagawa. The story follows a detective investigating a string of gruesome murders where an X is carved into the neck of each victim, and the murderer is found near the victim of each case and remembers nothing of the crime. The film was part of the new wave of Japanese cinema, J-Horror, with other releases like Hideo Nakata's Ring and Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On: The Grudge. The film was released to strong critical acclaim in Japan and internationally, with critics praising Kurosawa's direction as well as the visuals and atmosphere. In 2012, South Korean film director Bong Joon-ho listed the film as one of the greatest films of all time, citing it as having had a strong impact on his career. This is Kurosawa and lead actor Yakusho's first collaboration. Plot Kenichi Takabe (K≈çji Yakusho) is an emotionally repressed police detective with a mentally unstable wife. Takabe investigates a series of bizarre murders in which each victim is killed in the same way, with a large \\"X\\" carved into their neck, but the perpetrator is different each time. In every case the murderers are caught close to the scene of the crime, and although they readily confess to committing the crimes, they never have a substantial motive and cannot explain what drove them to kill. Takabe, together with a psychologist named Sakuma (Tsuyoshi Ujiki), eventually determines that one man is the common thread among the murders, as each person he comes in contact with commits a killing shortly thereafter. The man, called Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), appears to have extreme short-term memory loss; he seems constantly confused about what day it is, where he is, and what his name is. He claims to recall nothing of his past. Mamiya constantly counters Takabe's interrogation with evasive questions regarding Takabe's identity. This drives Takabe nearly insane as he gradually loses his initial calmness. The futility of the case starts to affect his psyche as he becomes more and more volatile, exploding into violent fits of anger. Takabe discovers that Mamiya used to be a student of psychology who researched mesmerism and hypnosis. He comes to realize that Mamiya has no memory problems, and is instead a master of hypnosis, capable of planting criminal suggestions in strangers' minds by exposing them to repetitive sounds, the motion of water, or the flame of a lighter. In an archive, Sakuma finds a videotape of a mysterious man, speculated to be the originator of Japanese mesmerism, and shows it to Takabe. The man is depicted hypnotizing a woman in the late 1800s. She had been under treatment for hysteria and was hypnotized by the man who gestured an \\"X\\" midair. The woman later killed her son in a manner similar to Mamiya's crimes. Sakuma believes the current crimes have a connection to the earlier events, describing Mamiya as a missionary of ceremonial murders. After showing the tape, Sakuma is revealed to have unconsciously drawn an X on his wall, and starts to experience hallucinations of Takabe menacingly cornering him. Several days later, the police discover Sakuma's body in his home, and conclude that he committed suicide. Meanwhile, Mamiya is jailed and charged with incitement to murder. Mamiya finds Takabe fascinating, possibly because he cannot force Takabe to kill. Takabe is tormented by visions of his wife (Anna Nakagawa) dead, however, and the more he studies Mamiya, the more he feels that he might be losing his mind. The detective grows frustrated with his wife's helplessness and even expresses murderous intent towards her at one point. His wife's strange behavior and concerns about his own mental stability lead him to have her committed to a mental hospital. When Mamiya escapes, killing a policeman and a doctor in the process, Takabe tracks him to a deserted building in the wilderness and shoots him. Exploring the building, Takabe finds and listens to an old phonograph cylinder that contains a scratchy recording of a male voice repeating what seem to be cryptic hypnotic instructions. The film ends ambiguously at a restaurant where a waitress serves Takabe then suddenly draws out a knife after speaking to the detective‚Äîsuggesting that the bizarre ceremonial crimes are being carried out inadvertently by Takabe after listening to the cylinder recording created a century earlier.

The film was released on home video for the first time in the UK as part of The Masters of Cinema Series on April 23, 2018. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Cure has a 93% approval rating based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 7.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Mesmerizing and psychologically intriguing.\\" Tom Mes of Midnight Eye described the film as \\"a horror film in the purest sense of the word\\". Meanwhile, A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that Kiyoshi Kurosawa \\"turns the thriller into a vehicle for gloomy social criticism.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club said: \\"Kurosawa, a prolific genre stylist who specializes in low-key thrillers and horror films, undercuts the lurid material by keeping a chilly, almost clinical distance from the events and unfolding the story in elliptical pieces.\\" For Screen Slate, Stephanie Monohan wrote, \\"Arguably overshadowed by other films in the turn-of-the-century J-Horror canon like Ringu (1998) and Audition (1999), Cure lives on as one of the more powerful works of the era.\\" Bong Joon Ho calls Kurosawa a great master of Japanese horror films. He states, \\"There is this sense of horror that trickles down your nerves. It's something that only Kiyoshi can create.\\" Bong would come out with his own crime, serial killer movie six years after called Memories of Murder. Kurosawa, speaking about the success of Cure, stated, \\"I watched a lot of American horror movies growing up, and I had wanted to make a movie in that genre for some years. Then the growth in popularity of genre films made it easier for me to get the project financed and produced. So, circumstance was the key factor to the success of Cure, and it has continued to play an important role in my career ever since.\\" = Awards = ‚Ä¢ 1997 - Best Actor Award - K√¥ji Yakusho - Tokyo International Film Festival ‚Ä¢ 1998 - Best Film - Kiyoshi Kurosawa - Japanese Professional Movie Awards ‚Ä¢ 1998 - Best Supporting Actor - Masato Hagiwara - Japanese Professional Movie Awards ‚Ä¢ 1999 - Best Film - Yokohama Film Festival ‚Ä¢ 1999 - Best Supporting Actor - Ren Osugi - Yokohama Film Festival ‚Ä¢ 1999 - Best Director - Kiyoshi Kurosawa - Yokohama Film Festival References =Footnotes= =Sources= * External links  Category:1997 films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:1997 horror films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese- language films Category:Japanese thriller films Category:Films directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa Category:Japanese neo-noir films Category:Police detective films Category:Japanese serial killer films ","title":"Cure (film)"},{"id":"2359786","text":"David Lionel Bazelon (September 3, 1909 ‚Äì February 19, 1993) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Education and career Bazelon was born in Superior, Wisconsin, the son of Lena (Krasnovsky) and Israel Bazelon, a general store proprietor. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants. Bazelon grew up in Chicago, Illinois and earned a Bachelor of Science in Law from Northwestern University in 1931. He read law to enter the bar in 1932. He entered private practice in Chicago from 1932 to 1935. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois from 1935 to 1946. He then worked as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Public Lands Division of the United States Department of Justice from 1946 until June 1, 1947, when he moved to Alien Property,Alien Office Merging. The New York Times, April 25, 1947. where he remained until he became a judge.McGohey Is Named Federal Judge; Nominations in Other Areas. The New York Times, Walter H. Waggoner, October 16, 1949 . Federal judicial service In 1948, then- Attorney General Tom C. Clark lobbied for Bazelon's‚ÄîClark's deputy‚Äîappointment to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago but his nomination was not supported by Illinois' two US Senators, Democrats Lucas and Douglas. In Illinois, there was a widespread perception, including by Lucas and Douglas, that Bazelon was not qualified for the post. J. Edgar Hoover, Bazelon's long- time \\"friend and patron\\", had earlier urged Bazelon to take his post in the Justice Department and supported his bid for a judicial post. After Clark was confirmed as a US Supreme Court Justice, in breach of judicial norms, he continued to lobby for Bazelon's appointment although switching his efforts to getting Bazelon a seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Senators Lucas and Douglas supported Bazelon's appointment to that court despite the fact that Bazelon had contributed funds to the unsuccessful 1948 campaign of incumbent Republican US Senator Charles W. Brooks, whom Douglas defeated. Harold L. Ickes, a key figure in the Roosevelt administration, indicated that Bazelon's activities as head of the Office of Alien Property Custodian warranted a Senate investigation but predicted none would be forthcoming. Bazelon received a recess appointment from President Harry S. Truman on October 21, 1949, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 63 Stat. 493. At 40 years of age, he was the youngest person ever appointed to that court. He was nominated to the same position by President Truman on January 5, 1950. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 8, 1950, and received his commission on February 10, 1950. He served as Chief Judge from 1962 to 1978. He was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1963 to 1977. He assumed senior status on June 30, 1979. He was the last appeals court judge who continued to serve in active service appointed by President Truman. He assumed inactive senior status in 1985 due to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. His service terminated on February 19, 1993, due to his death from that condition. Bazelon was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. =Influencing the United States Supreme Court= Bazelon was for decades the senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and a close associate of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., whom he had met in 1956.Eisler, Kim Isaac (1993). A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the decisions that transformed America. Pages 15, 202. New York: Simon & Schuster. Justice William O. Douglas and President Lyndon B. Johnson would be their sometime companions on trips to baseball games. Bazelon served with Warren E. Burger on the D.C. Circuit for over a decade, and the two grew to be not just professional rivals, but personal enemies as well.Eisler, 202. The Washington Post would note in 1981 that during the Warren Court era, lawyers who wanted a Bazelon opinion upheld would do well to mention the judge's name as many times as possible in their briefs... \\"One mention of this name was worth 100 pages of legal research.\\"Eisler, 203. Bazelon became a primary source of Justice Brennan's law clerks.Eisler, 203 and 235. =Judicial career= Bazelon had a broad view of the reach of the Constitution. Conservatives viewed the judge as dangerous for his tendency to rule in favor of the lower class, the mentally ill, and defendants. Bazelon authored many far-reaching decisions on topics as diverse as the environment, the eighteen-year-old vote, discrimination, and the insanity defense. Many of his \\"radical\\" rulings were upheld by the Supreme Court. In Rouse v. Cameron, 373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1966), Bazelon, writing for the court, became the first appellate judge to say that civilly committed mental patients had a \\"right to treatment.\\" =Feud with Burger= Bazelon was the nemesis of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger beginning from the time both served on the Court of Appeals.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 24. Bazelon was a nationally recognized advocate for the rights of the mentally ill, and his opinion in 1954's Durham v. United States (which adopted a new criminal insanity test) set off a long clash between the two judges. Under Bazelon's Durham rule, a defendant would be excused from criminal responsibility if a jury found that the unlawful act was \\"the product of mental disease or mental defect,\\" rather than the product of an \\"irresistible impulse\\" (which was the old test).

In the past, and sometimes today, a theodolite was used to track the balloon in order to determine the speed and direction of winds aloft. The principle behind the ceiling balloon is that timing of a balloon with a known ascent rate (how fast it climbs) from its release until it disappears into the clouds can be used to calculate the height of the bottom of the clouds. How it is used A ceiling balloon is a small, usually red, (fluted) rubber balloon commonly measuring 76 mm (3 in) across prior to inflation, inflated to ~40 cm (~15.75 in) diameter. After inflation the balloon is taken outside and released. By timing the balloon from release until it enters the cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated the balloon will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and solid, so the ceiling height is not when the balloon disappears but when the colour begins to fade. The balloon can also be used to measure the vertical visibility into a layer of fog or blowing snow. In this case the balloon will begin to fade as soon as it is released, so the vertical visibility is when the balloon disappears. If the balloon is visible for a considerable distance into the cloud layer the observer should make note of it as it is of importance to aircraft. The ceiling balloon is a reliable, safe and simple way to get an indication of the height of clouds. However, it does suffer from some disadvantages that the observer must be aware of. Rain and wet snow may slow the ascent of the balloon, giving a falsely high ceiling and high winds and poor visibility may cause the balloon to appear to enter the cloud before it actually does. As the balloon rises at a rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min) it will take over five minutes for the balloon to reach 700 m (2300 ft). Beyond this height the ability to follow the balloon, even with binoculars, is poor, as even the slightest movement of the eye off the balloon will almost certainly ensure that it vanishes. At night when it is not practical to use a balloon the ceiling projector is used. However, during twilight it may be impossible to use the ceiling projector and then a pibal (pilot balloon) light may be used. This is a simple flashlight bulb attached to a battery. To charge the battery it is immersed in water for three minutes and then tied to the balloon prior to inflation. These are rarely used today. Technical details The balloons and associated equipment are usually stored in a cabinet mounted on a wall close to the gas cylinders. The cabinet has three doors one of which opens down and to it the filler stand is attached. At the top of the filler stand is a \\"L\\" shaped pipe with two rings, a small one on the bottom and a larger one on the top called the inflation nozzle. The rings stop the tube from dropping through the stand or rising too far when the balloon is inflated. The top ring has several grooves cut into it, to help grip the balloon which is fitted to it. At the bottom of the pipe is a weight that, when the precise amount of gas has been added, will lift to indicate the balloon is full. A rubber hose is attached to this pipe and passes through the filler stand twice. The first hole is larger than the tube to permit movement, while the second is used to hold the tubing in place. From there the tube runs to a needle valve that controls the amount of gas flowing to the balloon. A second tube will then run from the valve to a regulator valve that is attached to the gas cylinder. This valve has two pressure gauges attached. One showing the total pressure remaining in the gas cylinder and the second showing the amount of gas flowing through the tubing. Typically the cylinder, which is made of steel and weighs about 140 lb (65 kg). It contains the equivalent of about 200 ft3 (5.7 m3) of gas at standard pressure, stored at a pressure of 2000 psi (14 megapascals) and will inflate approximately 120 balloons (according to a nominal diameter of 45 cm). On the opposite side of the cabinet is space to store balloons, string and pibal lights. The gas used to fill the balloon is helium or hydrogen. Because of its low cost ceiling balloons are often filled with hydrogen gas, but sometimes helium is used. The balloon is attached to the inflation nozzle and a piece of string is wound around the neck. After donning safety glasses and hearing protection a check is made to ensure the needle valve is fully closed. The main valve on the cylinder is then opened, followed by the regulator valve. Next, the needle valve is opened and the balloon begins to inflate. As the balloon reaches the correct size the inflation nozzle will begin to lift. At this point the needle valve is closed along with the regulator valve and cylinder valve. The string is then used to tie off the balloon neck to ensure that no gas can escape. Caution must be used during inflation due to the occasional faulty balloon and its failure. If the person inflating the balloon is not wearing goggles or hearing protectors then eye or ear damage can result.

The submarine's career was spent with the Soviet Pacific Fleet. It was lost on or about 15 December 1952, due to unknown causes in the Strait of Tartary in the Sea of Japan. The boat may have collided with a surface ship or struck a mine. All 47 crew died in the incident.  Service history  Shch-117 was laid down on 9 October 1932 as Yard No. 189 at the Baltic Shipyard. She was delivered unassembled by rail to Dalzavod Ship Repair Center in Vladivostok for assembly and was launched on 15 April 1934 and commissioned on 18 December. Shch-117 became part of the Pacific Fleet on 28 January 1935, commanded by Nikolai Yegipko. From 11 January to 20 February 1936, Shch-117 conducted a long- endurance under-ice cruise, for which the crew received the Order of the Badge of Honour. Yegipko and Commissar Sergey Pastukhov both were awarded the Order of the Red Star in April 1936. The cruise was advertised in the Soviet press as part of the Stakhanovite movement. On 19 April 1945, Shch-117 was transferred to a new naval base at Sovetskiy Gavan as a component of the 8th Division. After the Soviet declaration of war on Japan on 9 August, Shch-117, under the command of Captain lieutenant Pyotr Sinetsky patrolled off western Sakhalin. It did not meet Japanese opposition and was recalled to base on 20 August. On 10 June 1949 the submarine was renamed S-117. S-117 was lost on 15 December 1952 due to unknown circumstances. Its crew of 47 perished.

Ehret authored books and articles on dieting, detoxification, fruitarianism, fasting, food combining, health, longevity, naturopathy, physical culture and vitalism. In opposition to medical science that asserts white blood cells are important components of the immune system, Ehret believed that white blood cells were caused by consuming mucus-forming foods, and as waste materials, poison the blood.Butler, Kurt; Rayner, Lynn.

During the 1890s his health deteriorated and he took interest in naturopathy. He visited Sebastian Kneipp's water cure sanatorium in W√∂rishofen. He embraced fasting and a diet that consisted primarily of fruit. He founded a Sanitarium in Switzerland and used his diet to treat people. He moved to the United States in 1914 and attended the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition of 1915. He opened an office in Los Angeles to promote his ideas. By age 31, he developed Bright's disease which was cured by his mucusless diet. (Bright's Disease inflammation of the kidneys). On October 9, 1922 Ehret fell while walking down a street sustaining a fatal injury to his head.

In 1909, he claimed he fasted for 105 days in total.Lebesfragen, Arnold Ehret, Carl Kuhn Verlag, Munich, 1923 In 1910, he wrote an article for a German vegetarian magazine about his 49-day fasting experience, which gained the public's interest, and which later appeared in his book Lebensfragen (Life Questions).The Mucusless Diet Healing System, Arnold Ehret, ELPC Inc 1994, page 20 \\"It had a sensational and revolutionizing effect.\\" For 65 years, Fred and Lucille Hirsch published Ehret's literature and the torch symbol found on Ehret's books became the logo of the Ehret Health Club. In 1979, the Ehret Literature Publishing Company Inc, in New York, inherited Ehret's publications and archive of unpublished German manuscripts. = Vitalism = Having denounced the nitrogenous-albumin metabolic theory in 1909, Ehret learned of a contemporary, Thomas Powell M.D., in 1912, who concurred with his belief that \\"grape sugar\\" (simple sugars in fruits and vegetables) was the optimum fuel source, body building material and agent of vital energy, for humans, not protein rich foods.Dr. Guy Bogart, N.D.: \\"In 1909, Ehret wrote an article for the European health magazines denouncing the metabolic theory, and in 1912 learned that Thomas Powell, M.D., of Los Angeles had made the same discovery and was effecting wonderful cures by using foods containing what he called 'organized carbon' which is the same food ingredient that develops into grape-sugar during digestion.\\"; \\"grape- sugar of carbohydrates was the source of vitality and vital energy, and not the proteids\\". Introduction to Kranke Menschen (Beneficial Books, 1971) Powell had set out his beliefs in the book \\"Fundamentals and Requirements of Health and Disease\\", published in 1909.Fundamentals and Requirements of Health and Disease, Thomas Powell, M.D., Powell Publishing Company, Los Angeles, California, 1909, Introduction to Part One, page 15, \\"The New Vital Philosophy: Comprehending the Basic Principles of Biology, Physiology and Dietetics - unraveling the manifold Mysteries of Vegetation, Nutrition, Nerve Action and Locomotion, by showing how energy is stored in Food; how Nutrition is effected; how Food-Energy is transformed into the VITOMOTIVE POWER, or Muscular Energy; that this agent possesses, at its maximum efficiency, a Dynamic Equivalent of 600 lbs. to the square inch; what this Mighty Power is; from what element of the food it is developed; and how it sets the VITAL MACHINERY in motion.\\" Ehret claimed alkaline foods, which were also mucusless, formed the natural diet of humans. Ehret asserted that the body was an air-gas engine, not dependent on food for energy, and that the body was not designed to utilize mucus-forming foods, offering the equation Vitality = Power ‚àí Obstruction (V = P ‚àí O) to demonstrate this.Dr. Guy Bogart, N.D., Introduction to Kranke Menschen (Beneficial Books, 1971), \\"Man is working against too much friction in his human machine. Hidden away in every part of the human body are thousands of feet of small and almost invisible tubes through which the blood circulates like the water in a water motor. If the blood stream contains sticky mucus from wrong eating, the body machine has to work under continual friction, like a car slowed down by applying the brake.\\" Ehret also claimed the lungs were the pump in the body while the heart acted as a valve, with the blood controlling the heart. Ehret further believed that white blood cells were the result of ingesting mucus-forming foods.Dr. Guy Bogart, N.D., Introduction to Kranke Menschen (Beneficial Books, 1971), \\"The excessive appearance of the white blood corpuscles, i.e., of the white dead mucus, as compared with the red sugar and iron substances is becoming dangerous to life. Red-colored and sweet is the visible token of life and love; white, pale, colorless, bitter, the token of disease and the overwhelming by mucus, the slow dying of the individual.\\"The Purple Seal: Breaking The Plague of Chronic Diseases and Syndromes, George Washington Singleton III, BRCA Incorporated, page 41, \\"Arnold Ehret who first identified the Caucasian Peoples' white skin color as physiopathogenicity in his 1922 classic nutritional herbology book Mucusless Diet Healing System; goes on and explains how he reversed his own white color back to its original brown color and everyone thought he was a Native American or Asian Indian via a \\"natural sun tan\\" regime. He achieved this by following his own Mucusless Diet Healing System, i.e. a Herbivore/Vegan diet using foods that remove the undigested animal residues he calls \\"mucus\\" that gives the white blood cells their characteristic white color from their phagocytosis of Animal/Dietary Cholestrol in their \\"house cleaning\\" sanitary body maintenance duties.\\" =Metabolism myth= Ehret maintained new tissue was built primarily from simple sugars in fruits,\\"These elements or ingredients are known as \\"organized carbon and \\"grape sugar\\". Their presence in sufficient quantities, refutes the now current idea that the organic, mineral or tissue salts, are the energy producing elements. They exist only in infinitesimal amounts in all foods, and part of them are drugs. Neither are the number of calories (\\"heat units\\" by calorimeter tests), reasonable basis for selecting a proper diet. My over forty years of observation, experiences and research have proven conclusively to me that fruits and vegetables have all the tissue salts needed, and that the presence of actually well known ingredients in sufficient quantity are the energy and life supporting ingredients which make them the superior of all other foods, when the debris (mucus) from the \\"mucus-rich\\" foods is eliminated.\\", Professor. B. W. Child, Introduction, \\"The Mucusless Diet Healing System\\", Arnold Ehret, New York: ELPC Inc, 1994, page 21 not metabolised from protein and fat-rich foods. Ehret only favored nuts and seeds during transition to the ideal fruit diet, and even then, only \\"sparingly\\", condemning high-protein and fat-rich foods, as \\"unnatural\\"; further writing that \\"no animals eat fats\\" and \\"all fats are acid forming, even those of vegetable origin, and are not used by the body\\"Mucusless Diet Healing System, Arnold Ehret, USA: ELPC Inc, 1994, chapter \\"The Destructive Diet Of Civilization\\" Later editions of his Mucusless Diet Healing System published by Fred S. Hirsch, claimed nuts were \\"mucus- free\\".Mucusless Diet Healing System, Arnold Ehret, USA: ELPC Inc, 1994, page 90 Ehret specifically renounced meat, eggs, milk, fats, cereals, legumes, potatoes and rice, whilst recognizing the transitional value in some of these. Ehret, citing Ragnar Berg, stated that fats and proteins were acid-forming and were to be consumed in moderation, as did Ehret's contemporary Otto Carque.\\"Medical science is still suffering from Liebig's old theory that the human or animal muscle works on proteins, whereas as a matter of fact nearly all heat and energy are produced by fats and carbohydrates. It is now an established fact that the adult body cannot make use of more than about five per cent protein, of the total amount of solid food needed daily.\\", Rational Diet: An Advanced Treatise on the Food Question, Otto Carque, Health Research Books, 1996, page 355 = Religious views = Along with his sister,Arnold Ehret's The Story Of My Life as told to Anita Bauer, Beneficial Books, 1980, page 21, 28 Ehret was brought up as a Roman Catholic. He believed in God, but took issue with the Church because of its dietary requirements in a letter to the Pope, and subsequently quit the Church, though his faith in God remained. After his death, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who was aware of his writings on Jesus, wrote to Fred Hirsch to confirm he would ban Catholics from reading Ehret's religious writings, if published. Prior to this, Ehret was popular with the bishop and the Catholic fraternity. Criticism None of Ehret's claims are recognized as valid by experts in the scientific, medical, and nutritional fields to the present day. They largely contradict well-understood biology and chemistry, and are unsupported by any evidence. Mucusless diets were critiqued as unscientific in the book Diet and Die by health writer Carl Malmberg in 1935.Malmberg, Carl. (1935). Mucusless Diets and the Back-to- Nature Cults. In Diet and Die. Hillman-Curl, Inc. pp. 91-95 The \\"Special Committee on Aging\\" of the 88th US Congress published a report on \\"Frauds and Quackery effecting the Older Citizen\\" in 1963, in which it mentions Ehret as a quack whose \\"cultists earnestly believed that women who adhered to the diet program of ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Arnold Ehret could expect ‚Äúimmaculate conception.‚Äù\\".Hearing before the Special Committee on Aging. United States Senate, 88th Congress. US Government Printing Office, Washington DC: 1963. pp. 133-134 In 1978, Ehret's mucusless diet was listed as a fad diet as \\"its claims are not substantiated scientifically.\\" Physician Terrence T. Kuske has written that Ehret's mucusless fruitarian diet \\"lack[s] high quality utilizable protein as well as adequate levels of many vitamins.\\"Kuske, Terrence T. (1983). Quackery and Fad Diets. In Elaine B. Feldman. Nutrition in the Middle and Later Years. John Wright & Sons. pp. 291-303. Kuske also commented that \\"there is no evidence that prolonged fasting provides any significant benefits.\\" Nutritionist Kurt Butler and physician Lynn Rayner have noted: > Like macrobiotics, the mucusless diet system promotes a dangerous idea, that > the more you suffer during starvation, the more you need to be starved to > \\"cleanse the system\\". This leads unfortunate victims to cling fanatically to > the system and dismiss all signs of malnutrition as signs that poisons are > being expelled and the diet is working.\\" Ehret held a number of non-scientific beliefs that were documented by Butler and Rayner, such as: *White blood cells are decayed mucus in the blood that cause disease. *Lungs pump blood through the body, the heart is merely a valve. *Mental illness is the result of gas pressure on the brain from mucus decay. *Fasting can cure insanity. *Consuming rice causes leprosy. *Dandruff is dried mucus. *A mucus-free body never sweats. *Nocturnal emissions expel mucus, but cease on a mucusless diet. *Gonorrhoea is caused by eating mucus foods. *A clean blooded body sends electromagnetic radiation through the hair, which is important in sexual attraction. *Hairless persons are sexually inferior. *The white race is un-natural. The white skin colour is the result of mucus-laden white blood corpuscles clogging the system. =Innerclean= Ehret's Innerclean Intestinal Laxative was produced by the Innerclean Manufacturing Company of Los Angeles and was sold through mail order. The Innerclean product was issued with a four-page leaflet advertising the Mucusless-Diet Healing System of Ehret.Camp, Arthur J. (1936). Nostrums and Quackery and Pseudo-Medicine, Volume 3. Press of the American Medical Association. pp. 72-73 The product was said to cleanse and rejuvenate the intestines by \\"remov[ing] from the intestines hardened feces, mucus, and other age-old uneliminated, imperfectly digested, fatty substances.\\" An examination by the American Medical Association's Chemical Laboratory revealed that the product was made from a mixture of chopped herbs such as Senna, an indigestible residue of agar and sand. In 1926, the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that \\"the harm that a mixture of that sort might do to an inflamed mucous membrane or an inflamed intestinal mucous membrane can easily be realized by physicians and even intelligent laymen.\\" In October 1931, 125 cartons of Innerclean were seized at Brooklyn, New York because of misbranding in violation of the Pure Food and Drug Act.Misbranding of Innerclean. U. S. v. 125 cartons of Innerclean. Consent decree of condemnation and forfeiture. Product released under bond. Notices of Judgment Under the Food and Drugs Act. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1932. The United States Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde reported from sampling Innerclean that it was made from Senna leaves, anise seed and sassafras bark. The product was misbranded with false and misleading health claims.

The battle was one of the bloodiest fought by the British East India Company. Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and both sides claimed victory.Heath, p.42 The battle was a strategic check to immediate British ambitions in India and a shock to British military prestige.Major A. H. Amin (retd.) Orbat.com Prelude The Second Anglo-Sikh war broke out in the Punjab, which had recently lost much of its independence to the British East India Company following the First Anglo-Sikh War, in April 1848, when the city of Multan rebelled under Dewan Mulraj. The East India Company's Commissioner for the Punjab, Frederick Currie, sent several forces of locally raised troops to help quell the revolt. One of these forces consisted largely of Sikhs, formerly from the Sikh Khalsa Army, under Sher Singh Attariwalla. Some junior British Political Officers viewed this development with alarm as Sher Singh's father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, was known to be plotting sedition in Hazara, north of the Punjab. On 14 September, Sher Singh's army also rebelled. Other than opposition to the British, Mulraj and Sher Singh had no aims in common. Sher Singh decided to move his army north, to join that of Chattar Singh, who had also rebelled. However, some British officers had taken steps to secure vital fortresses. For the time being, Chattar Singh was unable to leave Hazara, as the British held Attock on the Indus River, and the passes over the Margalla Hills separating Hazara from the Punjab. Instead, Sher Singh moved a few miles north and fortified the crossings over the Chenab River, while awaiting events. The East India Company responded by announcing their intention to depose the young Maharaja, Duleep Singh, annexe the Punjab and confiscate the lands of any landholders who joined the revolt.Hernon, p.583 While an army under Major General Whish resumed the Siege of Multan, the company ordered the formation of an Army of the Punjab under the veteran Commander in Chief, Sir Hugh Gough. However, both Gough and the Governor General, the 37-year-old Lord Dalhousie, delayed operations until after the end of the monsoon season, allowing Sher Singh to gather reinforcements and establish strong positions. Gough took charge of the Army on 21 November. The next day, he attacked Sher Singh's bridgehead on the left bank of the Chenab at Ramnagar but was repulsed, raising Sikh morale. On 1 December, a cavalry division under Major General Joseph Thackwell crossed the Chenab upstream from Ramnagar. Sher Singh advanced against him, resulting in a day-long artillery duel at Sadullapur. Gough meanwhile bombarded the empty Sikh positions at Ramnagar, and postponed a general attack until the next day. During the night, Sher Singh withdrew to the north. Gough then halted, awaiting further instructions from Dalhousie. Early in January 1849, news came that the British had recaptured the city of Multan (although Mulraj still defended the citadel), but also that the Muslim garrison of Attock had defected to Amir Dost Mohammad Khan of Afghanistan, who was half-heartedly supporting Chattar Singh. The fall of Attock nevertheless allowed Chattar Singh's army to leave Hazara and move south. Dalhousie ordered Gough to seek out and destroy Sher Singh's main army before the Sikh armies could combine, without waiting for reinforcements from the army at Multan. First contact On 13 January, Gough's army was marching towards the reported Sikh position at Rasul, on the left bank of the Jhelum River, about north-west of Lahore. At noon, they drove a Sikh outpost out of the village of Chillianwala. At this point, Gough intended to march round to the north of the Sikh position and attack its left flank on the following day, but from the vantage point of a mound near Chillianwala, it was apparent that the Sikhs had advanced from their original positions along ridges close to the Jhelum. Sher Singh's army had originally occupied a position six miles long, too extended for their numbers and vulnerable to a flank attack such as Gough proposed. By advancing, Sher Singh made a British flank march too risky and forced the British to make a frontal attack.A. H. Amin, defencejournal.com It was estimated by Frederick Mackeson, Gough's attached political officer, that Sher Singh's army numbered 23,000 (although most later British historians put it at 30,000 or more), including 5,000 irregular cavalry, with some 60 guns. However after the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Khalsa was reduced to 12,000 infantry and 60 guns in total, so some historians have stated the Sikh army could not have been more than 10,000 on the day. The Sikh army consisted of three main bodies of troops.Farwell, pp.53‚Äì54 On the left under Sher Singh himself were one cavalry regiment, nine infantry battalions, some irregulars and 20 guns, occupying some low hills and ridges. In the centre under Lal Singh were two cavalry regiments, ten infantry battalions and 17 guns, mostly concealed in or behind belts of scrub and jungle. On the right was a brigade which formerly had garrisoned Bannu, consisting of one cavalry regiment, four infantry battalions and eleven guns, anchored on two villages. Other irregulars extended Sher Singh's left flank. Gough intended to delay the attack until the following day, but as his army prepared to pitch camp, hitherto concealed Sikh artillery opened fire from positions much closer than had been anticipated. Gough later wrote that he feared the Sikhs might bombard his encampments overnight, though some of his officers believed he had merely been stung into hasty action.Hernon, p.594 Gough's army was composed of two infantry divisions, each of two brigades, each in turn of one British and two Bengal Native infantry battalions, with a total of 66 guns from the Bengal Artillery and Bengal Horse Artillery. The 3rd Division under Sir Colin Campbell, with two field artillery batteries and three horse artillery troops, was deployed on the left, while the 2nd Division commanded by Major General Sir Walter Gilbert was deployed on the right with a field artillery battery and three horse artillery troops. Gough also had a cavalry division under Major General Joseph Thackwell, but this was split, with one brigade on each flank; Brigadier White's on the left, Brigadier Pope's on the right. Gough deployed two heavy artillery batteries with eight 18-pounder guns and four 8-inch howitzers in the centre. A brigade of Bengal Native troops under Brigadier Penney was in reserve. The battle Map of the battle Gough ordered the advance to commence at about 3:00 pm. From the outset, the right-hand brigade of Campbell's division, commanded by Brigadier Pennycuick, was in difficulties. Because the jungle made it difficult for Campbell to coordinate his two brigades, he assumed personal command of the left hand brigade under Brigadier Hoggan, while ordering Pennycuick to attack with the bayonet. The British regiment of Pennycuick's brigade was the 24th Foot, which had only recently arrived in India. They advanced very rapidly, but lost cohesion and also lost touch with the rest of the brigade in the thick scrub. Trying to attack Sikh guns head-on, they suffered heavily from grapeshot. When they reached the main Sikh positions, Sikh resistance was desperate and the 24th were driven back. The Queen's colours were lost,Hernon, p.596 although the Sikhs never claimed to have captured them and they were either destroyed or conceivably buried with the officer who had carried them. Pennycuick's brigade eventually became completely disorganised and had to make its way back to the start line in small parties. Pennycuick himself was killed. Picture of the plaque erected in St James Church Sialkot Cantonment by Sarah Pennycuick, widow of Brigadier John Pennycuick and mother of Alexender of 24th Regiment, both of whom died in Battle of Chillianwala on 13 January 1849. Campbell's left hand brigade (under Brigadier Hoggan and Campbell himself) had greater success. The 61st Foot captured several guns and even an elephant, and Brigadier White's cavalry followed up with an effective charge. Hoggan's troops eventually met the left- hand brigade of Gilbert's division, commanded by Brigadier Mountain, behind the Sikhs' centre positions. On Gough's right however, his troops had met with disaster. While Gilbert's two brigades had at first successfully driven the Sikhs before them, capturing or spiking several guns, on their right flank, Brigadier Pope (who was almost an invalid) first ordered an ineffective cavalry charge through thorn scrub which threw his brigade into confusion, and then panicked and ordered a retreat. One of his British cavalry regiments, the 14th Light Dragoons, routed. The Sikhs followed up the fleeing cavalry and captured four guns. They then attacked Gilbert's right-hand infantry brigade, commanded by Brigadier Godby, from the rear, forcing him to withdraw under heavy pressure until Penney's reserve brigade came to his aid. By now, darkness was approaching. The Sikhs had been driven from many of their positions with heavy casualties, but were still fighting strongly. With some of his formations rendered ineffective, or having to fight their way out of encirclement, Gough ordered a withdrawal to the start line. Although his units brought back as many wounded as they could, many of them could not be found in the scrub. Many of the abandoned wounded were killed during the night by roving Sikh irregulars. Gough's retreat also allowed the Sikhs to recapture all but twelve of the guns the British had taken earlier in the day. Casualties The final losses to Gough's army were 757 killed, 1,651 wounded and 104 missingHernon, p.599 for a total of 2,512.Farwell, p.58 A comparatively high proportion of the casualties (almost 1,000) were British rather than Indian. This was mainly a result of the disaster which befell the 24th Foot, which suffered 590 casualties, over 50 percent. Sikh casualties were 4,000 dead and wounded. An obelisk later erected at Chillianwalla by the British government preserves the names of those who fell in the battle. Result A monument was erected in memory of the losses sustained by both armies Both armies held their positions at the end of the battle and Sher Singh withdrew to the north. Both sides claimed a victory. The Sikhs claimed that they forced the British to retreat but the British forces actually withdrew three days after the battle ended; however, this was due to the rains which separated the two armies for that duration.Rain separated the foes for three days and on the fourth day the British withdrew. Since the Sikhs disengaged first, the British claimed the victory, although they admitted that the Sikhs missed an opportunity to gain a victory.BritishBattles.com However, the repulse of the British, together with the loss of several guns and the colours of the 24th and two other regiments, and the rout of the 14th Light Dragoons, dealt a blow to British morale and is testament to the tenacity and martial skill of the Sikh army.

Before Napier could arrive from England to take over command, Gough had fought the decisive Battle of Goojerat (or Gujrat, Gujerat). The loss of British prestige at Chillianwala was one of the factors which contributed to the Indian rebellion of 1857 some nine years later. However, the Sikh soldiers serving in the British army remained loyal to Britain and helped crush the rebellion.The Indian Mutiny ‚Äì Education forumThe Sikhs and the Sikh Wars General Sir Charles Gough Within the British Army, such was the consternation over the events at Chillianwala that, after the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade, when Lord Lucan remarked \\"This is a most serious matter\\", General Airey replied, \\"These sort of things will happen in war.

The name Dunkleosteus combines the Greek , osteon, meaning \\"bone\\", and Dunkle, in honor of David Dunkle of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. It consists of ten species: D. terrelli, D. belgicus, D. denisoni, D. marsaisi, D. magnificus, D. missouriensis, D. newberryi, D. amblyodoratus, and D. raveri; some of which are among the largest placoderms to have ever lived. The largest species, D. terrelli grew up to long and in weight. Dunkleosteus could quickly open and close its jaw, like modern day suction feeders, and had a bite force of at the tip and at the blade edge. Numerous fossils of the various species have been found in North America, Poland, Belgium, and Morocco. Taxonomy Restoration and size comparison of D. terrelli Dunkleosteus was named in 1956 to honour David Dunkle, then curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The type species D. terrelli was originally described in 1873 as a species of Dinichthys. Dunkleosteus is an arthrodire originally placed in the family Dinichthyidae, which is composed mostly of large, carnivorous fish like Gorgonichthys. Anderson (2009) suggests, because of its primitive jaw structure, Dunkleosteus should be placed outside the family Dinichthyidae, perhaps close to the base of the clade Pachyosteomorpha, near Eastmanosteus. Carr and Hlavin (2010) resurrect Dunkleosteidae and place Dunkleosteus, Eastmanosteus, and a few other genera from Dinichthyidae within it. Dinichthyidae, in turn, is made into a monospecific family. = Species = D. marsaisi skull At least 10 different species of Dunkleosteus have been described so far. The type species, D. terrelli, is the largest, best-known species of the genus, measuring in length. It has a rounded snout. D. terrelli fossil remains are found in Upper Frasnian to Upper Famennian Late Devonian strata of the United States (Huron and Cleveland Shale of Ohio, the Conneaut of Pennsylvania, Chattanooga Shale of Tennessee, Lost Burro Formation, California, and possibly Ives breccia of Texas) and Europe. D. belgicus (?) is known from fragments described from the Famennian of Belgium. The median dorsal plate is characteristic of the genus, but, a plate that was described as a suborbital is anterolateral. D. Denison is known from a small median dorsal plate, typical in appearance for Dunkleosteus, but much smaller than normal. D. marsaisi refers to the Dunkleosteus fossils from the Lower Famennian Late Devonian strata of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. It differs in size, the known skulls averaging a length of and in form to D. terrelli. In D. marsaisi, the snout is narrower, and a postpineal fenestra may be present. Many researchers and authorities consider it a synonym of D. terrelli. H. Schultze regards D. marsaisi as a member of Eastmanosteus. D. magnificus is a large placoderm from the Frasnian Rhinestreet Shale of New York. It was originally described as \\"Dinichthys magnificus\\" by Hussakof and Bryant in 1919, then as \\" Dinichthys mirabilis\\" by Heintz in 1932. Dunkle and Lane moved it to Dunkleosteus in 1971. D. missouriensis is known from fragments from Frasnian Missouri. Dunkle and Lane regard them as being very similar to D. terrelli. D. Newberry is known primarily from a long infragnathal with a prominent anterior cusp, found in the Frasnian portion of the Genesee Group of New York, and originally described as \\" Dinichthys Newberry\\". D. amblyodoratus is known from some fragmentary remains from Late Devonian strata of Kettle Point, Canada. The species name means \\"blunt spear\\" and refers to the way the nuchal and paranuchal plates in the back of the head form the shape of a blunted spearhead. Although it is known only from fragments, it is estimated to have been about long in life. D. raveri is a small species, possibly 1 meter long, known from an uncrushed skull roof found in a carbonate concretion from near the bottom of the Huron Shale, of the Famennian Ohio Shale strata. Besides its small size, it had comparatively large eyes. Because D. raveri was found in the strata directly below the strata where the remains of D. terrelli are found, D. raveri may have given rise to D. terrelli. The species name commemorates Clarence Raver of Wakeman, Ohio, who discovered the concretion where the holotype was found. Description Life restoration of D. marsaisi The largest species, D. terrelli, is estimated to have grown up to in length and in weight, making it one of the largest placoderms to have existed. Like other placoderms, Dunkleosteus had a two-part bony, armoured exterior, which may have made it a relatively slow but powerful swimmer. Instead of teeth, Dunkleosteus possessed two pairs of sharp bony plates which formed a beak-like structure. Dunkleosteus, together with most other placoderms, may have also been among the first vertebrates to internalize egg fertilization, as seen in some modern sharks. A skull diagram of Dunkleosteus Mainly the armored frontal sections of specimens have been fossilized, and consequently, the appearance of the other portions of the fish is mostly unknown. In fact, only about 5% of Dunkleosteus specimens have more than a quarter of their skeleton preserved.Carr, R, & G.L. Jackson. 2008. The Vertebrates fauna of the Cleveland member (Famennian) of the Ohio Shale. Society of Vertebrates Paleontology. 1-17. Because of this, many reconstructions of the hindquarters are often based on smaller arthrodires, such as Coccosteus, which had preserved hind sections. However, an exceptionally preserved specimen of D. terrelli preserves ceratotrichia in a pectoral fin, implying that the fin morphology of placoderms was much more variable than previously thought, and was heavily influenced by locomotory requirements. This knowledge, coupled with the knowledge that fish morphology is more heavily influenced by feeding niche than phylogeny, allowed a 2017 study to infer the body shape of D. terrelli. This new reconstruction gives D. terrelli a much more shark-like profile, including a strong anterior lobe on its tail, in contrast to reconstructions based on other placoderms. The most famous specimens of Dunkleosteus are displayed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and others are displayed at the American Museum of Natural History, National Museum of Natural History, State Museum of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg and in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, Queensland. =Diet= Life restoration of D. terrelli Dunkleosteus terrelli possessed a four-bar linkage mechanism for jaw opening that incorporated connections between the skull, the thoracic shield, the lower jaw and the jaw muscles joined together by movable joints. This mechanism allowed D. terrelli to both achieve a high speed of jaw opening, opening their jaws in 20 milliseconds and completing the whole process in 50‚Äì60 milliseconds (comparable to modern fishes that use suction feeding to assist in prey capture;) and producing high bite forces when closing the jaw, estimated at at the tip and at the blade edge in the largest individuals. The pressures generated in those regions were high enough to puncture or cut through cuticle or dermal armor suggesting that D. terrelli was adapted to prey on free-swimming, armored prey such as ammonites and other placoderms. Fossils of Dunkleosteus are frequently found with boluses of fish bones, semidigested and partially eaten remains of other fish. As a result, the fossil record indicates it may have routinely regurgitated prey bones rather than digest them. It probably inhabited inshore waters. =Juveniles= Morphological studies on the lower jaws of juveniles of D. terrelli reveal they were proportionally as robust as those of adults, indicating they already could produce high bite forces and likely were able to shear into resistant prey tissue similar to adults, albeit on a smaller scale. This pattern is in direct contrast to the condition common in tetrapods in which the jaws of juveniles are more gracile than in adults. Media Depictions Dunkleosteus has occasionally been depicted in various media and games. These include the 2003 BBC TV series Chased By Sea Monsters and the Animal Planet series River Monsters episode \\"Prehistoric Terror\\", amongst other depictions.

The three- story building with its main entrance facing Gasmer Street housed the administrative offices, classrooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium, library and a gym. The grounds were bare; no trees or grass greeted the first classes on opening day. To the right of the building, at the corner of Chimney Rock Road and Gasmer Street, stood \\"The Company Store\\", a hardware store. Westbury's 1961 enrollment consisted of 813 students ‚Äì seniors, juniors, sophomores coming from Bellaire, Lamar, and San Jacinto High Schools, and freshmen coming from Meyerland Jr High School. After the first year, there would not be a freshman class until the late 1970s. Of that first year's class, 58 seniors received their diplomas in the Westbury High School auditorium. Shading the school was the water tower that served the Westbury neighborhood. Mary Beth Kulp and Donna Harkness, the editors of the first yearbook, imagined the water tower as a silent citadel watching over the students, teachers, and administrators as they busied themselves with the task of transferring from one generation to the next the culture of the western world. They imagined the water tower thinking as it looked down on the school. \\"I, the majestic water tower beside it, hear its name and feel a part of it.\\" The metaphor of the water tower as citadel became the title of Westbury's yearbook. The students became the \\"Westbury Rebels\\". W. I. \\"Jim\\" Burns was Westbury's first principal. A lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps during World War II, Burns had taught chemistry at San Jacinto and Lamar High Schools and had opened Bellaire High School as assistant principal. The principal of Bellaire, Harland Andrews, complained that all of his good teachers wanted to transfer to Westbury so they could work under Burns. Many of the first staff members did, indeed, follow Burns from Bellaire High School. Among them were Westbury's first assistant principal, Kenneth Gupton, and the dean, Rivers Lodge. Lodge became assistant principal in 1970. There were 73 teachers in first year. The curriculum included the academic courses‚Äîmath, science, English and foreign language; the fine arts‚Äîmusic and art, speech, drama, journalism, home economics; the commercial subjects‚Äîtyping, business machines, and business law; the industrial arts‚Äîmechanical drawing‚Äîarchitectural drawing, woodshop and metal shop; drivers education, physical education and the National Defense Cadet Corps. In the early 1960s Westbury had no air conditioning, just fans. Temporary classroom buildings were brought in. As the years passed, trees were planted; the grass grew, and Westbury's student body flourished. Air conditioning was installed in the late 1960s and in the early 1970s, a three-story classroom wing was added to the east side of the school building to accommodate the growth. The \\"Company Store\\" was purchased by the Houston Independent School District (HISD) and was converted to the Oceanography/Living Resource Center to provide oceanography education and biological material for the district's science classes. Later the oceanography was phased out and it became the Living Resource Center (known as the \\"Frog Farm\\" around Westbury). LeRoy Hardy, the center's director, was one of the original science teachers at Westbury. W.L. Burns died of a heart attack in the summer of 1966. John Brandstetter served as the interim principal until Kenneth Gupton was appointed principal in 1967. In memory of Burns, Westbury established the W.L. Burns Award to honor academic excellence. Each May the students deemed best by each department are honored in an impressive formal assembly. Award winners receive the distinctive W.L. Burns Award trophy, modeled from the permanent trophy situated in the foyer outside the auditorium. The symbolism of the trophy \\"darkness into light...ignorance into learning...\\" and the noble words of its inscription, \\"Esse quam videre,\\" meaning \\"to be, rather than to seem\\" emphasize the essence of Westbury academic achievement. =The 2000s= On May 18, 2001, the main education building was declared unsafe; renovation crews discovered that the concrete, intended to measure at 3,000 pounds per square inch, instead measured at 1,400 to 2,000 pounds per square inch. The district did not permit students to retrieve their belongings. The district tested the other schools built between 1956 and 1965 and did not discover structural problems.Downing, Margaret. \\"Stepchild?\\" Houston Press. September 6, 2001. 1.

KLSD is based in San Diego, California, and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. It operates with 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. KLSD is San Diego's oldest licensed radio station, first going on the air in 1922. Its history includes previous formats Top 40 (as KGB), Adult standards (as KPOP) and progressive talk radio. Sports programming began on November 12, 2007. KLSD broadcasts Los Angeles Chargers football games, in conjunction with the team's San Diego flagship radio station, co-owned 101.5 KGB-FM. KLSD also broadcasts Los Angeles Lakers basketball, San Diego State University football & men's basketball, as well as college and pro football games from the Sports USA Radio Network and also was the broadcaster for the San Diego Fleet of the short-lived Alliance of American Football. The station shares a broadcasting tower with KGB-FM and KHTS-FM in the East San Diego area. The station's studios are located in San Diego's Serra Mesa area on the northeast side. History =Timeline of Significant events= *1922: W.K. Azbill was issued a license and the Call sign KFBC, operating at 10 watts on 833.3 kHz. *1927: This license was assigned to Dr. Arthur Wells Yale. *1928: Pickwick Broadcasting Corporation bought the station and made George Bowles vice president and manager of the station, changing the call sign to KGB to follow his name. *1931: Don Lee, Inc. bought KGB. *1932 August 5: The Federal Radio Commission authorized KGB to increase its power from 500 watts to 1,000 watts. At that time the station operated on 1330 kHz. *1934: Don Lee died and the license went to his son Thomas Lee, and was managed by Marion R. Harris. *1942: The station began operating at 1360 kHz. *1949: KGB was operating at 1000 watts. Don Lee, Inc. was merged with Mutual Broadcasting Company. *1954: The station was sold to Marion R. Harris. *1958: KGB's studios moved from the Pickwick Hotel to 4141 Pacific Highway, and the transmitter moved to 52nd Street and Kalmia. Power was increased at the new transmitter site to 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. (Because AM radio waves travel farther at night, some stations must reduce power after sunset to avoid interfering with stations in nearby cities operating on the same frequency.) *1996: Nationwide Communications acquires the station, it would merge with Jacor two years later *2000: Clear Channel acquires all stations owned by Jacor Communications. *2014: Clear Channel spins off its radio divisions into iHeartMedia =Early years (1922-1959)= KLSD is San Diego's oldest licensed radio station still broadcasting today, first going on the air as KFBC on July 14, 1922, broadcasting on 833.3 kHz (360 meters) and sharing the time with eight other San Diego radio stations. As the government expanded the AM band to numerous frequencies, the station soon moved to 1210 kHz, and later to 1330 kHz. The call sign was changed to KGB in 1928, and the frequency moved to its present 1360 kHz in 1942. The call letters have nothing to do with the Soviet- era KGB. In 1928, the U.S.S.R. intelligence and internal security service was still known as the OGPU and would not become the KGB, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, until 26 years later, in 1954. =Music era (1960-1981)= In the 1960s, KGB was an important player in the San Diego AM Top 40 race, being one of the first markets for the Boss Radio format. In the 1970s, with its FM sister station KGB-FM, 1360 KGB became an early adopter and pioneer of what is now called the album oriented rock format. KGB-FM still plays classic rock from that era on 101.5 MHz. The AM side of KGB returned to the top 40 format for a few years in the late 1970s under the moniker \\"13K\\", with a good amount of success. =Format and callsign changes (1982-2003)= As music was being phased off of AM radio, 1360 KGB became KCNN with an all-news format in 1982, using the audio from CNN Headline News, now the HLN Network. In 1986, the station switched to KPQP, playing Adult Standards. In 1997 the call sign changed to KPOP, with the same adult standards format. The KPOP callsign did not associate the station with the music genre. =Progressive Talk era (2004-2006)= The station became a progressive talk station under the call sign KLSD (with LSD standing for Liberal San Diego) in August 2004. Most of the programming came from the Air America Radio Network. KLSD also aired the Ed Schultz show from Jones Radio Network and Mike Malloy from Nova M Radio. Local programming included the morning show, hosted by Stacy TaylorStacy Taylor website (last heard on San Diego 1700 AM) and the nationally syndicated Air America host Jon Elliott.Jon Elliott website Its logo during this period was similar to that of sister station and progressive talk outlet KABQ in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In August 2005, Clear Channel Media applied to the FCC to increase KLSD's power to 50,000 watts day and night, planning to share the six-tower KSDO array in Santee, California, since the owners of KLSD also owned the broadcast site for KSDO.FCC Website However, due to the added cost, Clear Channel decided against the move, and 1360 still broadcasts at 5,000 watts day/1,000 watts night. =Sports era (2007-present)= KLSD's first logo as a sports station, used from 2007-2014 In August 2007, format change rumbles had started in the market and were reported by SDRadio.net. There was speculation that KLSD would soon adopt an all-sports format, possibly called \\"XTRA Sports.\\" (The format and tagline was used by AM690 for many years in the San Diego market.) Clear Channel had an agreement with Fox Sports Radio to market and distribute the service, adding to the speculation that the parent company wanted an outlet for Fox Sports in San Diego. About October 22, the station started (possibly accidentally) slipping in station identifications for the name \\"KHTS-FM HD-3,\\" to which the Air America content was rumored to be moving. Jon Elliot had also mentioned \\"93.3 HD-3\\" as a possible new home for the Air America and similar programs, implying the Progressive Talk format would be leaving AM 1360 for an HD Radio channel, only available to owners of HD radio receivers. When it became known that KLSD was going to change format from Liberal Talk to Sports Talk, listeners organized and held rallies to attempt to persuade Clear Channel to keep the format.Listeners rally to save KLSDSan Diego Union Tribune Station officials at first denied the rumor.am1360 website A documentary titled Save KLSD: Media Consolidation and Local Radio was being made about the effort.Daily KOSOfficial Website Save KLSD: Media Consolidation and Local Radio On November 12, 2007, KLSD flipped to the new format as XTRA Sports 1360, inheriting the former branding from XETRA-AM, which would change its callsign to XEWW a month later. The first local live program, which aired at 3 p.m., was Lee Hacksaw Hamilton. Hamilton left the station in 2008 when his contract was not renewed. The callsign was not changed. During the first ratings period since the format change to sports, Winter of 2008, KLSD ratings dropped below the minimum Arbitron standard of 0.3. As a comparison, the progressive radio format of KLSD last received a 1.6 for Fall 2007. This was the first time in San Diego's AM 1360 history when the station did not meet the minimum ratings threshold. On July 21, 2014, KLSD rebranded as \\"Xtra 1360 Fox Sports San Diego\\" as a partnership with the Fox Sports San Diego TV network. In September 2014, Clear Channel Communications became iHeartMedia. Today, San Diego is served by one other English language sports radio station, Entercom-owned KWFN, which broadcasts at 97.3 FM.

The station's signal is owned and operated by Media Sports de M√©xico (itself owned by Mexican businessman Jaime Bonilla Valdez). XEPE is on the air 24 hours a day at 10,000 watts in the AM expanded band, commonly known as the \\"X band\\". The 1700 kHz frequency has de facto clear channel status. There are no expanded AM band stations at 1700 AM in the United States west of Texas or in the rest of Mexico. Unlike X-band stations in the U.S., which reduce their power to 1,000 watts at night, XEPE keeps its 10,000 watts of power around the clock. History The history of XEPE begins in August 1987, when Guillermo Dionisio Salas Vargas was selected by the Mexican government from among 19 applicants to operate a station on 1600 kHz. The call sign assigned at that time was XETCT-AM. By the time a concession was issued in 1994, the station had the call sign XEKTT-AM. In 1999, XEKTT was sold to Carlos de Jes√∫s Qui√±ones Armend√°riz (Radio S.A.), who in turn sold the station to Media Sports de M√©xico, S.A. de C.V. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, both the frequency and call sign changed, the former on several occasions. XEKTT unsuccessfully experimented with a move to a lower frequency. It abruptly moved to 550 kHz, which caused interference concerns for US stations. XEKTT was prompted to move to 560, but that did not remediate the interference and instead prompted action by US broadcasters who sought to revoke XEKTT's authorization to receive programming from across the border. In 2004, the SCT (Mexico's communications authority) authorized the station to move to 1700 kHz, and in February 2005, the call sign was changed to XEPE-AM. Logo used as an ESPN Radio affiliate XEPE was on the air in the spring of 2005 and used to supplement sister XEPRS in its coverage of San Diego Padres games.Jay Posner, \\"Padres flagship adds simulcast\\", San Diego Union-Tribune April 6, 2005. That August, XEPE added a business talk format under the branding \\"Cash 1700\\". On August 1, 2007, XEPE switched to a talk radio format, while keeping some business talk programs, such as financial talk show host Ray Lucia. Conservative syndicated talk shows from Michael Reagan and Dennis Miller were also on the schedule. After progressive talk station 1360 KLSD switched to a sports format, XEPE tried adding some liberal-leaning shows including one locally hosted by Stacy Taylor. The syndicated The Lionel Show was carried during overnight hours. In late 2009, XEPE became a partner to sister station XEPRS 1090. XEPRS was enjoying success as San Diego's top sports radio station, and XEPE began running some of the games and sports shows that XEPRS couldn't carry due to other commitments. On October 6, 2010, the station became an affiliate of ESPN Radio as ESPN 1700. In 2017, the station's daytime lineup began to carry a block of financial talk shows under the banner Your Business, Your Life. On December 12, 2018, the station's ESPN Radio programming, as well as that of sister station XHPRS-FM, was taken off- air due to a payment dispute between the station's ownership and Broadcast Company of the Americas. The over-the-air transmitter carried a simulcast of XESDD-AM until February 3, 2020, when the station began running the Heraldo Radio news-talk network from Mexico City. Sports rights At its demise, play-by-play on ESPN 1700 consisted of the University of San Diego football and basketball games and San Diego Gulls hockey games (on a secondary basis, shared with XEPRS). At one time, it aired San Diego State Aztecs basketball (now on KOGO or KLSD), the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer (now on KLAC and KEIB in Los Angeles), and San Diego Sockers PASL games. It was also the flagship station of the San Diego Shockwave of the National Indoor Football League until the league suspended operations. It also had broadcast rights to the Lake Elsinore Storm minor league baseball team until 2009, when it lost the rights to KXFG.

She is usually depicted as a secret agent, an ex-field agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. under Nick Fury, and a love interest of Captain America/Steve Rogers. In the original comic book continuity, Sharon was the younger sister of Peggy Carter, the possible wartime love interest of Captain America. She was later retconned as Peggy's grand-niece because of the unaging nature of comic book characters.Emily VanCamp interview confirms Sharon is Peggy's great-niece Emily VanCamp portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016) and will return to play the role in the upcoming Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2020). Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and penciler and co-plotter Jack Kirby, Carter first appeared in Tales of Suspense #75 (cover-date March 1966). Carter was apparently killed in Captain America #233. She was revived in issue #444 by writer Mark Waid, who commented, \\"The reason she works so well with Cap is because she's a complete cynic and he's a complete idealist\\". Sharon Carter appeared as a supporting character in the 2010-2013 Secret Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #21 (March 2012). Fictional character biography Sharon was born in Richmond, Virginia, the daughter of two wealthy Virginians, Harrison and Amanda Carter. She grew up with the stories of her aunt (Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Carter) who was a freedom fighter with the French Resistance during World War II. Inspired by her aunt's adventures, Sharon joins the international security agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and is assigned the code name Agent 13. By this time, Steve Rogers, the patriotic hero known as Captain America, had been revived from suspended animation, and during one of Sharon's earliest missions, he comes to her aid when she is under attack by a mercenary known as Batroc the Leaper. The two of them cross paths often, teaming up on missions against A.I.M., HYDRA, Red Skull, and many others. Sharon and Rogers eventually fall in love, and she becomes one of the first to know his secret identity. The dangerous nature of Sharon's work strains their relationship, and Rogers wants Sharon to give up her life as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. While working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison with the New York Police Department, Sharon investigates and infiltrates a white supremacist terrorist organization known as the National Force. During one of the National Force's battles with street criminals in Harlem, the National Guard is sent in. Under the effects of a mind-altering gas, Sharon apparently activates a self-destruct device in her National Force uniform and commits suicide. Rogers is shown the event on videotape.Captain America #237 (Sept. 1979). Marvel Comics. It is later revealed that Sharon's death was faked so she could go on a top secret mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. The mission did not go well, and Nick Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Executive Director, believed her to have been killed in action; Captain America was not informed of the true circumstances of her \\"death\\". =Return= Sharon is not dead, but has been left behind in enemy territory, a captive of the dictator Tap-Kwai. Escaping, she spends several years working as a mercenary, until she encounters a group of Neo-Nazi extremists known as the Kubecult. Learning that they plan to use the Cosmic Cube to return Adolf Hitler to life, Sharon joins forces with the villainous Red Skull to stop them, but they also need Captain America. At this point, Rogers is suffering health problems: the Super-Soldier serum that gave him his abilities is breaking down, and he has fallen into a coma. The Red Skull is currently occupying a cloned body of Rogers himself, and a transfusion of the Skull's blood, which contains an uncontaminated Super-Soldier formula, restores and revives Rogers. Rogers is shocked to find Sharon alive. Over the course of the mission to topple the cult he learns that her years out in the cold have made her grimmer and more ruthless, and the two of them do not renew their relationship when Sharon rejoins S.H.I.E.L.D. A romantic tension still exists: Sharon teases him about his na√Øvet√©, such as when he lets a family of squatters stay in his apartment. The two battle the Red Skull, who possesses a cosmic cube that can do whatever he wishes. Sharon and Captain America argue about killing the Skull, with Sharon urging Rogers to use an energy-based shield that she has given him. Sharon tries and fails to kill the Red Skull, but he is soon defeated through trickery. The energy shield is lost in the time-stream. Soon afterwards, Sharon assists Captain America in several cases where patriotic Americans go on violent rampages under the influence of a supernatural entity named Nightmare, who has found a way to influence this dimension through the 'American dream.' Sharon and Cap battle many patriotic people, including a temporarily insane U.S. Agent, and ultimately Sharon has to face down a Captain America under the influence of Nightmare.These events took place in Captain America Vol. 3, issues 9-12 (1998), reprinted in the hardcover \\"Captain America: American Nightmare\\". =21st Century= In the absence of Nick Fury, Sharon serves a brief term as Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. She returns to field work, reporting directly to the new Executive Director, Maria Hill, as a liaison officer specifically assigned to support and report on Captain America's activities. While investigating the whereabouts of Jack Monroe, she is abducted by the Winter Soldier and used as bait to lure Captain America into a trap set by General Aleksander Lukin. She and Captain America later resume their relationship while on a field mission investigating the activities of the Winter Soldier. During the \\"Civil War\\" storyline, Sharon is initially a supporter of the Superhuman Registration Act, but she is averse to actually aiding in the capture of her lover, Captain America, who is the leader of the \\"Secret Avengers\\" opposed to the Act. At the same time, she is an unknowing pawn of the Red Skull and his associate Doctor Faustus. She later comes into contact with Nick Fury's underground organization, even as she is reassigned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. task force charged with locating Fury. She switches her allegiance to Captain America, citing the death of Goliath as the primary reason; it is unclear how much of this is the result of Faustus's influence. In a follow-up, a sniper shoots Steve Rogers in the shoulder while he walks up the steps to the Federal Court. In the ensuing crowd chaos, Rogers is shot three times in the abdomen with a pistol, and later appears to die of his injuries. It is later revealed that the plan was orchestrated by the Red Skull; the sniper was Crossbones, and Sharon Carter shot Rogers in the abdomen while under a hypnotic suggestion by Dr. Faustus.Captain America Vol. 2 #25. Marvel Comics. Sharon is still under the influence of Doctor Faustus, who uses her to disable Black Widow and Falcon before she joins the Red Skull's organization as a minion. She is apparently pregnant with Rogers's child, but she loses the baby during a fight with the Red Skull's daughter, Sin, during one of several attempts to escape. Later, Sharon says that she, not Sin, stabbed her womb and caused the miscarriage, to keep the Red Skull from getting his hands on anything of hers. Doctor Faustus makes her forget ever being pregnant, and he also gives her the tools to escape. Sharon frees herself, killing Aleksander Lukin in the process (and narrowly missing killing the Red Skull himself), before being found by Black Widow and the Falcon. Iron Man and Falcon decide to tell her about her pregnancy at a later date, after sufficient recovery time.Captain America #41-42. Marvel Comics. As a result, Sharon decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D.Captain America #43. Marvel Comics. Sharon Carter is featured in the storyline Captain America: Reborn, where she learns that she killed Captain America and plans to figure out a way to revive him. Unfortunately, Norman Osborn also plans to revive Captain America, so that he can complete the Red Skull's plan to transfer his consciousness into Steve's body and have him lead the Avengers to increase his popularity. He frames Sharon as an accomplice in Rogers' murder and threatens to kill the second Captain America if she doesn't turn herself in, which she does.Captain America: Reborn #2. Marvel Comics. She is brought to Latveria, where she is attached to a machine to bring Rogers back, but with the Red Skull controlling his body. Mr. Fantastic determines that Sharon has chronal tracers in her blood meant to pull Steve to her.Captain America: Reborn #3-4. Marvel Comics. She surrenders to Norman Osborn in order to save the life of Bucky (who had already escaped, unbeknownst to her), and she is delivered to the Red Skull and Dr. Doom, who use her to retrieve Steve, with the Skull's mind in control.

It turns out that she has been under mind control. She becomes the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury supposedly dies. In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Carter is also an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but is much closer to the environment of Ultimate Spider-Man. She often appears as one of a pair of wise-cracking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, the other one is the Ultimate Jimmy Woo.Ultimate Spider-Man #11-14. Marvel Comics. She can display humor at times, but mostly keeps her mouth shut in public. As seen in Ultimate Spider-Man #46, she is a practicing Christian and has strong morals, which lead her to want S.H.I.E.L.D. to destroy individuals such as Otto Octavius rather than 'lock them away for poking'.Ultimate Spider-Man #46.

It is owned by Salem Media Group and airs a talk radio format. Studios and offices are on Towne Center Drive in San Diego's University City area. The transmitter is off Moreno Avenue in Lakeside, California.http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=KCBQ-AM&h;=N By day, KCBQ operates at 50,000 watts, the maximum power for American AM stations. Because AM 1170 is a clear-channel frequency, KCBQ must reduce its power at night to 2900 watts to avoid interfering with Class A stations KFAQ in Tulsa, Oklahoma and WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia. It uses a directional antenna at all times. KCBQ had been a Top 40 powerhouse in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, later airing country music and oldies formats in the 1980s and 1990s, before switching to talk.  History  1170 first signed on the air in 1946.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-26 Its original call sign was KSDJ (for its owner The San Diego News Journal). The station began broadcasting from its first studio at 5th and Ash (later to become the studios of KFMB AM-FM-TV). In 1949, KSDJ was sold to Charles Elliot Salek and became San Diego's second CBS network affiliate. (KGB had been San Diego's first CBS affiliate during the 1930s). To coincide with the new network affiliation, the KSDJ call letters were changed to KCBQ, meaning Columbia Broadcasting Quality. The call letters KCBS were sought, but the CBS network wanted them for its network-owned San Francisco affiliate. An \\"agreement\\" was reached and Salek settled for \\"K-Columbia-Broadcasting-Quality\\". In 1951, KCBQ moved its studios to the Imig Manor Hotel (now the Lafayette) on El Cajon Blvd. KCBQ's transmitter site was next to the Campus Drive-In at El Cajon Boulevard and College Ave. The drive- in was demolished in the late 1970s and is now the Campus Shopping Center. KCBQ's power until 1958 was 5,000 watts non-directional day and 1,000 watts non-directional night. The station used an RCA BTA-5F 5,000 watt transmitter at the College site. KFSD (now KOGO) used the same model transmitter. Bartell Family Radio bought KCBQ in 1955 and dropped the CBS affiliation as network radio was losing its luster in the face of competition from television. In 1956 the station spent a few months in an old Victorian house during a gap between the end of their lease at the Imig Manor and the completion of the new glass studios at the El Cortez Center at 7th and Ash. Those studios are dedicated in 1957 with a live broadcast from an outdoor stage featuring the music of Bill Green's Big Band. The new studios had a large \\"picture window\\" studio that looked out over the street so that fans could watch their favorite disc jockeys on the air. There was even a mirror mounted over the console so that from the street you could watch the DJ's every move at the controls. The studios were featured in Life Magazine in 1958. This would be the home of one of the nation's pioneering Top 40 stations for the next 11 years. In 1958, the station increased its power to 50,000 watts directional daytime and 5000 watts directional nighttime with a huge $50,000 treasure hunt giveaway to publicize the power increase. The transmitter site was moved from College and El Cajon Boulevard to a new site in then-remote, bucolic Santee. The boosted power was more of an appeal to ad agencies than an actual reception improvement with virtually all of the signal being shot out over the Pacific Ocean. KCBQ was still difficult to hear more than about 20 miles to the north at night. In 1968, the studios moved to the Santee transmitter site where they remained through several ownership changes, until being purchased by Salem Broadcasting in the 1990s. The site was demolished and the transmitter site moved even further east to relatively undeveloped Lakeside, sharing towers with Family Radio's KECR 910. The former Santee transmitter site now bears a monument to its famous 50-year tenant. KCBQ had been one of the leading AM Top 40 stations in San Diego and was a model for the rest of the nation. KCBQ began broadcasting Top 40 music in the late 1950s and continued with the format through the 1960s and 1970s with great success. The station achieved national prominence in 1972‚Äì1973 with its presentation of \\"The Last Contest,\\" a promotional and production extravaganza created by program director Jack McCoy. The promotion was later syndicated nationally by TM Productions of Dallas, and KCBQ's on-air format was widely copied as the \\"Q format.\\" KCBQ's success prompted a substantial number of Top 40 stations to apply to the Federal Communications Commission for new call letters which included the letter Q. During its Top 40 heyday, KCBQ was owned by Bartell Media Corporation.Gerald A. Bartell biography Some of KCBQ's most legendary personalities included Don Howard, Jim O'Leary, Ralph James, Jack Vincent, Dex Allen, Harry \\"Happy Hare\\" Martin, \\"Shotgun\\" Tom Kelly, Charlie & Harrigan, Charlie Tuna, Bob Shannon, Perry Allen, Bobby Ocean, Lee \\"Baby\\" Sims, Jimmy Rabbitt,http://www.jimmyrabbitt.com/rabbittbio.htm Jimmy Rabbitt biography Rich \\"Brother\\" Robbin, Brian Roberts, China Smith, Chuck Browning, Jimi Fox, Harry Scarborough, Dave Conley, Chris Bailey, Gene Knight, Gary Kelley, Paul Kelley, Jim Barker, The Magic Christian, Brian \\"The Blind Owl\\" White, Gary Allyn, Robert L. Collins, Neilson Ross, Phil Flowers and Ron \\"Ugly\\" Thompson, Mason Dixon. By the mid-'70s, the station had begun a series of ownership and format changes that continued on a fairly regular basis. In 1978, with music- formatted radio becoming dominated by FM stations, KCBQ dropped top 40 in favor of an adult contemporary format, to be followed in 1982 by a switch to country music. PD Bob McKay, in 1985 the station changed to a syndicated \\"first decade of rock 'n' roll\\" oldies format, Kool Gold, which carried it through most of the 1990s. It would later simulcast then-sister KKLQ. KCBQ was put up for sale in late 1995, and Salem Media Group acquired it the following summer. Upon the closure of the acquisition on July 4, 1996, music programming ended and KCBQ, like other AM stations at that point, became a talk radio station full time.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-07-19.pdf; On August 28, 2010, a monument to the \\"Top 40\\" days between 1958 and 1978 was dedicated near the site of the former broadcast center and radio towers. The dedication was attended by more than 400 people. Located in the 9400 block of Mission Gorge Road, the monument has over 100 names of on-air personalities. Funding for the monument was raised by alumni and fans of KCBQ radio.KCBQ Remembered KCBQ is often recognized as a pioneer in Top 40 radio and it is rare for a community to erect a monument in honor of a radio station. In 2011, San Diegan Mike Zuccaro launched the \\"Saturday Night Sock Hop\\". A brokered show, it was formatted as a throwback to the early Top-40 days of KCBQ.http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/apr/12/mike- zuccaro-AM-radio-kcbq/ It featured doo-wop, early R&B; and oldies music on Saturday and Sunday evenings. This put KCBQ as a full service station (hybrid talk and music). Though Zuccaro discontinued his program, other music programming remains among the weekend brokered schedule. On January 5, 2015, KCBQ rebranded as \\"1170 The Answer\\".Salem Rebrands Talkers as The Answer Salem uses the moniker \\"The Answer\\" for many of its talk stations across the country. In August 2018, KCBQ received an FM translator at 96.1 FM. It slightly rebranded as 96.1 and 1170 The Answer. Today, the station broadcasts almost complete wall-to-wall syndication, however, the station still has sales offices in the University City area. Programming KCBQ is the San Diego affiliate for Salem's line up of conservative nationally syndicated hosts, which include, but are not limited to Mike Gallagher, Dennis Prager, Hugh Hewitt, Larry Elder and Sebastian Gorka. In an effort to provide some local programming, live and local host Andrea Kaye has a public affairs program, which airs in the evenings. This program uses studios at the KCBQ sales office. Weekends feature shows on money, health, food, law, and cars. Some hours on weekdays and weekends are reserved for brokered programming.  Transmitting facilities  KCBQ featured a 50,000 watt transmitter (limited to 5000 watts at night, later reduced to 1500 watts nighttime). The antenna was originally a six-element directional array in the city of Santee off of Mission Gorge Road. The antenna site was sold amidst urban development in the area, and is now a shopping center, anchored by a Kohl's and a Lowe's. For a time the station had to broadcast at reduced power from a temporary longwire antenna on long time competitor's tower 1360 KGB/KLSD and 101.5 KGB-FM, as well as the former FM side of competitor 910 radio KDEO/KECR (now Channel 933 KHTS-FM). According to the FCC, KCBQ's daytime power on the long wire was 5,000 watts, with power reduced after sunset to 675 watts (non-directional, both day and night). KCBQ received a construction permit for a five-tower array in the area north of Lakeside, not far from the old site, and to increase power to 50,000 watts daytime, 2,900 watts nighttime. The station returned to 50,000 watts on Monday, June 4, 2007. KCBQ is now sharing antennas with 910 KECR, another former AM top 40 competitor of KCBQ's in the first half of the 1960s. In October 2016, Salem Communications purchased K260CG, an FM translator station in Mohave Valley, Arizona. K260CG was then relocated to San Diego. It relays AM 1170 onto 96.1 FM.https://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/179371/kcbq-san-diego-adds-fm-translator-simulcast-in-nor As a consequence, the serial callsign became K241CT, and went on the air in August 2018. The FM transmitter's power is 0.25 kilowatts directional, and is only received in the North County area, in order to avoid co-channel interference with KYDO, which has used the 96.1 frequency since 2013.  In Fiction  The KCBQ studio at 7th Avenue and Ash Street in San Diego, California, appeared in a street scene from an episode of the American television series \\"Perry Mason\\" (\\"The Case of the Cowardly Lion,\\" Season 4, Episode 22 (1961)).\\"Perry Mason,\\" \\"The Case of the Cowardly Lion,\\" (1961).

Belief  Providentialism was sometimes viewed by its adherents as differing between national providence and personal providence. Some English and American Christians came to view personal providentialism as backward and superstitious, while continuing to believe in national providentialism. National providentialism was described by the British historian Nicholas Guyatt as encompassing three broader beliefs: God judged nations on the virtues of its leaders, there is a special role for certain nations, and finally that God worked out a master plan through the role of various nations. Providentialism was frequently featured in discussions of European political and intellectual elites seeking to justify imperialism in the 19th century, on the grounds that the suffering caused by European conquest was justified under the grounds of furthering God's plan and spreading Christianity and civilization to distant nations. In the words of historians, it was an interpretive framework of occurring natural, political and social events at a time when religious and secular were not clearly divided.Hamilton, James Frederick. Democratic Communications: Formations, Projects, Possibilities. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2008, p. 35. Providentialism may be understood as the acceptance of the belief that all that happens in the world is for the greater good, since, \\"God created the social order and appointed each individual in his place within it.\\"Smuts, R. Malcolm. Culture and Power in England, 1585-1685. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, p. 28. Quiverfull movement Providentialism is also a term sometimes used to refer to the general philosophy of Quiverfull adherents. Quiverfull is a small movement among conservative evangelical Christians. Advocates oppose the general acceptance among Protestant Christians of deliberately limiting family size through use of birth control. Advocates believe God controls via providence how many children are conceived and born, pointing to Bible verses that describe God acting to \\"open and close the womb\\". Continual \\"openness to children\\", to conception during routine sexual intercourse, irrespective of timing of the month during the ovulation cycle, is considered by Quiverfull adherents as part of their Christian calling in submission to the lordship of Christ.

It is owned by North County Broadcasting Corp. and is currently off the air. The station's studios are located in Carlsbad, while the transmitter is located in an industrial park in Escondido. From 2004 until February 1, 2007, KFSD was a classical music radio station. KFSD stands for \\"First in San Diego,\\" dating back to the first commercial broadcast license in San Diego. The KFSD call letters were originally assigned in 1926 to AM 620 (later 600). The KFSD call sign was on 600 from 1926‚Äì1963. KFSD was also on FM 94.1 from 1948 to 1963, then re-appeared on 94.1 in 1973 until 1997. The KFSD- TV call sign was on Channel 10 from 1953‚Äì1963. The three KFSD stations switched to the KOGO call sign in 1963, as information about San Diego and its people were fed into a new IBM computer and asked for the perfect call letters for these stations, and it chose KOGO. The last iteration of KFSD-FM 94.1 was as a classical station. KFSD had a good solid audience, but the station was bought by Nationwide Communications (division of Nationwide Insurance). Nationwide felt a change to more aggressive music was a better choice for the only 100 kW station in San Diego. KFSD was changed to KXGL, and became the Eagle 94.1. The Eagle's format proved to be a failure, and in 1998 became KJQY/KJOY 94.1.  History  The station began life in 1957 as KOWN, broadcasting from studios on Hale Avenue on the eastern side of Escondido. In 1964, the station moved into studios in the then-new Escondido Village Mall, and added an FM station, KOWN-FM, on 92.1 MHz. Shoppers could look through double-pane windows to see disk jockeys spinning records and the state-of-the- art (for 1964) Schafer automation system which played easy listening music on the FM station. AM and FM transmitters stayed on Hale Avenue until 1972, when they were moved to a new location south of the city. Both stations moved again in 1974, to studios in the Vineyard Shopping Center on Valley Parkway, just east of the Escondido Village Mall. KFSD's call sign re-emerged on 92.1 in Escondido, now 92.1 Escondido, California, which now simulcasts KSON. The KFSD call letters were then transferred to AM 1450 where KFSD lives today. From February 1, 2007 until March 15, 2010 KFSD was a simulcast of sister station KSPA featuring a nostalgia format, with music from the 1930s through the 1960s. The current format quoting from their website is: \\"Our philosophy is to blend the enduring standards of timeless artists with bold new interpretations from the younger vanguard\\".About page KFSD website The simulcast began again on November 26, 2010, when the Astor Broadcast Group decided to drop KSPA's talk format to bring back the previous adult standards format. The format then continued until March 1, 2012, when it, along with KSPA, picked up the business talk format that had aired on KCEO. As of June 6, 2011, KFSD has begun to broker time to San Diego Radio Seoul, who airs Korean programming weekdays from 6:00 am until 12 noon. Japanese programming also airs weekdays from 3:00 pm until 4 pm.And the big band (doesn't) play on Randy Dotinga, North County Times This programming arrangement ended on February 8, 2012, as KFSD will switch to a business talk format that it is inheriting from sister station KCEO on March 7, 2012, when KCEO flips to Immaculate Heart Radio programming. In February 2015 KFSD changed their format to country, branded as \\"KOW Country 1450\\".Country Comes to AM in Orange and San Diego Counties On May 18, 2015 KFSD changed their format to Spanish Catholic religious, branded as \\"Guadalupe Radio\\".Radio Expands in Southern California As of January 2017 both KFSD and KSPA ended their LMA agreement with Guadalupe Radio and returned both stations to the previous adult standards format. KFSD went off the air on June 1, 2019.http://sbe36.org/2019/09/kfsd-1450-escondido-goes-silent/ In July 2020, North Shore Broadcasting sold KFSD to Raul Caro and Stephen Beuerle‚Äôs IHS Media for $125,000.

When she was a trainee hairdresser in Liverpool, she met Starr at The Cavern Club, where the Beatles were playing. Starr proposed marriage at the Ad-Lib Club in London, on 20 January 1965. They married at the Caxton Hall Register Office, London, in 1965, and divorced in 1975. First living at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone, the Starrs bought Sunny Heights, in St George's Hill, Weybridge. In 1973, they bought Tittenhurst Park from John Lennon. They had three children together: sons Zak and Jason, and daughter Lee.  Early life  Mary Cox was born on 4 August 1946, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. She was the only child of Joseph Cox, a ship's steward, and Florence Cox (n√©e Barrett). As a teenager, she remembered turning her school uniform around to make it look like a frock, and paying a school friend ten cigarettes a day to teach her how to \\"smoke properly\\". She left convent school when she was 14 years old, changing her name to Maureen when she began her career as a trainee manicurist/hairdresser at Ashley du Pre, in Liverpool, but was known as \\"Mo\\" to her friends.  Ringo Starr  At 15, Cox became a regular at The Cavern Club, and remembered the long queues and violent competition for access to the Beatles. Although she got a kiss from Ringo, whom she called ‚ÄòRitchie‚Äô (for Richard), he did not immediately notice her among his numerous fans. All the Beatles were supposed to be officially unattached, for image purposes, and when Ringo started dating Cox, she was often threatened, and once scratched in the face by a vicious rival. She even had to stop working as a hairdresser because of the threats. In September 1963, with her parents' permission, she travelled to Greece with Starr, McCartney, and Jane Asher. On the eve of an international tour, Starr collapsed during a photo session at a studio in Barnes, London. Stricken with a fever and tonsillitis, he was rushed to hospital, where Cox visited every day to help him recuperate. Afterwards they became a monogamous couple. On 20 January 1965, Starr proposed marriage to Cox at the Ad-Lib Club, above the Prince Charles Theatre, London. =Marriage= Caxton Hall, London, where the Starrs were married After finding out that she was pregnant in late January 1965, 18-year-old Maureen married Starr at the Caxton Hall Register Office, London. The service was performed on 11 February 1965 by Barry Digweed, the superintendent registrar. Starr listed his father's profession as 'confectioner', and she listed her father as 'ship's steward'. Starr wrote that his profession was 'musician', but she left her profession blank. Because of the pregnancy, the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein arranged the wedding very quickly, hoping it would be private, with John Lennon telling her there should be no tears, or she 'wouldn't be one of the gang'. McCartney was in Tunisia at the time, and could not attend. After the wedding, George Harrison (who had arrived on a bicycle) jokingly said 'Two down, two to go', meaning that the only two Beatles who were not married were Harrison and McCartney. The Starrs had a brief honeymoon for three days at the holiday home of Epstein's lawyer, David Jacobs, in Prince's Crescent, Hove, but gave an interview in the back garden on their wedding day, as they were being besieged by numerous reporters, with 100 photographers. Starr then had to depart to the Bahamas for the filming of Help!, on 22 February. She made it clear from the start that she would not give interviews, as a Beatles spokesperson explained: 'She doesn't want to get mixed up in publicity, and Ringo doesn't want her to, either.' The Starrs were living at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone, when Epstein's accountant suggested that the group members should move to houses near his, in Esher. Lennon bought a house called Kenwood in St George's Hill, Weybridge, Harrison bought Kinfauns on a nearby estate in Esher, and on 24 July 1965, the Starrs bought Sunny Heights, on South Road, St George's Hill, for ¬£30,000. Ken Partridge was asked to redesign the interior of the six- bedroomed house, incorporating a private pub above the garage, called The Flying Cow, which had a mirrored bar, pool table, jukebox, and a portrait of Lennon and McCartney on the wall. A TV was usually on in every single room, and a go-kart track was laid in the grounds. Although she cooked for the family, the Starrs had a nanny who lived in the house, and a cleaning woman who visited every day. After Lennon moved away, they sold Sunny Heights for ¬£50,000, and bought a 16th-century mansion in Elstead, from Peter Sellers, which they soon sold to Stephen Stills, before moving into Roundhill, on Compton Avenue, Highgate, London, on 25 April 1969. They bought Tittenhurst Park on 18 September 1973, which had been Lennon's former home. Cox enjoyed the closeness of Cynthia Lennon and Pattie Harrison, as they often went on holiday together, shopping, and celebrated Christmas. Starr promised that he would set up a nationwide hairdressing business for his wife, but the idea was later shelved, as she had to deal with looking after their children and being the wife of a Beatle. This would entail waiting with other Beatles' partners, at clubs like the Speakeasy Club, the Ad-Lib, or the Scotch of St James, or staying up all night, waiting for Starr to come home after a recording session, with a cooked meal waiting for him. She was also asked to look after voluminous fan club mail, and would personally answer letters. The Starrs were both interested in various arts, and collaborated on photo montages, paintings and simple sculptures together. On 19 February 1968, the Starrs travelled to Rishikesh, India, with McCartney and Asher. They joined the Lennons and the Harrisons, who had arrived three days earlier. Maureen took an instant dislike to the spiders, mosquitoes, and flies that were ever-present in the ashram, and as Starr was allergic to many foodstuffs, he had taken a case full of tinned baked beans along, but soon tired of them. The division between the sexes was emphasised by the male musicians sitting outside at night composing songs, while their partners would gather together in one of their rooms, often talking about life as the wife or partner of a Beatle. The Starrs left India on 1 March, saying the unfamiliar food was not to their liking, and they were missing their children. Cox sang backup vocals on \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" (from The White Album) and was, along with Yoko Ono, in attendance at the Apple Corps' rooftop concert in 1969, which was filmed for Let It Be, showing her sitting next to the chimney stack with Ono to keep warm. Responding to applause, McCartney can be heard saying 'Thanks, Mo' after the final performance of \\"Get Back\\" on the album Let It Be. =Frank Sinatra's birthday song= The very first song in the Apple Records catalogue was a special private recording by Frank Sinatra. In 1968, as a favour to Starr, Sinatra recorded a special version of his previously released song \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" for Maureen's birthday. Sammy Cahn re-wrote the lyrics, and personalised them: \\"She married Ringo, and she could have had Paul/That's why the lady is a champ\\". Sinatra's recording was pressed as a single in Los Angeles, and notated as Apple 1. (Note: \\"Hey Jude\\" had been previously released as a single, but was not given an Apple Records catalogue number, instead appearing sequentially in the Parlophone and Capitol catalogues.) Starr presented his wife with the single on her 22nd birthday, 4 August 1968. Only a few copies were pressed before the master tape was destroyed; the song is still in demand by record collectors. A poor quality copy of the song began circulating in collector circles, and is now available on several bootleg albums. Starr and his wife attended a Sinatra concert in London, on 8 May 1970. =Children= Zak Starkey was born on 13 September 1965, at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, the same day as the single \\"Yesterday\\" was released. She said at the time: \\"I'd like the baby to be like Ringo, but he need not necessarily follow in his father's footsteps\\". Starr said his son was \\"a little smasher\\", but also said, \\"I won't let Zak be a drummer\\", which was not to be, as his son later went on to play with The Who and Oasis. Jason Starkey was born on 19 August 1967, and daughter Lee Starkey was born on 11 November 1970. =Marital problems and divorce= When the Beatles broke up in 1970, so did the Starrs' marriage, as Starr's infidelities were becoming more frequent, and his alcoholism was escalating. When the Harrisons were visiting the Starrs, Harrison confessed how much he loved Maureen, which led to an affair. Starr threatened divorce when he was told by Harrison's wife Pattie Harrison that she had found the pair in bed together. Lennon was equally angry with Harrison, describing the affair as being \\"virtual incest\\". Despite the couple's problems, notwithstanding extra-marital affairs, she did not want to divorce Starr, but eventually, on 17 July 1975, their divorce was finalised on the grounds of Starr's affair with American fashion model Nancy Lee Andrews. Starr agreed to give his ex-wife custody of their children and a one-off payment of ¬£125,000, along with ¬£23,000 a year plus ¬£2,500 a year for each of their children. The end of her marriage depressed her deeply; she once rode a motorbike into a brick wall in a suicide attempt. Starr later admitted that his first marriage, to Cox, had been dysfunctional, confessing that he had been \\"a drunk, a wife-beater and an absent father.\\" In November 1987 she instructed her counsel, Thayne Forbes QC, to sue Withers, the London firm of solicitors that had handled her divorce settlement, for an alleged \\"breach of contract and negligence,\\" saying that a partner, Charles Doughty, had not fully investigated Starr's finances at the time and had not given enough consideration to the settlement amount and her personal needs. She was present for every day of the three-week court case, and when called to give evidence, she referred to herself as \\"thick as two short planks,\\" and Starr as being a \\"sodding great Andy Capp\\" (a womanising, drunk cartoon character). Acquitting Doughty and Withers, Mr Justice Bush said that Starr was \\"a generous man\\" as he had increased her yearly payments twice since their divorce. He ordered her to pay the whole bill for the case, estimated to be over ¬£200,000.  Later life and death  In 1976, Maureen started to live with Isaac Tigrett, best known as one of the founders of the Hard Rock Cafe and the House of Blues. They were married in Monaco on 27 May 1989. Tigrett, known for collecting memorabilia, once said that Maureen was his \\"ultimate collectible.\\" During her relationship and marriage to Tigrett she often used the phrase, \\"Just give me furs, jewels and property, thank you.\\" They had one daughter together, Augusta King Tigrett, who was born on 4 January 1987, in Dallas, Texas. Cox attended the funeral of drummer Keith Moon on 13 September 1978, at the Golders Green Crematorium, along with 120 guests including Eric Clapton, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts. On December 9, 1980, Lennon's ex-wife, Cynthia Lennon, was staying at Maureen's home in London when Maureen received a phone call from Starr two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York City. Maureen and Starr became grandparents when Tatia Jayne Starkey was born on 7 September 1985, to their eldest son, Zak, and his wife, Sarah Starkey (n√©e Menikides), in England. Cox died at age 48 on 30 December 1994, due to complications from leukaemia, after receiving treatment at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. She had received bone marrow from her son, Zak, who then donated blood platelets and white blood cells. Maureen's four children, her 82-year-old mother, husband Tigrett and ex-husband Starr were all at her bedside when she died. Following her death, McCartney wrote the song \\"Little Willow\\" in her memory, which appears on his 1997 album, Flaming Pie, with a dedication to her children.

Opened in December 1954, it sits at the end of West 15th Street on Eleventh Avenue (West Side Highway), just south of the Chelsea Piers sports complex. It underwent renovations starting in the early 2010s. Design The Hudson River facade of Pier 57. Consisting of two stories above the waterline, the pier also has a concrete basement resting on the riverbed, and an Art Deco-style metal enclosure at the west end with stainless-steel signage reading \\"MARINE & AVIATION\\" and displaying the identifying designation \\"PIER 57\\". The headhouse at the east end of the pier is steel-framed with a brick exterior, bearing similar signage. The long sides of the structure are each topped with a line of continuous \\"burton\\" cargo handling frames, which allowed freight to be easily transferred to and from ships docked at the pier. The pier is notable for being underpinned by three separate submerged buoyant concrete caissons, which are spanned by long steel girders supporting the building above. Designer Emil Praeger of the firm Madigan-Hyland had created similar structures as part of the American military effort in World War II, including temporary breakwaters that were used as part of the D-Day invasion. The caissons were constructed in 1951 and 1952 inside a diked and drained pond in Grassy Point near Haverstraw, New York, and after completion were floated down the Hudson to the site. The two largest (in terms of volume) concrete caissons are long, wide and high. The third is long, high, and of similar width to the other two caissons. The caissons weigh as much as , but float because they weigh less than the of water that they displace.Dunlap, David W. \\"Pier 57 Goes Down in History as a Place Where Concrete Floats\\", The New York Times, August 8, 2016. Accessed August 8, 2016. \\"Even though the larger ones weigh 27,000 tons, they displace about 47,000 tons of water, far more than their own weight.\\" Their buoyancy supports 90% of the pier's weight, with the riverbed supporting the rest. The caissons, often referred to as concrete boxes and dubbed \\"Cheeseboxes\\" during construction, are laid out in a T-shape, with the two caissons of equal dimensions laid out from west-to-east, and the third from north-to-south. The caissons were placed on top of the wooden pilings of the original wooden pier, which were filled with sand and gravel. Dubbed \\"The World's Most Modern Pier\\" and the \\"Superpier\\", it was hailed as an innovative structure, being fireproof, extremely durable and immune to many of the problems that had historically plagued wooden waterfront construction. History = Construction = The front facade of Pier 57 in 2012. Prior to the construction of the current Pier 57, a wooden pier also called Pier 57 was located at the site, built in 1907 at the cost of $1.2 million. It was leased to the Grace Line in 1939. On September 29, 1947, a large fire engulfed the pier lasting several days into early October. Over 200 firefighters were dispatched to the blaze, along with numerous fireboats including the John J. Harvey. The fire originated in the structure's wooden support piles, and the fire was attributed to either the preservation of the piles with creosote or another oil substance, or the accumulation of fuel in the wooden beams. The damage was estimated at $5 million. Shortly after the fire, a replacement pier was planned, with the concrete caisson supports selected to provide a fireproof base. Construction began on August 30, 1950. By September 18, 1952, the three concrete boxes were installed. At the time of its construction, Pier 57 was the largest dock building effort ever undertaken by the City of New York. During construction, a gasoline fire at the site in 1953 killed two workers and injured a third. Final construction costs totaled $12 million. The designers were awarded the Architectural League of New York's Gold Medal in Engineering for this innovative design in 1955. = Maritime use = The pier was dedicated on March 5, 1954, and opened on December 29, 1954. In attendance of both events were Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and city Fire Commissioner Edward Francis Cavanagh, Jr., who had been the Department of Marine and Aviation commissioner that oversaw the planning of the pier. The Grace Line began serving the pier on March 7, 1955 after a dispute with the International Longshoremen's Association. From its opening, the pier served as a terminal for shipping and storage of cargo for the company, replacing the original wooden structure. The company sold its shipping business in 1967. From 1971 until 2003, Pier 57 housed the Hudson Pier Bus Depot for the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA).David W. Chen, Hoping for a Waterfront Makeover Just South of Chelsea Piers, New York Times, October 15, 2003, section B, page 6 The pier was vacated in 2004. About one year after the NYCTA vacated the pier, Pier 57 was temporarily utilized as a detention center during the 2004 Republican National Convention, when approximately 1,200 anti-RNC protesters were arrested and sent to a makeshift detention/processing center at Pier 57. Over 1,800 were arrested during the entire event, giving rise to the nickname \\"Guantanamo on the Hudson\\" for the temporary facility. Medical activists reportedly treated many people held at Pier 57 for chemical burns, rashes, and infections that resulted from direct, prolonged exposure to the motor oil, asbestos, and other contaminants from its days as a bus garage. = Redevelopment = In recognition of its historic engineering significance, the structure was placed on the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places in 2004, but since that time it has been completely disused. Past proposals for re-use have included a 2004 competitive process pitting an extension of the nearby Chelsea Piers sports complex against \\"Leonardo at Pier 57\\", an Italian cultural center that was to be operated by Cipriani S.A.. However, an investigation by the DA's office sparked by an anonymous tip regarding financial irregularities caused the Cipriani team to back out and scuttled the process. In 2009, the Hudson River Park Trust selected Youngwoo & Associates to redevelop the site. The current concept, dubbed the SuperPier after a nickname given to the structure in a 1952 Popular Mechanics article, includes a retail shopping environment based on salvaged steel shipping containers and re-use of the roof and concrete-encased basement space below the waterline, as well as incubator office rental spaces for start-up companies. The office spaces will be developed and leased by RXR Realty. The structure would contain offices for Google, which also had offices in the nearby 111 Eighth Avenue building. The renovated Pier 57 building was originally also supposed to include Bourdain Market, a food market by the TV chef Anthony Bourdain, but plans for the market were scrapped in late 2017. The developers originally projected a spring 2017 re-opening for the site,http://superp.vaesite.net/__data/9aeb6c5e8cf088bc40aef4de60f9a236.pdf/ but by March 2017, that had been pushed back to at least 2018. The structure topped out in June 2017, in advance of a proposed summer 2018 opening. After Bourdain Market canceled its plans to move into Pier 57, Google signed a lease to occupy additional space in the portion of the building where Bourdain Market would have been located. By that time, Pier 57 was expected to open in 2019. In October 2020, City Winery opened a space at Pier 57.

The New York Times. Early life Born in 1970, Brando was raised by her mother Tarita on the island of Tahiti, south of Papeete. Her parents divorced in 1972. While growing up, Marlon Brando did not allow Cheyenne and her brother Tehotu to visit him in the United States. In 1976 he stated, \\"I don't think I will let them [Cheyenne and Tehotu] go to the States. As Tahitians, they are too trusting. They would be destroyed in the pace of life in the States.\\" As a child, Cheyenne reportedly adored her father and bragged about him. As she entered her teenage years, her feelings towards her father changed. In a 1990 interview she stated, \\"I have come to despise my father for the way he ignored me when I was a child. He came to the island maybe once a year but really didn't seem to care whether he saw me or not. He wanted us but he didn't want us.\\" Cheyenne eventually dropped out of high school and began taking drugs including LSD, PCP, marijuana, and tranquilizers. During this time, she began a modeling career. In 1989, Cheyenne was seriously injured in a car accident when she crashed a Jeep she was driving after her father refused to allow her to visit him while he was filming The Freshman in Toronto. She sustained a broken jaw, a laceration under her eye, and a torn ear. Marlon Brando flew Cheyenne to Los Angeles to undergo extensive reconstructive and cosmetic surgery. The accident effectively ended her modeling career. After the accident, she began experiencing bouts of depression and attempted suicide. Death of Dag Drollet In May 1987, Cheyenne began dating 23-year-old Dag Drollet. His father, Jacques Drollet, was a member of the Assembly of French Polynesia. The pair were introduced through a get-together, as the Brandos and Drollets had been longtime friends. In 1989, Cheyenne became pregnant with their child. At Marlon Brando's request, the couple moved to the United States and into Marlon's Mulholland Drive home to await the birth of their child. On 16 May 1990, Drollet was fatally shot by Cheyenne's elder half-brother Christian at their father's home.The New York TimesThe New York Times Christian Brando maintained that the shooting was accidental. He stated that earlier in the evening, Cheyenne told him that Drollet was physically abusing her. Later that night, Christian confronted Drollet about the abuse. Christian claimed that the gun went off after Drollet tried to take the gun away from him. Christian Brando was immediately arrested and charged with first-degree murder two days later. The prosecutors of the case attempted to subpoena Cheyenne to testify at Christian's trial as they felt her account of the night's event was crucial in proving the shooting was premeditated. However, she refused to testify and fled to Tahiti. On 26 June 1990, she gave birth to a son she named Tuki Brando. Soon after Tuki's birth, Cheyenne attempted suicide twice and was hospitalized for drug detoxification in a psychiatric hospital. On 22 December 1990, Cheyenne was declared \\"mentally disabled\\" by a French judge and was deemed unable to testify in her brother's trial. Without Cheyenne's testimony, prosecutors felt they could no longer prove that Drollet's death was premeditated. They presented Christian Brando with a plea deal. Christian took the deal and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. He served a total of five years and was placed on three years' probation. In an interview given after his release, Christian stated that he doubted Cheyenne's accusations of physical abuse against Drollet due to her mental instability. \\"I feel like a complete chump for believing her,\\" he said. Aftermath and final years In the years following Drollet's death and her half-brother Christian's trial, Cheyenne Brando's mental health steadily declined. She repeatedly entered drug rehab and psychiatric hospitals. Cheyenne also publicly accused her father of molesting her and accused him of being an accomplice in Drollet's death: Marlon Brando denied both accusations. Cheyenne Brando was later formally diagnosed with schizophrenia, became isolated from her former friends, and lost custody of her son, Tuki, to her mother, who raised him in Tahiti. As an adult, Tuki Brando, like his mother, would go into modeling and also enter medical school. Death On 16 April 1995, Cheyenne hanged herself at her mother's house in Puna'auia, Tahiti. Neither her father nor her half-brother Christian were able to attend her funeral in Tahiti. She was buried in the Roman Catholic Uranie Cemetery in Papeete in the family crypt of Dag Drollet's family.

Kathleen Crowley was the lead; one day with half the film to finish she turned up to filming three hours late claiming she had been raped. The script was rewritten to build up the role played by Jayne Mansfield and additional scenes were shot involving a double for Crowley. Release The movie was shown as a double feature with Roger Corman's The Oklahoma Woman in 1956 to ride on Mansfield's popularity which had risen dramatically due to her 20th Century Fox films released at the time. =Critical response= In Death on the Cheap, Arthur Lyons writes that the film, although \\"shoddily written, produced and directed\\", is significant for several reasons, including \\"It was American International's only foray into film noir ... The film also marked a return to the screen of noir icon Lawrence Tierney, whose off-screen bar brawls and numerous arrests during the 1940s had made him persona non grata in Hollywood.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz, gave the film a mixed review and discussed the film's problems. He wrote, \\"A muddled but diverting B film noir melodrama from cheapie American International Pictures. Future sex queen Jayne Mansfield, known as the blonde bombshell, made her acting debut, costarring as a nymphomaniac. Its attempts to be hard-boiled fall apart when it becomes apparent that writer Burt Kaiser couldn't get a handle on the plot line, and instead lets the narrative get mired in too much silliness. It also suffers from a weak directing effort by Bruno Ve Sota and cheesy production values.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, April 19, 2005. Accessed: July 20, 2013.

The show's format was adapted for mainstream television as the BBC Scotland show videoGaiden, featuring the same creative team, while episodes of Consolevania continued to be produced and distributed online as time permitted. History The show began production in early 2004, and episodes were initially distributed for free on CD in the post to interested members of the RLLMUK discussion forum, before being made available as torrents and then as HTTP downloads from the show's website and mirror sites. The first two episodes of Series One were released in March and April 2004, with the rest of the series being released between August 2004 and April 2005. The first and second episodes of Series Two appeared in July and August 2005, following which the show was put on hiatus while the creative team worked on the first series of videoGaiden. Episodes 3‚Äì7 were released at monthly intervals between March and July 2006. A second hiatus followed, during which the second series of videoGaiden was made and broadcast, and the eighth and final episode of Series Two was finally released in February 2007. Series Three began in the summer of 2007, and four episodes (as well as a lost episode) were released between June and October 2007. Production of Consolevania then halted again for the third series of videoGaiden (December 2007‚ÄìMarch 2008). In late 2008, the show's creators experimented with a new distribution method, making new reviews and sketches available on the show's YouTube account before releasing compilations of these items as episodes in the usual manner. However, this proved to be a short-lived experiment: equipment problems and the creative team's growing disenchantment led to the end of the original run of Consolevania in January 2009. After an eight-year hiatus, and following the release of a fourth series of videoGaiden in 2016, a new series of Consolevania, based on a subscription model, was announced at the beginning of 2017. New episodes have been made available to the show's Patreon subscribers on a monthly basis, from February 2017 onwards. Series Four concluded in November 2017 and was followed by a Christmas special. Series Five began in January 2018, and Series Six (a shorter series of themed episodes) in January 2019. Following a trailed change to the series format, Series Seven began in August 2019. 24 episodes (one of which is currently missing) were produced during the show's original 2004‚Äì09 run, while 44 episodes have been produced so far for the second run (2017- ), making a current total of 68.

He played in the American Basketball Association (ABA) for the Minnesota Muskies, Indiana Pacers, and Memphis Sounds, and in the National Basketball Association for the New York Nets. Daniels was a two-time ABA Most Valuable Player, three-time ABA Champion and a seven-time ABA All-Star. Daniels was the All-time ABA rebounding leader. Daniels was enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012. Early life The son of Maceo and Bernice Daniels, Mel Daniels moved with his family back to his birthplace of Detroit, Michigan from Lincoln, North Carolina when Mel was a toddler. Mel had two sisters. Back in Detroit, the family first lived with Mel's grandfather, then in a tenement on 8 Mile Road and finally in a house on McDougall Street. Maceo Daniels worked in an automobile parts factory. Bernice read poetry to Mel. He began writing poems by age eight and continued to write them throughout the rest of his life, generally focusing on the lives of athletes, but wrote poems about non-sports topics as well. Daniels mostly did not share his poems with his teammates, ‚ÄúThis is the side I‚Äôve kept quiet,‚Äù he said of his poems. Daniels attended Pershing High School in Detroit, Michigan. Pershing also produced Spencer Haywood, Ralph Simpson, Kevin Willis, Ted Sizemore and Steve Smith. Will Robinson, physical education teacher and basketball coach at Pershing High School, recalled Daniels being absent from PE class for a few weeks. So Mr. Robinson went looking for the truant Daniels and finally found him in the hallway and ordered him to the gym. A few days later, Daniels still had not appeared in class, so Robinson went looking for him again. The way Mel Daniels, then a sophomore, remembered it, he was ordered by Coach Robinson to report to the gymnasium at 3:30 to join the basketball team. \\"Chief, I want you in the gym today,\\" Daniels recalled Coach Robinson telling him. \\"If you're not in the gym, I'm going to come get you and beat your a‚Äî.\\" Will Robinson would win two state championships at Pershing, become the first black NCAA Division I coach at Illinois State in 1970 and later scout for the NFL Detroit Lions and NBA Detroit Pistons. Daniels was slow to earn playing time in high school, playing sparingly in junior varsity games his first two seasons. He was also slow in running fitness laps under Coach Robinson's direction. \\"Jesus Christ, he would always be a bad last,\\" Robinson recalled. \\"Not just last, but a bad last. The guys would lap him. He had a winning spirit. He tried all the time after he found out the swing of things.\\" Ted Sizemore, later a major league baseball player, was a high school basketball teammate of Daniels and recalled, \\"Will (Robinson) worked him. One thing Mel never did was give up. He kept coming back and Will made him work, work, work. He just kept developing and developing. He just did a lot of work. A lot of drills, footwork, handling the ball. He just got coordinated all of a sudden.\\" After growing to 6'9\\", Daniels showed his potential as a senior and Robinson helped him secure a scholarship at Burlington Community College in Iowa. College career (1963-1967) Daniels continued to improve in college. Playing the 1963-1964 season at Burlington Community College in Burlington, Iowa, Daniels averaged 25.2 points and 10.0 rebounds and was named a Junior College All- American.Basketball: A Biographical Dictionary. by David L. Porter, P.103. While at Burlington, Dainiels was recruited to play for the University of New Mexico Lobos by coach Bob King. Daniels transferred, played for New Mexico from 1964-1967, averaged 20 points per game in his New Mexico Lobo career and was named an All-American. Starting as a sophomore in 1964-65, the 6-9 power forward played in 27 games and averaged 17.0 points and 11.2 rebounds as New Mexico finished 19-8. During the 1965-66 season, Daniels suffered a severe injury when he put his arm through a glass door at Johnson Gymnasium, requiring 352 stitches and almost ending his athletic career. The sutures notwithstanding, Daniels missed one game and averaged 21.2 points and 10.3 rebounds as the Lobos finished 16-8. The 1966-67 team won a school-record 17 straight games to start the season as New Mexico climbed to No. 3 in the national rankings. Daniels led the Western Athletic Conference in scoring at 21.5 points, along with 11.6 rebounds as New Mexico finished 19-8. For his career, Daniels averaged 20.0 points and 11.1 rebounds in 77 games at New Mexico. He had 44 career double-doubles, still the most in school history. ABA/NBA career Daniels was the ninth pick of the 1967 NBA draft, selected by the Cincinnati Royals, and was also drafted by the Minnesota Muskies of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He chose to play in the fledgling ABA. After rejecting Cincinnati (with Oscar Robertson), Daniels became the first NBA first-round pick to snub the established league and go to the ABA. \\"At that time, it wasn't about money for me. But y'know, 2 + 2 is still 4,\\" Daniels said of his decision to go to the ABA. \\"I was offered $15,000 by Cincinnati as a bonus and $17,500 as a salary. I was offered $15,000 as a bonus in Minnesota and $30,000 as a salary. So the higher number somehow won out.\\" Daniels' decision to play in the ABA led to great success for him. Daniels won three ABA Championships, was a two-time ABA Most Valuable Player, a seven time ABA All-star and led the ABA in rebounding average in three different seasons. Daniels is the ABA's all-time leader in total rebounds and second in ABA career average rebounds (15.12) behind only fellow Hall of Famer Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels (17.07). Daniels had 1,608 career postseason rebounds in the ABA. = Minnesota Muskies (1967-1968) = As a rookie in 1967‚Äì68 with the Minnesota Muskies, Daniels was named the American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year. He averaged 22.2 points and a league leading 15.6 rebounds in 78 games, as Minnesota finished 50-28 under coach Jim Pollard. Minnesota lost to the eventual ABA Champion Pittsburgh Pipers with Connie Hawkins in the 1968 ABA Playoffs, as Daniels averaged 25.3 points and 16.1 rebounds in 10 playoff games. After the 1967-1968 season, Daniels was traded to the Indiana Pacers for cash (reportedly, $75,000), Jimmy Dawson and Ron Kozlicki, as Minnesota was experiencing financial difficulty. Minnesota moved to become the Miami Floridians after the one season in Minnesota. = Indiana Pacers (1968-1974) = With Indiana in 1968-1969, Daniels was named the ABA Most Valuable Player as he averaged 24.0 points and an ABA leading 16.5 rebounds. With Hall of Fame Coach Slick Leonard taking over from Larry Staverman as the Pacers coach early in the season, in the 1969 ABA Playoffs, Indiana defeated the Kentucky Colonels 4-3, Daniels' former team, the Miami Floridians 4-1 before losing to the Oakland Oaks with Rick Barry 4-1 in the 1969 ABA Finals. \\"Slick was one of the most creative, innovative coaches ever,\\" Daniels said of his longtime Pacers coach. \\"He would change our offense at halftime. He'd create six new plays and we executed them the way he drew them up on the board.\\" In 1969-1970, Indiana won the 1970 ABA championship with a 4-2 series win over the Los Angeles Stars in the ABA Finals. Daniels averaged 18.7 points and 17.6 rebounds in the regular season, as Indiana finished 59-25. Hall of Famer Roger Brown, Bob Netolicky John Barnhill and Freddie Lewis helped lead the Pacers to the ABA Title. Daniels averaged 19.3 points and 17.7 rebounds in the playoffs. In 1970-1971, the Pacers finished 58-26, as Daniels was again named the ABA Most Valuable Player. He averaged 21.0 points, a league leading 18.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists. The Pacers were defeated by the Utah Stars 4-3 in the Western Division Finals in the 1971 ABA Playoffs. Daniels averaged 21.4 points and 19.2 rebounds in the playoffs. In 1971-1972 the Pacers added Hall of Famer George McGinnis. They then won their second ABA Title, as they defeated the Denver Rockets 4-3, the Utah Stars 4-3 and the New York Nets with Rick Barry 4-2 in the 1972 ABA Finals. Daniels averaged 19.2 points, 16.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists as Indiana finished the regular season 47-37. Daniels averaged 15.3 points and 15.1 rebounds in the playoffs. The Pacers won their third ABA Championship in 1972-1973. Daniels averaged 18.5 points and 15.4 rebounds alongside McGinnis (27.6 points and 12.5 rebounds), as Indiana finished 51-33. In the 1973 ABA Playoffs, Indiana defeated the Denver Rockets 4-1 and the Utah Stars 4-2. In the 1973 ABA Finals the Pacers defeated the Kentucky Colonels with Hall of Famers Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel, Louis Dampier and former Pacer teammate Rick Mount 4-3 to capture the ABA Championship. Daniels averaged 15.9 points and 13.8 rebounds in the playoffs. In his last season in Indiana, Daniels averaged a double-double 15.4 points and 11.6 rebounds in 1973-1974. The Pacers finished 46-38 and lost to the Utah Stars in the Western Conference finals in the 1974 ABA Playoffs, with Daniels averaging 12.2 points and 11.4 rebounds in the playoffs. \\"He was the leader on the ballclub,\\" said Coach Slick Leonard of Daniels. \\"He expected his teammates to bring it every night and he would get on 'em. But off the floor, he was like a big bear.\\" In 479 career games with the Indiana Pacers, Daniels averaged 19.0 points and 16.4 rebounds. = Memphis Sounds (1974-1975) = In 1974-1975, Daniels (along with Freddie Lewis) was traded to the Memphis Sounds for Charles Edge. Roger Brown joined them in Memphis as well. Early in the season, Daniels suffered pulled stomach muscles and missed a month. Then, he fell in a bathtub and injured his back, ending up back on injured list. His back problems were chronic .Daniels averaged 9.8 points and 9.0 rebounds. \\"I was traded (to Memphis) with the understanding that we'd play together,\\" Daniels recalled of his Memphis experience. \\"But Roger was traded to Utah and Freddie went to St. Louis. We were lied to. Then I hurt my back. Everything kind of fell apart. I never got my passion for the game back. Once you're lied to, you lose respect for the people who did it to you. You start doubting yourself a little bit. And your boys are gone.\\" In 1975-1976, the Memphis Sounds relocated and became the Baltimore Claws. The Baltimore franchise was suddenly disbanded after three exhibition games due to financial difficulties. Daniels said at the time: \\"It just seems unbelievable. I've been around the ABA for nine years and felt this would be the most solid year and now this happens. We worked hard and wanted something good to happen with this team. The guys feel it is part of our lives that has been swooped away. We tried hard to keep it together by working real hard in practice even when we weren't getting paid. But now it's all over and we're all down in the dumps.\\" The Baltimore Claws players were then available to other ABA teams in a special draft. The 31-year-old Daniels was passed over in the resulting dispersal draft, as other teams were likely wary of assuming the contract he had with Baltimore. Daniels decided to retire from the league rather than play for another ABA team. He then played in Italy during the 1975-1976 season. After the 1976 ABA-NBA merger, the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, New York Nets and Indiana Pacers merged with the NBA. The remaining ABA teams were disbanded. On October 19, 1976, Daniels signed as a free agent with the New York Nets and on December 13, 1976 he was waived by the Nets and retired. Daniels had played with the Nets for 11 games during the 1976‚Äì77 season. = Career totals = ‚ÄúI loved to knock guys down,‚Äù Daniels said in ‚ÄúLoose Balls‚Äù (1990). ‚ÄúWhen you went to the boards, you did it with your elbows out. If there was a fight, it wasn‚Äôt just one-on-one, it was 12-on-12. The fine for fighting was $25. That wasn‚Äôt going to stop any fights.‚Äù ‚ÄúMel was the anchor,‚Äù Pacers teammate and best-friend Bob Netolicky said of Daniels. ‚ÄúHad Mel not came to this team, I can guarantee you 100 percent we wouldn‚Äôt be sitting down at (Bankers Life Fieldhouse). Had we not had the success we had, they would‚Äôve folded the team. The thing I hope people understand, they have no idea how important this guy was to the city (of Indianapolis).‚Äù Daniels is the ABA‚Äôs all-time leader with 9,494 rebounds and is second in ABA history with an average of 15.1 rebounds per game. He is fourth in ABA total points, with 11,739, ninth with 628 games, fourth with 22,340 minutes and 10th with 351 ABA blocked shots. Overall, in his ABA/NBA career, Daniels averaged a double-double of 18.4 points and 14.9 rebounds in 639 career games. In 109 playoff games, he averaged 17.4 points and 14.9 rebounds. Coaching and front office career After retiring as a player, Daniels joined the coaching staff of his college coach, Bob King, at Indiana State University. There he coached future Hall of Famer Larry Bird and helped the Sycamores reach the 1979 NCAA Final, where they were defeated by Magic Johnson and Michigan State ending an undefeated season. After his tenure at Indiana State, Daniels joined the Indiana Pacers coaching staff in 1986. After seven seasons an assistant coach, he moved to scouting and eventually the front office and was the team's Director of Player Personnel until October 2009. Daniels had a 0-2 record as interim coach of the Pacers in 1988-89. He replaced Jack Ramsay, who was fired after an 0-7 start. George Irvine and later Dick Versace were the head coaches who followed. Personal Daniels died on October 30, 2015, at the age of 71, from complications after heart surgery. He was survived by his wife, CeCe Daniels, son Mel Daniels Jr., two granddaughters, and two sisters. A lover of horses, Daniels lived on a ranch in Sheridan, Indiana at the time of his death. Daniels was longtime friends with Ira Harge, a teammate at New Mexico and was very close with Bob Netolicky, his Pacers teammate. Daniels appeared in 30 for 30 Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks (documentary, 2010), Magic vs. Bird: The 1979 NCAA Championship Game (TV special, 1979) and Undefeated: The Roger Brown Story (TV Movie, 2013). A poet, Mel Daniels, wrote more than 20,000 poems in his lifetime. His favorite poet was Edgar Allan Poe.

The Rampart Casino is located within the hotel. The property is owned and operated by Hotspur Resorts, which franchises the JW Marriott name from Marriott International. History =Development and opening (1996-2000)= The Resort at Summerlin Pool (aerial) In May 1996, the Howard Hughes Corporation, developer of the Summerlin planned community, announced an agreement for a casino resort to be developed by Seven Circle Resorts, an American affiliate of Swiss gaming firm Swiss Casinos. Paul Steelman was the architect. The resort's opening was originally planned for 1998. Developers envisioned it as a luxury golf and spa resort, similar to those found in destinations like Scottsdale, Arizona and Palm Springs, California. The property would have relationships with several nearby golf courses, including exclusive control of half of the tee times at the neighboring Tournament Players Club at the Canyons. Seven Circle purchased the site from Howard Hughes Corp. in August 1996 for $16.6 million. By February 1998, construction was underway. Managed by J.A. Jones Construction, the project was marked by delays and cost overruns. The final cost of development was $276 million, including $76 million contributed by Swiss Casinos and $200 million borrowed from lenders. The Resort at Summerlin quietly opened its doors on July 15, 1999. Its developers described it as Las Vegas' first off-Strip luxury resort. At opening, the property included a 286-room hotel, two restaurants, and a casino. The hotel was named the Regent Grand Spa, under a franchise from Regent International Hotels. Because of construction delays, other amenities, including the spa, pool, retail shops, and more restaurants, opened over the following months. A second hotel, the 255-room Regent Grand Palm, opened in January 2000. By the next month, the entire property had been renamed as The Regent Las Vegas, to capitalize on its affiliation with the upscale Regent brand, and the two hotels were known simply as the Spa tower and the Palms tower. In June 2000, Swiss Casinos announced plans to purchase a parcel next to the Regent and to develop it with timeshare units and tennis courts, but this project never came to fruition. =After completion (2000-present)= Signs of financial trouble appeared as early as November 1999, when the resort's operating company revealed that it was seeking new financing and its credit rating was downgraded. By March 2000, the resort was in technical default on its mortgage debt, as a result of having borrowed additional money from Swiss Casinos. Executives began to shift the casino's focus to attract more locals, such as by replacing slot machines with video poker machines. In September 2000, the Regent defaulted on various payments to creditors. By November, executives were attempting to renegotiate the property's debt, and 239 of the resort's 1,700 employees had been laid off. The Regent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection later that month, and soon began seeking a buyer for the property. Real estate developer Peccole Nevada was selected as the stalking horse bidder, with an offer of $150 million, but then withdrew its bid after a disagreement with its financing partner. A new bid of $80 million by Los Angeles-based hotel company Maritz, Wolff was then selected, but was also withdrawn after negotiations with the Regent's creditors broke down. Finally, the resort was sold to Hotspur Resorts, the hotel affiliate of Canadian real estate firm Larco Investments, for $80 million. Observers had expected a competitive auction with bids from major casino operators, but most potential buyers lost interest after the September 11 attacks, which occurred two weeks before the auction. Hotspur completed its purchase in November 2001. Hotspur rebranded the hotel under the JW Marriott name, hoping that it would be a better draw than the Regent name, which was found to have good name recognition in Asia but not in America. The casino was leased in 2002 to Nevada-based Millennium Management Group on a 10-year lease. Millennium renamed the casino as the Rampart Casino at the Resort at Summerlin, and continued the effort to shift the casino's marketing emphasis away from high rollers towards locals, and performed major renovations, including redesigning the gaming floor, acquiring new slot equipment, and constructing three new restaurants. When the casino lease expired in 2012, Hotspur opted not to renew the agreement, assuming direct management of the casino, with the help of consulting services from Affinity Gaming. Michael Gaughan, Jr., the son of casino magnate Michael Gaughan, was hired as the property's general manager. Meanwhile, revenues declined because of a slow economy and increased competition from newly opened Strip resorts, leading the property to again default on its mortgage payments. The owners were able to avoid foreclosure, ultimately negotiating a loan modification in December 2013.  Facilities  The hotel has 469 rooms and 79 suites, with rooms starting at . There is a spa and of meeting and event spaces. The casino has of gaming space with 1,560 slot machines, 28 table games, and a race and sports book. Film history In April 2004, scenes were shot at the casino for the fourth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

It is the only member of the genus Gampsonyx. The scientific name commemorates the English naturalist William Swainson. Taxonomy and systematics The type specimen was collected from Brazil by English naturalist William Swainson, and described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825. Vigors noted the similarity to both hawks and falcons, but placed Gampsonyx within the \\"Accipitrine subfamily\\" because it lacks the notched beak of the falcons. He also noted its striking resemblance to the coloration of the falconets. Later, the pearl kite was classified with the falcons. For example, Peters placed it with the forest falcons in subfamily Polyhieracinae. In the mid-20th century it was found to be related to Elanus based on morphology and its molt schedule. Distribution and habitat This tiny kite breeds from Panama, Colombia and Venezuela south to Bolivia and northern Argentina, with an isolated sedentary population in Nicaragua. It is expanding its range and was proved to breed on Trinidad in 1970. It was first reported in Costa Rica in the mid-1990s, and now is fairly common along Pacific slope, to 1000m. Description Frontal view showing yellow forehead. South of Guayaquil, Ecuador The pearl kite is in length and weighs . It is the smallest raptor in the Americas and one of the two smallest accipitrids in the world (besides the little sparrowhawk). The tiny hawk, another neotropical species, attains a slightly higher weight than the pearl kite. The adult has a black crown, upperparts, wing and tail, a rufous edged white collar, yellow forehead and cheeks, mainly white underparts, and yellow legs. Immature birds are similar to the adults but have white and chestnut tips to the back and wing feathers, a buff collar and some buff on the white underparts. In flight this species looks mainly black above and white below. The northern form G. s. leonae differs from the nominate G. s. swainsonii in that it has rufous flanks. Behaviour =Breeding= The nest is a deep cup of sticks built high in a tree. The clutch is 2-4 brown-marked white eggs, incubated mainly by the female for 34‚Äì35 days to hatching, with a further 5 weeks to fledging. There may be two broods in a season. =Feeding= The pearl kite feeds mainly on lizards, especially Anolis, but also takes small birds and insects; it usually sits on a high open perch from which it swoops on its prey. The call is a high musical pip-pip-pip-pip or kitty-kitty-kitty.

The Royal Australian Air Force ordered its first 18 PBY-5s (named Catalina) in 1940, around the same time as French purchase. Some of these would be used to re-establish the British- Australian airlink through Asia as the Double Sunrise. By the end of the war the RAAF had taken delivery of 168 Catalinas. The RAAF used Catalinas in a wide range of roles including reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, offensive mine-laying and air-sea rescue, the deployment of folboats (collapsible canoes), notably the Hoehn MKIII military type for Commando raids.

The Swedish designation was Tp 47. After modifications for their new post-war missions, they were based at Wing F2 at H√§gern√§s near Stockholm and were used mainly for air and sea rescue service. Also reconnaissance missions were flown. The Tp 47 was equipped with PS-19/A radar. The aircraft had a crew of five and had also room for six stretchers. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp 14-cylinder radial engines of 1.200 hp each. It was unarmed. ;Swedish Air Force  The Soviet Union had shown an interest, resulting in an order for three aircraft and the negotiation of a licence to build the type in USSR. When these three machines were delivered they were accompanied by a team of Consolidated engineers who assisted in establishment of the Soviet production facilities. This aircraft model, designated GST, was powered by two Wright R-1820-derived, nine-cylinder Shvetsov M-62 or ASh-62IR single-row radial engines of 900 to 1,000 hp (671 to 746 kW). The first GST entered service towards the end of 1939. It is estimated hundreds more served with the Soviet Navy. Soviet Union also received 138 PBN-1 Nomad variant of the Catalina built by the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia along with 48 PBY-6As under the Lend-Lease Act. ;Soviet Naval Aviation  The British Air Ministry purchased a single aircraft for evaluation purposes, the Model 28-5. This was flown across the Atlantic Ocean to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment, Felixstowe, in July 1939. With the outbreak of war anticipated, the trials were terminated prematurely, and an initial 50 aircraft were ordered under as \\"Catalina I\\"s. These aircraft were similar to the PBY-5, except for installation of British armament. The name Catalina had been used by Consolidated for their commercial sales prior to the British order, and was eventually adopted by the US Navy on October 1, 1941. Initial deliveries of the Royal Air Force's Catalinas began in early 1941 and these entered service with No. 209 and No. 240 squadrons of Coastal Command. In all, nine squadrons of Coastal Command were equipped with the Catalina, as were an additional 12 squadrons overseas. The total acquisition was approximately 700 spread over the following designations: Catalina Mk I, Mk IA (PBY-5A amphibian in RCAF service only), Mk IB, Mk II, Mk III, Mk IVB (Canadian built PBY-5, the PB2B-1), Mk IV, and Mk VI (a PBN-1 style tall tail version built in Canada). The Catalina Mk Vs, which would have been PBN-1s, were cancelled. The RAF also acquired a former Soviet Navy GST which landed in Cyprus in November 1941, although it probably was not used before it was beached in a gale at Aboukir in February 1943. In British service, the Catalina was fitted with .303 machineguns, typically a Vickers K in the bow and Browning Model 1919 in the waist. Some received the Leigh light to aid anti-submarine warfare by night. ;Royal Air Force * No. 119 Squadron RAF (1941 and 1941) * No. 190 Squadron RAF (1943) * No. 191 Squadron RAF (1943-1945) * No. 202 Squadron RAF (1941-1945) * No. 205 Squadron RAF (1941-1945) * No. 209 Squadron RAF (1941-1945) * No. 210 Squadron RAF (1941-1945) * No. 212 Squadron RAF (1942-1945) * No. 240 Squadron RAF (1941-1945) * No. 259 Squadron RAF (1943-1945) * No. 262 Squadron RAF (1942-1943) squadron transferred to South African Air Force as No. 35 Squadron. * No. 265 Squadron RAF (1943-1945) * No. 270 Squadron RAF (1942-1944) * No. 357 Squadron RAF (1944) * No. 628 Squadron RAF (1944) * No. 4 Operational Training Unit RAF (1941-1943) * No. 131 Operational Training Unit RAF (1942-1945) * No. 302 Ferry Training Unit RAF (1942-1945)  ;United States Navy *VP-1 *VP-2 *VP-3 *VP-4 *VP-5 *VP-6 *VP-7 *VP-8 *VP-9 *VP-10 *VP-11 *VP-12 *VP-15 *VP-16 *VP-17 *VP-18 *VP-19 *VP-20 *VP-21 *VP-31 *VP-33 *VP-34 *VP-43 *VP-44 *VP-45 *VP-52 *VP-53 *VP-54 *VP-61 *VP-62 *VP-62 (1943-4) *VP-63 *VP-83 *VP-84 *VP-91 *VP-92 *VP-93 *VP-94 *VP-100 *VP-900 *VP-905 *VP-906 *VP-907 *VP-911 *VP-916 *VP-917 *VP-AM-5 *VB-102 *FltAirPhotoRonLant ;United States Army Air Forces * 1st Emergency Rescue Squadron (OA-10A) * 2d Emergency Rescue Squadron (OA-10A) * 3d Emergency Rescue Squadron (OA-10A) * 4th Emergency Rescue Squadron (OA-10A)  Civilian operators  ;Ansett Flying Boat Services ;Trans Australia Airlines 1 ex-Cathay Pacific/Macau Air Transport Company CBY-5A (acquired from United States Army Air Forces via RCAF) used from 1962-1966 ;Qantas Between 1940 and 1945, five ex-RAF aircraft were used by Qantas for a Ceylon to Perth service.  ;Aero Geral ;Cruzeiro do Sul ;Panair do Brasil ;Paraense Transportes A√©reos ;TABA ‚Äì Transportes A√©reos Bandeirantes ;VASD ‚Äì Via√ß√£o A√©rea Santos Dumont  The following PBY-5A are listed with Transport CanadaCanadian Civil Aircraft Register: Quick Search Result ;Canadian Warplane Heritage ;David Dorosh ;Exploits Valley Air Services ;Fondation Aerovision Quebec ;Pacific Flying Boats ;Savethecanso  ;Satena  ;China Airlines China Airlines was funded by two PBY-5A.

Manton (November 3, 1932 - July 22, 2006) was a Democratic congressman. He represented the 9th and 7th Congressional District of New York. Life and career Thomas J. Manton was born in New York City, and was of Irish descent. He attended private Catholic schools, before entering St. John's University, from which he earned his LL.B. degree. Manton served in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Prior to entering politics, Manton held several jobs. He was a New York City Police Officer from 1955 to 1960, and he then became a marketing executive for IBM. In 1964, Manton began to practice law privately. He joined the law firm of Manton, Sweeney, Gallo, Reich & Bolz in 1999; and practiced law under that name until his retirement. He was elected to the New York City Council in 1970, and served until 1984. Manton ran in the Democratic primary for what was then the 9th District in northern Queens in 1978, following the retirement of 30-year incumbent James J. Delaney. However, he lost to assistant Queens County district attorney Geraldine Ferraro. Manton had also run against Delaney in 1972 and lost. When Ferarro gave up her seat to join Walter Mondale's presidential ticket, Manton jumped into the Democratic primary for the seat. In a hotly contested primary, he defeated Clifford Wilson, Walter Crowley and Gloria D'Amico before narrowly defeating Republican Serphin Maltese in the general election with 52 percent of the vote. He was reelected six more times from this district, only once facing a contest nearly as close as the first one. In 1992, he was held to only 56 percent of the vote‚Äìthe only time after his first run for the seat that he failed to win at least 60 percent of the vote. To date, the 1992 contest is the last time that a Republican has even garnered 30 percent of the vote in the district and its successors. Manton was elected Chairman of the Democratic Organization of Queens County in 1986, succeeding John Sabini who had served as the interim Chairman following the suicide of Donald Manes. Tom Manton was the first major party chairman in the nation to endorse Bill Clinton for President in 1992. As the Co-chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs in the United States Congress he was instrumental in obtaining a visa for Gerry Adams to travel to the United States.As a member of Congress Mr. Manton served as a member of the House Energy Committee and was a subcommittee chairman of the House Government Operations Committee that supervised the Capitol Police. His last vote in the House was to vote against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Retirement and Death Manton quietly retired from the Congress in 1998, having already filed for and circulated petitions for re-election. He withdrew on the last day it was legally possible to do so and arranged for his chosen successor, State Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, to replace him on the ballot. Crowley wasn't aware of this until Manton phoned him to tell him his name would be on the general election ballot. Crowley won the election and held the seat until losing in the 2018 Democratic primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Manton continued to serve as the Party Chairman to the date of his death (Crowley then held that post until 2019). After leaving Congress, he lived in the Queens neighborhoods of Woodside, later moving to Sunnyside, and finally to Astoria. Thomas Manton died on July 22, 2006, following a battle with prostate cancer.Thomas J. Manton, 73, Influential Queens Democrat, Dies The Thomas J.

Vasu, and starring Vishnuvardhan, Ramesh Arvind, Soundarya, Avinash and others. This was actress Soundarya's last film. It is an official remake of the 1993 Malayalam film Manichithrathazhu with a few scenes based on the 1997 Malayalam film Aaram Thampuran. The movie was dubbed in Telugu as Soundharya Chandramukhi. The movie was dubbed in Hindi as Chandramukhi ka Bhool Bhulaiya Mahal. The film ran for one year in the main theaters across Karnataka. Apthamitra was later followed by its sequel, Aptharakshaka (2010). P. Vasu also remade the movie in Tamil in 2005 as Chandramukhi. Plot Ramesh (Ramesh Arvind) and Ganga (Soundarya) are married couple who recently move into Mysore to buy an ancient palace, against the wishes of his uncles and elders (Dwarakish & Pramila Joshai) of the family. His uncle agrees to reside with them with his two daughters Vani and Hema, on one condition that the room on the first floor which is locked and sealed should not be visited by anyone in the family. They have their care-taker Rangajja (Shivaram) who lives in the outhouse with his granddaughter Sowmya (Prema). During their stay in the house they come to know that this palace earlier belonged to Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur. He had a court dancer named Nagavalli from Andhra Pradesh, whom he was in love with. But Nagavalli already loved a fellow dancer named Ramanatha, who used to reside in a house just behind the palace. When the Raja came to know of their affair on an Durgashtami day, he be-headed Dancer Ramanatha and burned Nagavalli alive. Nagavalli vowed at the time of her death that she would seek revenge of her death from the Raja by burning him alive on very same Durgashtami day, as like her. Strange things start to happen in the palace and everyone suspect Sowmya, who is always found at the place of the incident. So, Ramesh calls in his psychiatrist friend Vijay (Vishnuvardhan) to help him clear of the misconceptions regarding the palace and its history. Ramesh's uncle (Satyajit) is not happy with the way Vijay functions and is always very suspectful of him. Vani, Ramesh's cousin is in love with an orphan-dance teacher who incidentally resides in the same house behind the palace. Vijay comes to know of this and tells Ramesh's uncle about this and the alliance is approved by all in the family and their marriage is fixed. When the whole family is out of town to visit Mahadev, to decide his wedding with Vani, Ganga with help from Sowmya opens the room in the first floor with the key given by Sowmya. While she entered the room, Sowmya comes running to tell not to open the door as the key-maker who made the key had died. But Ganga told her not to believe on this superstitions. During this time there are attempts to kill Ramesh by someone unknown, which every time is foiled by Vijay. Even Vani is attacked once by someone unknown. So Ramesh's uncle calls upon an Acharya Ramachandra Shastri (Avinash) to perform some Shanti pooja upon the palace. Though Ramesh is not interested in all these proceedings he agrees on advice of Vijay. On the eve of Engagement ceremony of Mahadev and Vani, Ganga accuses Mahadev of trying to molest her - which is refused by both Mahdev and Vijay. Upon hearing this Ramesh gets angry upon Vijay and shouts at him to get out of his house. Acharya stops the family from doing so and asks Vijay to tell them the mystery behind the strange incidents. Vijay reveals to everyone that Ganga is behind all the strange incidents and she only tried to kill Ramesh and Vani. Ganga who visited the first floor room was enamoured by Nagavalli and her diary. Since Ganga suffered from Multiple personality disorder or Split personality disorder, the mystery behind Nagavalli's story compelled her to assume herself as Nagavalli, compelling the spirit of Nagavalli to enter her body. She (Nagavalli inside Ganga) now intends to kill Vijay as he had posed in front of her as Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur, on the coming Durgashtami day as vowed by Nagavalli while dying. Vijay explains to everyone that since Nagavalli inside Ganga thinks that Mahadev is the dancer Ramnath. Vijay on Durgashtami Day, makes Nagavalli (Ganga) believe that he himself is the king, and employs a sophisticated system to make Nagavalli burn a dummy with his image on it. Nagavalli satisfies herself and leaves Ganga's body. Vijay is also safe. Vijay helps Ganga psychologically later to regain herself. Ramesh thanks Vijay for his help.

It can be considered a rite of passage or a milestone.  Indian babies  = Hindu babies = In Hindu tradition, the hair from birth is associated with undesirable traits from past lives. Thus at the time of the mundan, the child is freshly shaven to signify freedom from the past and moving into the future. It is also said that the shaving of the hair stimulates proper growth of the brain and nerves, and that the sikha, a tuft at the crown of the head, protects the memory.It is believed to wash away bad karma and give the recipient good karma and a better life than their previous life, from Hindu Council UK web page on the mundan ceremony Hindus practice a variety of rituals from birth to death. Collectively these are known as sa·πÉskƒÅras, meaning rites of purification, and are believed to make the body pure and fit for worship. A boy's first haircut, known as choula, is one such samskara and is considered an event of great auspiciousness. The lawbooks or smritis prescribe that a boy must have his haircut in his first or third year. While complete tonsure is common, some Hindus prefer to leave some hair on the head, distinguishing this rite from the inauspicious tonsure that occurs upon the death of a parent. Those that practice complete tonsure generally ritually offer the hair to their family deity. Many travel to temples such as the famed Tirumala Venkateswara Temple of Lord Vishnu to perform this ceremony. = Maliku babies = At the twentieth day from birth, Maliku babies' heads are shaven and the hair is weighed against gold or silver, which is given to the poor. The ceremony is called boabeylun.  Mongolian babies  Mongolian children get their first haircut in early ages between 2-5. Depending on the lunar calendar, boys receive their first hair cut in their odd year and girls in even year. The ritual of cutting the first hair is called Daah' Urgeeh. It is a big occasion for a whole family when guests are invited. Each guest cuts a strand of hair, saying his wishes to the child, and gives a gift.  Orthodox Jews  = Orthodox boys = A rabbi performs the traditional first haircut on a three-year-old boy in Meron on Lag BaOmer 1970. Many Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish boys get their first haircut when they are three years old. The hair-cutting ceremony is known in Yiddish as the upsherenish or upsherin (shear off), and in Hebrew as halaqah (smoothing). In Israel, there are also non-religious families who adhere to this custom and do not cut their sons' hair until the age of three. A mass hair cutting ceremony is held on the holiday of Lag BaOmer at the tomb of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai in the Galilean town of Meron.  Muslim babies  The Aqiqah ceremony involves shaving the child's head seven days after birth and anointing the child‚Äôs head with saffron.The Rights of the New Born Baby in Islam It is traditional to give in charity gold or silver equal in weight to the hair. This does not have to be done by actually weighing the hair; if it is too difficult to do that, it is sufficient to estimate the weight and give paper currency equivalent to the price of that amount of gold or silver.  Slavic culture  = Polish = The ritual first haircut () was a pre- Christian, all-Slavic tradition, though it survived in Poland well into the 18th century. This first haircut traditionally took place between the ages of 7 and 10, and was conducted by either the boy's father or a stranger, who would thus enter into the boy's family. Before that age the boy's life was connected to his mother and he was treated as a child. The ritual haircut, coupled with the granting of an additional given name (usually the third), marked the boy's coming of age and a transition to the world of men, in which he was to be looked after by his father. The ritual also constituted the father's formal act of recognition of the boy as a son. = Ukrainian = Ukrainian babies often have their hair cut on their first birthday as part of the ancient Postryzhennya custom.Postryzhennya ‚Äì The Haircutting there are doubts on the reliability of the source  Polynesian boys  In Cook Islands tradition, the haircutting ceremony is a rite of passage for young boys. At these large gatherings the boy sits on a chair draped with tƒ´vaevae (quilts). As his hair is cut, members of the community plaster the boy with money or other gifts. The custom serves to maintain reciprocal ties within the extended family and community.Cook Islanders ‚Äì Haircutting ceremony, Porirua ‚Äì Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand Traditionally, Niuean boys do not cut their hair, which is lovingly cared for by sisters, mothers and fathers . When the boys become teenagers, a ceremony is held where women tend the hair for the last time before it is cut.

The Apache tribe had a springtime ritual. = African Caribbean boys = Within the African Caribbean community this is performed once the child begins to speak clearly or after the child reaches two. This is usually done in a barbershop or carried out by the parent.  Yazidi boys  In the Yazidi tradition (mainly in Iran), the bisk ceremony involves cutting of a baby boy's two or three first locks, according to old traditions by his 40th day after birth to be given to the family's shaikh and pir, but in modern practice at 7 to 11 months, and kept by the family. The bisk ceremony is regarded as the central initiatory ritual by most Yazidis from Turkey, Armenia. and Syria. In the European Diaspora, the term is often translated as baptism. The ceremony is reminiscent of the Muslim 'aqiqa celebrated on the seventh day after birth, but the Yazidi ceremony takes place at a later stage, when the child has already been named.

The film is based on the 1947 novel The Condemned by Jo Pagano, who also wrote the screenplay. The Pagano novel was based on events that occurred in 1933, when two men were arrested in San Jose, California, for the kidnap and murder of Brooke Hart. The suspects confessed and were subsequently lynched by a mob of locals. The 1936 film Fury, directed by Fritz Lang, was inspired by the same incident. Plot Howard Tyler (Frank Lovejoy) is a family man, living in California, who can't find a job. He meets up with a small-time, but charismatic, hood Jerry Slocum (Lloyd Bridges). Soon, Slocum convinces Tyler to participate in gas station robberies to get by. Later, they kidnap a wealthy man in hopes of getting a huge ransom. Things go wrong when the man is murdered by Slocum then thrown in a lake. Tyler reaches his limit emotionally, and he begins drinking heavily. He meets a lonely woman and confesses the crime while drunk. The woman flees and goes to the police. When the two kidnappers are arrested, a local journalist (Richard Carlson) writes a series of hate-filled articles about the two prisoners which eventually lead to a brutal lynching.

The Soviets had orders to advance through Salla to Kemij√§rvi and Sodankyl√§, and from there to Rovaniemi in just two weeks. From there they were to advance to Tornio and cut Finland in two. The Finnish troops managed to stop the Soviet advance just east of Kemij√§rvi. During the last days of February 1940 the Finnish troops were replaced with the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish volunteers of the Stridsgruppen SFK. Background =Opposing plans= Soviet preparations By 1938 the Soviet Union had decided to conquer Finland. Relying in part on the information provided by Finnish communists, detailed intelligence on Finnish infrastructure had been prepared by the summer of 1939 in a 200-page book that was distributed to the invasion force. The Soviet 9th Army was tasked with invading Finland between Kuhmo and Salla and cutting the country in half by advancing to the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia. As part of the 9th Army's offensive, the 122nd Rifle Division, having arrived from Poland on 8 November 1939, was supposed to capture Salla and Kemij√§rvi and advance to Rovaniemi within two weeks, from where it would continue to Tornio near the Finnish border with Sweden. The Soviets were only expecting light resistance and the troops were ordered not to cross the Swedish frontier. The Soviets began building a railroad from Kandalaksha to the Finnish border in 1939 using 100,000 prisoners as slave labor. In the late 1930s, existing roads were improved and new ones built from the Murmansk Railway to the Finnish border, such as the road from Kandalaksha to Alakurtti. Finnish preparations The improvements in Soviet infrastructure and demographics near the border that made it possible to supply 40,000 troops in the region had little effect on Finnish operational planning in northern Finland. The Finnish general staff did not believe the Soviets would launch a major offensive from the White Sea region to Finland. As a result, work on fortifying key road choke-points in northern Finland only began in the autumn of 1939. The forces in northern Finland were under the command of the staff of the Lapland Group, which in turn was led by the North Finland Group. The Finns had one detached battalion (Er.P 17) and one company (Er.K Kojonen) near Salla that were supposed to conduct an active defense by crossing the border, stopping the advance of the Soviet regiment that was expected in the area and harassing the Soviet lines of communications, thereby tying down Soviet forces. The Finnish general staff considered the force insufficient for even this mission, but could not spare any more troops from the more important Karelian Isthmus. As Finland undertook a general mobilization in October 1939, the troops had time to take stock of the situation and came to the conclusion that even limited offensive operations across the border were beyond their capabilities and afterwards only defensive and delaying operations were practiced in training. A Finnish intelligence estimate on 15 October placed one Soviet division in the Murmansk-Kandalaksha area. The Finns expected a larger Soviet force concentration in the future. On 30 November, the Soviets had four divisions in the area. =Military geography= Southern Lapland is 80% covered by forests or swamps. The geography is dominated by forest-covered fells that surround large swamps and lakes. In December 1939 the lakes and swamps were not yet sufficiently frozen over to support motor vehicle movement but this became irrelevant as the winter progressed and the temperature dropped to -40¬∞, which also made military operations more difficult. Movement outside roads was thus impossible for large military formations. Only one road existed from the Soviet border to Salla. The road network was better developed west of it, with numerous small roads to support lateral movements and the encirclement of defending forces. Order of battle =Finland= There were only a few Finnish troops in the area at the start of the war. The 17th Separate Battalion (Er.P 17) or the \\"Salla Battalion\\" was mobilized before the war. Its main components came from a company of the Frontier Guard. From 11 December 1939 onward the Finnish troops were part of the Lapland Group (Lapin Ryhm√§) which was commanded by Major General Kurt Martti Wallenius. After 5 December infantry, artillery, mortar and anti-tank units were to reinforce the defenders. The total number of Finnish forces in the area was 3,500. =Soviet Union= The Soviets attacked with 122nd Rifle Division. The stalling of the offensive forced the Soviets to reinforce it in late December 1939 with the 88th Rifle Division.  The battle  Initial Soviet advance November 30 ‚Äì December 17 Soviet troops pushed the Finns up to the Kemijoki river, but were unable to break through the Finnish defences on the river. The Soviet supply lines were now 145 kilometers long. The Finns took advantage of the overstretched Soviet position by launching attacks with ski troops on the Soviet lines of communications. One third of Soviet troops were tied up guarding them. On January 13, the Soviet 9th Army ordered the 122nd Division to retreat to the M√§rk√§j√§rvi village. Finnish counter-attacks and Soviet withdrawal. For the next two months the battle was a stalemate, apart from small skirmishes and exchanges of artillery fire. On March 13, the last day of the war, the Soviets initiated a major fire preparation with artillery, aircraft and infantry weapons as part of a planned renewal of offensive operations towards Rovaniemi. The Scandinavian volunteers suffered their most casualty-intensive day of the war, with 10 killed and 30 wounded. Overall, Finnish casualties were 1,100 men, including 650 dead or missing. Scandinavian volunteer casualties were 33 dead, 50 wounded and 130 frostbitten. Soviet losses are estimated at 4,000.

The songs originated in the Southern Appalachian area of the United States in the contiguous areas of Eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, Western North Carolina and Northern Georgia.Cohen, Norm (2000), Long Steel Rail: The Railroad in American Folk Song. Chicago, University of Illinois Press, pp. 491‚Äì496. . Accessed September 30, 2017.\\"In the Pines\\", Second Hand Songs. Accessed September 30, 2017. Versions of the song have been recorded by many artists in numerous genres, but it is most often associated with American bluegrass musician Bill Monroe and American blues musician Lead Belly, both of whom recorded very different versions of the song in the 1940s and 1950s.Five Good Covers: In The Pines (Where Did You Sleep Last Night), Cover Me. Accessed September 30, 2017. A version of the song performed by the Four Pennies reached the UK top-twenty in 1964. A live performance by the American grunge band Nirvana reinterpreted Lead Belly's version and was recorded during their MTV Unplugged performance in 1993.MTV Unplugged in New York (1993), DGC Records. Early history Like numerous other folk songs, \\"In the Pines\\" was passed on from one generation and locale to the next by word of mouth. In 1925, a version of the song was recorded onto phonograph cylinder by a folk collector. This was the first documentation of \\"The Longest Train\\" variant of the song, which includes a verse about \\"The longest train I ever saw\\". This verse probably began as a separate song that later merged into \\"In the Pines\\". Lyrics in some versions about \\"Joe Brown's coal mine\\" and \\"the Georgia line\\" may refer to Joseph E. Brown, a former Governor of Georgia, who famously leased convicts to operate coal mines in the 1870s. While early renditions which mention the head in the \\"driver's wheel\\" make clear that the decapitation was caused by the train, some later versions would omit the reference to the train and reattribute the cause. As music historian Norm Cohen pointed out in his 1981 book, Long Steel Rail: The Railroad in American Folksong, the song came to consist of three frequent elements: a chorus about \\"in the pines\\", a verse about \\"the longest train\\" and a verse about a decapitation, but not all elements are present in all versions. Starting in 1926, commercial recordings of the song were made by various country artists. In her 1970 Ph.D. dissertation, Judith McCulloh found 160 permutations of the song. As well as rearrangement of the three frequent elements, the person who goes into the pines, or who is decapitated, is described as a man, woman, adolescent, husband, wife, or parent, while the pines can be seen as representing sexuality, death, or loneliness. The train is described as killing a loved one, as taking one's beloved away, or as leaving an itinerant worker far from home. The folk version by the Kossoy Sisters asks, \\"Little girl, little girl, where'd you stay last night? Not even your mother knows.\\" The reply to the question, \\"Where did you get that dress/ And those shoes that are so fine?\\" from one version is, \\"From a man in the mines/Who sleeps in the pines.\\" The theme of a woman being caught doing something she should not is thus also common to many variants. One variant, performed in the early twentieth century by the Ellison clan (Ora Ellison, deceased) in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, tells of a young Georgia girl who flees to the pines after being raped. Her rapist, a male soldier, is later beheaded by the train. Some versions of the song also reference the Great Depression, with the \\"black girl\\" being a hobo on the move from the police, who witnesses the murder of her father while train-jumping. She hides from this by sleeping in the pines, in the cold. Influential versions =Bill Monroe= Bill Monroe's 1941 and 1952 recordings, both under the title \\"In the Pines\\", were highly influential on later bluegrass and country versions. Recorded with his Bluegrass Boys and featuring fiddles and yodelling, they represent the \\"longest train\\" variant of the song, and omit any reference to a decapitation. However, as Eric Weisbard writes in a 1994 article in The New York Times, \\"...the enigmatic train is almost as frightening, suggesting an eternal passage: 'I asked my captain for the time of day/He said he throwed his watch away.'\\" =Lead Belly= Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Lead Belly, recorded over half-a-dozen versions between 1944 and 1948, most often under the title, \\"Black Girl\\" or \\"Black Gal\\". His first rendition, for Musicraft Records in New York City in February 1944, is arguably his most familiar. Listed as \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\", this version appears on a number of Lead Belly \\"best-of\\" compilations, such as Absolutely the Best (2000). Another familiar version was recorded for Moses Asch, founder of Folkways Records, in New York City. Listed as \\"Black Girl\\" or \\"In the Pines\\", this version appears on compilations such as Where Did You Sleep Last Night ‚Äì Lead Belly Legacy Vol. 1 (1996), and The Definitive Lead Belly (2008). Lead Belly is often said to be the author of the song, e.g. by Nirvana on their MTV Unplugged album in 1994. However, Lead Belly didn't write the song, but reinterpreted it, as did other musicians before and after him. According to the American folklorist Alan Lomax, Lead Belly learned the song from someone's interpretation of the 1917 version compiled by Cecil Sharp, and by the 1925 phonograph recording. =Cajun versions= \\"In the Pines\\", converted into the Cajun French language and sung under the titles \\"Pine Grove Blues\\" or \\"Ma Negresse\\", became one of the landmark songs of Cajun music. The song is most associated with Nathan Abshire, the Louisiana Cajun accordion player, for whom \\"Pine Grove Blues\\" was his biggest hit. His melody is a hard-driving blues, but the lyrics, when translated to English, are the familiar \\"Hey, my girl, where did you sleep last night?\\" The Cajun French word \\"negresse\\" and the masculine counterpart \\"negre\\" are terms of endearment without regard to race. He recorded it at least three times, from the 1940s onward. Since then, Abshire's version has been covered by a wide variety of Cajun and zydeco musicians, including the Pine Leaf Boys, the Lost Bayou Ramblers, Beau Jocque, and Cedric Watson. =The Four Pennies= The Four Pennies recorded and released the song as \\"Black Girl\\" in October 1964. Their version reached No. 20 in the UK, but was not released by their label in the US. =Mark Lanegan/Nirvana= Nirvana occasionally performed the song during the early 1990s. Singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was introduced to the song by fellow Seattle musician Mark Lanegan, and played guitar on a version on Lanegan's 1990 album, The Winding Sheet. Like Lanegan, Cobain usually screamed its final verse. It is likely that Cobain drew from Lead Belly's 1944 Musicraft version for his interpretation of the song; Lanegan owned an original 78 rpm record of this version, and it is the one that Cobain's version most closely resembles in terms of lyrics, form, and title‚Äîeven repeating Leadbelly's interjection \\"Shiver for me\\" before the instrumental bridge. In a 2009 MTV article, Kurt Loder remembers discussing the song's title with Cobain, with Cobain insisting, \\"But the Leadbelly version is called 'Where Did You Sleep Last Night,'\\" and Loder preferring the \\"In the Pines\\" title used by Bill Monroe (as well as Lead Belly). Cobain earned critical acclaim for his acoustic performance of the song during Nirvana's MTV Unplugged appearance in 1993. Canadian musician Neil Young described Cobain's vocals during the final screamed verse as \\"Unearthly, like a werewolf, unbelievable.\\" This version was originally sanctioned to be released as a b-side to the band's \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" single in 1994, but the single was cancelled following Cobain's death in April 1994. It was posthumously released on the band's MTV Unplugged in New York album in November 1994, and as a promotional single from the album.Nirvana - Where Did You Sleep Last Night Discogs.com. Retrieved March 1, 2014. In 2002 the song featured as a bonus track on Nirvana's \\"best of\\" compilation album Nirvana.

She was born in Dublin, Ireland of Tipperary parentage and appeared in British and Hollywood films between 1947 and 1957. In 2020, she was listed as number 40 on The Irish Times's list of Ireland's greatest film actors. Family Kathleen Ryan was one of the eight children of S√©amus Ryan, a member of Seanad √âireann and his wife Agnes Ryan n√©e Harding who came from Kilfeacle and Solohead respectively in County Tipperary and who were Republican activists during the Irish War of Independence. They opened a shop in Parnell Street, Dublin in the 1920s which was the first of 36 outlets which were known as \\"The Monument Creameries\\". The family lived at Burton Hall, near Leopardstown Racecourse in the Dublin suburb of Foxrock. Her father died in 1933, shortly after he had been elected to Ireland's senate. Her brother was John Ryan, an artist and man of letters in bohemian Dublin of the 1940s and 1950s, who was a friend and benefactor of a number of struggling writers in the post-war era, such as Patrick Kavanagh. He started and edited a short-lived literary magazine entitled Envoy. Among her other siblings were Fr. Vincent (S√©amus) (1930‚Äì2005), a Benedictine priest at Glenstal Abbey, Sister √çde of the Convent of The Sacred Heart, Mount Anville, Dublin, Oonagh (who married the Irish artist Patrick Swift), Cora who married the politician, Se√°n Dunne, T.D. When Kathleen was an undergraduate at University College Dublin, she was introduced to the future Dr. Dermod Devane of Limerick. They were married in the society wedding of 1944 and the couple had three children, but the marriage was annulled in 1958. Ryan's schooling came in convents and universities. Career Ryan acted with the Dublin Abbey Players and at Longford's Gate Theater. She was discovered by Carol Reed, and her film debut was in a leading role in Odd Man Out (1947). Arthur Rank, to whom she was under contract, turned down subsequent offers for her to act in films, but she resumed film work after that contract expired. Her other films included Captain Boycott (1947), and The Sound of Fury (1950). She also appeared in the English-made Christopher Columbus (1949), but censors removed her from the version shown in the United States. Her role involved \\"a romantic interlude in Columbus's life,\\" she said, \\"and that did not meet with approval in America because of prevailing traditions regarding the discoverer of this continent.\\"  Legal trouble  In 1954, Ryan was fined ¬£5 for failing to stop at the scene of an accident. Ryan hit a man, Peter Kelliher, with her car near Tralee, County Kerry. Mr. Kelliher was parked in an Esso petrol station filling his car with water when Ryan erratically swerved into him, knocked him down and drove off without stopping. When the police traced Ryan that evening they found her relaxing in the bath. Mr. Kelliher's leg was amputated as a result of the accident. In a further insult to the victim, the court hearing in which Ryan was fined was adjourned for three months to allow Ryan to finish the filming of Captain Lightfoot (1955).  Painting  Ryan was the subject of one of Louis le Brocquy's most striking portraits, Girl in White, which he painted in 1941 and entered in the RHA exhibition of that year. The portrait (oil on canvas) is in the Ulster Museum collection.  Death  Ryan died in Dublin from a lung ailment aged 63 and was buried with her parents beneath a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, near the Republican Plot in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

Description The saxaul ranges in size from a large shrub to a small tree, 2-8 (rarely 12) m tall. It has a brown trunk 4-10 (up to 25) cm in diameter. The wood is heavy and coarse and the bark is spongy and water-soaked. The branches of the current year are green, older branches are brown, or grey to white. The leaves are reduced to very small cusp-like scales, so that the plant appears nearly leafless. The inflorescences consist of short lateral shoots borne on stems of the previous year. The flowers are bisexual or male, very small, as long as or shorter than the bracteoles. The flowering period is from March to April. In fruit, the perianth segments develop spreading pale brown or white wings. The diameter of the winged fruit is about 8 mm. The seed is 1,5 mm in diameter. The fruiting period is October to November. Distribution and habitat The saxaul is distributed in Middle and Central Asia (Iran, West-Afghanistan, Turcomania, from Aralo-Caspian to Amu Darya, the lowland areas of Central Asia, Mongolia and China (Xinjiang, Gansu).http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/359e520da928436c4e3eb010b2f3f19f It is a psammophyte, and grows in sandy deserts, on sand dunes, and in steppe up to 1600m a.s.l. In Central Asia, it often forms 'saxaul forests', while in Middle Asia it grows usually scattered. It also spreads in the Sandy parts of Saudi Arabia. Already listed as at risk of extinction, the saxaul faced further additional pressure as it was used for fuel to fight the 2008 Central Asia energy crisis. Taxonomy Illustration of Haloxylon ammodendron from 1829 The species was first published in 1829 by Carl Anton von Meyer as Anabasis ammodendron C.A.Meyer. In 1851 Alexander Bunge combined it to genus Haloxylon as Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A.Meyer) Bunge. Synonyms are: Arthrophytum ammodendron (C.A.Meyer) Litw., Arthrophytum haloxylon Litw., Haloxylon pachycladum M.Pop., and Haloxylon aphyllum (Minkw.) Iljin.. A related saxaul species is Haloxylon persicum (or white saxaul). Uses Saxaul is planted on a large scale in the afforestation of arid areas in China. Being highly drought-resistant, it has played an important role in the establishment of shelter belts and the fixation of sand dunes as a counter to desertification.http://www.china.org.cn/environment/2010-11/22/content_21392420_2.htm The thick bark of the saxaul tree stores water. Quantities of the bark may be pressed for drinking water, making saxaul an important source of water in arid regions where it grows. In the Gobi desert, the saxaul is often the only kind of tree found. It used to be, and in some place still is, the only kind of wood that nomads can use for heating and cooking. When the Russian Imperial Navy brought the first steamships into the land-locked Aral Sea, the local Governor-General Vasily Perovsky ordered the commander of Fort Aralsk to collect \\"as large as possible supply\\" of saxaul wood (Anabasis saxaul, in the source) for use by the new steamships on their maiden navigation of 1851. Unfortunately for the Russian Naval budget (but probably quite fortunately for the saxaul itself), saxaul wood turned out to be not particularly suitable for steamships, as the hard and resinous wood was difficult to cut, and knotty and crooked saxaul logs could not be stored space-efficiently in the ships' holds. Therefore, starting from 1852, the Aral Flotilla switched to coal as its main fuel, despite the remarkable costs of shipping it by caravan from Orenburg. The Uzbek government has also planted the trees in the Aral Desert to help prevent the spread of toxic salts left behind when the sea dried up, which have caused numerous health problems for people living on the perimeter of the desert. Ecology Turcmenigena varentzovi (saxaul longhorn beetle, Varentsov's longhorn beetle) is a pest of the black saxaul tree in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Dark cone-like galls are often found on the plants. A parasitic plant, Cistanche deserticola, that grows on the roots of the saxaul is prized in Chinese medicine as the 'ginseng of the desert'.

It is from this koin√© that Riksm√•l and Bokm√•l developed. Bokm√•l is now the most widely used written standard of contemporary Norwegian. History =As a spoken language= During the period when Norway was in a union with Denmark, Norwegian writing died out and Danish became the language of the literate class in Norway. At first Danish was used primarily in writing; later it came to be spoken on formal or official occasions; and by the time Norway's ties with Denmark were severed in 1814, a Dano-Norwegian vernacular often called the \\"cultivated everyday speech\\" had become the mother tongue of parts of the urban elite. This new Dano-Norwegian koin√© could be described as Danish with Norwegian pronunciation, some Norwegian vocabulary, and some minor grammatic differences from Danish. =As a written language= In the late middle ages and early modern age, the Scandinavian languages went through great changes, as they were influenced in particular by Low German. Written Danish language mostly found its modern form in the 17th century, based on the vernacular of the educated classes of Copenhagen. At the time, Copenhagen was the capital of Denmark-Norway, and Danish was used as an official written language in Norway at the time of the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union in 1814. In Norway it was generally referred to as Norwegian, particularly after the dissolution of the Dano-Norwegian union. During the 19th century spoken Dano-Norwegian language gradually came to incorporate more of Norwegian vocabulary and grammar. At the start of the 20th century, written Dano-Norwegian was mostly identical with written Danish, with only minor differences, such as some additional Norwegian vocabulary in Dano-Norwegian. In 1907 and 1917, spelling and grammar reforms brought the written language closer to the spoken koin√© (Dano-Norwegian). Based on the Danish model, the Dano-Norwegian language in Norway was referred to as Rigsm√•l, later spelled Riksm√•l, from the late 19th century, and this name was officially adopted in the early 20th century. In 1929, the name Riksm√•l was officially changed to Bokm√•l after a proposition to use the name dansk-norsk lost with a single vote in the Lagting (a chamber in the Norwegian parliament). In the mid-19th century, a new written language, Landsm√•l, based on selected rural Norwegian dialects, was launched as an alternative to Dano-Norwegian, but it did not replace the existing written language. Landsm√•l, renamed Nynorsk, is currently used by around 12% of the population, mostly in western Norway; it had reached its height in the 1940s. The Norwegian language conflict is an ongoing controversy within Norwegian culture and politics related to these two official versions of the Norwegian language. Modern developments Nowadays, the term Bokm√•l officially refers only to the written language of that name (and possibly to its use in the media, by actors etc.). There are, however, a number of spoken varieties of Norwegian that are close or largely identical to written Bokm√•l, sometimes even in a conservative form similar to historical Dano-Norwegian - notably, the higher sociolect in Oslo and in other cities in Eastern Norway. A socially less distinct variety known as standard √∏stnorsk (Standard East Norwegian) is increasingly becoming the standard spoken language of a growing part of Eastern Norway. Colloquially, the latter form is also called the Oslo dialect, which is misleading since the Oslo dialect predates the Dano-Norwegian koin√©, and though both influenced by and partially replaced by standard √∏stnorsk, it is still in use, and since the koin√© language is not a dialect. Over the years the spoken Dano-Norwegian standard and its successors, on the one hand, and Modern Norwegian dialects on the other hand have influenced each other. Nowadays, no clear dividing line can be drawn between the two. The term Dano- Norwegian is seldom used with reference to contemporary Bokm√•l and its spoken varieties. The nationality of the language has been a hotly debated topic, and its users and proponents have generally not been fond of the implied association with Danish (hence the neutral names Riksm√•l and Bokm√•l, meaning state language and literary language respectively). The debate intensified with the advent of a new Norwegian written language in the 19th century, now known as Nynorsk, which is based on Modern Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish and Dano-Norwegian. Historically, many Nynorsk supporters have held that Nynorsk is the only genuinely Norwegian language, since Riksm√•l/Bokm√•l is a relic of the dual monarchy; therefore, the term Dano- Norwegian applied to Bokm√•l can be used to stigmatize or delegitimize the language. Many Bokm√•l users consider this association to be offensive, and it is therefore mainly confined to the Nynorsk-supporting side of heated discussions.

It is believed to have been invented in 1845.The history of science and technology by Bryan H. Bunch p.355 The system has also been used to close other applications, including the joint between helmet (bonnet) and breastplate (corselet) of standard diving suit helmets, and the locks of diving chambers. In the artillery application, it is a screw set into the breechblock that has a section of thread along its axis removed. The screw is mated with a partially threaded hole at the rear of the weapon's chamber: threadless channels in the breechblock screw line up with the threaded parts of the breech, and vice versa. The screw can thus be smoothly inserted all the way into the gun, after which as little as one-sixth of a turn can engage the two sets of threads securely, sealing the breech. Interrupted screws are occasionally seen in loose gunpowder rifles, as this mechanism was historically one of the few practical ways to achieve a gas-proof seal with a breech-loading firearm that does not employ cartridges. An earlier method was the use of a wedge to block the rear of the gun. The amount of rotation required to achieve full closure depends on the number of unthreaded sectors. The minimum balanced arrangement has two sectors of 90¬∞, and requires 1/4 turn to lock. three sectors of 60¬∞ requires 1/6 turn to lock, and the typical arrangement on a diving helmet, four sectors of 45¬∞, requires 1/8 turn to lock. Sealing was further improved with the de Bange obturator in 1872, and all interrupted screw breeches with this system were generally known as the De Bange type. The major weakness of the original designs was that only half of the circumference of the breechblock could be threaded, hence a fairly long breechblock was still required to achieve a secure lock. Axel Welin solved this problem with his stepped interrupted screw design: the Welin breech block of 1890. This design has threads of the block and breech cut in steps of successively larger radius. For example, this allows a breechblock with four steps to allow four-fifths of the block circumference to be threaded, allowing for a much shorter breechblock while still requiring only one-fifth of a turn to open or close. This is the basic design still in use with bagged charge artillery.

He was also a member of National Health and Soft Heap, and has recorded several solo albums, including Accident (1982), Parrot Fashions (1984), The Caretaker (2001) and Greaves Verlaine (2008). Biography Greaves was born in Prestatyn and grew up in Wrexham in north-east Wales. At the age of 12, he was given a bass guitar by his father, a Welsh dancehall bandleader, and within six months, he was playing in his father's orchestra. He continued playing in the orchestra for four years, during which time its varied musical styles gave Greaves valuable musician and arranger skills. He was educated at Grove Park Grammar School in Wrexham from 1961 to 1968. In 1968, Greaves entered Pembroke College, Cambridge to study English, and at Cambridge he met members of the burgeoning English avant-rock group Henry Cow in 1969. The band had been established the previous year by fellow Cambridge students Fred Frith and Tim Hodgkinson and had undergone numerous personnel changes up to that point. They were looking for a bassist and after several months of persuading, Greaves joined the band in October 1969. After juggling his time with the band and his studies, Greaves completed his Master of Arts degree in 1971. By the end of 1971, Henry Cow settled into a permanent core of Frith, Hodgkinson, Greaves and Chris Cutler. Greaves remained with the band until March 1976, toured Europe extensively with them (with his wife Sarah doing the sound-mix at many of their concertsCutler 2009, vol. 1‚Äì5, p. 21.), and appeared on five of their albums (including two with Slapp Happy). Greaves also contributed several compositions to the band's repertoire, including \\"Half Asleep; Half Awake\\", recorded on their second album, Unrest (1974). In November 1973, Greaves (and other members of Henry Cow) participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for the BBC. Greaves left Henry Cow to work on a project, Kew. Rhone. with Slapp Happy's Peter Blegvad in New York City. Greaves had met and worked with Blegvad during the brief merger of Henry Cow and Slapp Happy between November 1974 and April 1975, their first collaboration, \\"Bad Alchemy\\", appearing on the two bands' joint album Desperate Straights. Kew. Rhone. was a song cycle with all the music composed by Greaves and the lyrics written by Blegvad. In addition to bass guitar, Greaves also played keyboards and sang. The album was released in 1977 and credited to Greaves, Blegvad and Lisa Herman, the lead vocalist. It was well received by critics: AllMusic described it as \\"An unfortunately neglected masterpiece of '70s progressive rock ...\\"; and Robert Wyatt reportedly liked it so much he bought two copies \\"just in case the first got worn out!\\" After Kew. Rhone. Greaves returned to England to work in theatre as a composer, arranger and actor. In early 1978 he joined National Health and remained with them until the band split up in 1980. He toured with the band, appearing on the album Of Queues and Cures, for which he wrote the instrumental tour-de- force \\"Squarer for Maud\\", the later reunion effort DS Al Coda (1982) and the archive release Play Time. During this time (1979‚Äì88) he also performed with a free-improvising group, Soft Heap with Elton Dean from Soft Machine, Pip Pyle from National Health, and maverick guitarist Mark Hewins. In the early 1980s Greaves began a series of solo projects and collaborations. Having secured a deal with independent French-American label Europa Records, he recorded his first solo album, Accident in Paris in 1981‚Äì82. He moved to France permanently in 1984, and formed a touring band with Fran√ßois Ovide (guitar and trombone), Denis van Hecke from Aksak Maboul (cello), Mireille Bauer (formerly of Gong) (stand-up drums and percussion) and Blegvad's brother, Kristoffer Blegvad (backing vocals). This line-up also featured on Greaves's second solo album, Parrot Fashions (1984). During this time he also recorded and/or toured with the Penguin Cafe Orchestra and the Michael Nyman Band. He reunited with Peter Blegvad again on The Lodge project (alongside Kristoffer Blegvad, Jakko Jakszyk and Anton Fier) which produced an album, Smell of a Friend in 1987 (but only ever made a couple of attempts at performing live). For his next album, 1991's La Petite Bouteille de Linge (Little Bottle of Laundry), Greaves retained the services of Ovide on guitar, adding his old mate Pip Pyle on drums and the latter's then-partner, Sophia Domancich on piano. Over the next few years his music took on a more acoustic flavour and Greaves eventually settled on a drum-less line-up comprising Domancich, Ovide (now on acoustic guitar exclusively) and double bass player Paul Rogers. This resulted in the 1995 album Songs, which consisted largely of acoustic arrangements of songs from his previous efforts, going back to Kew.Rhone. Greaves himself only handled lead vocals on one track, \\"The Green Fuse\\" (based on a Dylan Thomas poem), leaving the spotlight to Robert Wyatt, opera singer Susan Belling, Kristoffer Blegvad and French variety singer Caroline Loeb. During the 1990s, Greaves also embarked on one-off collaborations with David Cunningham from The Flying Lizards, on 1991's greaves, cunningham album, and Peter Blegvad on 1995's Unearthed. He also played bass in Blegvad's own trio alongside Chris Cutler on drums, which recorded two studio albums. In the early 2000s Greaves chose to divide his time between two contrasting bands, an electric trio named Roxongs with Fran√ßois Ovide on guitar (later replaced by Patrice Meyer then Jef Morin) and Manu Denizet on drums, heard on 2001's The Caretaker, and an acoustic trio named Jazzsongs, with Sophia Domancich on piano and Vincent Courtois on cello, heard on 2003's The Trouble With Happiness, once again a mixture of old and new songs, but this time with Greaves himself singing all the way through. Originally intended as a follow-up of sorts to the acclaimed Songs, 2004's Chansons saw Greaves team up with lyricist Christophe Glockner and vocalist Elise Caron for a collection of all-new songs with predominantly acoustic instrumentation, including guest spots by Robert Wyatt and Louis Sclavis. During the same period, Greaves appeared as featured vocalist on a number of projects. He contributed lyrics and vocals to two songs on saxophonist Julien Lourau's acclaimed Fire & Forget (2005), to much of Sophia Domancich's Snakes & Ladders (2010) sharing the microphone with Himiko Paganotti and Robert Wyatt, and sang all the vocals on Alain Bl√©sing's Songs From The Beginning project, revisiting 1970s progressive rock classics by King Crimson, Soft Machine, Henry Cow and Hatfield and the North among others, Catherine Delaunay's Sois Patient Car Le Loup (2011), the French clarinettist's settings of texts by Malcolm Lowry, and Post Image's In an English Garden (2012), a special project celebrating the jazz-fusion group's 25th anniversary. Having had two of his songs used by the Daniel Yvinec-led edition of the Orchestre National de Jazz's tribute to Robert Wyatt, Greaves fulfilled a lifelong dream by fronting the ONJ at the legendary Theatre du Chatelet in Paris in January 2011, singing several Billie Holiday songs either solo or alongside Sandra Nkak√©. From the mid-2000s, a significant focus for Greaves was a series of projects centered on French poet Paul Verlaine (1844‚Äì1896), beginning with 2008's, Greaves Verlaine, his own settings of Verlaine poems with a decidedly un-retro aesthetic conceived in cooperation with French multimedia collective Les Recycleurs de Bruits. In addition to his Roxongs bandmates the album featured regular collaborators Jeanne Added (vocals) and Scott Taylor (accordion, trumpet), as well as appearances by Karen Mantler and Dominique Pifar√©ly. Concerts promoting this release saw Greaves accompanied by line-ups ranging from just Taylor on accordion to a full electric septet. A second volume saw the light of day in 2011 but received very little media attention due to nonexistent promotion. Instead, Greaves embarked on yet another Verlaine project, this time composing to an original libretto by Emmanuel Tugny. \\"Verlaine, Les Airs\\" saw Greaves team up with a trio of French vocalists, Elise Caron, Jeanne Added and Thomas de Pourquery. The work was premiered in December 2012 at Le Triton following a residency at the venue, has since been performed at the Orl√©ans Jazz Festival and at Les Sables-d'Olonnes, and a studio album was released in April 2015 on Bruno Letort's Signature label. In 2018, he released Life Size with guests including Zeena Parkins, Jakko Jakszyk, and Annie Barbazza.John Greaves, Life Size, 2018, liner notes Private life John Greaves presently lives in Paris with artist Laura Buxton and their two daughters, Ailsa Grace and Millie.

It was directed by Daniel Mann and produced by Kurt Unger from a screenplay by John Michael Hayes, based on the story by Lawrence Durrell. The music score was by Sol Kaplan and the cinematography by John Wilcox. The film stars Sophia Loren, Peter Finch and Jack Hawkins. Plot Loren in a publicity photo for the movie In Palestine shortly before the end of the British mandate, the Haganah has learned that a former German tank commander, General Gustav Schiller, is teaching the Arabs battle tactics, but they are unable to locate him. Then they learn of the existence of his Jewish former wife, Judith Auerbach Schiller, and arrange for her to be smuggled into Palestine via the port of Haifa. She is placed in the care of Aaron Stein, a Haganah commander, at a kibbutz. Schiller had abandoned his wife during the war and took away their son. Judith was then sent to the Dachau concentration camp, where she was forced to serve in an officers' brothel, but survived. Judith dislikes the rigours of kibbutz life, and is unable the kibbutz leaders anything about Schiller, but Stein hopes that she can at least identify him. He \\"suggests\\" that she ask the local army commander, Major Lawton, to help her. Judith travels to Haifa to see him and pleads with him to hand over the file on Schiller, which he eventually does. It turns out that Schiller was last known to be in Damascus, Syria. Judith, Stein and a colleague are smuggled into Damascus, and after days of searching, they find Schiller. As they are about to capture him, Judith shoots and wounds him. Schiller is smuggled back to Palestine and interrogated, but he refuses to give any information. Left alone with Judith, he pleads for mercy. But as the kibbutz comes under attack by Arab forces, he finally reveals the battle plans, and also tells Judith that he knows the whereabouts of their son, Karl. The room in which he is being kept is bombed and Schiller is killed. Aaron promises that he will help Judith find her son.

Release The film premiered on January 20, 1966 at Radio City Music Hall. =Reception= New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther, wrote that the film \\"... comes out as a disappointing picture, more lurid and loud than lustrous,\\" and that the film is more fiction than an illusion. However, he praised Loren's acting: \\"She is lending her name and her presence to a routine cloak-and-dagger film that, without her, would get no more attention‚Äîand would deserve no more‚Äîthan a quickie on the lower half of a double bill.\\" The film has a 20% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on five reviews.

As of the 2012 census it had a population of 224,987, up from 154,262 in the 2002 census. The people who live in the region are principally from the Shona tribe. Politics Goromonzi lies in Mashonaland East, and is represented in the national Parliament by the single seat of Goromonzi in the Senate and by three seats (Goromonzi North, Goromonzi South, and Goromonzi West) in the House of Assembly. Economy Until 1999 the economy of the area was flourishing and many of the local residents of Goromonzi were employed, and had jobs on commercial farms that were growing flowers and gourmet vegetables in greenhouses for export to Europe. These commercial farms are no longer operational due to the Zimbabwean government's land reform programme which evicted and drove white born Zimbabweans out of their homes and off commercial farms. Local unemployment is now standing at 80% or more. Traditional families now base their livelihoods on subsistence farming methods growing corn, pumpkins and other crops that are dependent on rainfall. At the current rate of inflation the cost of fertilizers and seeds are prohibitive for them and there is limited access to market today. Food Food is the most critical concern of the people of Goromonzi. Unemployment, lack of transportation, the fact that there are few adults between the ages of 25 and 60, and a lack of farming knowledge passed from parents to children have all contributed to the difficulty in obtaining and producing food. Many children and adults are malnourished due to the scarcity of food in the region. Most have only one meal per day. Much need to be done to ensure food security in the area. Medicine Three medical clinics are available for the community. Resources are strained to serve such a wide area; and some people have to walk or more to get care. Although malaria is not a serious problem due to Goromonzi‚Äôs altitude, schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is widespread and goes untreated along with a multitude of parasitic infections and other easily treated illnesses. Water is obtained by digging wells, although the influence of development is seeping into the community thus providing tapped water to a rapidly expanding community. New houses are springing up as a township is now being built to cater for middle-class citizens who have tired of the city life. There are two types of well; hand drawn and electrically operated. When a well fails, there are not always the financial resources to dig a new one. Electric pumps are subject to lightning strikes and mechanical problems. Goromonzi is on the electric grid but individual homes are not connected, and it is too expensive for most families. Transportation The roads in Goromonzi are dirt or strip roads (strip roads are dirt roads with a narrow strip of tar for each wheel) and are in poor condition. There is little traffic, as few people have the resources to own or operate a truck. Public transport is by commuter taxi. There are a few oxcarts. Walking is the standard, and it is not unusual for children to walk 3 or to school, or for hungry family members to walk the same distance for food. Education There are ten schools in the Goromonzi area: five primary and five secondary schools that serve 6729 students, ages 5 to 22. There are 50 or more students in each class with one teacher. Textbooks, workbooks and other learning materials are noticeably absent. The school libraries are sparse. The cost of school fees, uniforms and textbooks are out of reach for many families, so it is unusual for a child to attend school without interruption or to complete all of his or her schooling. sporting activities include soccer, netball, javelin and rugby among others.

Their debut single, \\"You'll See\\", appeared on the Illustrious Artists label that same year. They followed with a four-track debut extended play, I Dealt a Rollercoaster, in 2002. Fist2Face's reviewer describes their work as the \\"sound of the modern world colliding with blood, sweat and wood to create timeless, melodic rock music. High on total energy yet grounded by killer hooks and playing\\". Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald noted their style \\"alternated between impassioned Neil Young workouts and Who-like eruptions\\". In January 2004 Lane was nominated as Best Lead Guitarist at the inaugural Jack Awards. In October that year Nic Cester of Jet organised a charity project, The Wrights, to raise money for Australian musician, Stevie Wright. The supergroup recorded a cover version of Wright's signature song, \\"Evie\\", which was an 11-minute hit single from 1974. Lane provided rhythm guitar for Part 1 of \\"Evie\\", titled \\"Let Your Hair Hang Down\\" and lead guitar for Part 3, \\"I'm Losing You\\". On 29 January 2005 Lane performed \\"Evie\\" with The Wrights at Waveaid in relief of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, presented at the Sydney Cricket Ground. \\"Evie\\" by The Wrights was issued in February 2005, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Since 2005 Lane has periodically played in Jimmy Barnes' backing band for touring and live recording. In June 2005 The Pictures' debut album, Pieces of Eight, appeared. Mathieson felt that its \\"best moments, such as the melancholic 'All My Ties' and opener 'Stupid Me', forsake the usual bravado of first albums for a more reflective tone\\". In 2007 he joined Crowded House for their tour in Europe and Australia, temporarily replacing Liam Finn on miscellaneous guitar, keyboard and backup vocal duties. Late in 2008 Lane's groups each released an album: both You Am I's Dilettantes (September) and The Pictures' Kicking Indifference (November). On 6 September 2013, Lane issued his debut solo extended play, The Good Borne of Bad Tymes, which was supported by a national tour in September and October. The Heralds Jade Lazarevic described its \\"five tracks are a departure from Lane‚Äôs retro rock roots, with synths influenced by '70s groups such as the Gary Numan-fronted Tubeway Army and German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk working their way into the sound and even a 'space rock jam' track\\". Joined The Stems in November 2017 and toured Europe April/May 2018 for the 30th anniversary of The Stems debt album \\"At First Sight Violets Are Blue\\". In 2018 he formed a group to back the legendary Todd Rundgren for an Australian tour. According to Lane, they have also collaborated in the studio on upcoming releases. Since 2016 he has also performed periodically as touring guitarist for Robyn Hitchcock.

It is named after the Russian term for the Dnieper river islet of today's Seredny Stih, Ukraine, where it was first located. Distribution The Sredny Stog culture was situated across the Dnieper river on both its shores, with sporadic settlements to the west and east.J. P. Mallory, In the search of Indo-Europeans, 1989 p. 198, Distribution of the Sredny Stog and Novodanilovka sites The Sredny Stog culture seems to have had contact with the agricultural Cucuteni-Trypillian culture in the west and was a contemporary of the Khvalynsk culture, to the north-east. Sites One of the best known sites associated with this culture is Dereivka, located on the right bank of the Omelnik, a tributary of the Dnieper, and is the most impressive site within the Sredny Stog culture complex, being about 2,000 square meters in area. Characteristics The Sredny Stog culture is known for initiating the domestication of horses. The Sredny Stog people lived rather mobile lives. This was seen in their temporary settlements, particularly their dwellings, which were simple rectilinear structures. The expert Dmytro Telegin has divided the chronology of Sredny Stog into two distinct phases. Phase II (ca. 4000‚Äì3500 BC) used corded ware pottery which may have originated there, and stone battle-axes of the type later associated with expanding Indo-European cultures to the West. Most notably, it has perhaps the earliest evidence of horse domestication (in phase II), with finds suggestive of cheek-pieces (psalia). Evidence revealed that around 6,000ya, the culture has domesticated the wild Przewalski's horse. However, there is no conclusive proof that those horses were used for riding since they were mainly employed for gathering food. Burials In its three largest cemeteries, Alexandria (39 individuals), Igren (17) and Dereivka (14), evidence of inhumation in flat graves (ground level pits) has been found.The Journal of Indo-European studies, Vol 18, p. 18 This parallels the practise of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, and is in contrast with the later Yamna culture, which practiced tumuli burials, according to the Kurgan hypothesis. In Sredny Stog culture, the deceased were laid to rest on their backs with the legs flexed. The use of ochre in the burial was practiced, as with the kurgan cultures. For this and other reasons, Yuri Rassamakin suggests that the Sredny Stog culture should be considered as an areal term, with at least four distinct cultural elements co- existing inside the same geographical area. Language In the context of the modified Kurgan hypothesis of Marija Gimbutas, this pre-kurgan archaeological culture could represent the Urheimat (homeland) of the Proto-Indo-European language. Physical type Examination of physical remains of the Sredny Stog people has determined that they were Europoid. A similar physical type prevails among the Yamnaya, who were tall and powerfully built. People of the neighboring Khvalynsk culture were less powerfully built. People of the preceding Dnieper-Donets culture were even more powerfully built than the Sredny Stog and Yamnaya. Genetics A genetic study published in Nature in February 2018 included an analysis of a male buried at Alexandria, Ukraine ca. 4000 BC. This site is ascribed to the Sredny Stog culture. He was found to be carrying the paternal haplogroup R1a1a1 (R1a-Z93, and the maternal haplogroup H2a1a. He carried about 80% Western Steppe Herder (WSH) ancestry and about 20% Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry. The Sredny Stog male is the first steppe individual found to have been carrying EEF ancestry. As a carrier of the 13910 allele, he is the earliest individual ever examined who has had a genetic adaptation to lactase persistence. He is the earliest known individual known to have carried the paternal haplogroup R1a-Z93, which is later found in the Sintashta culture and subsequent Indo-Iranians. The WSH genetic cluster was a result of mixing between Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs) from Eastern Europe and Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers (CHGs) from the Caucasus. This mixing appears to have happened on the eastern Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe starting around 5,000 BC. The WSH ancestry found in the Sredny Stog culture is similar to that of the Khvalynsk culture, among whom there was no EEF admixture. Males of the Khvalynsk culture carried primarily the paternal haplogroup R1b, although a few samples of R1a, I2a2, Q1a and J have been detected. Succeeding Yamnaya males however, have been found to have carried only R1b and I2. This is similar to the males of the Dnieper-Donets culture, who carried R and I only and were exclusively EHGs with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) admixture. The results suggest that the Yamnaya emerged through mixing between EHG and WHG males, and EEF and CHG females. This implies that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG paternal origin. On this basis, David W. Anthony argues that the Indo-European languages were originally spoken by EHGs. Successors The culture ended at around 3500 BC, when the Yamna culture expanded westward replacing Sredny Stog, and coming into direct contact with the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture in the western Ukraine.

During various periods of urban renewal, starting in the 1960s, portions of Chinatown were razed for the construction of the Vine Street Expressway and the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation was formed in 1968. This gave community and business leaders more say in matters of local development.\\"History .\\" Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation. Retrieved on January 21, 2009. In the late 1990s, the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team was hoping to build a new ballpark in downtown Philadelphia to replace the aging Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia. Several locations were considered, including 12th and Vine Streets, just north of the Vine Street Expressway. The Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation mounted an intense opposition to the ballpark plans. Residents were concerned that the ballpark would destroy Chinatown. The PCDC staged protests and rallies that united neighborhood groups, religious, labor, ethnic, and political groups. Eventually the Phillies built Citizens Bank Park at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, which opened in 2004. In years leading up to 1998, businesses catering to other immigrants from East and Southeast Asian countries, like Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam, opened in Chinatown. Eastern Tower construction In 2012, a plan to build the Eastern Tower Community Center (renamed \\"Crane Chinatown\\" since Nov 2018) was approved by the city council. Construction of this prominent community center began in August 2017. The official opening and dedication ceremony was held on November 8, 2019.

Location of the birthplace of Chinatown Developments in the 20th century formed the current boundaries of the Philadelphia Chinatown. In the 1920s, ramps leading to the Ben Franklin Bridge were constructed at Chinatown's northern edge. At another point, the city condemned an area east of what is now Chinatown so that the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department, Independence Mall, and a hospital could be constructed. At one point the city proposed building an eight lane highway that would divide the Philadelphia Chinatown into two parts and eliminate the Holy Redeemer Church and School. The church and school remained, while the Vine Street Expressway, smaller than its original proposed size, was built. Cecelia Yep, one of the founders of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Coalition, said \\"I think we saw it as a plan to get rid of Chinatown. [The church and school] was the only thing good in Chinatown at the time. We thought it was a fight for survival.\\" The construction of the Market East Station in the 1970s and 1980s established Filbert Street as Chinatown's southern border. As a result of the construction of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, which opened in 1993, the Chinatown buildings on Arch Street, up to the intersection of 13th Street, were demolished. In addition, a federal prison, the Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia, opened in the area. AsianWeek said \\"Each was built with much compromising, and now they form a circle around Chinatown‚Äôs current core of about five city blocks.\\" By 1998, community leaders had taken a property bounded by 8th Street, 9th Street, Callowhill, and Vine in order to establish a US$7 million townhome complex called Hing Wah Yuen (, \\"Prosperous Chinese Garden\\").

Of the residents, 1,085 were Asian American, 152 were White American, 71 were African American, 31 were of other races, and 23 were Hispanic American. During that year the community had 509 housing units, with 50 of them being vacant and 85 of them being owner occupied.\\"Demographic Profile.\\" Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation.

In 1998 Chinese students were 25% of McCall's 650 person student body. By September 1998 the school, which had 650 students, established a bilingual English-Chinese program to serve Chinese immigrant students, and that month it began hiring teachers fluent in both languages to teach core subjects. As of 1998 there were no public schools within Chinatown itself. In 2005 the Philadelphia School Reform Commission approved the creation of the charter school FACTS in Chinatown. At the time the Chinatown Community Development Corporation opposed the creation of the charter school, saying that it was not necessary and that it would hurt enrollment figures at McCall and Holy Redeemer. Private schools Holy Redeemer Chinese Catholic Church and School The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operates Catholic schools. The Holy Redeemer Chinese Catholic Church and School () was constructed in 1941. David J. Wallace of The New York Times said that it was \\"a leading Chinatown institution.\\" Historically many Chinatown residents enrolled their children in the school, and the community used the church and school complex as a meeting place and a community center. In the 1990s the school lost much of its schoolyard due to expansion of the Vine Street Expressway. In 2005 it was the only school in Chinatown. =Colleges and libraries= Independence Branch Library in Society Hill The nearest branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia is the Independence Branch () in Society Hill, about four blocks from Chinatown.\\"Independence Branch.\\" Free Library of Philadelphia.

This reaction type is abundant in organic reactions. Two pioneering studies into free radical reactions have been the discovery of the triphenylmethyl radical by Moses Gomberg (1900) and the lead-mirror experiment √úber die Darstellung von freiem Methyl Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series) Volume 62, Issue 5 , Pages 1335‚Äì47 Fritz Paneth, Wilhelm Hofeditz described by Friedrich Paneth in 1927. In this last experiment tetramethyllead is decomposed at elevated temperatures to methyl radicals and elemental lead in a quartz tube. The gaseous methyl radicals are moved to another part of the chamber in a carrier gas where they react with lead in a mirror film which slowly disappears. When radical reactions are part of organic synthesis the radicals are often generated from radical initiators such as peroxides or azobis compounds. Many radical reactions are chain reactions with a chain initiation step, a chain propagation step and a chain termination step. Reaction inhibitors slow down a radical reaction and radical disproportionation is a competing reaction. Radical reactions occur frequently in the gas phase, are often initiated by light, are rarely acid or base catalyzed and are not dependent on polarity of the reaction medium.Free Radical Reaction ‚Äì from Eric Weisstein's World of Chemistry Reactions are also similar whether in the gas phase or solution phase.  Kinetics  The chemical kinetics of a radical reaction depend on all these individual reactions. In steady state the concentrations of initiating (I.) and terminating species T. are negligent and rate of initiation and rate of termination are equal. The overall reaction rate can be written as:Advanced Organic Chemistry F.A. Carey R.J. Sundberg :\\\\ \\\\text{rate} = k_{\\\\text{obs}}[I]^{3/2} \\\\, with a broken-order dependence of 1.5 with respect to the initiating species. The reactivity of different compounds toward a certain radical is measured in so-called competition experiments. Compounds bearing carbon‚Äìhydrogen bonds react with radicals in the order primary < secondary < tertiary < benzyl < allyl reflecting the order in C‚ÄìH bond dissociation energy Many stabilizing effects can be explained as resonance effects, an effect specific to radicals is the captodative effect.  Reactions  The most important reaction types involving free radicals are: * Free-radical substitution, for instance free-radical halogenation and autoxidation. * Free-radical addition reactions * Intramolecular free radical reactions (substitution or addition) such as the Hofmann‚ÄìL√∂ffler reaction or the Barton reaction * Free radical rearrangement reactions are rare compared to rearrangements involving carbocations and restricted to aryl migrations. * Fragmentation reactions or homolysis, for instance the Norrish reaction, the Hunsdiecker reaction and certain decarboxylations. For fragmentations taking place in mass spectrometry see mass spectrum analysis. * Electron transfer. An example is the decomposition of certain peresters by Cu(I) which is a one- electron reduction reaction forming Cu(II), an alkoxy oxygen radical and a carboxylate. Another example is Kolbe electrolysis. * Radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution is a special case of nucleophilic aromatic substitution. * Carbon‚Äìcarbon coupling reactions, for example manganese-mediated coupling reactions. * Elimination reactions Free radicals can be formed by photochemical reaction and thermal fission reaction or by oxidation reduction reaction Specific reactions involving free radicals are combustion, pyrolysis and crackingRobert T.

It typically stood in a main clause and had a subjunctive or imperative meaning; for example, it could indicate intention, e.g. √≠ndrasya n√∫ vƒ´ryƒÅÃÄ·πái pr√° vocam \\"Indra's heroic deeds will/shall I now declaim\\" (Beekes, Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction. 1995, p.245). It was obligatory for use in prohibitions, where it follows mƒÅÃÅ. In later Classical Sanskrit, only the use after mƒÅ remained (there are no accents in Classical Sanskrit). Ancient Greek has words that are formally similar to the Sanskrit injunctive mood, consisting of aorist and imperfect forms lacking the augment. However, in this case there is no difference in meaning between these forms and the normal augmented forms. These are normally used in Homer and other epic poetry (see Homeric Greek). It is generally assumed that the augment was originally a separate particle meaning something like \\"then\\", added to indicate the past time of a form that was once mostly aspectual, and neutral with respect to tense. Originally, its use appears to have been optional, added as necessary to clear up an otherwise ambiguous expression, similarly to time adverbs in Chinese. Gradually, it fused onto the verb form and became mandatory, but in the early stages of Greek and Sanskrit this change was not yet complete, and hence augmentless forms existed side-by-side with augmented forms. The modal semantics of the augmentless forms may then be a later development within Indo-Iranian or Indo-Aryan. It's also possible that the modal semantics developed in the parent language and later developments in Pre-Greek removed them and put back the basic meaning of the aorist and imperative, by analogy.

Mutual Reception Two planets are in mutual reception when they are in each other's signs (for example Mercury is in Aries and Mars is in Gemini). If the condition of each planet in mutual reception is strong, they will strengthen and provide assistance to one another. Some modern astrologers believe they will also take on some of each other's attributes. Whenever planets are in mutual reception, they provide the native with additional forces to overcome difficulties that present themselves during transits affecting their signs and houses. Ancient astrologers called this condition \\"exchange of signs,\\" and it was but one example of various forms of astrological reception, that is, assistance provided by one planet for another one which falls in signs where the first planet has dignity. However, there are conditions where this helpful relationship is much weakened: * If one of the planets is in a sign of its detriment or fall, it is not likely to have the resources to be of much assistance to the planet it rules; * If the condition of one or both of the planets is otherwise impaired‚Äîsuch as by being placed in a sign that does not aspect the Ascendant sign (for example, the twelfth house), or retrograde, or combust or under the beams (that is, within fifteen degrees of the Sun), it will similarly be of less use to the planet it receives, in proportion to how poorly it is positioned; * If the two planets are not in astrological aspect to one other (that is, the signs in which they are placed are not in sextile, trine, square or opposition angles to one another, the condition of mutual reception will be much less forceful, since there is no connection between the two planets in which this mutuality can be effected. Furthermore, if the aspect between the two signs is one of opposition, the planets will both be opposite their signs of rulership, which is the definition of being in detriment, and hence both will be too weak to be of much help to the other. For example, in a chart where Mercury is in Capricorn and Saturn is in Virgo, a strong mutual reception is in effect. Mercury is located in Capricorn, Saturn's domicile, or rulership, and Saturn is found in Mercury's sign of rulership and of exaltation, Virgo. The two signs are in trine to one another, and hence have a strong working relationship. In this instance, the individual with these placements would be likely to demonstrate a powerful, logical mind, with excellent ability to reason and strong habits of organization, as well as the likelihood of being a very hard-working, focused thinker. The relationship brings out the best attributes of Saturn's powers of organization and dedication and Mercury's facility of mind. Furthermore, transits affecting Mercury adversely would be mitigated by Saturn's strengths, and Saturn might be able to come to Mercury's rescue. Mercury might have the same function in the case of an adverse transit to Saturn. If an individual has the Sun posited in Aquarius and Saturn located in Leo, both the Sun and Saturn are in mutual reception, since the Sun's own house is in Leo, where Saturn is located, and Saturn governs the sign of Aquarius, where the Sun is positioned. However, in this example, since the signs of Leo and Aquarius are opposed to one another in aspect, the mutual reception may be of little value. Located opposite their own houses, in the signs of their detriment, both planets have little dignity, and without other very strong placement factors to compensate for this, the mutuality is probably not a factor in the individual's life Similarly, with Venus in Virgo and Mercury in Libra, there is inherently a weakness in the mutuality of the relationship. Venus in Virgo is in fall, and can provide little support for Mercury, although Mercury, if otherwise powerful and well-positioned (for example in the first house or tenth house), may be helpful to Venus. But the relationship is further impaired by the fact that the signs Virgo and Libra are in aversion to one another‚Äîthat is, they are not in aspect‚Äîand hence there is no easy way for these two planets to work together. Mutual reception is not limited to exchange of the signs of dignity of rulership. Ancient and medieval astrologers gave equal force to mutuality obtained by planets being in each other's signs of exaltation‚Äîfor example, Jupiter in Taurus in a chart where the Moon is in Cancer. Jupiter is exalted in the sign of Cancer; Moon is exalted in the sign of Taurus. This is a very powerful mutual reception, not only because Taurus and Cancer are in a sextile aspect to one another, but also because the Moon is also in its own house in Cancer. This placement would tend to give a notably generous and probably religious individual, with a good deal of luck and talent. Ancient and medieval astrologers also considered mutual reception by triplicity rulerships, and by terms or bounds rulerships. Even mutual reception by face was considered, although, unlike the other four dignities, of very little overall impact. Furthermore, \\"mixed\\" mutual reception is also taken into account‚Äîfor example, when one planet is in the sign of another planet's exaltation, and the second planet is at the same time in the sign of the first planet's rulership. The mutual reception between Neptune and Uranus will become exact on the following dates: June 10, 2009 26 degrees 26 minutes October 5, 2009 23 degrees 57 minutes April 13, 2010 28 degrees 4 minutes See also * Astrological reception Footnotes # However, for Hellenistic astrologers, the signs Virgo and Libra do have a connection of sorts to one another; they are contra-antiscia‚Äîthat is, they are equally distant to the Aries/Libra equinoctial axis. What this means, practically, is that they have the same ascensional times. The ancients sometimes called signs that are thus positioned \\"like-ascending,\\" and considered that there was a working relationship between them‚Äîperhaps not as strong a relationship, however, as signs more directly related, such as by trine, square or sextile aspect. A similar connection would pertain when signs share the same ruling planet, or if they were in antiscia to one another‚Äîthat is, if two signs are the same distance from the solsticial Cancer/Capricorn axis. In this case, planets were considered to have similar relationships to the houses of the Sun and Moon. This connection did not pertain in mutual reception, however, for Medieval astrologers.

He has governed the Makkah region twice, from 2007 to 2013 and again since 2015. He was Minister of Education from 2013 to 2015. He was also the Governor of Asir Province from 1971 to 2007. He is a member of the House of Saud. He served as the Adviser to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, his half-uncle. Early life and education Prince Khalid was born in Makkah on 24 February 1940. He is the third son of King Faisal. His mother is Haya bint Turki bin Abdulaziz Al Turki, a member of Al Turki clan. In 1948, Prince Khalid attended Model School in Taif to receive secondary education. Like King Faisal's other children, Prince Khalid was educated abroad after completing secondary education in Saudi Arabia. He attended the Hun School of Princeton in New Jersey and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in political economy from the University of Oxford in 1966. Political career After returning to Saudi Arabia, Prince Khalid served as director general of the Presidency of Youth Welfare in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in 1967. His term lasted until April 1971 when he was appointed as Governor of Asir Province. Khalid al Faisal was Governor of Asir Province in southwestern Saudi Arabia from 1971 to 2007. He was credited with bringing the province a measure of modernity and prosperity. At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, he sought to use its natural beauty and cool climate to attract Arab tourists. But many inhabitants were resentful that the oil-based welfare state has not provided for them. As governor, he held majlis, open-house meeting with citizens, twice a day. The region also had its first telephone line under his governorship. According to a leaked WikiLeaks cable, Prince Khalid went to extraordinary lengths to renovate his late father's palace to host a party for Prince Charles, during his 2006 visit. The cable revealed that at the time, Khalid had been living in the Old Palace which was in dire need of renovation. He directed a Western business associate to renovate the palace in three weeks and rewarded the businessman with $13,000 when Prince Charles was impressed. Khalid has since built a new palace while the Old Palace has been converted into a university. On 16 May 2007, Khalid was appointed Governor of Makkah Province by King Abdullah, replacing Prince Abdul Majeed bin Abdulaziz, who died in office. The province includes the Muslim holy city of Makkah and the second largest city in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah. In 2010, he ordered hotels, restaurants, shops and wedding halls in the province to drop all their non-Arabic names and use Arabic only for signboards. As governor, he played a major role in managing the annual Hajj in Makkah. According to leaked diplomatic cables, he visited Beirut in 2009 to meet with Lebanese parliamentarians. In June 2011, Prince Khalid presided at the opening of the Rabigh's expansion of its desalination plant.Michael Palmer. (2 June 2011). Rabigh desal plant Phase 2 expansion complete Utilities.

Other roles Prince Khalid is managing director of the King Faisal Foundation a large philanthropic and charitable organisation. The Foundation runs Alfaisal University in Riyadh, where Prince Khalid is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and also runs Effat University in Jeddah where Prince Khalid is a member of the board of trustees. He is the founder and current president of the organisation Painting and Patronage. In addition, he is a member of Allegiance Council. Prince Khalid is also the president of the Arab Thought Foundation. In 2009, Prince Khalid headed a Saudi delegation to Beirut that met the Lebanese parliamentarians. Influence Prince Khalid is believed to be respected in the family, appreciated for his combination of both modern and traditional sensibilities. He has been mentioned as a future king when succession in the Al Saud passes on to the grandsons of King Abdulaziz. He was also considered to be among the possible contenders after Prince Nayef's death in June 2012. However, the sons of King Faisal, Turki bin Faisal and late Saud bin Faisal, are said to be regarded unfavourably within the royal family due to their perceived air of intellectual superiority. On the other hand, Prince Khalid may have advantages over brothers as a result of his long-term tenure as governor in that he is well known to the public. Views and alliances Khalid Al Faisal criticized negative coverage of Saudi Arabia by the Western media. He spoke out against misconceptions that characterize Saudi society as backwards and uneducated. During his tenure in Asir province, he was close to then Crown Prince Abdullah. Personal interests Prince Khalid is an avid painter, poet and patron of the arts. In 1999, he founded Painting and Patronage to \\"build and foster valuable bridges of cultural, artistic and educational understanding between the Arab world and the international community\\". While he was Governor of Asir, Khalid founded the Literary Club of Abha, the Abha Singing Festival, the Abha Prize for cultural excellence, and the Al-Miftaha Visual Arts Village in the capital city Abha. As Governor of Makkah, he established the Cultural Council of Makkah. He is a close friend of Prince Charles, who is a supporters of artistic painting. Personal life Prince Khalid is married to Al Anoud bint Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. Her mother is Nura bint Saud bin Abdulaziz, a daughter of King Saud. Her father, Abdullah, is a son of Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman who is King Abdulaziz's step brother. Prince Khalid's eldest son, Prince Bandar, is the chairman of the board of directors of Al Watan, a reformist newspaper. His second son, Prince Sultan is a naval officer in Saudi army.

He is sometimes viewed as a Robin Hood type figure and a pioneer in the fight for civil rights. Many local North Carolinians remember him as a Robin Hood figure, particularly the Tuscarora and Lumbee people, who consider him one of their tribe and a pioneer in the fight for their civil rights, personal freedom, and tribal self-determination. Lowrie was described by George Alfred Townsend, a correspondent for the New York Herald in the late 19th century, as \\"[o]ne of those remarkable executive spirits that arises now and then in a raw community without advantages other than those given by nature.\\"Townsend, George Alfred (1872). The Swamp Outlaws: or, The North Carolina Bandits; Being a Complete History of the Modern Rob Roys and Robin Hoods, New York: Robert M. DeWitt. Early life Lowry was born c.1845 to Allen and Mary (Cumbo) Lowry in the Hopewell Community, in Robeson County, North Carolina. His father owned a successful mixed-use farm in the county. Henry Lowry was one of 12 children, described as multi-racial or free people of color. Lowry Gang The Confederate government used conscription to force many locals to work on the construction of various forts around the Cape Fear River area for very little pay. Several Lowrey cousins, excluded from military service because they were free men of color, had been conscripted to help build Fort Fisher. The Lowry Gang was originally started to aid those hiding from conscription. Other residents resorted to \\"lying out\\" or hiding in the region's swamps to avoid being rounded up by the Confederate Home Guard and forced to work for low wages. As the Civil War approached its end, the Lowry Gang aligned themselves with various Union soldiers that had escaped from Confederate prison camps and began engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Confederacy. On December 21, 1864, James P. Barnes, a neighbor of Allen Lowry, accused him of stealing hogs. Lowry's son Henry killed Barnes. In January 1865, Henry Lowry also killed James Brantley Harris, a conscription officer, for allegedly mistreating the women of the Lowry family. In March 1865, the Home Guard searched his father Allen Lowry's home and found firearms, which free people of color had been forbidden to own since after 1831 and Nat Turner's rebellion. The Home Guard convened a kangaroo court, convicted Allen Lowry and his son William, and executed them. Henry Lowry reportedly watched from the bushes. After William and his father were captured and executed by the Home Guard in March 1865, young Henry Berry came to be regarded as the new leader of the Lowry band. Although Lowry's band was composed mostly of Indians, among his chief lieutenants were a black man named George Applewhite and a white youth named Zachariah McLaughlin. During their robbery spree, the Lowry Gang committed many robberies with atypical conditions. Victims of the thefts were treated respectfully considering the circumstances and the victims could potentially avoid being robbed if they could show that they could not afford it. The Lowry gang often returned certain stolen items such as horses and wagons when they no longer needed them. The gang at times was known for sharing their profits with the poor, such as distributing corn to the poor. Lowry Wars Henry Lowry led a gang in committing a series of robberies and murders against the upper class, continuing until 1872. The attempts to capture the gang members became known as the Lowry War. The Lowry gang consisted of Henry Lowry, his brothers Stephen and Thomas, two cousins (Calvin and Henderson Oxendine), two of his brothers-in-law, two escaped slaves, a white man, and two other men of unknown relation. Lowry's gang continued its actions into Reconstruction. Republican governor William Woods Holden outlawed Lowry and his men in 1869, and offered a $12,000 reward for their capture: dead or alive. Lowry responded with more revenge killings. On December 7, 1865, he married Rhoda Strong. Immediately after the wedding, and in the presence of several hundred wedding guests, Lowry was arrested by former members of the Confederate Home Guard turned county militia and under the charge of murdering James Barnes. He was able to escape by filing through the bars with a file that was smuggled to him by members of his gang. The governor at the time Jonathon Worth placed a $300 dead or alive bounty on his head, but the gang would go on to evade captivity for another 3 years despite many efforts made by the militia to apprehend him. A few notable events include fending off a search posse while using a boat for cover and eluding troops from United States military that were sent down to North Carolina specifically to capture him. In 1871 Francis Marion Wishart became colonel of the Police Guard manhunt and had the wives of the Lowry band held hostage in prison. Henry Berry Lowry and other band members sent the colonel a letter with an ultimatum, either the release of their wives of the Lowry Gang, or \\"the bloodiest times will be here than ever was before‚Äîthe life of every man will be in jeopardy.\\" Their wives were abruptly released. Lowry's band opposed the postwar conservative Democratic power structure, which worked to reassert its political dominance and white supremacy. The Lowry gang robbed and killed numerous people of the establishment. Because of this, they gained the sympathy of the non-white population of Robeson County. The authorities were unable to stop the Lowry gang, largely because of this support. The conservative Democratic party was replaced by a more moderate Republican party with ideological similarities to many Lowry supporters. In February 1872, shortly after a raid in which he robbed the local sheriff's safe of more than $28,000, Henry Berry Lowry disappeared. Colonel Wishart called the reports of his death \\"ALL A HOAX.\\" The $12,000 reward for his life was never collected. It is claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his double-barrel shotgun. As with many folk heroes, the death of Lowrie was disputed. He was reportedly seen at a funeral several years later. Without his leadership, every member of the gang except two were subsequently captured or killed. Reverend Patrick Lowry who, as a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1872, announced that his brother (Henry Berry) was in fact dead. However, Henry Berry's wife Rhoda, insisted until her death in 1909 that he had made good his escape, even though she remarried a few years after his disappearance. Henry Berry Lowry had three children: Sally Ann (b. 1867), Henry Delany (b. 1869), and Nealy-ann (b. 1870). Depictions *Starting in 1976, Lowry's legend has been presented each summer in an outdoor drama called Strike at the Wind!. Set during the Civil War and Reconstruction years, the play portrays Lowry as a Native American culture hero who flouts the white power structure by fighting for his people and defending the county's downtrodden citizens. *Aftershock: Beyond the Civil War DVD (91 min.)

Technique Dave Knudson demonstrating his tapping technique. Dave Knudson is well known for his use of two-handed tapping. He uses this technique to create polyphony (countermelodies), whereby his right hand will tap a treble melody, whilst his left hand plays a bass accompaniment. This technique is most apparent on the album Highly Refined Pirates, where it is used on every single song (except the electronic interludes.) Dave is also known for his use of the Line 6 DL-4 delay modeller's sampler capability. The DL-4 can be used to record a phrase which can then be played back instantly by stepping on one of the DL-4's buttons. The sample can also be reversed, slowed down or sped up, effects which Dave makes use of both in the studio (notably on Menos El Oso), but can also be replicated live. Dave can often be heard recording and preparing the samples before the start of songs when playing live. Graphic design On top of playing and touring with Minus the Bear, Dave has also designed the artwork for the band's releases and the majority of apparel, as well as artwork for other bands such as Pretty Girls Make Graves.

The fire started from a recreational vehicle parked next to the building.Vatanen, Panu: Kilpisj√§rven koulu paloi kivijalkaan saakka, Ylen uutiset 3 May 2015. Accessed on 3 May 2015. The fire destroyed thousands of euros worth of euro banknotes that had been stored at the school. The money had been collected as donations to fund a study trip for the school's pupils, but had been stored at the school because the school staff had been unable to find a bank office capable of depositing the money to the school's bank account. The nearest office of Nordea, where the school had an account, capable of depositing cash was in Rovaniemi, 440 km away from Kilpisj√§rvi. Nordea has pledged to donate 4000 euros to the school as reimbursement for the lost money.Halminen, Laura: Lappilaiskoululaisten leirikoulurahat paloivat pitkien talletusmatkojen takia ‚Äì Nordea lupaa korvata tuhannet eurot, Helsingin Sanomat online edition 5 May 2015.

It produces spikes of bright yellow flowers in summer. The bright orange fruits have been used as a colourant to replace saffron by Shetland Islanders.Richard Mabey Flora Britannica Despite the plant's English name, it is not particularly closely related to the true asphodels. In addition to other forms of pollination, this plant is adapted to rain-pollination. The Latin specific name means \\"bone-breaker\\", and refers to a traditional belief that eating the plant caused sheep to develop brittle bones. The probable origin of this story is that sheep eating a calcium-poor diet are likely to develop bone weakness, and N. ossifragum favours acidic low-calcium soils. Description Bog asphodel is a tufted, hairless perennial with a creeping rhizome. The leaves are up to long, narrow, flattened and sword-shaped, and often tinged with orange. The inflorescence is a spike with bright yellow, star-like flowers about across, which have short white hairs on the orange stamens. The fruits are deep orange. Biology The plant can cause photosensitisation, a serious skin condition of sheep called alveld, \\"elf fire\\", in Norway. It can be relieved by moving stock into shade. Not all stands of the plant are toxic, and the toxicity may be the side effect of the plant's response to a fungal infection.Handbook of Plant and Fungal Toxicants by J. P. Felix D'MelloGeorge B. B.

In the British Isles it occurs in Scotland, Northwest England, Wales, Southwest England and most of Ireland. It grows in wet soils and peats, in bogs, wet heaths and flushes. It can be found in purple moor grass and rush pastures.

It was the first major battle fought between Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine and Ottoman forces under General Hasan Tahsin Pasha during the First Balkan War. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected Thessaly with central Macedonia. Despite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of Servia and Kozani. Background Following the conclusion of the Greek War of Independence, the Megali Idea (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state. The disastrous Greek defeat in the short Greco-Turkish War of 1897 exposed major flaws in the Greek Army's organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, Georgios Theotokis became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new table of organization was introduced for the country's navy and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the Goudi coup seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos to rule the country. Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the reservists for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a British naval mission and a French military mission. The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral Lionel Grant Tufnell, who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the Whitehead torpedo. The French mission under Brigadier General Joseph Paul Eydoux focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large formation operations. The Hellenic Military Academy was modeled after the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry. After being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in Sofia to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the Ottomans it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of Macedonia. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose Balkan League alliance with Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to Thrace; the Balkan League responded in kind. On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared war against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September. Prelude Greece dispatched the Army of Epirus and the Army of Thessaly to its frontiers in Epirus and Thessaly respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th, the 6th and the 7th Infantry Divisions, as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent Evzones battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince Constantine. Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman VIII Corps under General Hasan Tahsin Pasha which included three divisions: the regular (nizamiye) 22nd Division and the reserve (redif) Nasli√ß and Aydƒ±n Divisions which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000‚Äì40,000 men. The Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of Elassona. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry. The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions. The Greeks went on to advance into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance. Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo. Situated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some . Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the Convention of Constantinople (1881), the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war. The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \\"the graveyard of the Greek Army\\" by the Prussian Field Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz. Battle At 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions. The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the Haliacmon River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards Servia, planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon. Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog. At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning. The 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m. The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset. The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment. On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty Krupp guns and engaged in a disorganized retreat. The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and Kozani. Aftermath At 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets. Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians. By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed, opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of Thessaloniki and assist the Serbs at Monastir. On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King George I arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and Veroia. Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded, while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, 701 personnel taken prisoner, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses. By May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching Constantinople. On 30 May, the two sides signed the Treaty of London which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of Enos on the Aegean Sea and north of Midia on the Black Sea, as well as Crete. The fate of Albania and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the Great Powers.

The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman fortified position at Yenidje, which was the last line of defense for the city of Thessaloniki, which had a Greek majority population. The rough and swampy terrain surrounding Yenidje significantly complicated the advance of the Greek army, most notably its artillery. In the early morning of 20 October, an infantry charge by the Greek 9th Evzone Battalion caused the Greek army to gain momentum, leading to the collapse of the entire western wing of the Ottomans. Ottoman morale plunged and the bulk of the defenders began fleeing two hours later.

On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who engaged in a disorganized retreat. At 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division marched into Servia, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed the following day. On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; a day later King George I arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and Veroia. The Ottomans fought a number of small scale delaying actions at Kolokouri, Tripotamos and Perdika, the Greek army nevertheless continued its advance taking Veroia and Katerini on 16 October. Between 17 and 18 October, the Greek general command forwarded its troops to the Veroia-Naousa plain. After their defeat at Sarandaporo, the Ottomans augmented the remnants of Hasan Tahsin Pasha's force with fresh reinforcements. Two divisions from east Macedonia, one reserve division from Asia Minor and one reserve division from Thessaloniki; bringing the total Ottoman forces in the area to 25,000 men and 36 artillery pieces. The Ottomans chose to organize their main defensive line at Yenidje either because of the town's religious importance for Macedonia's Muslim population or because they did not wish to fight too close to Thessaloniki. The Ottomans dug their trenches at a high hill which overlooked the plain west of the town. The hill was surrounded by two rough streams, its southern approaches were covered by the swampy Giannitsa Lake while the slopes of Mount Paiko complicated any potential enveloping maneuver from the north. On the eastern approaches to Yenidje, the Ottomans reinforced the garrisons guarding the bridges across the Loudias River, the rail line at Platy and Gida. On 18 October, the Greek general command ordered its troops forward despite receiving conflicting intelligence reports regarding the disposition of the enemy troops. The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions marched along the same route towards Tsaousli and Tsekre respectively, both located north-east of Yenidje. The 1st Greek Division acted as the army's rearguard. The 4th Division headed towards Yenidje from the north-west, while the 6th Division circumvented the city further to west, intending to capture Nedir. The 7th Division and the cavalry brigade covered the right flank of the army by advancing towards Gida; while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment was ordered to seize Trikala. Battle Greek soldiers at the lake during the battle The first shots were fired in the early morning of 19 October, the advance guards of the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions pushed back the Ottomans at Burgas. Upon reaching the bridge across Balitzas river, the two divisions became the target of heavy shelling from the hills surrounding Yenidje. The 4th and 6th Divisions likewise halted their advance, after being repulsed by massed rifle fire. The Greek army command arrived at the battlefield at noon, in order to assess the situation and issue new orders. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions were to force their way across the bridge, conducting a frontal attack on the main body of the Ottoman forces behind it. The 4th and 6th Divisions conducted a flanking maneuver from the west, in the meantime the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment and the cavalry brigade rushed towards Loudias; thus creating two fronts on either side of the Giannitsa Lake. The Greek artillery's shelling was inaccurate since the ground was swampy and unstable. Only a single battery managed to establish itself at a distance of from the Ottoman trenches. This caused the 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions to significantly slow down their advance, however by nightfall, they managed to establish a large bridgehead across the Gramos river which flows into Giannitsa Lake from the north Contrary to the orders they had received the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade encamped at Gida upon reaching it, while the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment likewise failed to cross the Loudias after failing to locate a bridge. The 4th and 6th Greek Divisions progressed steadily on the western edge of the battlefield, crushing two counter-attacks and forcing the Ottomans to move their headquarters further back. At 8 a.m., 20 October, an infantry charge by the 9th Evzone Battalion of the 4th Greek Division captured an Ottoman battery. The 4th Greek Division used the momentum it had gained to push back the entire western wing of the Ottomans. The 2nd and 3rd Greek Divisions made headway against their opponents, reaching the edge of Yenidje and launching a bayonet attack on the Ottomans just as the 4th Greek Division arrived from the west. At 10 a.m., the Ottomans broke into a disorganized retreat, most fleeing towards Thessaloniki and Doiran. The latter were detained by a Serbian cavalry unit that was advancing towards the Axios valley. Crown Prince Constantine ordered a single regiment of the 2nd Greek Division to chase the retreating Ottomans along the road to Thessaloniki, but it proved to be too narrow for an effective pursuit. At the same time a force of 3,000 Ottomans struck the 7th Greek Division at Gida, as it lingered in the area. The Greeks held their ground and immediately went on the offensive, disobeying orders once again, they limited themselves to establishing a bridgehead at Kirtzalar instead of crossing the Axios. The Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment managed to cross the Loudias by midday. However since the engineers of the 7th Division and the cavalry brigade failed to arrive on time, it was unable to reach the Axios and block its bridges; enabling many Ottomans to flee. Aftermath Greek casualties in the battle of Yenidje numbered 188 killed and 785 wounded. The Ottomans lost over 250 killed, over 1,000 wounded, 200 men captured, two flags lost, 11 to 14 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses. Following the capture of Yenidje, Crown Prince Constantine allowed the bulk of the Army of Thessaly to rest for three days after fifteen days of continuous fighting. Greek engineering units began repairing the bridges across the Axios that the Ottomans had previously destroyed. In the meantime, the 5th Greek Division continued its march towards Monastiri until it was ambushed and defeated outside Sorovich on 21 October. The battle of Sorovich perplexed Constantine and made him hesitate just as the Greek majority city of Thessaloniki seemed to be within his grasp. Citing Greek intelligence agents within the Bulgarian capital that the latter had taken Serres and were rapidly approaching Thessaloniki, a vexed Venizelos repeatedly urged Constantine and King George I to act. On 25 October, the Army of Thessaly finally crossed the Axios, reaching the Tekeli-Bathylakkos-Gourdino line. On the same day, Constantine received a delegation consisting of the ambassadors of the Great Powers to Thessaloniki and Ottoman general Sefik Pasha. Tahsin Pasha offered to surrender the city without a fight and in return requested that Thessaloniki's garrison could retain its weapons and retreat to Karaburnu where it was to remain until the end of the war. Constantine rejected the Ottoman appeal, demanding a complete disarmament of the Ottomans and offering to transport them to an Asia Minor port of their choosing. At 5 a.m. on 26 October, a second Ottoman delegation appealed for 5,000 weapons to be retained during the transportation, Constantine responded by giving the Ottomans a two hour ultimatum to submit to his conditions. At 11 a.m., the 7th Greek Division crossed Gallikos river, the last aquatic barrier before the city. Around the same time, Tahsin Pasha decided to given in to the Greek demands, dispatching messengers to alert Constantine about his intentions; the latter received the news at 2 p.m. The 7th Greek Division and two Evzone battalions were immediately ordered to seize the city; while Constantine sent a message to the commander of the Bulgarian division closest to Thessaloniki advising him to divert towards a direction where his troops would be more useful. At 11 p.m., Tahsin Pasha signed a document of surrender in the presence of officers Viktor Dousmanis and Ioannis Metaxas. Under the terms of the treaty Greece captured 26,000 men and seized 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, 70,000 rifles and large amounts of ammunition and other military equipment. Feigning ignorance of the fact that the Ottomans had already surrendered, the Bulgarian army continued to advance towards the city. Bulgarian general Georgi Todorov requested that the control of city be split between Bulgaria and Greece. Constantine refused, allowing only two Bulgarian battalions to rest within the city. The battle marked the capture of the city and its inclusion in the Greek state, helping shape the modern map of Greece. Nevertheless the Greek capture of Thessaloniki remained a significant point of tension with Bulgaria, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the Second Balkan War. By May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching Constantinople. On 30 May, the two sides signed the Treaty of London which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of Enos on the Aegean Sea and north of Midia on the Black Sea, as well as Crete. The fate of Albania and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the Great Powers.

This is the first film adaptation of the story, directed by Michael Anderson and starring Edmond O'Brien as protagonist Winston Smith, and featuring Donald Pleasence, Jan Sterling, and Michael Redgrave. The character O'Brien, the antagonist, was renamed \\"O'Connor\\", due to the shared surname of the actor Edmond O'Brien. Emmanuel Goldstein is changed to \\"Kalador\\". In 1954, Peter Cushing and Andr√© Morell starred in a BBC-TV made-for-TV adaptation which was extremely popular with British audiences, leading to the production of the 1956 film version. Donald Pleasence had also appeared in the BBC television version, playing the character of Syme, which for the film was amalgamated with that of Parsons. The script was co-written by William Templeton, who had previously adapted the novel for the US Studio One TV series in 1953. For the U.S. market, 1984 was distributed in 1956 on a double feature with another British science fiction film, The Gamma People. After distributor agreements expired, the film was withdrawn from theatrical and TV distribution channels by Orwell's estate and has not been officially available for many years. Like the earlier film adaption of Animal Farm, 1984 was secretly funded by the Central Intelligence Agency. Plot A voice-over narrator explains that in the mid-1950s, a nuclear war and devastation of Earth gave rise to three superstates: Oceania, Eurasia, and East Asia. By 1984, London, with its bomb-proof ministry, is designated as the capital of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania, controlled by one all-powerful Party, embodied by the figurehead Big Brother. In the spring of 1984, Winston Smith, a member of the elite Outer Party, encounters Julia, a woman he suspects may be a member of the Thought Police. Winston returns to his apartment, where an electronic surveillance eye examines the contents of his briefcase. Smuggling a small black diary past the eye, Winston begins to write down the subversive thoughts he fears to say aloud. Winston's reverie is interrupted when Selina Parsons, a little girl who lives next door, enters his apartment to practice denouncing him as a traitor. Robert Parsons, Selina's father, invites Winston to join him for a drink at the local Chestnut Tree caf√©. At the cafe, Winston and Parsons spot Rutherford and Jones, two Outer Party traitors who have been rehabilitated by the government's Ministry of Love. Afterwards, Winston goes to a junk shop to wonder at the objects of yesteryear that are now deemed worthless. Julia enters the shop, sending Winston scurrying into the street, where he is stopped by the police and ordered to report to Administration the next morning. At the Administration the next day, a party officer reprimands Winston for socializing with the common masses. Winston then proceeds to his job at the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth. When Winston discovers a photo that would prove Jones and Rutherford innocent, O'Connor, Winston's superior, instructs him to destroy it. That evening, at a political rally, Julia passes Winston a note professing her love to him. Later, they arrange to meet Sunday in a meadow outside London, far from the prying microphones and monitors of Big Brother. There, they touch each other, an act prohibited by the Anti-Sex League, and proceed to make love. Two weeks later, Winston proposes renting a room at the junk store, one of the few places free of the omnipresent monitors. In the sanctity of their quarters, Winston confides that he believes O'Connor may be a member of the Underground. One night, Winston finds a note written in O'Connor's handwriting that reads \\"down with Big Brother.\\" Convinced that O'Connor represents their only hope to break free of the tyranny of Big Brother, Julia and Winston go to his apartment and declare that they want to join the Underground. O'Connor instructs Winston to carry an empty briefcase with him at all times. A few days later, during a rally to launch Hate Week, a man switches briefcases with Winston. When Winston opens the case, he finds a copy of a treatise by the alleged leader of the Underground. Back in their secret room, Julia muses that only love can defeat Big Brother. At that moment, a telescreen hidden behind a mirror condemns Julia's sentiments, after which, the police burst in to arrest them. At the Ministry of Love, Winston is confined in a pit-like room. Soon after, Parsons is thrown into the pit, his daughter having denounced him for muttering in his sleep \\"Down with Big Brother.\\" After Parsons is taken away, O'Connor enters the room and reveals himself to be a covert agent of the state. Under O'Connor's direction, Winston is subjected to a brainwashing campaign. Still resistant after a series of electroshock treatments, Winston declares that the party will never eradicate his love for Julia. Having ascertained that Winston's worst fear is being eaten alive by rats, O'Connor confines him in a room filled with the squealing rodents, after which Winston breaks down and begs them to feed Julia to the rodents instead. After O'Connor authorizes his release, Winston mindlessly wanders through the streets, where he spots Julia. After they confess their mutual betrayal, Big Brother broadcasts that the Eurasian army has been routed in battle and that the war will be soon over. In the final shot, the rehabilitated and brainwashed Winston and Julia then fervently join the crowd in cheering \\"Long live Big Brother!\\" An alternate ending was also produced, in which Winston rebels against his brainwashing, and starts to shout, \\"Down with Big Brother,\\" before being shot down. Julia runs to his aid, and suffers the same fate.

It was a battle fought between Greek forces under Lieutenant General Konstantinos Sapountzakis and Ottoman forces under General Esad Pasha during the First Balkan War. The battle began when the Ottomans attacked Greek positions at Anogi. Early snowfall prevented the Ottomans from launching a big offensive, while the Greeks managed to hold their ground for six days in the ensuing series of skirmishes. Background Following the conclusion of the Greek War of Independence, the Megali Idea (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state. The disastrous Greek defeat in the short Greco-Turkish War of 1897 exposed major flaws in the Greek Army's organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, Georgios Theotokis became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new table of organization was introduced for the country's navy and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the Goudi coup seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos to rule the country. Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the reservists for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a British naval mission and a French military mission. The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral Lionel Grant Tufnell, who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the Whitehead torpedo. The French mission under Brigadier General Joseph Paul Eydoux focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large formation operations. The Hellenic Military Academy was modeled after the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry. After being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in Sofia to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the Ottomans it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of Macedonia. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose Balkan League alliance with Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to Thrace; the Balkan League responded in kind. On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared war against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September. Prelude Greece dispatched the Army of Epirus and the Army of Thessaly to its frontiers in Epirus and Thessaly respectively. The Army of Epirus numbered 20,000 men and 30 artillery pieces and was commanded by Lieutenant General Konstantinos Sapountzakis. Facing the Greeks in Epirus was the Yanya Corps under General Esad Pasha, which numbered 35,000 men and 102 artillery pieces; most of which were concentrated at the Yanya Fortified Area. The Army of Epirus was to conduct only a limited number of offensive operations, mainly focusing on protecting the Army of Thessaly's western flank. As it was too small to breach the Ottoman defenses around Yanya. The Yanya Fortified Area included two major fortresses, those of Bizani and Kastritsa, guarding the main southern approaches, along with five smaller forts in a ring around the city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The terrain south of Yanya provided excellent defensive ground, as all the roads leading to the city could be observed from Bizani. The Ottomans had augmented their defenses with permanent fortifications, constructed under the guidance of German General R√ºdiger von der Goltz. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, trenches, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The Army of Epirus crossed the bridge of Arta into Ottoman territory at midday 6 October, capturing the Gribovo heights by the end of the day. On 9 October, the Ottomans counterattacked initiating the Battle of Gribovo, on the night of 10‚Äì11 October the Greeks were pushed back towards Arta. After regrouping the following day, the Greek army went on the offensive once again finding the Ottoman positions abandoned and capturing Filippiada. On 19 October, the Army of Epirus launched an attack on Preveza in conjunction with the Ionian squadron of the Greek Navy; taking the city on 21 October. Battle Following the fall of Preveza, Esad Pasha transferred his headquarters to the old Venetian castle at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). He ordered it to be repaired and augmented since it overlooked one of the two major roads leading to Yanya, while also recruiting local Cham Albanians into an armed militia. On 23 October, a force consisting of five Ottoman battalions set off from Pente Pigadia, launching an attack on the 3rd and 10th Greek Evzone Battalions stationed at Anogi. Early snowfall prevented the Ottomans from carrying out a large scale attack, while the Greeks held their ground in a series of clashes that lasted between 24‚Äì30 October. Upon halting their offensive the Ottomans withdrew to the village of Pesta. Greek casualties in the battle of Pente Pigadia numbered 26 dead and 222 wounded. Aftermath No major operations took place in the vicinity of Yanya until the Battle of Driskos, on 26 November. This action marked the defeat of the Greek Metsovo Detachment by a numerically superior and better equipped Ottoman force. Following the conclusion of the Greek campaign in Macedonia, the Army of Epirus received considerable reinforcements. This enabled it to capture the Yanya Fortified Area in the aftermath of the Battle of Bizani (19‚Äì21 February 1913). By May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and its forces were rapidly approaching Constantinople. On 30 May, the two sides signed the Treaty of London which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of Enos on the Aegean Sea and north of Midia on the Black Sea, as well as Crete. The fate of Albania and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the Great Powers.

It consists of between 39 and 56 members who serve 5-year terms. The current Senate was elected on 24 July 2015 and consists of 43 members. In each of the country's 18 provinces, two Senators (one Hutu and one Tutsi) are chosen by electoral colleges of communal councilors. Voting takes place using a three round system. In the first two rounds, a candidate must receive a supermajority of two-thirds of the vote to be elected. If no candidate is elected in these rounds, a third round is organized for the two leading candidates, of which the candidate receiving the majority of votes is elected. Three Senators represent the Twa ethnic group and additional members may be co-opted to meet the 30% gender representation quota for women. Former heads of state are Senators by right. History A provision of establishment of Senate was in the 1962 constitution of the Kingdom of Burundi, however, the body was only established in 1965. The Senate was disestablished in 1966 after the coup of Michel Micombero. The Senate was re-established in 2001 following Arusha Accords. Senate elections took place on 29 July 2005. The National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), which obtained the majority of seats in communal elections held in June, won an overwhelming majority (30) of the seats. The Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) won 3 seats, while the remaining seat went the National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), a breakaway faction of the CNDD-FDD. Four former heads of state - Jean-Baptiste Bagaza (PARENA), Pierre Buyoya (UPRONA), Sylvestre Ntibantunganya (FRODEBU), and the current transitional president Domitien Ndayizeye (FRODEBU) will occupy seats in the Senate along with three Twa members. In order to meet the 30% quota for women, eight seats were co- opted giving the chamber of total of 49 seats. On 19 August 2005, the Senate and National Assembly (acting as an Electoral College) elected Pierre Nkurunziza president of the republic. He took office on 26 August 2005. Gervais Rufyikiri, a member of the CNDD-FDD, was elected president of the Senate on 17 August 2005.

The Serbian army encountered Ottoman troops near the town of Prilep, in today's North Macedonia. The clash lasted for three days, and the Ottoman army was overwhelmed and forced to retreat.Hall-Balkan Wars 1912-1913. Prelude to the First World War. Retrieved August 5, 2012. Bad weather and difficult roads hampered the 1st Army‚Äôs pursuit of the Ottomans after the battle of Kumanovo, forcing the Morava Division to move ahead of the Drina Division. On 3 November, in the autumn rain, forward elements of the Morava Division encountered fire from Kara Said Pasha‚Äôs 5th Corps from positions north of Prilep. This started the three-day battle for Prilep, which was broken off that night and was renewed the next morning. When the Drina Division arrived on the battlefield, the Serbs gained an overwhelming advantage, forcing the Ottomans to withdraw south of the city. On 5 November, as the Serbs moved south of Prilep they came again under Ottoman fire from prepared positions on the heights of the road to Bitola. Bayonets and hand grenades gave the Serbs the advantage in hand-to-hand fighting, but they still required the better part of the day to force the Ottomans to retreat. The overt and guileless nature of the Serbian infantry attacks impressed one Ottoman observer, who noted: \\"The development of the Serbian infantry attack was as open and clear as the execution of a barracks exercise. Large and strong units covered the entire plain. All the Serbian officers were seen clearly. They attacked as if on parade. The picture was very impressive. One part of the Turkish officers were struck dumb by the wonder of this mathematical disposition and order, the other sighed at this moment because of the absence of heavy artillery. They remarked on the arrogance of the open approach and clear frontal attack.\\" The artillery abandoned in Skoplje would have helped the Ottoman defenders south of Prilep. The Serbs demonstrated the same lack of subtlety in their infantry attacks that caused heavy casualties among all the combatants during the Balkan Wars and would cause many during the First World War. During this battle, the Serbian 1st Army was without the presence of its commanding general, Crown Prince Alexander. Ill from the rigors of the cold and wet campaign, he maintained telephone contact with his army from his sickbed in Skoplje. The short, sharp battles around Prilep demonstrated that the Ottomans were still capable of opposing the Serbian march through Macedonia. Even after abandoning the city of Prilep, the Ottoman 5th Corps fought stubbornly south of town. The size and enthusiasm of the Serbs overcame the Ottomans, but at a cost. The Ottomans suffered around 300 dead and 900 wounded, and 152 were taken prisoner; the Serbs had losses of around 2,000 dead and wounded. The road southwest to Bitola now lay open to the Serbs.

Marking the forthcoming 70th birthday (18 July 1988) of the imprisoned anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela, the concert was also referred to as Freedomfest, Free Nelson Mandela Concert and Mandela Day. In the United States, the Fox television network heavily censored the political aspects of the concert.T. V. Reed, The Art of Protest, University of Minnesota Press, 2005, p. 174.Martin A Lee and Norman Solomon, Unreliable Sources: A Guide to Detecting Bias in News Media. . Quoted by Norman Solomon in Political and Corporate Censorship in the Land of the Free, by John Shirley, Gauntlet No. 3, 1992.Morse, Steve (13 June 1988), Boston Globe. The concert is considered a notable example of anti-apartheid music. First of two Mandela events The Birthday Tribute was regarded by many, including the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and the African National Congress (ANC), as raising worldwide consciousness of the imprisonment of ANC leader Mandela and others by the South African apartheid government and forcing the regime to release Nelson Mandela earlier than would otherwise have happened.Letter from Mike Terry, Executive Secretary, AAM, 18 January 2003: \\"Before the first event, the prospect of Nelson Mandela's imminent release from prison seemed completely unrealistic. Yet within 20 months he walked free and I have no doubt that the first event played a decisive role in making this happen. This was implicitly acknowledged by Nelson Mandela, himself, by his decision to participate in the second event.\\"Letter from Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, President of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, 12 July 1995: \\"The result of his efforts helped to generate the pressures which secured the release of Nelson Mandela.\\"ANC website message from Oliver Tambo: \\"...the worldwide campaign for the release of Nelson Mandela and political prisoners made a decisive contribution....One event in particular symbolised that campaign ‚Äì the 'Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute'...The ANC owes an enormous debt of gratitude to the artists and performers and all those who made that event possible...\\" Eighteen months after the event, with a release now thought to be approaching, Mandela asked for the organisers of the event to create a second concert as an official international reception at which, after 27 years in prison, he would address the world. The second event, Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa, was, like the first, conceived to be shown on television across the world and was broadcast from Wembley Stadium to more than 60 countries on 16 April 1990. The first concert, according to Robin Denselow, music critic and presenter of the BBC broadcast, writing in 1989,Denselow, Robin, When The Music's Over: The Story of Political Pop, London: Faber and Faber, 1990 (), p. 276. was the \\"biggest and most spectacular pop-political event of all time, a more political version of Live Aid with the aim of raising consciousness rather than just money.\\" The organiser and risk-funder of the two events was producer and impresario Tony Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth also conceived the idea for the first event.Letter from Mike Terry, Executive Secretary, Anti-Apartheid Movement, 18 January 2003: \\"...he performed multiple roles of creator, risk taker, executive producer, producer and artists recruiter. He never claimed such an array of titles nor pushed himself in front of the media preferring to let the media focus on the cause at hand.\\"Letter to Hollingsworth from AAM, signed by Archbishop Huddleston, Dr Allan Boesak, Robert Hughes MP, Andimba Toivo ja Toivo and Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, 12 June 1988, the day after the first Mandela concert: \\"On behalf of all of us who got the credit for the marvellous Anti Apartheid concert and all that will follow from it ‚Äì a thousand thanks!\\" Starting point Hollingsworth developed the plan for the first Mandela concert after talking to singer Jerry Dammers of The Specials ska band, who had written the song Free Nelson Mandela in 1984 and founded the Artists Against Apartheid organisation the following year. In early 1986, Hollingsworth contacted Dammers to say that the Greater London Council, for which Hollingsworth was producing a number of festivals and concerts, might be able to fund the AAA. The authority was due to be abolished at the end of March and had spare cash to give away. But a grant turned out to be impossible because the AAA was not a legal entity and Dammers had no interest in making it one. Hollingsworth told Dammers that he would put on an anti-apartheid concert if the singer could find a big name. Dammers did not phone back until June 1987, although in the summer of 1986 he had organised a free anti-apartheid concert, Freedom Beat, in London's Clapham Common attended by 200,000 people. Dammers told Hollingsworth that he had received a letter from Simple Minds, the Glasgow rock band, agreeing to perform at an event which Hollingsworth had suggested for the previous year. The two agreed to go to Edinburgh, where Simple Minds were performing, to talk about a deal for a new event. Hollingsworth had in mind a major event, a birthday tribute for Mandela, who would be 70 the following year. The event would seek worldwide television and would call for his release ‚Äì the first step in ending apartheid. Simple Minds was interested in the proposal but only if Hollingsworth brought in another top group. Persuading the Anti-Apartheid Movement At the same time, Hollingsworth started what turned out to be a series of meetings with Mike Terry, head of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in London. Also of note was the work of Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside, who led the AAM (Anti-Apartheid Movement) at the time these concerts were organised. If the concert was to be successful, it was important to win the support of the movement and, with it, the implicit support of Mandela. But Terry and his senior officials firmly resisted Hollingsworth's proposal, insisting on three conditions, based on the policies of the African National Congress. First, the concert must focus on all political prisoners in South Africa, not just Mandela. Mandela had himself told the ANC that he did not wish to be singled out from other prisoners in the organisation's campaigning. Second, the event must campaign against apartheid as a whole and this was to be in its title. Third, it must call for sanctions against South Africa. Hollingsworth argued that the concert could not be effective under those terms. They would not work for an event that was intended for the mass media across the world, including in countries where there might be little knowledge of Mandela, let alone support for him. The event should not be \\"angry\\", but a \\"positive\\" birthday tribute, calling only for Mandela to be freed. Many broadcasters, Hollingsworth argued, would not televise a Mandela concert if it followed the AAM and ANC campaign policies. They would regard it as a political event. Other broadcasters would provide only limited airtime. But a positive birthday tribute would conform to the broadcasters' entertainment mandate and there would be a good chance they would show the full day's event. Hollingsworth was not seeking ANC backing because that would have put off broadcasters. He wanted the AAM's backing but, for similar reasons, did not want the movement's name on the event. Terry was the first to come round to Hollingsworth's view, but needed some time before persuading the rest of his team. On the other hand, he quickly won the approval of Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, the AAM president and a former priest in southern Africa.  Signing up first artists  By the time that the Anti-Apartheid Movement had agreed to support the concert, Hollingsworth had booked Wembley Stadium for the following June and had approached several artists in addition to Simple Minds. Few were saying a definite no, but hardly anyone would commit. Hollingsworth wanted Dire Straits, one of the largest acts in the world and the kind of act that was needed if broadcasters across the world were to sign up for the event, to head the bill. The group took the same line as Simple Minds. The band's manager Ed Bicknell said that Dire Straits would perform if other top acts also agreed, but Hollingsworth was not to mention Dire Straits in persuading the other acts. Hollingsworth signed up other big names, albeit on a provisional basis, put them in touch with one another and finally they all, including Dire Straits, agreed to perform. With clearly enough talent on board, Hollingsworth announced the bill in March, three months before the 11 June event. The list included: George Michael, Dire Straits, Whitney Houston, UB40, Aswad, Sly and Robbie, Bee Gees, Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela. The announcement of the list made it easier to bring in further artists, including the Eurythmics who had earlier refused three times, but other big names also. There were some difficulties. Bicknell, for instance, was shocked when Hollingsworth told him there was one condition to Dire Straits playing. The band must rehearse for the event because it had not been on tour for some time and had even disbanded, albeit temporarily. Hollingsworth, in fact, told most of the artists they must rehearse, offering to pay for all rehearsal costs. Dire Straits, like the others, complied. In the event, the band had to bring in a guest guitarist to replace Jack Sonni, who had just become the father of twin girls. The new man was Eric Clapton. A week after the first bill was announced, Simple Minds threatened to quit, arguing that there was not enough grit in it: Whitney Houston, for instance, should not be there. Hollingsworth argued that there was plenty of grit but that Whitney Houston was needed to broaden the audience to include people who were not so likely to know about Mandela and apartheid. Simple Minds accepted the argument. Harry Belafonte, Sting and Stevie Wonder Harry Belafonte: Hollingsworth went to New York to ask Harry Belafonte to give the opening address of the concert. Belafonte made it clear he was upset that, with so many musicians appearing, he was being asked only to talk. Hollingsworth told him the audience was not the right culture for him. He feared that Belafonte's singing would turn the clock back 30 years and would lose much of the television audience across the world. He was already worried about losing the audience as a result of using African singers and dancers whom many people would not have heard of. On the other hand, Belafonte, as a highly respected, internationally known personality, would be an effective speaker. Belafonte told him he would think about it, but Hollingsworth should also think about him performing. The two spoke a week later, with each taking much the same position, although Hollingsworth added that Belafonte could sing if he could get a category-A artist, such as Bruce Springsteen or Mick Jagger or Elton John, to sing with him. Belafonte did not get any of those, but came back with a list which Hollingsworth said was not good enough. Eventually, Belafonte agreed just to give the opening speech. Sting: Hollingsworth went to great lengths to get Sting to perform at the concert. The singer was associated with human rights issues, partly as a result of his song They Dance Alone about the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, and was at the height of his popularity. Sting's manager Miles Copeland, however, refused even to put the proposition to the singer because he would be on a world tour at the time and the Wembley concert would not fit in. The final tour schedule showed Sting due to perform in Berlin the night before Wembley and elsewhere in Europe on the evening of the Wembley concert. Several weeks before Wembley, Hollingsworth went to Switzerland where Sting was playing and booked himself into the same hotel. He got reception to put him through to Sting (using the singer's actual name, Gordon Sumner), told Sting that his management had refused to let him talk to the singer, and asked to meet him. Sting told him to come round to his room. Hollingsworth told Sting that he would fly the singer and his band to London on a private plane after his Friday evening Berlin concert, drive him to Wembley in the morning where an identical set of equipment would be set up on stage for him. Sting would then do a sound check and open the show a few minutes after mid-day, the first act of the concert (after an opening speech and a set of South African show dancers). As soon as he had done his half-hour slot, he would be driven to the airport and put on the private plane taking him back to the continent. Sting agreed. Copeland was furious about the agreement and shocked that Sting would open the show rather than be one of the closing acts. But the event was being organised not as a live concert but as a television show and that, according to Hollingsworth, meant a top act at the beginning when \\"the largest audience tunes in to see how it's going to be\\". At least one big act was planned for each hour of the 11-hour day in a bid to keep the audience. Stevie Wonder: One of the first artists that Hollingsworth tried to sign up was Stevie Wonder. He could never get through to the singer, though he phoned him every Friday at his studio. Senior members of the team told him each time that the matter was \\"under consideration\\". On the Wednesday before the concert, Wonder phoned back, asking whether there was still space for him. Hollingsworth told him there was a 25-minute slot ‚Äì time that had originally been kept open for Prince and Bono to sing a duet together but which the two singers turned down. Wonder agreed the booking. This was never announced but was to be a surprise for the audience. In the event, the singer caused a major backstage drama when the equipment used to play his pre-recorded music was lost. He refused to play and walked out of the stadium ‚Äì though he returned later using Whitney Houston's instruments. Broadcast politics Once the first set of artists had signed up, broadcasters were approached, starting with the BBC. Alan Yentob, recently appointed controller of BBC2, said that he would provide five hours of airtime ‚Äì and more if the bill improved. After several more top artists were added, the BBC agreed to televise the whole show. Before the concert, 24 Conservative MPs put down a House of Commons motion, criticising the BBC for giving \\"publicity to a movement that encourages the African National Congress in its terrorist activities\\".Denselow (1990), When The Music's Over, p. 279. However, no appeal was either planned or made. Further, the artists‚Äô contracts ‚Äì which in many cases were signed backstage at Wembley ‚Äì laid down that no proceeds from the income of the event should go \\"towards the purchase of or in any other connection with armaments\\". What problems there were came from the other side. Both the Anti-Apartheid Movement and Hollingsworth received bomb threats warning them not to go ahead with the event. Nearer the event, there was a threat to blow up the power station distributing electricity to Wembley. With the BBC on board, it was easier to persuade other broadcasters to buy the rights for the concert. The show was in most cases sold to the entertainment divisions of broadcasters as a birthday tribute that would not be political. As a result, they could agree to show the event without referring the question upwards or to the news or current-affairs divisions. According to Hollingsworth, once they had agreed to show the concert, the news divisions would have to stop referring to Mandela as a terrorist leader, thereby helping to ensure that Mandela was looked upon in a more favourable light. This was said to be a campaign objective which was beginning to be achieved by March. Even so, given the subject matter, the event was bound to be political in a broad sense. Thus, a week before the event, the Chicago Sun-Times said that the concert would have \\"the most overtly political theme since the 1960s.... It's a confrontational political event aimed at the government of South Africa and its practice of apartheid\\".John Swenson, \\"Big pop concert will seek Nelson Mandela's release\\", Chicago Sun-Times, 4 June 1988. Broadcasters were also told that the concert would use two stages, enabling acts to follow each other without a break, with top acts on the main stage and lesser-known groups on the second. There would therefore be no need for broadcasters to add material between events. The reasoning was that, first, the concert would look like a television show without awkward gaps encouraging audiences to switch off; and, second, broadcasters would be less likely to impose their own narrative on the event. The use of film stars to introduce major acts also helped achieve these objectives. Some broadcasters did send presenters to carry out backstage interviews for the presumed gaps but stopped doing so after a couple of hours. Most broadcasters showed the event live. Others, particularly in the Americas, showed it delayed because of the time difference. Most gave more or less full coverage. In the US, the Fox Television network showed only six hours in what was referred to as a \\"significantly de-radicalised version\\". A number of artists had their songs or speeches cut. One US newspaper objected that Fox \\"cut out some of the most passionate ‚Äì and especially most political ‚Äì moments of the day\\". Steven Van Zandt was appalled when he saw a recording of the Fox broadcast on his return to the US. He complained to the press, describing it as \\"a totally Orwellian experience\\". His own contribution, including a strident rendering of the song, Sun City, was one of those that were cut. Fox was worried about its sponsors and advertisers, particularly Coca-Cola which had booked six advertising spots for each hour. Whitney Houston, who was contracted to make advertisements for Coca-Cola, did her act in front of a black backdrop instead of the usual picture of Nelson Mandela. But, according to Hollingsworth, this was nothing to do with censorship but the result of an electricity generator failing. Fox also refused to use the concert title, Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute. Instead, it billed the show as Freedomfest, objecting to the pleas of the organisers to at least add \\"for Nelson Mandela\\". A further issue was highlighted by film actress Whoopi Goldberg when she came on stage to introduce one of the acts, saying that she had been told to say nothing political. The request did not come from the concert organisers but from the Fox TV producer at Wembley who, unbeknown to the organisers, told the Hollywood film stars to avoid saying anything political because an election was coming up in the States. After the event, the producer ‚Äì in charge of his own editing team for the US broadcast ‚Äì took out a full-page advertisement in a US trade magazine thanking American artists for participating in his show. The producer had been flown in a week before the Wembley concert to replace Fox's original choice who had been working on the production for three weeks but was thought by the network to have become infected by the political ethos of the concert organisation. On-stage politics There were supposed to be no political speeches at the event except for the message that Nelson Mandela should be freed ‚Äì coming from Harry Belafonte in his opening speech, from the film stars and musicians introducing the acts or the next piece of music and from the slogans around the stage. The principle ‚Äì aimed at ensuring that broadcasters would, first, buy the television rights and, second, continue to show the proceedings ‚Äì was more or less followed. Early on, the organisers stopped an insistent Jesse Jackson, the black American politician, from going on stage to make a speech. To have agreed to the request would have made it very difficult to say no to others. Jackson was, instead, shepherded to the Royal Box, joining Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock and Liberal leader David Steel along with a number of actors and musicians. Nonetheless, the posters, the political references from the actors and musicians, the music itself, the way the singers worked the audience and the audience response almost certainly got across a wider political message about apartheid. One or two artists took a harder line. Steven Van Zandt, for instance, in the run-up to singing Sun City with Simple Minds, declared that \\"we the people will no longer tolerate the terrorism of the government of South Africa\\" and that \\"we will no longer do business with those who do business with the terrorist government of South Africa\\". Stevie Wonder walks out Stevie Wonder landed in the United Kingdom on the Saturday morning of the concert and went straight to Wembley Stadium, where a room was prepared for him and his band to warm up. He was to appear in the evening after UB40. His appearance had not been announced. UB40 were finishing their set on the main stage, and Wonder's equipment was set up, plugged in and ready to be rolled on after a 10-minute act on a side stage. He was about to walk up the ramp to the stage when it was discovered that the hard disc of his synclavier, carrying all 25 minutes of synthesised music for his act, was missing. He said he could not play without it, turned round, walked down the ramp crying, with his band and other members of his entourage following him, and out of the stadium. There was an urgent need to fill the gap he had left and Tracy Chapman, who had already performed her act, agreed to appear again. The two appearances shot her to stardom, with two songs from her recently released first album: \\"Fast Car\\" and \\"Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution\\". Before the concert, she had sold about 250,000 albums. In the following two weeks, she was said to have sold two million. Wonder returned to the stadium, but turned down the request to use the same equipment as the present act on the main stage, Whitney Houston. Other members of the band said they would use other people's equipment. Finally, with time running out, Wonder agreed. Houston finished with three encores and the next act, Salt-N-Pepa, started on the side stage using three minutes and 30 seconds of pre-approved stage time. Following Salt- N-Pepa's performance, there was no announcement, no sound from the main stage until, out of the darkness, came the opening lines of \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" and a huge roar from the audience. The lights came on and Wonder went into the rest of the set. With the loss of the programmed hard disc, he shouted the change of notes to the band. Resonant music The concert included several well-known protest songs and others which received an added resonance from the occasion. The songs included: *\\"Free Nelson Mandela\\" by Jerry Dammers *\\"Biko\\" by Peter Gabriel *\\"They Dance Alone\\" by Sting *\\"Sun City\\" by Steven Van Zandt *\\"Mandela Day\\" by Simple Minds *\\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" by Stevie Wonder *\\"Amazing Grace\\", sung by Jessye Norman *\\"I've Gotta Get a Message to You\\" by The Bee Gees Funding and organisation The initial funding for Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute came from Hollingsworth and, specifically, from the money that he had put into the production company, Elephant House, set up with television producer Neville Bolt. But the money amounted only \\"to 75 per cent of what was needed as a minimum\\". Funding to help pay the deposit on Wembley Stadium came from a trade-union loan organised by the Anti-Apartheid Movement. Wembley agreed to the unusual procedure of handing over ticket revenue as soon as it came in, and some television companies agreed to pay rights fees earlier than usual (although the BBC did not pay cash but provided facilities). Although the aim of the day was to raise consciousness about South Africa and Mandela, the event also made a profit of $5 million. One half went to the AAM to cover its costs, including a protest march the following day; and one half to seven charities named by Archbishop Huddleston on condition that none of the money went towards the purchase of armaments. The seven charities were: Oxfam, Christian Aid, War on Want, Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, Save the Children, Bishop Ambrose Reeves Trust and the International Defence and Aid Fund. With the charities in mind, a company, Freedom Productions, was set up to which the artists rights were assigned. Rights in the event are held by Tribute Inspirations Limited. Postscript The estimated audience for the Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute of 600 million in 67 countries was arguably an underestimate in that several broadcasters in Africa were given a free licence. However, the apartheid government did not allow the event to be broadcast in South Africa. But news of the event and its popularity reached Mandela and other political prisoners. In time, the strong ripple effect is thought to have increased pressure on the government to release Mandela, and it became increasingly likely that he would be released, albeit 20 months after the concert and 27 years after he was put in prison. Shortly before Mandela's release, Hollingsworth, Terry and Mandela's lawyer sat down in London to plan another broadcast event to celebrate Mandela's release and to call for the end of Apartheid. Performers and speakers Further appearances included Grupo Experimental de Dansa, H. B. Barnum, Mark Kelly, and Ray Lema. Australian comedy act The Doug Anthony Allstars were meant to perform, but a part of the set collapsed and they were unable to.

Plot introduction It is an insider's perspective of the medical world. As Dr. Peters becomes a doctor he is destroying himself as a person due to extensive work and concerns. Dr. Cook began writing the book while serving on a submarine, basing it on his experiences as a medical resident. When it did not do particularly well, he began an extensive study of other books in the genre to see what made a bestseller. He decided to concentrate on medical suspense thrillers, mixing intricately plotted murder and intrigue with medical technology. He also brought controversial ethical and social issues affecting the medical profession to the attention of the general public. = Plot Summary = Dr. Peters receives a phone call from a nurse, who sounds desperate, but Dr. Peters can do little. He has forgotten when he last slept, but he knows that in the coming hours he will make life or death decisions.

It was created after an earthquake struck on August 17, 1959, killing 28 people. Quake Lake is deep and long. US 287 follows the lake and offers glimpses of the effects of the earthquake and landslide, and a visitor center is just off the road. The lake is mostly within Gallatin National Forest. The earthquake The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter magnitude scale (revised by USGS to 7.3) and caused an 80-million ton landslide, which formed a landslide dam on the Madison River. The earthquake was the most powerful to hit the state of Montana in historic times. The landslide traveled down the north flank of Sheep Mountain, at an estimated , killing 28 people who were camping along the shores of Hebgen Lake and downstream along the Madison River. Upstream the faulting caused by the earthquake forced the waters of Hebgen Lake to shift violently. A seiche, a wave effect created by wind, atmospheric pressure, or seismic activity on water, crested over Hebgen Dam, causing cracks and erosion. The earthquake created fault scarps up to high in the area near Hebgen Lake and the lake bottom itself dropped the same distance. of the area near Hebgen Lake subsided more than . Several geysers in the northwestern sections in Yellowstone National Park erupted and numerous hot springs became temporarily muddied. Within the immediate vicinity of the earthquake and resultant landslide, a few dozen cabins and homes were destroyed. Overall damages to buildings and roads were minor with damage costs placed at 11 million dollars in 1959. Aftershocks up to 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale continued for several months. At the time, the quake was the second largest to occur in the continental US during the 20th century. Hebgen Dam and creation of the lake Hebgen Dam, built in 1917, is a concrete core and rock fill faced structure that sustained severe damage but continued to hold. Repairs were completed on the dam spillway in a few weeks. The landslide, which occurred downstream from the dam, blocked almost all the flow of the Madison River which began to fill in the void upstream from the slide. In less than a month, the waters had created what is now known as Quake Lake. The lack of a reliable water outlet for this new lake forced one of the largest mobilizations of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ever commenced in the western U.S. Before the new landslide was breached by the quickly rising waters, a spillway was constructed to ensure erosion and potential failure of the natural dam would be minimized. Visitors center Memorial for the victims from the 1959 earthquake at the Earthquake Lake Visitor Center In 1967, the U.S. Forest Service's Earthquake Lake Visitor Center opened its doors for the first season of operation. The center provides interpretive services for more than 50,000 visitors annually. The center provides a panoramic view of the mountain that fell and the lake that was formed. This facility hosts interpretive displays on earthquakes, plate tectonics, and a working seismograph. It is located in Custer Gallatin National Forest.

He was a student of a well-known Russian psychologist and philosopher George Chelpanov, a follower of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, who introduced Husserlian phenomenology to Russia, modifying the phenomenology which he found in Husserl. Shpet was a Vice president of the Russian State Academy of Arts in Moscow (1923‚Äî1929). Shpet is an author of many books, including his famous A View on the History of Russian philosophy (; in 2 vols.) and The Hermeneutics and its problems ().  Biography  Shpet enrolled in St. Vladimir University of Kiev in 1898, but was expelled for joining a Marxist circle. He never adopted a Marxist philosophical viewpoint, even though he sympathised with the socio-economic aims of Marxism. As a thinker, he was thoroughly grounded in Russian religious thought of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His philosophy combined Husserl's analysis of the structure of consciousness with Platonism of Orthodoxy, the doctrine of incarnation, and veneration of matter. In 1921 he founded the Institute of Scientific Philosophy in Moscow. His espousal of Husserl's phenomenology influenced the literary scholars Michail Petrovskij, Grigorij Vinokur, and Michail Stoljarov.  Death  Shpet was a victim of the Great Purge. He was originally arrested on 14 March 1935, along with several other former colleagues from the State Academy. He was charged with anti-soviet activities, received a sentence of five years internal exile, and was sent to Tomsk, the first university city in Siberia. Here Shpet worked on a new Russian translation of Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit. However, he was arrested again on 27 October 1937 and charged with belonging to a monarchist organisation. He was executed on 16 November 1937.

A revived Naugles chain was established in 2015 by entrepreneur Christian Ziebarth, after it was ruled that the trademarks had been abandoned by the original company's successor, Del Taco. History Naugles was founded by former Del Taco partner Dick Naugle. The first Naugles restaurant was located at the southwest corner of 14th St. and Brockton Avenue, in Riverside, California (now a Del Taco) in 1970. Naugle's motto was \\"Prepare food fresh. Serve customer fast. Keep place clean!\\" Harold Butler purchased Naugles in 1979 when the chain consisted of three restaurants. The chain was expanded by a system of non-exclusive franchises, which later was ruled unlawful by a federal court. Butler built Naugles up to 275 restaurants by 1984, when he sold the chain to Collins Foods International. Naugles merged with Del Taco in 1988 when businessman Anwar Soliman purchased both companies at nearly the same time. A few of the Naugles menu items, such as those with the \\"Macho\\" designation, found their way into the regular Del Taco menu. Also, the Naugles Taco Sandwich (Del Taco called it a \\"bun taco\\") can still be ordered from Del Taco even though it does not appear as an item listed on the menu. Later in May 1989, Soliman announced that he was going to convert most of the 171 Naugles locations to Del Taco by the end of that summer. Link via ProQuest. By the time Soliman sold the integrated company in January 1990 to a four-member group of Del Taco managers led by President Wayne W. Armstrong, there were 59 Naugles left with 25 located in California and 34 located in Utah, Nevada, Missouri and Arizona with 290 Del Tacos in California plus a lone Del Taco in Arizona. In August 1992, only 31 Naugles in the states of Utah, Nevada, Missouri, and Illinois remained with all the locations in California had been converted. Link via ProQuest. In March 1994, Del Taco converted seven of 8 remaining Naugles locations in Nevada to the Del Taco brand. The last Naugles to close in Nevada was in 1995, in Carson City, Nevada. That Hwy 50 Naugles Carson City location was not converted to a Del Taco, but in late 1995 became a Carson City Restaurant called China East. Del Taco stated that the Nevada conversions led to a great increase in sales at those locations. Seven months later, Del Taco announced it had completed converting all six remaining Naugles locations in the state of Utah in October 1994. Link via ProQuest. In December 1994, Del Taco announced that they have finished converting all four Naugles in the metropolitan St. Louis area. Link via ProQuest. According to the 1994 article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the four Naugles locations in St. Louis were the last sites that were converted to Del Taco. The last four remaining Naugles locations, all in Nevada, closed in 1994‚Äì1995. In the Las Vegas area, 3 restaurants closed circa 1994/95. The last Naugles location, in Carson City Nevada, on Hwy 50 East, closed in 1995. Revival In August 2006, blogger Christian Ziebarth posted a remembrance page on his year old Orange County Mexican Restaurants blog site on how he missed the defunct Naugles restaurant chain and wanted Del Taco to bring back some of the old but unique Naugles food items. In a short time, he received comments from hundreds of others who felt the same. So much interest was generated by his webpage that a Del Taco public relations staffer contacted Ziebarth to see how Del Taco could take advantage of this renewed interest. On May 31, 2012, the Orange County Register reported that a group was attempting to revive the Naugles brand. On July 9, 2013, the OC Weekly ran a similar story, with the author of the piece mentioning he had tried some Naugles taco sauce. On March 31, 2015, Christian Ziebarth (President), Josh Maxwell (CEO) and Dan Dvorak (CMO) won the judgment from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, allowing the restaurant to return to life as a new spot in Fountain Valley, California. In the years since first applying to take up the Naugles trademark and menu (back in 2010), Ziebarth, Maxwell and Dvorak went on to re-create the original menu and its flavors from scratch, hosting pop-up dinners at various locations to further gather ground support. Ziebarth, Maxwell and Dvorak decided to open a \\"test\\" kitchen to help shape the brand and on July 25, 2015, the Fountain Valley location had a \\"soft opening\\" primarily for fans from an unofficial Facebook fan page. The current menu includes bean and cheese burritos, hard and soft-shelled tacos, cups of beans, drinks, and more. The Naugles location is at 18471 Mt. Langley Street in Fountain Valley. The Fountain Valley location did a soft opening on Saturday July 28, 2015 and was overwhelmed by the fans response resulting in running out of food a few times during the day and decided to close the next day (Sunday). They opened back up Monday, again,ran out of food and closed early to prepare enough food for the apparent demand and opened back up Tuesday July 28, 2015. The Fountain Valley location went seven days a week for the following two weeks and decided to only be open on the weekends due to the neighbors being a bit concerned with the high traffic and limited parking. The Test Kitchen held these hours until May 28, 2016. It then closed for revamping until it re-opened October 2016 and has been open seven days a week from 8 AM to 8 PM since. The revived Naugles opened its first daily operating location at 21351 Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach on May 28, 2016, taking over a former Wahoo's Fish Taco across from the Waterfront Hilton. The initial lease was for the summer of 2016. At the end of this time, Josh Maxwell (CEO) said he would evaluate the performance of the operation at this location before deciding to renew the lease. The lease was renewed and has served as a great beach front seasonal location to date. On January 25, 2020, A third location was opened at 12120 Beach Blvd, Stanton, Ca, after months of preparation and conversion from the old restaurant that was on that site, The Mad Greek. It is the first of the revived chains to have a Drive Thru and the first drive thru in Orange County since the last Naugles was converted to Del Taco in 1990. This soft opening had an overwhelming response on the first day. Stanton is in a \\"soft opening\\" period and 7 AM to 11 PM will be the temporary daily schedule until the Grand Opening which will be announced soon. Stanton is generating plenty of nostalgic memories and new fans of the menu as is referenced by the Naugles fan club group on Facebook. In popular culture In the original Naugles TV commercials, the character of Se√±or Naugles was played by two successive character actors, Roger C. Carmel and comedian Avery Schreiber.

The Supreme Council overthrew the Second Republic of Korea in the May 16 coup in May 1961 and established a provisional military government composed largely of officers who were involved in or supportive of the coup. The Supreme Council was headed by the Chairman, the de facto head of government with dictatorial powers, while President Yun Posun was retained as a figurehead. The Supreme Council prioritized South Korea's economic development and political stability, suspending the National Assembly and most political freedoms, and founding the Korean Central Intelligence Agency to combat pro-North Korean and other anti- government activity. Park Chung-hee served as Chairman of the Supreme Council from July 1961 until his victory in the 1963 South Korean presidential election, and the Supreme Council was dissolved upon the inauguration of the Third Republic of Korea in December 1963. History =Background= The First Republic of Korea was established on 15 August 1948 following the transfer of power from the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) to the Government of South Korea, becoming the first independent government of South Korea. The First Republic had a highly-centralized government under President Syngman Rhee, who maintained autocratic power as the President of South Korea, and was widely viewed as authoritarian and corrupt. Rhee's government was characterized by widespread cronyism and indifference to South Korea's economic development. Until the late 1950s, Rhee's unpopularity and corruption was largely tolerated by the South Korea public for the sake of political unity, and as a staunch anti-communist, had crushed open opposition to his regime using the threat of communism as an excuse. In April 1960, Rhee was eventually overthrown in mass protests known as the April Revolution, started in response to the murder of a student killed by police during earlier protests against election rigging. Rhee's former political opponents in the Democratic Party established the Second Republic of Korea, with new parliamentary system of government, and dominated the National Assembly following elections. The Second Republic was led by Chang Myon as Prime Minister of South Korea, a position which held most of the power, and was headed by Yun Bo-seon as President, now a largely ceremonial role. The new government attempted to fix the issues left behind by Rhee, but proved to be ineffective, and caused the political instability of the First Republic to continue. =May 16 coup= Many high-ranking figures of the South Korean military held animosity for so-called \\"liberation aristocrats\\" ‚Äì the ruling class of conservative politicians involved in the Korean independence movement and the USAMGIK ‚Äì that they blamed for the stalling of development in South Korea. Military figures noted how South Korea had been intensively developed under the Japanese colonial system and the \\"economic miracle\\" occurring in Japan, in marked contrast to Rhee's presidency which saw little significant effort to develop the economy, which remained stagnant, poor and largely agrarian. The lack of development under Rhee provoked a growing nationalistic intellectual reaction which called for a radical restructuring of society and a thorough political and economic reorganization, rejecting the model being pursued by the governing elite. General Chang Do-yong served as the first Chairman of the Supreme Council from May to July 1961. Park Chung-hee, a Major General in the Republic of Korea Army with decidedly ambiguous political leanings, was heavily influenced by this unfolding intellectual reaction. Park became the leader of a reformist faction within the military that plotted a coup d'etat against the civilian government of the Second Republic on 12 May 1961. The plot was aborted after being leaked, however, the military attempted another coup four days later on 16 May which was successful, dissolving the Second Republic. They proceeded to broadcast a proclamation outlining the policy objectives of the coup, including anti-communism, strengthening of ties with the United States, the elimination of political corruption, the construction of an autonomous national economy, Korean reunification, and the removal of the present generation of politicians. Park and his supporters subsequently established the Military Revolutionary Committee as a military junta government, later renamed the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction. President Yun Posun, who had sided with the coup, was retained in his position as a figurehead. General Chang Do-yong, the Army Chiefs of Staff, was installed as the Chairman of the Supreme Council, while Park became the Vice-Chairman. However, the power struggles within the Supreme Council allowed Park to engineer the gradual transfer of power from Chang to himself. In July, Park officially replaced Chang as Chairman, effectively becoming the de facto dictator of Korea. =Dissolution= By 1962, Park and the Supreme Council were coming under increasing pressure by the United States administration of President John F. Kennedy to return to civilian rule, as military leaders had promised to return the government to a democratic system as soon as possible. On December 2, 1962, a referendum was held on returning to a presidential system of rule, which was allegedly passed with a 78% majority.Yonhap (2004, p. 271). In response, Park eventually abdicated from his military position to be eligible to run as a civilian in the upcoming presidential election, despite he and the other military leaders pledging not to run for office. Park narrowly won in the presidential election of October 1963, and replaced Yun Posun as the President of Korea. The Supreme Council was officially dissolved upon the inauguration of the Third Republic of Korea on 17 December 1963, ending the three-year constitutional vacuum. Economy The Supreme Council prioritized the economic development of South Korea and was the first South Korean government to introduce economic planning, with the first South Korean five-year plan inaugurated in 1962. Although the Second Republic had laid the groundwork for such economic plans, it had not been able to put them into practice due to the May 16 coup. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade enacted policies to encourage and promote export. Currency reform reduced the exchange rate of the South Korean won, mainly to prevent money laundering by fraudsters who hid large amounts of money and to weaken the economic influence of Overseas Chinese investors on the South Korean economy. In late 1963, the Supreme Council began the program with the government of West Germany to recruit South Korean nurses and miners as Gastarbeiter. The costs of the nurses and miners sent to West Germany were largely paid for by the South Korean government, with only their wages and some language services paid for by their employers in West Germany. The Gastarbeiter South Koreans have since been argued as a major cause of South Korea's rapid economic growth in the late 20th century. Diplomacy South Korean-United States relations were damaged by Park's coup and his military administration was met with instant disapproval from the United States. Park himself had suffered from suspicions of being a communist both at home and abroad due to his political history. Park had previously been sentenced to death in November 1948 after being arrested on charges that he led a communist cell in the Korean constabulary, but his sentence was commuted by several high-ranking military officers. Park had been a member of the Workers' Party of South Korea, the communist party responsible for the Jeju Uprising, and was involved in the left-wing Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion. Park's left-wing history, combined with his history as a Japanese-trained officer in the Manchukuo Imperial Army, the military of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, led many to question his true intentions despite the Supreme Council's publicly anti-communist stances. Park visited the United States in 1961 and attempted to persuade President Kennedy to approve his regime, but was instead encouraged to quickly restore civilian rule in South Korea.

Pavel Hristov) on the left flank, 4th Preslav Infantry Division (major-gen. Kliment Boyadzhiev) in the centre and 6th Bdin Infantry Division (major-gen. Pravoslav Tenev) on the right flank. By the end of the day 6th Division captured the town of Lule Burgas. With the arrival of First Army on the battlefield the following day, attacks continued along the entire front but were met with fierce resistance and even limited counter-attacks by the Ottomans. Heavy and bloody battles occurred on the next two days and the casualties were high on both sides. At the cost of heavy losses, the Bulgarian Fourth and 5th Division managed to push the Ottomans back and gained 5 km of land in their respective sectors of the frontline on 30 October. The Bulgarians continued to push the Ottomans on the entire front. The 6th division managed to breach the Ottoman lines on the right flank. After another two days of fierce combat, the Ottoman defence collapsed and on the night of 2 November the Ottoman forces began a full retreat along the entire frontline. The Bulgarians again didn't immediately follow the retreating Ottoman forces and lost contact with them, which allowed the Ottoman army to take up positions on the √áatalca defence line just 30 km west of Constantinople. There were a large number of journalists who reported on the Battle of Lule Burgas, whose accounts provide rich details about this event.

The Second Republic was founded during the April Revolution mass protests against President Syngman Rhee, succeeding the First Republic and establishing a parliamentary government under President Yun Bo-seon and Prime Minister Chang Myon. The Second Republic ended Rhee's authoritarianism and repression, formed a liberal democracy, and formulated the first Five-Year Plans to develop the neglected economy. The Second Republic's failure to improve South Korea's political and economic issues led to instability, and after thirteen months it was overthrown by the South Korean Army in the May 16 coup led by Park Chung-hee. The Second Republic was replaced by a provisional military government under the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction, leading to the Third Republic of Korea. The short-lived Second Republic was the only government under a parliamentary system in the history of Korea.  Establishment  Proclamation of the Second Republic of Korea. From right: Chang Myon (Prime Minister), Yun Bo-seon (President), Paik Nak-jun (President of the House of Councillors) and Kwak Sang-hoon (President of the Chamber of Deputies) The First Republic of Korea had existed since 1948 under President Syngman Rhee, who was widely considered to be corrupt and a dictator who abused his presidential powers to maintain his rule and cronyism. Although the First Republic was officially a representative democracy, Rhee adopted a strongly anti-communist position and used the threat of communism to enact a policy of severe repression against all political opposition. Tolerance of Rhee and his Liberal Party-dominated government declined in the mid-to-late 1950s, as the South Korean public were increasingly discontent with the repression and the limited economic and social development. In April 1960, Rhee was overthrown by widespread protests known as the \\"April Revolution\\" in response to the discovery of a high school student murdered by police during demonstrations against Rhee and rigged election in March. After Rhee's fall, power was briefly held by a caretaker government headed by Heo Jeong as Prime Minister until a new parliamentary election was held on 29 July 1960. The Second Republic operated under a parliamentary system, with the Prime Minister of South Korea as the head of government and the President of South Korea as the head of state. Due to Rhee's numerous abuses of power, the President's power was greatly reduced, to the point that he was effectively a figurehead. He was elected by both houses of the legislature. Real power was vested in the Prime Minister, who was elected by the National Assembly. The Second Republic was the first and the only instance of the South Korean government using a cabinet system instead of a presidential system. The Democratic Party, which had been in the opposition during the First Republic, easily gained power. and Rhee's former opponent Chang Myon became Prime Minister. The new legislature was bicameral, with the House of Commons as the lower house and the Senate as the upper house. Yun Bo-seon was elected as the second President of South Korea on 13 August 1960. Real power now rested with the Prime Minister and cabinet, who were both elected by the National Assembly.  Politics  = Freedom = The Second Republic repealed the severe curbs on political expression that had been in place under the Rhee regime, and as a result, freedom returned and an increase in political activity. Much of this activity was from leftist and student groups, which had been instrumental in the overthrow of the First Republic. Membership of unions and activity grew rapidly during the later months of 1960. Estimates suggest around 2,000 demonstrations were held during eight months of the Second Republic. Under pressure from the left-wing, the Chang government carried out a series of purges of military and police officials who had been involved in anti- democratic activities or corruption during the First Republic. A special law to this effect was passed on 31 October 1960. Around 40,000 people were placed under investigation; of these, more than 2,200 government officials and 4,000 police officers were purged. In addition, the government considered reducing the size of the South Korean Army by 100,000, although this plan was shelved. = Economy = The Second Republic government was faced with mounting instability in economic terms as well, seeing unemployment and wholesale prices also rose during this period. The won lost half of its value against the US dollar between fall 1960 and spring 1961. The government formulated a five-year economic plan based around agriculture and light industry to decrease unemployment, although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown. = Foreign relations = Chang's government resumed negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan, which had not progressed under the Rhee regime that had existed since the end of Japanese rule. The Second Republic established diplomatic relations with many new countries, with Sohn Won-yil, the first ambassador to West Germany, attending the independence ceremonies of Cameroon, Togo, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, and Morocco.  Dissolution  The Second Republic suffered from numerous political, economic, and social issues that were both new and inherited from the First Republic. Failure to properly address the issues caused a growth in political instability as factional fighting within the Democratic Party, combined with the increasing activity from opposition and activist groups, led to a breakdown in South Korean politics. = May 16 coup = Many high-ranking figures of the South Korean military held animosity for so-called \\"liberation aristocrats\\" ‚Äì the ruling class of conservative politicians involved in the Korean independence movement and United States Army Military Government ‚Äì that they blamed for the stalling of development in South Korea. Military figures noted how South Korea had been intensively developed under the Japanese colonial system and the \\"economic miracle\\" occurring in Japan, in marked contrast to Rhee's presidency which saw little significant effort to develop the economy, which remained stagnant, poor and largely agrarian. The lack of development under Rhee provoked a growing nationalistic intellectual reaction which called for a radical restructuring of society and a thorough political and economic reorganization, rejecting the model being pursued by the governing elite. Park Chung-hee, a Major General in the Republic of Korea Army with decidedly ambiguous political leanings, was heavily influenced by this unfolding intellectual reaction. Park became the leader of a reformist faction within the military that plotted a coup d'etat against the civilian government of the Second Republic on 12 May 1961. The plot was aborted after being leaked, however, the military attempted another coup four days later on 16 May which was successful, dissolving the Second Republic. They proceeded to broadcast a proclamation outlining the policy objectives of the coup, including anti-communism, strengthening of ties with the United States, the elimination of political corruption, the construction of an autonomous national economy, Korean reunification, and the removal of the present generation of politicians. Park and his supporters subsequently established the Military Revolutionary Committee as a military junta government, later renamed the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction. Park became the de facto dictator of South Korea as the Chairman of the Council, while Yun Bo-seon remained President as a figurehead.

Background and first marriage He was born in July 1756, the posthumous son of Captain Hon. John Hamilton and his wife Harriet, and grandson of James Hamilton, 7th Earl of Abercorn, and baptized at St George's, Hanover Square. He was educated at Harrow from 1770 to 1771. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 15 June 1773, but did not remain there long; he was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge on 30 July 1773. He matriculated at Michaelmas and received his MA in 1776. There he became the friend of William Pitt the Younger, a connection that would serve him well in later years. He married Catherine Copley (died 13 September 1791), daughter of Sir Joseph Copley, 1st Baronet, on 20 June 1779 at St Marylebone. They had five children: *Lady Harriet Margaret Hamilton (1780‚Äì1803), died unmarried. *Lady Maria Hamilton (1782‚Äì1814), died unmarried. *Lady Catherine Elizabeth Hamilton (1784‚Äì1812), married George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen and had issue. *James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton (1786‚Äì1814), married Harriet Douglas, granddaughter of James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton and had issue. *Lord Claud Hamilton (1787‚Äì1808), died unmarried. House of Commons Hamilton went abroad in about 1781, and returned in the late summer of 1783. Through the influence of John Buller, his wife's uncle, he was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for East Looe in December, taking the seat vacated by William Graves. His maiden speech was in opposition to the East India Bill of the Fox-North Coalition. He was naturally a supporter of his friend Pitt's first ministry. At the 1784, he was put in for St Germans, another Cornish borough, by his half-brother Edward Eliot. Though deeply attached to Pitt, he possessed great independence of character, and something of his uncle's stiff pride. A staunch supporter of Warren Hastings, he spoke in 1788 against a bill to regulate (and thereby sanction) the slave trade, and in favor of its abolition. On 9 October 1789, he succeeded his childless uncle as Earl of Abercorn, and entered the House of Lords as Viscount Hamilton. House of Lords He was created 1st Marquess of Abercorn on 15 October 1790, doubtless due to his political connections. His first wife died in 1791, and he married his first cousin, Lady Cecil Hamilton, daughter of Rev. Hon. George Hamilton, on 4 March 1792. She was granted a Royal Warrant of Precedence on 27 October 1789 to assume the precedence of an earl's daughter, through his influence with Pitt; Sir Nathaniel Wraxall suggests that she was Hamilton's mistress before the death of his first wife, and that George III was very reluctant to make out the warrant. They had one child: Cecil Frances Hamilton (1795-1860) (Thomas Lawrence, 1804) *Lady Cecil Frances Hamilton (19 July 1795 ‚Äì 7 July 1860), married William Howard, 4th Earl of Wicklow and had issue. He was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland on 7 February 1794. Most of the Abercorn lands were in Ireland, and the Marquess made great efforts to build a voting bloc in the Irish Parliament from County Donegal and County Tyrone, although with relatively little success. His marriage to Lady Cecil was not a success; they separated in 1798 and were divorced by Act of Parliament in April 1799. The next month, she married Joseph Copley, the brother of Abercorn's first wife. Abercorn married Lady Anne Jane Gore (1763‚Äì1827), daughter of Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran, on 3 April 1800. He was invested as a Knight of the Garter on 17 January 1805. George W. E. Russell provided the following sketch of his aristocratic character: > This admirable nobleman always went out shooting in his Blue Ribbon, and > required his housemaids to wear white kid gloves when they made his bed. > Before he married his first cousin, Miss Cecil Hamilton, he induced the > Crown to confer on her the titular rank of an Earl's daughter, that he might > not marry beneath his position; and, when he discovered that she > contemplated eloping, he sent a message begging her to take the family > coach, as it ought never to be said that Lady Abercorn left her husband's > roof in a hack chaise.George W. E. Russell, Collections & Recollections > (Revised edition, Smith Elder & Co, London, 1899), at page 77.

The group's subsidiaries include Econet Mobile Networks Group, Liquid Telecom, Cassava SmarTech, Distributed Power Africa, Vaya Africa and Technites Africa. History Econet was created in 1993 in Zimbabwe by Strive Masiyiwa. Initially it was meant to be called \\"Enhanced Communications Network\\" but was later abbreviated to Econet. In 1998, Econet was granted a telephony licence, at a time when 70% of the country inhabitants had never heard a ringtone. In 2005, Econet developed a mobile payment system to help NGOs make cash transfers to refugees after the Burundi war. The model was extended and integrated in Econet's technology, along with a credit solution. EcoCash was officially launched in 2011 and is operated by Econet Enterprises. Within 18 months of its launch, 31% of Zimbabwe's adult population registered to the service. By November 2017, the service had over 6.7 million registered users, accounting for 80% of adult Zimbabweans or 52% of all citizens. In February 2013, Econet acquired a controlling interest in the then TN Bank Zimbabwe, one of the local commercial banks in Zimbabwe, and renamed it Steward Bank. The bank, whose shares were previously listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), were delisted when it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Econet. In October 2014, Econet acquired VimpelCom's Telecel in Burundi (U-COM) and Telecel in the Central African Republic (Telecel RCA) for $65 million. In 2014, the listed Econet Wireless Zimbabwe announced a 14.7% drop in annual profits, from $140 million down to $119 million. In October 2015, due to dropping profits, following a state regulator-enforced tariff reduction, the company announced a 100-employee layoff to cope with the losses. In 2015, due to increasing losses, the group imposed a 20 percent salary cut to its employees in Zimbabwe, and negotiated a 15 percent discount with its suppliers, even though its service EcoCash continues to prosper in the country. In June 2015, despite the economic turmoil, the company distributed $15 million in dividends to shareholders. The group Econet is a privately owned group and is not listed on any stock exchange. One of its subsidiaries, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, is listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) and its activities are confined only to the Zimbabwe market.

It was released for DMA-capable 8\\" floppy, extended memory addressing hardware (software controlled 4KiB paging of up to 768 KiB RAM SWTPC S/09 Dynamic Address Translation), Motorola 6809 based computers. Examples included machines from SWTPC, GIMIX and Goupil (France). On SWTPC machines, UniFLEX also supported a 20 MB, 14\\" hard drive (OEM'd from Century Data Systems) in 1979. Later on, it also supported larger 14\\" drives (up to 80 MB), 8\\" hard drives, and 5-1/4\\" floppies. In 1982 other machines also supported the first widely available 5-1/4\\" hard disks using the ST506 interface such as the 5 MB BASF 6182 and the removable SyQuest SQ306RD of the same capacity. Due to the limited address space of the 6809 (64 kB) and hardware limitations, the main memory space for the UniFLEX kernel as well as for any running process had to be smaller than 56 kB (code + data)(processes could be up to 64K minus 512 bytes). This was achieved by writing the kernel and most user space code entirely in assembly language, and by removing a few classic Unix features, such as group permissions for files. Otherwise, UniFLEX was very similar to Unix Version 7, though some command names were slightly different. There was no technical reason for the renaming apart from achieving some level of command-level compatibility with its single-user sibling FLEX. By simply restoring the Unix style names, a considerable degree of \\"Unix Look & Feel\\" could be established, though due to memory limitations the command line interpreter (shell) was less capable than the Bourne Shell known from Unix Version 7. Memory management included swapping to a dedicated portion of the system disk (even on floppies) but only whole processes could be swapped in and out, not individual pages. This caused swapping to be a very big hit on system responsiveness, so memory had to be sized appropriately. However UniFLEX was an extremely memory-efficient operating system. Machines with less than a megabyte of RAM serving a dozen asynchronous terminals were not uncommon and worked surprisingly well. TSC never bundled a C compiler with UniFLEX for the 6809, though they produced one. But in the early 1980s a C language implementation became available as a 3rd party products (the \\"McCosh\\" and \\"Introl\\" compilers). Using such a C compiler could establish source-level compatibility with Unix Version 7, i.e., a number of Unix tools and applications could be ported to UniFLEX - if size allowed: Unix on a PDP-11 limited executables to 64 kB of code and another 64 kB of data, while the UniFLEX limitation was approximately 56 kB for both, code and data together. Not much application software was available for UniFLEX. Ports of the Dynacalc spreadsheet and the Stylograph word processor from the FLEX operating system existed but only very few copies were sold. In the mid 1980s a successor version for the Motorola 68000 was announced. Though it removed the pressing space limitations, it was not commercially successful because it had to compete with source-code ports of original Unix. The source code for UniFLEX and supporting software is available on the Internet. In the Netherlands, UniFLEX users ported a fair number of Unix utilities to UniFLEX. Also they modified some kernel code that give foreground processes preference over background processes accessing disk and that gave a major improvement in user experience. One of the TSC guys, Dan Vanada, later started his company \\"Scintillex Software\\". Its products were, for example, utilities that allowed transfer of data between UniFLEX and MS-DOS and vice versa, as well DOS format utilities, and a code patch utility.

The first match featured Chelsea v Newcastle United.Sky announce Premiership Plus Channel Sky press release The name Premiership Plus had run throughout the 2001‚Äì02, 2002‚Äì03 and 2003‚Äì04 seasons before being shortened to PremPlus for the beginning of the 2004‚Äì05 season. Also, from the start of 2004‚Äì05, PremPlus showed 50 live PPV matches, an increase of 10 compared to previous seasons. Matches could be purchased simply by telephone or, in later seasons, interactively through the TV, and a season ticket for all matches in a season was available at a substantial discount. There was a PremPlus 2 channel, but was only shown on NTL. It closed when PremPlus stopped broadcasting in 2007. In 2006, PremPlus HD launched with the other HD channels on Sky. It was replaced by Sky Sports HDX when PremPlus stopped broadcasting. PremPlus failed to live up to Sky's expectations as few British football fans were willing to pay for individual matches on top of paying a monthly subscription for other matches. After six seasons on air it closed down at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, when EU competition laws forced Sky to break its monopoly on the Premier League, having broadcast 270 matches live and exclusive from the Premier League.

He practices general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. He is a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Samuel O. Thier Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. In public health, he is executive director of Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation, and chairman of Lifebox, a nonprofit that works on reducing deaths in surgery globally. On June 20, 2018, Gawande was named the CEO of healthcare venture Haven, owned by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JP Morgan Chase and stepped down as CEO in May 2020. He has written extensively on medicine and public health for The New Yorker and Slate, and is the author of the books Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science; Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance; The Checklist Manifesto; and Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. Early years and education Gawande was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Indian immigrants to the United States, both doctors. His family soon moved to Athens, Ohio, where he and his sister grew up, and he graduated from Athens High School in 1983. Gawande earned a bachelor's degree in biology and political science from Stanford University in 1987. As a Rhodes Scholar, he earned an M.A. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from Balliol College, Oxford in 1989. He graduated with a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard Medical School in 1995, and earned a Master of Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1999. He completed his general surgical residency training, again at Harvard, in 2003. Political career As an undergraduate, Gawande was a volunteer for Gary Hart's campaign. After graduating, he joined Al Gore's 1988 presidential campaign. He worked as a health-care researcher for Rep. Jim Cooper (D-TN), who was author of a \\"managed competition\\" health care proposal for the Conservative Democratic Forum. He entered medical school in 1990 ‚Äì leaving after two years to become Bill Clinton's healthcare lieutenant during the 1992 campaign. He later became a senior advisor in the Department of Health and Human Services after Clinton's inauguration. He directed one of the three committees of the Clinton Health Care Task Force, supervising 75 people and defined the benefits packages for Americans and subsidies and requirements for employers. He returned to medical school in 1993 and earned a medical degree in 1995. Journalism Soon after he began his residency, his friend Jacob Weisberg, editor of Slate, asked him to contribute to the online magazine. His pieces on the life of a surgical resident caught the eye of The New Yorker, which published several pieces by him before making him a staff writer in 1998. A June 2009 New Yorker essay by Gawande compared the health care of two towns in Texas to show why health care was more expensive in one town compared to the other. Using the town of McAllen, Texas, as an example, it argued that a corporate, profit-maximizing culture (which can provide substantial amounts of unnecessary care) was an important factor in driving up costs, unlike a culture of low-cost high- quality care as provided by the Mayo Clinic and other efficient health systems. The article \\"made waves\\" and was cited by President Barack Obama during Obama's attempt to get health care reform legislation passed by the United States Congress. According to Senator Ron Wyden, the article \\"affected [Obama's] thinking dramatically\\", and was shown to a group of senators by Obama, who effectively said, \\"This is what we've got to fix.\\" After reading the New Yorker article, Warren Buffett's long-time business partner Charlie Munger mailed a check to Gawande in the amount of $20,000 as a thank-you to Dr. Gawande for providing something so socially useful. Gawande returned the check and was subsequently sent a new check for $40,000. Gawande donated the $40,000 to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health. In addition to his popular writing, Gawande has published studies on topics including military surgery techniques and error in medicine, included in the New England Journal of Medicine. He is the director of the World Health Organization's Global Patient Safety Challenge. His essays have appeared in The Best American Essays 2003, The Best American Science Writing 2002, The Best American Science Writing 2009 and Best American Science and Nature Writing 2011. In 2012, he gave the TED talk \\"How Do We Heal Medicine?\\". The talk has been viewed over 1.9 million times. Books Gawande published his first book, Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science, in 2002. It was a National Book Award finalist, and has been published in over one hundred countries. His second book, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance, was released in April 2007. It discusses three virtues that Gawande considers to be most important for success in medicine: diligence, doing right, and ingenuity. Gawande offers examples in the book of people who have embodied these virtues. The book strives to present multiple sides of contentious medical issues, such as malpractice law in the US, physicians' role in capital punishment, and treatment variation between hospitals. Gawande released his third book, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, in 2009. It discusses the importance of organization and pre-planning (such as thorough checklists) in both medicine and the larger world. The Checklist Manifesto reached the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list in 2010. Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End was released in October 2014 and became a #1 New York Times bestseller. It discusses end of life choices about assisted living and the effect of medical procedures on terminally ill people. It challenges many traditionally held notions about the role of medicine. The book was the basis of a documentary for the PBS television series \\"Frontline\\" and was first broadcast on February 10, 2015.  Later career  In June 2018, he was named the CEO for the new, Boston-based company, Haven Healthcare, formed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He stepped down from the position in May 2020.  Awards and honors  In 2004, he was named one of the 20 Most Influential South Asians by Newsweek. In the 2010 Time 100, he was included (fifth place) in Thinkers Category. The same year, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers. In 2006, Gawande was named a MacArthur Fellow for his work investigating and articulating modern surgical practices and medical ethics. In 2007, he became director of the World Health Organization's effort to reduce surgical deaths,\\"Q&A; with Atul Gawande, Part 2\\" H&HN.; June 30, 2011.

It consists of nearly pure nitric acid (3). WFNA is commonly specified as containing no more than 2% water and less than 0.5% dissolved nitrogen dioxide or dinitrogen tetroxide. WFNA was sometimes used with an inhibitor compound to reduce corrosiveness, often hydrogen fluoride. Without inhibitors, WFNA will corrode nearly all structural metals. Inhibited WFNA is often called IWFNA. The hydrogen fluoride addition causes the formation of a protective layer of fluoride on the metal surfaces. WFNA as an oxidizer has somewhat less performance than red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) but is considerably safer (though extremely corrosive), as it has little to no dissolved nitrogen tetroxide, which is an extremely toxic and volatile chemical. If not inhibited, it will form nitrogen tetroxide on contact with most metals and some organic materials. RFNA can be converted to WFNA by simply leaving the RFNA out in low temperature for a couple of hours. WFNA was once used in the manufacture of nitroglycerin, an explosive, by mixing it with concentrated sulfuric acid, and then by the slow addition of glycerol. This has now mostly been replaced by a less expensive process that uses a nearly 1:1 solution of oleum and azeotropic nitric acid (70%). WFNA and IWFNA are hypergolic with a long list of other propellants, including: UDMH, hydrazine, furfuryl alcohol, and aniline.

It was excavated by Thomas Bateman in 1848 from a tumulus at the Benty Grange farm in Monyash in western Derbyshire. The grave had probably been looted by the time of Bateman's excavation, but still contained other high-status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial, such as the fragmentary remains of a hanging bowl. The helmet is displayed at Sheffield's Weston Park Museum, which purchased it from Bateman's estate in 1893. The helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather; the organic material has since decayed. It would have provided some protection against weapons, but was also ornate and may have been intended for ceremonial use. It was the first Anglo-Saxon helmet to be discovered; five others, from Sutton Hoo, York, Wollaston, Shorwell, and Staffordshire, have been found since. The helmet features a unique combination of structural and technical attributes, but contemporaneous parallels exist for its individual characteristics. It is classified as one of the \\"crested helmets\\" used in Northern Europe from the 6th to 11th centuries AD. The most striking feature of the helmet is the boar at its apex; this pagan symbol faces towards a Christian cross on the nasal in a display of syncretism. This is representative of 7th-century England when Christian missionaries were slowly converting Anglo-Saxons away from traditional Germanic mythology. The helmet seems to exhibit a stronger preference toward paganism, with a large boar and a small cross. The cross may have been added for talismanic effect, the help of any god being welcome on the battlefield. The boar atop the crest was likewise associated with protection and suggests a time when boar-crested helmets may have been common, as do the helmet from Wollaston and the Guilden Morden boar. The contemporary epic Beowulf mentions such helmets five times and speaks of the strength of men \\"when the hefted sword, its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood, razes the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet\\". Description Replica of the Benty Grange helmet at Weston Park Museum in Sheffield The Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn. It probably weighed about , the weight of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 replica. The framework, which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments, originally consisted of seven iron strips, each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick. A brow band, long and wide, encircled the head. Two strips of the same width ran from front to back, and from side to side. The long nose-to-nape band extended in the front and in the back; the extension over the nose was straight, whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards, so as to fit the nape of the wearer. The lateral band ran from ear to ear; both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band, but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection. It was affixed to the outside of the dexter (wearer's right) side of the brow band, the inside of the sinister (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-nape band. The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron, only one of which now survives. Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band from the centre of the lateral band. Here they were wide, and, while tapering towards a width of , rose at a 70¬∞ angle towards the lateral band, which they overlapped at a 50¬∞ angle just beneath the crest. The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth, since decayed. Eight plates of horn, probably softened and bent and suggested to be from cattle, were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame. No horn now survives, but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern. The plates were fitted over the iron, thereby hiding it, and abutted at the centre of each strip. The joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top. The three layers‚Äîiron at the bottom, followed by two layers of horn‚Äîwere held together by a succession of rivets: iron rivets placed from inside the helmet, and rivets made of, or coated in, silver, with ornamental heads in the shape of a double-headed axe, placed from the outside, apart. Traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose-to-nape band, and on the rear brow band, suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard. These suggest that pieces of horn, extending from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose-to-nape band, would have met each extension of the lateral band at a 5¬∞ angle, reaching them from the centre of the brow band. In addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet, two features provide added decoration: a cross on the nasal and a boar on the crest. The silver cross is long by wide, and consists of two parts. A silver strip was added underneath, elongating what was originally an equal-armed cross. It was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets, one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom. Around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty-nine silver studs, out of a suggested original forty, that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn. The most distinctive feature of the Benty Grange helmet is its boar, affixed to the apex of the helmet. The core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow D-sectioned bronze tubes, their flat sides approximately apart. The space between the two halves was filled in with a substance, likely horn or metal, which has now disintegrated; it perhaps projected upwards, forming the mane or spine of the boar, or, as has been interpreted on the replica, created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit. On either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron, forming the visible exterior of the boar. Four pear-shaped plates of gilded silver‚Äîcut down and filed from Roman silver, as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate, and file marks on the obverse‚Äîacted as hips, through which passed two silver rivets, one atop the other, per end. These rivets held together the five layers of the boar, and were welded to the plates. Into the body of the boar were placed holes, probably punched, that held circular silver studs approximately in diameter. The studs, likely flush with the surface of the body, were filed down and gilded, and may have been intended to represent golden bristles. Eyes were formed with long pointed oval garnets set into gold sockets with filigree wire edging. The sockets were long by wide, and had long shanks, filled with beeswax, sunk into the head. Individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail, tusks, muzzle, jawline, and ears of the boar, but few traces of them now remain. Two sets of iron legs‚Äîprobably solid originally, but rendered hollow by corrosion‚Äîattached the body to an elliptical bronze plate; both sets depict front legs, bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar's fore and hind limbs. The elliptical plate is long with a maximum width of , and matches the curvature of the helmet. Four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet, in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre. The plate was probably affixed directly to the frame, the legs passing through holes in the horn. Function The Benty Grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle, and indicated its wearer's status. As the Weston Park replica shows, it would have originally been an impressive object, and may have been intended for ceremonial use. Experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an axe, which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it. Arrows and spears pierced the horn, but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets. Helmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and the Benty Grange helmet, both by its richness and its scarcity, signified the high status of its owner. Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent. In the contemporary epic Beowulf, a poem about kings and nobles, they are relatively common, while the helmeted Vendel and Valsg√§rde graves from the same period in Sweden, thought to be the burials of wealthy non-royals, suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the √©lite. Yet thousands of furnished Anglo-Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare; this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition, but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers.  Discovery  = Location = Benty Grange Farm, near Monyash in the Derbyshire Dales The helmet was discovered in a barrow on the Benty Grange farm in Derbyshire, in what is now the Peak District National Park. Thomas Bateman, an archaeologist and antiquarian who led the excavation, described Benty Grange as \\"a high and bleak situation\\"; its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road, now the A515, possibly to display the burial to passing travellers. It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments, Arbor Low stone circle and Gib Hill barrow. The seventh-century Peak District was a small buffer state between Mercia and Northumbria, occupied, according to the Tribal Hidage, by the Anglo-Saxon Pecs√¶te. The area came under the fold of the Mercian kingdom around the eighth century; the Benty Grange and other rich barrows suggest that the Pecs√¶te may have had their own dynasty beforehand, but there is no written evidence for this. = Excavation = Bateman excavated the barrow on 3 May 1848. Although he did not mention it in his account, he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave. The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by , and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted. Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials, only one of which was discovered by Bateman. The barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately in diameter and high, an encircling fosse about wide and deep, and outer penannular earthworks around wide and high. The entire structure measures approximately . Bateman suggested a body once lay at its centre, flat against the original surface of the soil, of which little remained; what he described as the one remnant, strands of hair, is now thought to be from a cloak of fur, cowhide or something similar. The recovered objects were found in two clusters. One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair, the other about to the west. In the former area Bateman described \\"a curious assemblage of ornaments\\", which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth. This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood, approximately in diameter at the mouth. Its rim was edged with silver, while its surface was \\"decorated by four wheel-shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver, affixed by pins of the same metal, clenched inside\\". Also found were the remnants of three hanging bowl escutcheons, as well as \\"a knot of very fine wire\\", and some \\"thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges &c.;\\" attached to silk, but that soon decayed when exposed to air. Approximately to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork. Separated, this mass included a collection of chainwork, a six-pronged piece of iron resembling a hayfork, and the helmet. As Bateman described it: Watercolour by Llewellynn Jewitt depicting the Benty Grange helmet and associated finds Bateman closed his 1849 account of the excavation by noting the \\"particularly corrosive nature of the soil\\", which by 1861 he said \\"has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire\\". He suggested that this was the result of \\"a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid; the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth, and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains.\\" Bateman's friend Llewellynn Jewitt, an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations, painted four watercolours of the finds, parts of which were included in Bateman's 1849 account. This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations, a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow. The helmet entered the extensive collection of Bateman, where it attracted interest. On 27 October 1848 he related his discoveries, including the helmet, to the British Arch√¶ological Association, and in 1855 it was catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow. In 1861 Bateman died at 39, and in 1876 his son, Thomas W. Bateman, loaned the objects to Sheffield. They were displayed at the Weston Park Museum through 1893, at which time the museum purchased objects, including the helmet, from the family; other pieces were dispersed elsewhere. As of 2020, the helmet remains in the collection of the museum. From 8 November 1991 to 8 March 1992 it joined the Coppergate helmet at the British Museum for The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, AD 600‚Äì900. The Benty Grange barrow was designated a scheduled monument on 23 October 1970. The list entry notes that \\"[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains.\\" It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information. The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014; as of 2020 it is rented out as a holiday cottage. =Conservation= In 1948, the helmet was brought to the British Museum to undergo cleaning and study. Permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year, when Rupert Bruce-Mitford, recently returned from World War II service in the Royal Signals to an assistant keepership at the museum, spent time in Sheffield examining the Benty Grange grave goods. A 1940 letter from T. D. Kendrick to Bruce-Mitford's army camp had assigned him his position, and responsibility for the Sutton Hoo discoveries‚Äî\\"Brace yourself for the task\\", the letter concluded. Upon his return, he therefore took to studying the comparison material; his work in 1947 included the excavation of the Valsg√§rde 11 boat- grave in Sweden alongside Sune Lindqvist, and the trip to Sheffield, intended to shed light on the Sutton Hoo helmet through comparison with the only other Anglo-Saxon helmet then known. Permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the Weston Park Museum for the proposed work, and, in April 1948, a century and a month after its discovery, the Benty Grange helmet was brought to London. Work at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory Harold Plenderleith, who in some cases, particularly with the boar, did the work himself; additional input was provided by Bruce-Mitford, the technical attach√© and authority on ancient metalwork Herbert Maryon, and the archaeologist and art historian Fran√ßoise Henry. In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode, and certain parts had become indiscernible. The boar was unrecognizable, and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured. A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation, revealing the underlying features. During this process, the boar, hitherto thought solid, snapped in two. Bruce-Mitford termed this occurrence \\"fortunate\\", for it revealed the boar's inner structure. Frederic Charles Fraser examined the remnants of horn at the Natural History Museum, and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn. Typology The Benty Grange helmet is dated to the first half of the 7th century AD, on the basis of its technical construction and decorative style. It is one of six Anglo-Saxon helmets, joined by the subsequent discoveries from Sutton Hoo, York, Wollaston, Shorwell, and Staffordshire. These are all, other than the Frankish Shorwell helmet, examples of the \\"crested helmets\\" known in Northern Europe in the 6th through 11th centuries AD. Such helmets are characterized by prominent crests and rounded caps, traits shared by the Benty Grange example, and other than a Viking Age fragment found in Kiev, uniformly originate from England or Scandinavia; contemporary continental helmets were primarily spangenhelm or lamellenhelm. The ultimate form of the helmet is unparalleled among surviving Anglo-Saxon and crested helmets, although individual characteristics are shared. While other Anglo-Saxon helmets were typically formed with wide perpendicular bands and four infill plates, their Swedish counterparts from Vendel and Valsg√§rde display similar use of thin iron frameworks. The complicated construction of the Benty Grange boar, which combines garnet, filigree, gold, silver, iron, and bronze, is unique across ornamental Anglo-Saxon objects, but the general boar-crest is paralleled by the Wollaston and Guilden Morden boars. One other helmet exhibits the use of horn, but it is the spangenhelm-type helmet of a high-status child, discovered in Cologne. Iconography The helmet was made during the nascent days of Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England, and exhibits both Christian and pagan motifs. The boar invoked a pagan tradition and the cross a Christian belief. Roman Britain had been officially converted to Christianity in the fourth century, although Celtic paganism remained strong. In the fifth century Ireland was converted by British missionaries and in 563 Irish missionaries based in the monastery of Iona off the western coast of Scotland embarked on the conversion of the Picts. Christianity almost disappeared in southern Britain after its conquest by the pagan Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries, apart from the surviving Celtic areas of southwest England and Wales. In 597 Pope Gregory the Great sent the Gregorian mission to Kent to embark on the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. It rapidly converted kingdoms as far north as Northumbria, but initial success was often followed by a period of apostasy and in several cases the final conversion was carried out by Irish missionaries from Iona. It is not known whether the Pecs√¶te were converted by adherents of the Roman or Irish Celtic tradition. The Benty Grange helmet was made during this time of change, as evidenced by its syncretic display. It emphasises the pagan element, a large boar dominating a small cross. The cross may not necessarily be an indication of Christian belief; it may have instead been chosen for its amuletic effect. Whatever the politics behind religious conversion, the battlefield was not a place to discriminate against gods. =The boar= A Central European boar The boar had symbolic import in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was \\"venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time.\\" Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La T√®ne examples in the 4th century BC, Gaulish specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the 4th century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the 1st century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made 500 years later. The Romans also included the boar as one of their many symbols‚Äîfour legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem. The boar persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the Beowulf poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them. =Boar- crests in Beowulf= The Sutton Hoo helmet exhibits the other style of boar motif mentioned in Beowulf. The Benty Grange helmet recalls the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, in which boar-adorned helmets are mentioned five times. Three passages appear to describe examples that, like the Benty Grange helmet, are topped with a freestanding boar. After √Üschere is killed by Grendel's mother, King Hrothgar's lamentation speaks of such helmets. The devastation wrought by Grendel's mother itself invokes a boar-crested helmet, for \\"[h]er onslaught was less only by as much as an amazon warrior's strength is less than an armed man's when the hefted sword, its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood, razed the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet\\" (). These two passages likely refer to boar-crests like those found on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, and the detached Guilden Morden boar.

In the 1970s he was the richest man in Britain. Early life Grave of Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster Eccleston Church Grosvenor was born Robert Grosvenor, the son of Lord Hugh Grosvenor, sixth son and tenth child of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster by his second wife, the Honourable Katherine Cavendish, daughter of William Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham. His mother, Lady Mabel Crichton, was the daughter of John Crichton, 4th Earl Erne. He was educated at Eton College, an all-boys public boarding school in Berkshire. He was a member of the school's contingent of the junior division of the Officer Training Corps. He reached the rank of cadet lance corporal. Military career On 28 June 1938, Grosvenor was commissioned into the 11th (City of London Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, a newly formed Territorial Army unit of the Royal Artillery, as a second lieutenant. He ended World War II as a war substantive major. On 1 May 1947, he transferred to the reformed City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) and was promoted from his pre- war substantive rank of second lieutenant to major with seniority from 24 April 1944. His service number was 76151. He transferred to the North Irish Horse on 1 May 1949. On 11 November 1949, he was awarded the Efficiency Decoration (TD) for long service with the Territorial Army. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 15 February 1953. He was awarded a clasp to his Efficiency Decoration on 26 October 1954. On 14 February 1956, he moved from the Active List to the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers. He resigned his commission on 15 April 1960 and was permitted to retain the rank of lieutenant colonel. Political career Grosvenor lived in Northern Ireland most of his life at Ely Lodge, Blaney, on an island in the middle of Lough Erne. In 1952 he was appointed High Sheriff of Fermanagh. In the 1955 general election, he was elected to Parliament as member for Fermanagh & South Tyrone. Re-elected in 1959, he retired in 1964, he was succeeded by his cousin, the Marquess of Hamilton. In parliament he stuck mainly to constituency issues, but was responsible for a bill to help increase adoptions, which became the Adoption Act 1964. He was described in his successor's maiden speech as popular and well-liked. Family On 3 December 1946, he married his second cousin, Hon. Viola Maud Lyttelton, a daughter of the 9th Viscount Cobham, and they had three children, ten grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren: *Lady Leonora Mary Grosvenor (b. 1 February 1949). She married Thomas Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield on 8 March 1975 and they were divorced in 1986. They have three children and two grandsons. *Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster (22 December 1951 ‚Äì 9 August 2016). He married Natalia Phillips on 7 October 1978. They had four children and six grandchildren. *Lady Jane Meriel Grosvenor (b. 8 February 1953). She married Guy David Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe on 10 September 1977 and they were divorced in 1990. They have three children and three grandchildren. Lady Jane was presented to high society as a debutante at the prestigious International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City in 1971. In 1963, his cousin died and his brother Gerald became Duke of Westminster. A Royal Warrant of Precedence was issued to allow him to adopt the style of Lord Robert Grosvenor. Upon his brother's death in 1967, Robert became 5th Duke of Westminster. Although he took his seat in the House of Lords, he never spoke, surprisingly considering his political career. Westminster was appointed honorary colonel of the North Irish Horse in 1971. He died at Ely Lodge near Enniskillen, Northern Ireland on 19 February 1979 and was buried in the churchyard of Eccleston Church near Eaton Hall, Cheshire.

It is held by some that the separation of software engineering, infrastructure management, and information security management leads to difficulties and failures. These failures occur especially when communication is needed between these two sectors Thus, leading edge companies are starting to integrate these information quality management disciplines along with the discipline of information risk management. These two disciplines ensure that software engineering frameworks of the future have established information security controls in place before the project commences.

Biography Viertel was born to Jewish parents in Dresden, Germany, the writer and actress Salka Viertel and the writer Berthold Viertel. In 1928, his parents moved to Santa Monica, California, where Viertel grew up with his brothers, Hans and Thomas. The home in Santa Monica Canyon was the site of salons and meetings of the Hollywood intelligentsia and the √©migr√© community of European intellectuals, particularly at the Sunday night tea parties given by Viertel's mother. However, Viertel identified more with Southern California youth culture than with the European millieu he was exposed to by his family. \\"The physical aspect of European intellectuals was so totally different from what an American kid wants to be,\\" he told the International Herald Tribune in 1992. \\"I knew Bert Brecht was close to being a genius, but he was a funny-looking man to me.\\" Viertel graduated from Dartmouth College in 1941. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a private, but after being assigned office work in California (in his memoirs he joked he was a \\"Remington Raider\\" in reference to the typewriters they used), he applied for officer training and eventually was accepted by the OSS, the predecessor of the CIA, where his recruiters were impressed that he had already published at 19 the highly acclaimed novel The Canyon (1940), and had written a screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock, Saboteur (1942), as well as the script for The Hard Way (1943). His obvious high intelligence, native German language skills, good looks and athleticism were useful in Nazi-controlled Europe. He finished the war as a second lieutenant. Based on his experiences, Viertel wrote the play The Survivors with his friend Irwin Shaw. It premiered in New York City in 1948, and was turned into an episode for the US Studio One TV series in 1950, and a BBC television movie in 1957. Some of his war experiences found their way into the screenplay for Anatole Litvak's highly acclaimed movie Decision Before Dawn (1951). He found it difficult to turn his OSS experiences into a novel and struggled with it for several decades, and a draft was found after his death,\\"Peter Viertel, 86; Novelist and Noted Screenplay Writer\\" by Adam Bernstein, The Washington Post, November 6, 2007. Retrieved October 29, 2018. but as of 2018 there has been no news of potential publication, nor of the second volume of his autobiography. Viertel was best known for his novel White Hunter Black Heart, which was made into a film starring Clint Eastwood in 1990. It is a thinly-disguised account of Viertel's experiences working with film director John Huston while they were making The African Queen. The central character is scriptwriter Pete Verrill while the Huston character is called John Wilson. Film critic Pauline Kael wrote in 1999 that White Hunter was ‚Äústill the best Hollywood novel I‚Äôve ever come across ‚Äî and it isn‚Äôt even set in Hollywood.‚Äù\\"Peter Viertel, 86, Author and Screenwriter, Is Dead\\" by Douglas Martin, The New York Times, November 6, 2007. Retrieved October 29, 2018. Viertel's opinion of the finished film was tempered by his idea that Huston himself would have preferred a portrayal with more sarcasm. Viertel's looks and personality were an inspiration for Robert Redford's character Hubbell Gardiner in The Way We Were. Of his screenwriting work for Hollywood productions, Viertel said that it was primarily a vehicle for income so that he could continue to write novels.Marbella, Spain, La Tribuna obituary November 6, 2007 Though he worked closely with movie professionals that he liked such as Billy Wilder and Huston, Viertel said there was always creative tension.English translation of La Tribuna obituary November 6, 2007 Viertel is recognized for introducing surfing in Europe. In 1956, while on location in Biarritz for the filming of The Sun Also Rises, Viertel was so impressed by the waves that he sent for his surfboard from California and soon afterwards started Europe's first surf club.The Encyclopedia of Surfing, by Matt Warshaw, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2005 Viertel was twice married. His first wife was Virginia Ray \\"Jigee\\" Schulberg, the ex-wife of the novelist and screenwriter Budd Schulberg; she was pregnant with their only child, Christine, when Viertel abandoned her to live with the fashion model Simone Micheline \\"Bettina\\" Bodin. Varying sources show that Viertel and Jigee divorced in 1958, 1959, or were still separated but legally married upon her death in January 1960. Bettina left him for Prince Aly Khan in 1955, and was pregnant with Khan's child when he died in May 1960. Viertel's second wife was the actress Deborah Kerr, marrying her on 23 July 1960. Viertel was widowed by Kerr on 16 October 2007, just 19 days before he died from lymphoma while living in Marbella, Spain; he was 12 days shy of his 87th birthday. Through Kerr he had two stepdaughters, Melanie and Francesca Bartley. A filmed documentary by director Michael Scheingraber was in production at the time of Viertel's death.

The channel was renamed to Fox +1 on 18 March 2017.https://overnights.tv/public/content/News.aspx (The channel's former name, Fox +, is not to be confused with the Latin American group of premium channels now known as Fox Premium, which used the name \\"Fox+\\" from 3 November 2014 until they were rebranded to the current name on 11 March 2017.) Fox HD Fox HD is a high definition television channel, which launched on Monday 28 April 2008 at 10:00pm in the UK and Ireland as FX HD. It initially broadcast a completely separate schedule from the standard definition channel, with only HD content and without ads. FX HD was originally due to launch on 21 April 2008, but as stated on the FX Forums the date was pushed back to 28 April 2008 due to \\"technical problems at the transmission end\\". On 24 April 2009, FX HD become a simulcast of FX, broadcasting HD content when possible but only broadcasting between 7:00pm and 2:00am every day. On 5 January 2010, FX HD increased it broadcast hours to match its SD counterpart. The channel also joined Virgin Media's digital cable TV lineup on channel 158 on 30 July 2009. The channel was rebranded as Fox HD on 11 January 2013, in line with the main channel.  Funny As Fox  Similar to Fox's Animation Domination in America. Funny as Fox is a programming block which airs shows similarly to its American counterpart, such as: Family Guy and American Dad!. The block name is the same as Fox's slogan. Funny As Fox used to air People Of Earth until late 2019. Funny As Fox airs, on some days, from 9pm to 4am. This is regularly not the case as some premieres shown on Fox are shown around 9pm to 11pm so the block normally airs from 11pm to 4am, The main slogan for this programming block is 'Late Night, Every Night... Literally!.'. Programming As well as British and American programming, the channel has aired a number of international programmes. These include Last Man Standing and The Nominees from Australia; Jo from France; Charlie Jade, a co-production between Canada and South Africa; and the Flemish series Matrioshki, which was shown with subtitles. Original content has also aired on the channel, including No Signal! which aired from February to April 2009. For several weeks from 5 December 2005, FX carried a strand of programming from the Fox-owned American channel Fuel TV. The strand was identified as FX Presents Fuel TV, and made use of Fuel TV's US branding graphics. The strand ran for an hour from , and was repeated in the early hours of the following morning. In August 2015, Fox announced that a variety of Adult Swim programming would air on the channel including adult animated sci-fi comedy Rick and Morty, starting Thursday, 10 September of that year. On 10 September 2015, Adult Swim moved to Fox along with truTV, airing Rick and Morty and Mr. Pickles as its first day line up. \\"Adult Swim UK's First Official Night On FOX UK HD Continuity,\\" on YouTube As of 2016, it aired on Fridays from Midnight to 1:00 a.m. =Current programming= *APB *American Dad!

ERM provides a framework for risk management, which typically involves identifying particular events or circumstances relevant to the organization's objectives (threats and opportunities), assessing them in terms of likelihood and magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy, and monitoring process. By identifying and proactively addressing risks and opportunities, business enterprises protect and create value for their stakeholders, including owners, employees, customers, regulators, and society overall. ERM can also be described as a risk-based approach to managing an enterprise, integrating concepts of internal control, the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act, data protection and strategic planning. ERM is evolving to address the needs of various stakeholders, who want to understand the broad spectrum of risks facing complex organizations to ensure they are appropriately managed. Regulators and debt rating agencies have increased their scrutiny on the risk management processes of companies. According to Thomas Stanton of Johns Hopkins University, the point of enterprise risk management is not to create more bureaucracy, but to facilitate discussion on what the really big risks are. ERM frameworks defined There are various important ERM frameworks, each of which describes an approach for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks and opportunities, within the internal and external environment facing the enterprise. Management selects a risk response strategy for specific risks identified and analyzed, which may include: #Avoidance: exiting the activities giving rise to risk #Reduction: taking action to reduce the likelihood or impact related to the risk #Alternative Actions: deciding and considering other feasible steps to minimize risks #Share or Insure: transferring or sharing a portion of the risk, to finance it #Accept: no action is taken, due to a cost/benefit decision Monitoring is typically performed by management as part of its internal control activities, such as review of analytical reports or management committee meetings with relevant experts, to understand how the risk response strategy is working and whether the objectives are being achieved. =Casualty Actuarial Society framework= In 2003, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) defined ERM as the discipline by which an organization in any industry assesses, controls, exploits, finances, and monitors risks from all sources for the purpose of increasing the organization's short- and long-term value to its stakeholders.\\" The CAS conceptualized ERM as proceeding across the two dimensions of risk type and risk management processes. The risk types and examples include: ;Hazard risk: Liability torts, Property damage, Natural catastrophe ;Financial risk: Pricing risk, Asset risk, Currency risk, Liquidity risk ;Operational risk: Customer satisfaction, Product failure, Integrity, Reputational risk; Internal Poaching; Knowledge drain ;Strategic risks: Competition, Social trend, Capital availability The risk management process involves: #Establishing Context: This includes an understanding of the current conditions in which the organization operates on an internal, external and risk management context. #Identifying Risks: This includes the documentation of the material threats to the organization‚Äôs achievement of its objectives and the representation of areas that the organization may exploit for competitive advantage. #Analyzing/Quantifying Risks: This includes the calibration and, if possible, creation of probability distributions of outcomes for each material risk. #Integrating Risks: This includes the aggregation of all risk distributions, reflecting correlations and portfolio effects, and the formulation of the results in terms of impact on the organization‚Äôs key performance metrics. #Assessing/Prioritizing Risks: This includes the determination of the contribution of each risk to the aggregate risk profile, and appropriate prioritization. #Treating/Exploiting Risks: This includes the development of strategies for controlling and exploiting the various risks. #Monitoring and Reviewing: This includes the continual measurement and monitoring of the risk environment and the performance of the risk management strategies. = COSO ERM framework = The COSO \\"Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework\\" published in 2004 (New edition COSO ERM 2017 is not Mentioned and the 2004 version is outdated) defines ERM as a \\"‚Ä¶process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives.\\" The COSO ERM Framework has eight Components and four objectives categories. It is an expansion of the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework published in 1992 and amended in 1994. The eight components - additional components highlighted - are: * Authority and pledge to the ERM * RISK Management policy * Mixer of ERM in the institution * Risk Assessment * Risk Response * communication and reporting * Information and Communication * Monitoring The four objectives categories - additional components highlighted - are: * Strategy - high-level goals, aligned with and supporting the organization's mission * Operations - effective and efficient use of resources * Financial Reporting - reliability of operational and financial reporting * Compliance - compliance with applicable laws and regulations = ISO 31000 : the new International Risk Management Standard = ISO 31000 is an International Standard for Risk Management which was published on 13 November 2009. An accompanying standard, ISO 31010 - Risk Assessment Techniques, soon followed publication (December 1, 2009) together with the updated Risk Management vocabulary ISO Guide 73. = RIMS Risk Maturity Model = The RIMS Risk Maturity Model (RMM) for Enterprise Risk Management, published in 2006, is an umbrella framework of content and methodology that detail the requirements for sustainable and effective enterprise risk management. The RMM model consists of twenty-five competency drivers for seven attributes that create ERM‚Äôs value and utility in an organization. The 7 attributes are: * ERM-based approach * ERM process management * Risk appetite management * Root cause discipline * Uncovering risks * Performance management * Business resiliency and sustainability The model was developed by Steven Minsky, CEO of LogicManager, and published by the Risk and Insurance Management Society in collaboration with the RIMS ERM Committee. The Risk Maturity Model is based on the Capability Maturity Model, a methodology founded by the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in the 1980s. Implementing an ERM program =Goals of an ERM program= Organizations by nature manage risks and have a variety of existing departments or functions (\\"risk functions\\") that identify and manage particular risks. However, each risk function varies in capability and how it coordinates with other risk functions. A central goal and challenge of ERM is improving this capability and coordination, while integrating the output to provide a unified picture of risk for stakeholders and improving the organization's ability to manage the risks effectively. =Typical risk functions= The primary risk functions in large corporations that may participate in an ERM program typically include: * Strategic planning - identifies external threats and competitive opportunities, along with strategic initiatives to address them * Marketing - understands the target customer to ensure product/service alignment with customer requirements * Compliance & Ethics - monitors compliance with code of conduct and directs fraud investigations * Accounting / Financial compliance - directs the Sarbanes-Oxley Section 302 and 404 assessment, which identifies financial reporting risks * Law Department - manages litigation and analyzes emerging legal trends that may impact the organization * Insurance - ensures the proper insurance coverage for the organization * Treasury - ensures cash is sufficient to meet business needs, while managing risk related to commodity pricing or foreign exchange * Operational Quality Assurance - verifies operational output is within tolerances * Operations management - ensures the business runs day-to-day and that related barriers are surfaced for resolution * Credit - ensures any credit provided to customers is appropriate to their ability to pay * Customer service - ensures customer complaints are handled promptly and root causes are reported to operations for resolution * Internal audit - evaluates the effectiveness of each of the above risk functions and recommends improvements =Common challenges in ERM implementation= Various consulting firms offer suggestions for how to implement an ERM program.ERM Implementation Advice Common topics and challenges include:ERM Frequently Asked Questions * Identifying executive sponsors for ERM. * Establishing a common risk language or glossary. * Describing the entity's risk appetite (i.e., risks it will and will not take) * Identifying and describing the risks in a \\"risk inventory\\". * Implementing a risk-ranking methodology to prioritize risks within and across functions. * Establishing a risk committee and or Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to coordinate certain activities of the risk functions. * Establishing ownership for particular risks and responses. * Demonstrating the cost-benefit of the risk management effort. * Developing action plans to ensure the risks are appropriately managed. * Developing consolidated reporting for various stakeholders. * Monitoring the results of actions taken to mitigate risk. * Ensuring efficient risk coverage by internal auditors, consulting teams, and other evaluating entities. * Developing a technical ERM framework that enables secure participation by 3rd parties and remote employees. =Internal audit role= In addition to information technology audit, internal auditors play an important role in evaluating the risk-management processes of an organization and advocating their continued improvement. However, to preserve its organizational independence and objective judgment, Internal Audit professional standards indicate the function should not take any direct responsibility for making risk management decisions for the enterprise or managing the risk-management function.Role of Internal Auditing in ERM Internal auditors typically perform an annual risk assessment of the enterprise, to develop a plan of audit engagements for the upcoming year. This plan is updated at various frequencies in practice. This typically involves review of the various risk assessments performed by the enterprise (e.g., strategic plans, competitive benchmarking, and SOX 404 top- down risk assessment), consideration of prior audits, and interviews with a variety of senior management. It is designed for identifying audit projects, not to identify, prioritize, and manage risks directly for the enterprise. Current issues in ERM The risk management processes of corporations worldwide are under increasing regulatory and private scrutiny. Risk is an essential part of any business. Properly managed, it drives growth and opportunity. Executives struggle with business pressures that may be partly or completely beyond their immediate control, such as distressed financial markets; mergers, acquisitions and restructurings; disruptive technology change; geopolitical instabilities; and the rising price of energy. =Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements= Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required U.S. publicly traded corporations to utilize a control framework in their internal control assessments. Many opted for the COSO Internal Control Framework, which includes a risk assessment element. In addition, new guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and PCAOB in 2007 placed increasing scrutiny on top-down risk assessment and included a specific requirement to perform a fraud risk assessment.PCAOB Auditing Standard No 5 Fraud risk assessments typically involve identifying scenarios of potential (or experienced) fraud, related exposure to the organization, related controls, and any action taken as a result. =NYSE corporate governance rules= The New York Stock Exchange requires the Audit Committees of its listed companies to \\"discuss policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.\\" The related commentary continues: \\"While it is the job of the CEO and senior management to assess and manage the company‚Äôs exposure to risk, the audit committee must discuss guidelines and policies to govern the process by which this is handled. The audit committee should discuss the company‚Äôs major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The audit committee is not required to be the sole body responsible for risk assessment and management, but, as stated above, the committee must discuss guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. Many companies, particularly financial companies, manage and assess their risk through mechanisms other than the audit committee. The processes these companies have in place should be reviewed in a general manner by the audit committee, but they need not be replaced by the audit committee.\\" =ERM and corporate debt ratings= Standard & Poor's (S&P;), the debt rating agency, plans to include a series of questions about risk management in its company evaluation process. This will rollout to financial companies in 2007.S&P; Ratings - Treasury & Risk Article The results of this inquiry is one of the many factors considered in debt rating, which has a corresponding impact on the interest rates lenders charge companies for loans or bonds.S&P; ERM for Financial Institutions On May 7, 2008, S&P; also announced that it would begin including an ERM assessment in its ratings for non-financial companies starting in 2009,S&P; ERM FAQs with initial comments in its reports during Q4 2008.S&P; ERM Announcement =IFC Performance Standards= IFC Performance Standardhttp://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability- at-ifc/policies-standards/performance-standards/ps1 focuses on the management of Health, Safety, Environmental and Social risks. The third edition was published on January 1, 2012 after a two-year negotiation process with the private sector, governments and civil society organisations. It has been adopted by the Equator Banks, a consortium of over 90 commercial banks in 37 countries. = Data Privacy = Data privacy rules, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, increasingly foresee significant penalties for failure to maintain adequate protection of individuals' personal data such as names, e-mail addresses and personal financial information, or alert affected individuals when data privacy is breached. The EU regulation requires any organization--including organizations located outside the EU--to appoint a Data Protection Officer reporting to the highest management level if they handle the personal data of anyone living in the EU. Actuarial response =Casualty Actuarial Society= In 2003, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee of the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) issued its overview of ERM. This paper laid out the evolution, rationale, definitions, and frameworks for ERM from the casualty actuarial perspective, and also included a vocabulary, conceptual and technical foundations, actual practice and applications, and case studies. The CAS has specific stated ERM goals, including being \\"a leading supplier internationally of educational materials relating to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in the property casualty insurance arena,\\" and has sponsored research, development, and training of casualty actuaries in that regard. The CAS has refrained from issuing its own credential; instead, in 2007, the CAS Board decided that the CAS should participate in the initiative to develop a global ERM designation, and make a final decision at some later date. =Society of Actuaries= In 2007, the Society of Actuaries developed the Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst (CERA) credential in response to the growing field of enterprise risk management. This is the first new professional credential to be introduced by the SOA since 1949. A CERA studies to focus on how various risks, including operational, investment, strategic, and reputational combine to affect organizations. CERAs work in environments beyond insurance, reinsurance and the consulting markets, including broader financial services, energy, transportation, media, technology, manufacturing and healthcare. It takes approximately three to four years to complete the CERA curriculum which combines basic actuarial science, ERM principles and a course on professionalism. To earn the CERA credential, candidates must take five exams, fulfill an educational experience requirement, complete one online course, and attend one in-person course on professionalism. =CERA Global= Initially all CERAs were members of the Society of Actuaries but in 2009 the CERA designation became a global specialized professional credential, awarded and regulated by multiple actuarial bodies.

Biography Christopher Tunnard was the son of Christopher Coney Tunnard (1879-1939), second son of Charles Thomas Tunnard of Frampton House, near Boston, Lincolnshire (now a Residential care home) and Madeline Kingscote (b. 7 Jul 1881, d. Jan 1977). He had one younger brother, Peter Kingscote Tunnard (b. 11 December 1919, d. 16 March 1940), died at age 20. Tunnard's uncle was John Charles Tunnard (b. 1873) whose only son was British surrealist artist John Tunnard (1900‚Äì1971). Another uncle was Thomas Monkton Tunnard (b. 1882) of Birtles Hall, vicar of Over Alderley, who married Grace Cook and fathered pianist Viola Mary Tunnard (1916-1974), Thomas Newburgh Tunnar (b. 1919) and gallery owner Peter Humphrey Tunnard (b. 1920). Born and educated in Victoria, British Columbia, where his Lincolnshire-born father had moved as a young man, in 1929 Christopher Tunnard went to England and obtained a Diploma from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1930. From 1932-1935 he worked as a garden designer for Percy Cane, an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement. He then embarked on a European tour, becoming interested in avant-garde art and architecture. In 1936, he started his own practice for landscape architecture in London. His noted landscape projects include his landscape architecture for Serge Chermayeff's house Bentley Wood at Halland, Sussex;Modernism , History of Environmental Design course notes, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape and for his modification of existing 18th-century gardens at the circular Art Deco St Ann's Court (a Grade II* Listed Building) in Chertsey designed by Raymond McGrath, where Tunnard lived for a short time with his then partner, the stockbroker GL Schlesinger.. He wrote a series of articles for the Architectural Review, later re-published as a manifesto, Gardens in the Modern Landscape. In 1939, he designed the garden for the \\"All-Europe House\\" at the Ideal Home Exhibition, Earls Court.. In the same year he emigrated to America, at the invitation of Walter Gropius, to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. From 1938 to 1943 Tunnard taught at Harvard. While in Massachusetts, he designed several gardens for modern houses, photos and/or drawings of which he later published in the second edition of his book in 1948. Among them were a small courtyard garden for the Koch House in Cambridge by Edward D. Stone and Carl Koch; planning with Koch the early modern residential development at Snake Hill Road in Belmont; and a garden for an expansive rural site in Lincoln with a new house by architect G. Holmes Perkins, who was on the Harvard faculty with Tunnard. During the 1943/44 academic year, Tunnard lived in the Greenwich Village with his mother Madeline Kingscote. Madeline had moved to New York City to be near her other son, Peter Kingscote, who was with the Michael Chekhov's Theatre Studio at Ridgefield, CT, 40 miles away. Peter was an aspiring poet and short stories writer, but his career was cut short when he died just 20 years old in mid-1940. Christopher Tunnard was drafted into the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1943 and after the war took a job teaching city planning at Yale. Enjoying the work, he did little further garden design, and reached the post of professor and chairman of the department of city planning. His publications in this area include articles such as America's super-cities. and a number of books on city design in the U.S. The best known may be Man-made America: Chaos or Control? (1963), by Tunnard and Boris Pushkarev,. which won the 1964 National Book Award in Science, Philosophy and Religion... In 1969 Yale disciplined him by demotion for sending out unauthorized admission letters to prospective students, following an unresolved departmental dispute. Landscape architecture and garden design One of Tunnard's main projects was Chermayeff's Bentley Wood in Halland Sussex in 1928. This project was shown in Architectural Review and his book Gardens in the Modern Landscape. In describing the gardens surrounding the building, Tunnard refers to them as to being in perfect harmony. The thinning of the trees left shaded lawn that gradually led up to the house and left room for daffodils and evergreens.. It is not a formal garden. The trees are formed in relation to the house in groups or by themselves. This is a concept that Tunnard describes as \\"letting space flow by breaking down division between usable areas and incidentally increasing their usability.\\". Another of Tunnard's projects was at Galby Leicestershire House, in collaboration with architect Raymond McGrath. The building materials for the house were chosen to fit in with the scenery. For example, some remnants of the former great estates of Beaudesert were used to build the new building. In addition, Tunnard wanted the garden to be interpreted as a link between the house and the open landscape, than merely as a formal garden. Design philosophy Tunnard came to England in a period when garden design was strongly influenced by the work of Edwin Lutyens, Gertrude Jekyll and Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott. The eclectic Arts and Crafts movement was drawing on this background to focus on garden features such as crazy paving, pergolas, sundials, sunken pools and statuary.. Tunnard viewed this as \\"romantic trivialisation\\" of garden design and in reaction spearheaded a Modernist approach to landscape design, which he expressed in the polemical Gardens in the Modern Landscape. His approach avoided decoration, sentimentality and classical allusion in favour of functional minimalist designs. For instance, his acclaimed landscape for Chermayeff's Bentley Wood house, itself Modernist, simply thinned the surrounding woodland and replanted areas with drifts of daffodils. His writings influenced a further generation of designers such as Thomas Dolliver Church.. Gardens in the Modern Landscape First published as a series of articles in Architectural Review from October 1937 to September 1938, Gardens in the Modern Landscape significantly challenged the then current views of landscape architecture. Geoffrey Jellicoe reviewed Gardens in the Modern Landscape in the magazine Architecture Review and overall gave a great praise to Tunnard's work. As it debunks previous and most accepted styles of landscape architecture, Tunnard meets with new nature, and questioning and breaking apart most widely accepted conventions, such as symmetry and the containment of the garden to a picture. He described the book as \\"if you can take the jolts you will be pleasantly introduced to the brave new world of landscape,\\" referring the jolts as this challenge to current conventions.. In sum, Jellicoe reviews the new landscape that Tunnard describes as having a response from readers as either \\"shocked from it altogether, or carried off their feet with enthusiasm.\\" Garrett Eckbo, Dan Kiley and James Rose, while together at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard during 1936 to 1938, cite reading Gardens in the Modern Landscape as inspiration against the strict rules of the curriculum of the GSD and a major influence for their work. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo.. Lawrence Halprin cites Gardens in the Modern Landscape as a revelation for him and his future career. From the book, the most enduring idea for Halprin being \\"A garden is a work of art, and it remains a vision for guidance as one tries to extend the garden‚Äôs benefits of rest, recreation, and aesethic pleasure to a wider public, in the larger landscape.\\" Walker 150 Moreover, Halprin wanted to study under Tunnard. For his graduate studies, he went to the GSD at Harvard and under Tunnard and other influential men, Halprin studied landscape architecture. Later, with Tunnard, Halprin produced an issue of Task magazine. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo. The functional garden Functionalism derives from a doctrine of \\"fit for purpose.\\" Is the object made fit its purpose? From this arises a more simple and clear way of planning, and not embellished with materials or things not fit for the purpose. For Tunnad, the creation of modern houses lacked modern surroundings, which he wanted to create. Flowers are not created to just be created but to be enjoyed by children. Gardens are not necessarily symmetrical because there is no need outside of simply being symmetrical. Tunnard cites the Swedish Garden Architect's Associations‚Äô paper as describing this new garden as Fletcher Steele, noted landscape architect, agrees with Tunnard's views of modern building design, but pointed out that Tunnard's views as being another style and not a possible universal conception.. City planning Tunnard's latter years were spent away from landscape architecture. He taught at Yale University for city planning, became more focused on preserving historic buildings, and wrote many books on urban planning.. Eckbo stated that landscape architect lost a great man when Tunnard went into city planning..

His father was the historian, Kume Kunitake.  Biography  His father moved his family to Tokyo in 1874 after participating in the Iwakura Mission. In 1881, he attended the National Industrial Exhibition, which was primarily devoted to the economy, but also included paintings. He was deeply impressed by the Western-style art and decided to become a painter. In pursuit of the goal, he began taking lessons from Fuji Masaz≈ç (, 1853‚Äì1916), who had studied in Europe. When Fuji returned to France in 1885, he followed him as soon as he could and, with Fuji's help, gained admission to the Acad√©mie Colarossi, where he studied under Rapha√´l Collin. While there, he became lifelong friends with Kuroda Seiki, who painted several portraits of him. He returned to Japan in 1893, followed shortly after by Kuroda. In 1894, they founded an art school called the Tenshin-d≈çj≈ç (; roughly, Heavenly Dojo), which numbered many famous artists among its graduates; notably Okada Sabur≈çsuke. They collaborated again in 1896 to help create the artists' association, Hakuba-kai (roughly; White Horse Club, a name that was chosen during a drinking party). In 1898, he was appointed a Professor at what is now the Tokyo University of the Arts and, the following year, was part of a group of art educators that paid an official visit to France.Benezit Dictionary of Artists Later, he travelled to the United States to work for the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition (1904) and the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition (1915).

He was the cousin of landscape architect Christopher Tunnard. Life Tunnard was born in Sandy, Bedfordshire, and educated at Charterhouse School. He studied design at the Royal College of Art (1919‚Äì1923). In 1926, he married a fellow student, Mary May Robertson. During the 1920s he worked in various textile design jobs in Manchester ‚Äî for Tootal, Broadhurst, Lee & Co, the carpet manufacturers, H&M; Southwell, and John Lewis Partnership. He took up painting seriously in 1928, and taught design at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, from 1929. In 1931 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and with the London Group, which he joined in 1934. In 1933 the Tunnards moved to Cadgwith, Cornwall, where they ran a business making printed silks. From the mid-1930s, he became friends with Julian Trevelyan, Henry Moore, John Betjeman and Humphrey Spender. During World War II he considered himself a conscientious objector, although, as no man born earlier than 1 July 1900 was required for call-up, an occasion for formally registering his objection never arose. Nevertheless, feeling morally obliged to make a contribution, he worked briefly as a fisherman in 1939, then as an auxiliary coastguard for the duration of the war. From 1945 to 1965 he taught at the Penzance School of Art. He exhibited again at the Royal Academy in 1960, and was elected as an Associate in 1967. He died in Penzance in 1971.Alan Windsor, \\"Tunnard, John Samuel (1900‚Äì1971)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 July 2007 Work Tunnard's early works were considered fairly conventional. His first major exhibition, held in 1932 at the Redfern Gallery, featured landscapes, marine scenes and still life. From the mid-1930s, however, he began to paint abstract works influenced by the styles of Joan Mir√≥ and Paul Klee, and further embraced British surrealism on reading Herbert Read's Surrealism. His works featured architectural and biomorphic forms combined with elements of constructivism. In his Self Portrait, now in the National Portrait Gallery (London), the artist depicts himself alongside an oversized insect. Tunnard was given a show at the Guggenheim Jeune gallery in 1938. In her autobiography, Peggy Guggenheim says that \\"His color was exquisite and his construction magnificent\\" and that \\"I was happy to think that I had discovered a genius.\\" She purchased a large work from the exhibition titled PSI Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice which is in the Guggenheim Collection in Venice.Out of this Century: Confessions of an Art Addict, Peggy Guggenheim, published by Andre Deutsch, London. 2005, p190. Tunnard's work, along with that of painter Graham Sutherland, was loosely termed British Neo-romanticism, continuing the tradition of British landscape, but with a modern sensibility. In later life he became interested in space travel and entomology, when he depicted satellites and moonscapes in his paintings. Interest in his work diminished after his death in 1971. In 2000, there was a centenary exhibition at Durham University. A major retrospective at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester in Spring 2010 entitled 'John Tunnard: Inner Space to Outer Space', explored the themes of abstraction, music and surrealism, nature and landscape, and science and space travel in his work. The exhibition was curated by Simon Martin. References The Haywood Gallery exhibition, and the Arts Councils book/catalogue. Further reading *John Tunnard: His Life and Work by Alan Peat and Brian A.

The latter name is an eponym for Friedrich Arnold. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve supplies sensory innervation to the skin of the ear canal, tragus, and auricle. Path It arises from the superior ganglion of the vagus nerve, and is joined soon after its origin by a filament from the petrous ganglion of the glossopharyngeal; it passes behind the internal jugular vein, and enters the mastoid canaliculus on the lateral wall of the jugular fossa. Traversing the substance of the temporal bone, it crosses the facial canal about above the stylomastoid foramen, and here it gives off an ascending branch which joins the facial nerve. The nerve reaches the surface by passing through the tympanomastoid fissure between the mastoid process and the tympanic part of the temporal bone, and divides into two branches: * one joins the posterior auricular nerve. * the other is distributed to the skin of the back of the ear (auricle) and to the posterior part of the ear canal. Clinical significance This nerve may be involved by the glomus jugulare tumour. Laryngeal cancer can present with pain behind the ear and in the ear - this is a referred pain through the vagus nerve to the nerve of Arnold. In a small portion of individuals, the auricular nerve is the afferent limb of the Ear-Cough or Arnold Reflex. Physical stimulation of the external acoustic meatus innervated by the auricular nerve elicits a cough, much like the other cough reflexes associated with the vagus nerve. Rarely, on introduction of speculum in the external ear, patients have experienced syncope due to the stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Clinical application This nerve may be stimulated as a diagnostic or therapeutic technique Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) was proposed by Ventureya (2000) for seizures. In 2003 Fallgatter et al. published \\"Far field potentials from the brain stem after transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation\\" and in 2007 Kraus et al. did the first tVNS-fMRI study. In Europe, a device was approved for seizure treatment (NEMOS by CerboMed). Although the transcutaneous method has not been specifically approved in the United States (i.e. off-label) it is legal and being investigated (and found to be effective and safe) for many conditions including: * Atrial fibrillation * Depression * Diabetes * Endotoxemia * Memory * Myocardial infarction * Tinnitus * Stroke References External links * Diagram Category:Vagus nerve Category:Nerves of the head and neck ","title":"Auricular branch of vagus nerve"},{"id":"2360774","text":"Salka Viertel (15 June 1889 ‚Äì 20 October 1978) was an Austrian Jewish actress and Hollywood screenwriter. While under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1933 to 1937, Viertel co-wrote the scripts for many movies, particularly those starring her close friend Greta Garbo, including Queen Christina (1933) and Anna Karenina (1935). She also played opposite Garbo in MGM's German-language version of Anna Christie in 1930. Early life and career Viertel was born Salomea Sara Steuermann in Sambor, a city then in the province of Galicia, which was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but today is in western Ukraine. Her father, Joseph Steuermann, was a lawyer and the mayor of Sambor before antisemitism forced him to renounce his office. Her mother, Auguste Steuermann, died in 1952 at Viertel's home in Santa Monica. Her siblings were the composer and pianist Eduard Steuermann; Rosa (Ruzia; 1891‚Äì1972), married from 1922 until her death to the actor ; and the Polish national football player Zygmunt Steuermann. After debuting as Salome Steuermann at the Pressburg Stadttheater (regional theater), Viertel had engagements in typical spas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1911 she played briefly under Max Reinhardt in Berlin, whereupon she followed an offer in 1913 to go to Vienna to work on the New Vienna stage. There she met her husband, author and director Berthold Viertel, and they married in 1918. They raised three sons‚ÄîHans, Peter, and Thomas‚Äîbefore divorcing in 1947. In 1920, Salka Viertel went to Hamburg to the Great Theater, later to D√ºsseldorf. Her husband worked from 1920 in Berlin, where he founded the collective theatre \\"Die Troupe\\" and worked for UFA, the major German film production company. The Viertels were part of ‚ÄúHitler‚Äôs gift to America,‚Äù according to one biographer, since so many film artists throughout Europe and the German-speaking artistic community in particular fled his regime, including, notably, fellow Austrian writer Vicki Baum. As was the case with US universities in the 1930s, Saunders notes that Hollywood studios could be so selective \\"that the list of emigres reads almost as a who's who of Weimar production\\"; he places Berthold Viertel as \\"only marginally less significant\\" than other emigres whom he considers \\"without peer.\\" In 1928, at FW Murnau's instigation, the family went to Hollywood, where Berthold Viertel received a contract with Fox Film Corporation as a director and writer. Despite her success on German and Austrian stages, Salka Viertel was only modestly successful as an actor in movies. Agreeing with Max Reinhardt, whom the Viertels ran into in New York on their way to Los Angeles, Viertel herself said she was \\"neither pretty nor young enough\\" for a career in film. One of her most successful roles was Marthy in the German version of Anna Christie, which she took over at the request of Garbo (it was originally intended for Marie Dressler). She became a mentor and friend to Greta Garbo and contributed to scripts for the famous actress for such films as Queen Christina, Anna Karenina, and Two-Faced Woman. However, the plan to write a commercial script for Hollywood together with Bertolt Brecht, who also lived in exile in the United States, failed. Social activism The Viertels, members of the intelligentsia in Europe, moved to the United States in 1928 for a planned four-year stay. The Viertels initially lived on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, before renting a house on Mabery Road in Santa Monica, California. In 1932, following Hitler's rise, they decided to stay in Santa Monica, where their sons grew up. Their home in Santa Monica Canyon was the site of salons and meetings of the Hollywood intelligentsia and the √©migr√© community of European intellectuals, particularly at their Sunday night tea parties. Her guests included not only Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin but also Arnold Schoenberg, Christopher Isherwood, Hanns Eisler, Bertolt Brecht, Max Reinhardt, and Thomas Mann. Salka Viertel played an active role in fundraising for Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico! project. Composer Franz Waxman met James Whale through her and wrote his first Hollywood soundtrack for Whale. She acted as a broker for Charles Boyer, among others, helping them to gain a foothold within the Hollywood film industry. In the 1930s and 1940s, she was involved in the fight against National Socialism. Viertel was also active aiding those still trapped in Europe.\\"German Exiles in Southern California ‚Äì Berthold Viertel (1885‚Äì1953) & Salka Viertel (1889‚Äì1978)\\" , Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, University of Southern California She helped found the European Film Fund, which brokered contracts with major Hollywood studios. Through its assistance, notable artists such as Leonhard Frank, Heinrich Mann, Alfred Polgar, Walter Mehring, and Friedrich Torberg received emergency visas that enabled them to escape the Nazis. With the onset of the Cold War and the McCarthy era, Viertel was among the Hollywood writers, suspected of being communists, who were blacklisted. Later life After her divorce in 1947, Salka lived in Brentwood, Southern California. In 1953 she left the U.S. and settled in Klosters in Switzerland, where later her son Peter and his second wife, actress Deborah Kerr, lived. In 1969, her autobiography, The Kindness of Strangers, was published. Salka Viertel died in Klosters, Switzerland, on 20 October 1978, aged 89.

He was one of the first Canadian authors to be internationally known. He published various works on Canadian exploration and natural history, verse, travel books, and fiction.\\" He continued to be a well-known \\"man of letters\\" until his death. Besides his own body of work, Roberts has also been called the \\"Father of Canadian Poetry\\" because he served as an inspiration and a source of assistance for other Canadian poets of his time. Roberts, his cousin Bliss Carman, Archibald Lampman and Duncan Campbell Scott are known as the Confederation Poets. Early life and education Roberts was born in Douglas, New Brunswick in 1860, the eldest child of Emma Wetmore Bliss and Rev. George Goodridge Roberts (an Anglican priest). Rev. Roberts was rector of Fredericton and canon of Christ Church Cathedral, New Brunswick. Charles's brother Theodore Goodridge Roberts and sister, Jane Elizabeth Gostwycke Roberts, also became authors. Between the ages of 8 months and 14 years, Roberts was raised in the parish of Westcock, New Brunswick, near Sackville, by the Tantramar Marshes. He was homeschooled, mostly by his father, who was educated in Greek, Latin and French. He published his first writing, three articles in The Colonial Farmer, at 12 years of age. After the family moved to Fredericton in 1873, Roberts attended Fredericton Collegiate School from 1874 to 1876, and then the University of New Brunswick (UNB), earning his B.A. in 1879 and M.A. in 1881. At the Collegiate School he came under the influence of headmaster George Robert Parkin, who gave him a love of classical literature and introduced him to the poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. =Early Canadian career= Roberts worked as principal of Chatham High School in Chatham, New Brunswick, from 1879 to 1881, and of York Street School in Fredericton from 1881 to 1883. In Chatham he met and befriended Edmund Collins, editor of the Chatham Star and the future biographer of Sir John A. Macdonald. Roberts first published poetry in the Canadian Illustrated News of March 30, 1878, and by 1879 he had placed two poems in the American magazine, Scribner's. In 1880, Roberts published his first book of poetry, Orion and Other Poems. Thanks in part to his industry in sending out complimentary review copies, there were many positive reviews, including praise from Rose-Belford's Canadian Monthly and several American periodicals, including the New York Independent, which called it 'a little book of choice things, with the indifferent things well weeded out.'\\" On December 29, 1880, Roberts married Mary Fenety, and they had five children. The biography by Roberts's friend Edmund Collins, The Life and Times of Sir John A. Macdonald, was published in 1883. The book was a success, going through eight printings. It contained a chapter on \\"Thought and Literature in Canada,\\" which devoted 15 pages to Roberts, quoting from Orion. Collins' characterization of Roberts as \\"our greatest Canadian poet\\" helped develop Roberts' reputation as a prominent Canadian writer. From 1883 to 1884, Roberts was in Toronto, Ontario, working as the editor of Goldwin Smith's short-lived literary magazine, The Week. After five months of long hours and disagreements with Smith, Roberts resigned. In 1885, Roberts became a professor at the University of King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia. In 1886, his second book, In Divers Tones, was published by a Boston publisher. During the following six years, Roberts wrote articles on a variety of subjects, and lectured in a number of cities in Canada and the United States. He published about thirty poems in The Independent (edited by Bliss Carman) and other American periodicals, as well as stories for young readers in The Youth's Companion. He also edited a poetry collection, Poems of Wild Life in 1888, and created the Canadian Guide Book in 1891. The anthology, Songs of the Great Dominion, edited by W.D. Lighthall, included a selection of Roberts's work. Roberts resigned from King's College in 1895, when his request for a leave of absence was turned down. In a short period of time he had published his first novel, The Forge in the Forest, as well as a fourth collection of poetry, The Book of the Native. He also wrote a book of nature-stories, Earth's Enigmas, and completed a book of boys' adventure stories Around the Campfire. =Move to New York= Adventure In 1897, Roberts left his wife and children in Canada and moved to New York City to work free-lance. Between 1897 and 1898, he worked for The Illustrated American as an associate editor. In New York, Roberts wrote prose in many genres, but had most success with animal stories, drawing upon his early experience in the wilds of the Maritimes. He published about a dozen volumes of these, beginning with Earth's Enigmas in 1896 and ending with Eyes of the Wilderness in 1933. Roberts also wrote historical romances and novels. Barbara Ladd (1902) is the story of a young girl who runs away from her aunt in New England in 1769; it sold 80,000 copies in the US. He also wrote descriptive text for guide books, such as Picturesque Canada and The Land of Evangeline and Gateways Thither for Nova Scotia's Dominion Atlantic Railway. Roberts became involved in a literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy after John Burroughs denounced his popular animal stories, and those of other writers, in a 1903 article for Atlantic Monthly. The controversy lasted for nearly six years and included American environmental and political figures of the day, including President Theodore Roosevelt. =Europe and return to Canada= In 1907, Roberts moved to Europe. First living in Paris, he moved to Munich in 1910, and in 1912 to London, where he lived until 1925. During World War I he enlisted with the British Army as a trooper, eventually becoming a captain and a cadet trainer in England. After the war he joined the Canadian War Records Office in London. Roberts returned to Canada in 1925 and began once more to write poetry.\\" During the late 1920s he was a member of the Halifax literary and social set, The Song Fishermen. He married his second wife Joan Montgomery on October 28, 1943, at the age of 83, but became ill and died shortly thereafter in Toronto. The funeral was held in Toronto; his ashes were interred in Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredericton. Poetry =Early work= Roberts's first book, Orion and Other Poems (1880), was a collection of poetry written in his teen years. It was a vanity book; he paid an advance of $300 to have it published, borrowing money from George E. Fenety, the Queen's Printer for New Brunswick, and his father-in-law-to-be. Much later, in 1958, the critic Desmond Pacey deemed it a \\"remarkable performance\\" considering the age of the writer. Editor Ross Kilpatrick called the poems \\"imitative, naively romantic, defective in diction\\", but also \\"facile, clever, and occasionally distinctly beautiful\\". Roberts' second book, In Divers Tones is filled with selections which vary in quality, style and subject. Those written after 1883 demonstrated developing skill, and three in particular, 'The Tantramar Revisited,' 'The Sower,' and 'The Potato Harvest, were considered superior. By the time of Songs of the Common Day, and Ave! (1893), Roberts poetic style was well developed. The sonnet sequence of Songs of the Common Day drew attention from critics; some colourfully described landscapes in Tantramar (lines such as \\"How sombre slope these acres to the sea' ('The Furrow\\"), 'These marshes pale and meadows by the sea' ('The Salt Flats'), and 'My fields of Tantramar in summer-time' ('The Pea-Fields')). =Middle period= After Roberts turned to free-lance writing in 1895, he began concentrating on writing fiction in order to support himself. He published two more books of poetry by 1898, but managed only two more in the following 30 years. His 1897 book of seasonal poems in The Book of the Native was a collection of works designed to appeal to monthly magazines: 'The Brook in February,' 'An April Adoration,' 'July,' and 'An August Woodroad.' Some of the poems demonstrated Roberts' skill at colourful depictions of nature through Romantic verse; however, the book also included examples of a shift toward a more mystical style. Roberts's 1898 book New York Nocturnes and Other Poems was filled mainly with poetry written before his move to New York. Written during a difficult time in his life, much of the work is unremarkable. The poem 'The Solitary Woodsman,' was later included in a number of anthologies. His poems about New York focus less on descriptions of visual interest and more on urban problems such as noise, fumes and crowding. The first and title section of The Book of the Rose (1903) was a collection of love poetry of varying effectiveness. Among the poems in the second section, \\"Heat in the City,\\" about the distress and despair of the tenement-dwellers, has been praised as \\"the best poem he ever wrote about city life\\". Also notable is the introspective final poem in the book, \\"The Aim.\\" \\"New Poems, a slim volume published in 1919, shows the drop in both the quantity and quality of Roberts' poetry during his European years. At least half of the pieces had been written before he left America, some as early as 1903.\\" =Later poems= Roberts's \\"return to Canada in 1925 led to a renewed production of verse with The Vagrant of Time (1927) and The Iceberg and Other Poems (1934).\\" Literary critic Desmond Pacey calls this period \\"the Indian summer of his poetic career\\". \\"Among the best of the new poems\\" in The Vagrant of Time \\"is the one with this inspired opening line: 'Spring breaks in foam along the blackthorn bough.' In another love poem, 'In the Night Watches,' written in 1926, his command of free verse is natural and unstrained, unlike the laboured language and forced rhymes of his earlier love poetry. Its synthesis of lonely wilderness setting with feelings of separation and longing is harmonious and poignant.\\" \\"Most critics rank \\"The Iceberg\\" (265 lines), the title poem of the new collection\\" published in 1934, \\"as one of Roberts' outstanding achievements. It is almost as ambitious as 'Ave!' in conception; its cold, unemotional images are as apt and precise in their detached way as the warmly-remembered descriptions in 'Tantramar Revisited.' Animal stories The Canadian Encyclopedia says that \\"Roberts is remembered for creating in the animal story, along with Ernest Thompson Seton, the one native Canadian art form.\\" A typical Roberts animal story is \\"The Truce\\". Many of Roberts' stories are told from the point of view of the animals themselves. In his introduction to The Kindred of the Wild (1902), Roberts called the animal story \\"a potent emancipator. It frees us for a little from the world of shop- worn utilities, and from the mean tenement of self of which we do well to grow weary. It helps us to return to nature, without requiring that we at the same time return to barbarism. It leads us back to the old kinship of earth, without asking us to relinquish by way of toll any part of the wisdom of the ages, any fine essential of the 'large result of time.' (Kindred 28)\\" Critics began to take interest in Roberts's animal stories in the 1960s and 70s. Some critics saw the animal stories as an allegory for Canadian nationhood, seeing in Seton's and Roberts' depictions of the brutal lives of animals a reflection of Canada's fate in dealing with the United States. Margaret Atwood devotes a chapter of her 1971 critical study Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature to animal stories, where she states the same thesis: \\"the stories are told from the point of view of the animal. That's the key: English animal stories are about the 'social relations,' American ones are about people killing animals; Canadian ones are about animals being killed, as felt emotionally from inside the fur and feathers. (qtd. in Sandlos 74; emphasis in original).\\" Recognition Charles G. D Roberts was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1893. Roberts was elected to the United States National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1898. He was awarded an honorary LLD from UNB in 1906, and an honorary doctorate from Mount Allison University in 1942. For his contributions to Canadian literature, Roberts was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's first Lorne Pierce Medal in 1926. On June 3, 1935, Roberts was one of three Canadians on King George V's honour list to receive a knighthood (Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George). Roberts was honoured by a sculpture erected in 1947 on the UNB campus, portraying him with Bliss Carman and fellow poet Francis Joseph Sherman. The 1980s were a period of renewed interest in Roberts' work: a number of monographs were written; a book containing all his poems, a biography, and a collection of his letters were published.Mount Allison University hosted a Roberts Symposium in 1982, as did the University of Ottawa in 1983. There were several new studies of his poetry. Roberts was declared a Person of National Historic Significance in 1945, and a monument to him was erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in Westcock in 2005. His alma mater, the University of New Brunswick, offers a \\"Charles G.D. Roberts Memorial Prize\\" for best short story by an undergraduate.

August 2, 2005. Archived October 26, 2008. In 1936, the name of the school became Bunka Fashion College, and it began publishing So-en, Japan's first fashion magazine. The Bunka Fashion College went through three major eras: First it taught people and families and to make clothes; then in the 1960s, designers from the school such as Kenzo Takada (who enrolled in 1958) and Yohji Yamamoto emerged on the international fashion scene and drove the rise of modern Japanese fashion; Since the 2000s, the school aims to develop a more global and sustainable fashion industry.

This course is called the Global Fashion Concentration and is taught completely in English. Every year, new mannequins are created that reflect the average measurements of the students of that year, in an effort to work on realistic physical figures. All students are required to study the human body shape and how human bodies move. The Bunka school values the Satori and the Kaizen in its education. One Master program is held in English. Students must pass a Japanese language proficiency test, and part-time jobs are not allowed.  Main Campus  Bunka has over 70 branches around Japan, but its main campus is in the western part of Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood. The main building is 21 stories tall, and includes facilities such as a library, costume museum, and a resource center.

He transferred to Fenerbah√ße in 1947, achieving instant success. He won the National Division championship in 1950, his first nationwide championship title with the club, becoming the Turkish top scorer in the same edition. He was one of the first Turkish footballers to play abroad, playing during 1951‚Äì1953 for ACF Fiorentina in Italy and OGC Nice in France. Returning to Fenerbah√ße, he won two Istanbul League titles and later, after the start of the Turkish Super League, three Turkish League (1959, 1961 and 1964) titles. In the 1947‚Äì48 and 1953‚Äì54 seasons, he became the leading goalscorer of the Istanbul League. Overall, he scored a total of 423 goals in 615 games for Fenerbah√ße. After ending his career in Turkey in 1964, he played a single season in Greece with AEK Athens. He participated in five games in the 1965 season scoring two goals before an injury in the match against Iraklis forced his retirement.

Alan Taylor at Upton Park 2 May 2015 Early life He was a pupil at Dormston School from September 1961 to December 1965. Football career Beginning his football career at Walsall, turning professional in 1968, he made over 50 appearances in the Black Country before moving to London, signing for Queens Park Rangers for ¬£15,000 in June 1970. His QPR debut was on Saturday 22 August 1970 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at home to Leicester City. Parkes was part of the QPR team that reached the last eight of the FA Cup in 1974 and were League runners-up to Liverpool in 1976. Many observers consider that side, managed by Dave Sexton, the finest team never to have won the League. His club career at QPR spanned 344 league appearances (406 in all competitions). He gained his only England cap during this period, against Portugal in 1974. Parkes was sold to West Ham United in 1979 for ¬£565,000, a world record for a goalkeeper at the time. It is reported that Sexton, who by then was manager of Manchester United, put in six bids for the player but saw them all turned down. It was only the half- million-pound bid from West Ham United that QPR chairman Jim Gregory could not resist. Upon John Lyall's signing of Parkes it was thought that he was a huge risk due to the severity of the condition of his knees but his signing was to pay off as Parkes was to remain first choice keeper for the next ten years. Despite this longevity, however, he only ever gained one piece of silverware, when West Ham beat Arsenal 1‚Äì0 to win the 1980 FA Cup Final. Parkes appeared as himself in Thunderbolt and Smokey! in the boys' comic Eagle in 1982, giving a coaching session to a schoolboy striker who was having to play in goal in a cup semi-final due to the regular keeper being injured. Although Parkes collected just one major trophy during his long playing career, his time at Upton Park saw him come close to picking up honours more than once later on in the 1980s. He was on the losing side in the 1981 Football League Cup Final against Liverpool, the same year that he collected a Second Division title medal as the Hammers returned to the First Division after three years away. In 1983‚Äì84, the Hammers were in the title race mid season but fell away to finish ninth. They re-emerged as title challengers in 1985‚Äì86 and were in the hunt for the title right up to the end of April, finally finishing third. He also helped them reach the League Cup semi-finals in 1988‚Äì89, but it was a disappointing season for the Hammers who were then relegated to the Second Division. Parkes had sat out much of the season despite new signing Allen McKnight making many mistakes before Parkes was finally reinstated as first choice. Parkes finished his West Ham career having played exactly the same number of league games for them as he had for QPR ‚Äì 344. Parkes is the only footballer ever to have played in excess of 400 matches for two different English league clubs.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-game-in-numbers- seven-goal-thrillers-and-bundesliga-blunders-6532pdrxt In 1990, he left the Hammers on a free transfer after 11 years and linked up with John Lyall who had returned to management at Ipswich Town. He played three league games in 1990‚Äì91 and moved into coaching. In 2003, an official West Ham United members poll for the greatest West Ham XI named him as the team's goalkeeper, beating Ludek Miklosko to that position. He is considered by QPR supporters to be one of the three best goalkeepers in the club's history, the others being Reg Allen and David Seaman. Parkes had great ability, and was unfortunate to only ever win one England cap. He would have won a second soon after his first as, during a game against Wales in 1976, the manager Don Revie said Parkes would play the second half, but at half-time with the score still at 0‚Äì0 Revie decided to keep Ray Clemence on. After the game Parkes went home and said to his wife he would never make himself available for England again.

It is on the main Dublin to Derry and Letterkenny road, the (N2), about 10 km (6 miles) north of Monaghan and 8 km (5 miles) south of Aughnacloy. Its population is about 700. History In 1959, a Bronze Age tomb was discovered which proved that there was a settlement at the site of the village more than 3,000 years ago. Unfortunately for historians, the urn and other artifacts found were inadvertently destroyed during excavation of the tomb. The name Scairbh na gCaorach (the Irish language name for Emyvale) means 'shallow ford of the sheep', referring to a low (and easily traversable) point in the Mountain Water river on which Emyvale is situated. The name is thought to have come from the Ui Meith tribe, the village's first inhabitants. Scairbh na gCaorach was abbreviated to \\"Scarna\\" in the early part of the 19th Century (indeed a local hostelry bears this name), although this fell out of common usage and village is now referred to by its English language name ‚Äì Emyvale. In the 8th century, the McKenna Clan arrived and, by the 12th century, they had established an independent t√∫ath or kingdom in North Monaghan which would last for the next 450 years. In more recent times, Emyvale was immortalised by the renowned 19th-century Irish writer William Carleton as part of his Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry series, which included The Fair of Emyvale (a short story based upon Carleton's experiences of the north Monaghan landscape where he was educated as a young man at a 'hedge school' situated beside St Mary's chapel, Glennan, near Glaslough).

Medina was knocked down twice early, but became a world champion by getting up and defeating Dorsey by a twelve-round decision. He made four defenses of his title, including victories against Tom Johnson, beaten by a nine rounds technical decision and Fabrice Benichou, another world champion boxer, outpointed by Medina over twelve rounds. His first reign as world featherweight champion took him to places like France and Italy. Medina lost the championship to Johnson by a twelve-round decision on their February 26, 1993 rematch, held in France. He turned to the super featherweight division, where he won one fight, then attempted to become world champion there also. But, on June 26 of the same year, he lost to IBF super featherweight champion John John Molina by a twelve-round decision, in Atlantic City. =2nd Championship Reign= Medina then returned to featherweight, where he won two more fights before facing Johnson in a rubber match, held on January 28, 1995 at Atlantic City. Johnson retained the IBF featherweight title he had won from Medina by beating him via a twelve-round decision. In his next fight, Medina won the WBC's regional Fecarbox title by defeating Juan Polo Perez by a twelve-round unanimous decision on March 15 in Miami, Florida. Medina's next fight was televised nationally in the United States, as he became world Featherweight champion for the second time, defeating Alejandro Gonz√°lez on September 23 of '95, with a twelve-round unanimous decision, at Sacramento, California, for the WBC featherweight title. He lost the title in his first defense, losing a twelve-round decision to Luisito Espinosa on December 11 at Tokyo, Japan. After a win, Medina tried to become a three time world featherweight champion by challenging Naseem Hamed for Hamed's WBO title, but he was defeated by Hamed with an eleventh-round knockout on August 31, 1996 in Dublin, Ireland. He followed that loss with a win, and another attempt at winning a world featherweight championship for a third time, this time around in a rematch with Espinosa. held on May 17, 1997. He lost to the Asian champion, this time by an eight rounds technical decision at Intramuros, Philippines. Medina then lost his next fight, by a ninth-round knockout on August 7, to future world champion Derrick Gainer. On October 18, he recovered from his two loss streak to defeat Jose Ayala in Homestead, Florida, winning the WBA's Fedecentro regional championship, and setting himself in a position to obtain another chance at winning the world featherweight title for the third time. He knocked Ayala out in the eighth round. =3rd Championship Reign= On April 24, 1998, Medina joined Carlos De Le√≥n, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Edwin Rosario, Evander Holyfield and a small number of other boxers in the exclusive group of fighters to reign as world champions three or more times in the same division, when he outpointed defending IBF title holder Hector Lizarraga over twelve rounds in San Jose, California. He retained the title on April 16, 1999, in Las Vegas with a nine rounds technical decision over former world super featherweight champion Victor Polo, then proceeded to lose the championship to Paul Ingle. The fight against Ingle, held on November 13 of the same year, in Hull, England, went on to be considered one of the fights of the year by boxing fans, experts and magazine writers alike. Floored in the second and tenth rounds, Medina almost saved his title when he dropped Ingle in the twelfth and last round. He ended up losing a unanimous decision, however. Medina then met future world champion Frank Toledo, beating him in Las Vegas by a ten-round decision on May 19, 2000. Toledo then went on to win the IBF title by outpointing Mbulelo Botile, who had defeated Ingle. Medina, meanwhile, picked up two more wins, including a fourth-round knockout over future world title challenger Mike Juarez. =4th Championship Reign= Medina and Toledo had a rematch on November 16, 2001, with Medina joining Robinson as a four-time world champion in the same division when he knocked Toledo out in the sixth round. His next fight was filled with controversy. Faced against former two division world champion Johnny Tapia on April 27, 2002, Medina lost the title by a twelve-round majority decision at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. The decision was criticized for months to come by writers from such publications as Ring and KO Magazine. The official scorecards reflected a very close fight, with two judges scoring it 115-113 for Tapia and a third scoring the fight a 114-114 tie. Medina's first attempt at tying Robinson's record as the only boxer to win a world title in the same division five times came on February 1, 2003, when he and Juan Manuel M√°rquez faced off in Las Vegas for the IBF championship vacated by Tapia. Medina was knocked out in the seventh round by Marquez, however. =5th Championship Reign= After two more wins, Medina got his second chance at becoming world featherweight champion for the fifth time against WBO champion Scott Harrison. The two boxers fought for the first time on July 12 at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow, Scotland. Medina made history and joined Robinson as the only two fighters in history to be five-time world champions in the same division, by defeating Harrison, who until then had been defeated only once, by a twelve-round split decision. A boxing magazine from the United States then called Medina the gambler's nightmare, because of his tendency to win world featherweight titles, lose them quickly, then regain them just as quick. Medina and Harrison were rematched on November 29 of the same year, and Harrison regained the WBO title with an eleventh-round knockout of Medina, again, at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow. =Super featherweight= Medina only fought once in 2004, defeating Leonardo Resendiz on July 23 at Rancho Mirage, California by a third-round knockout, to win the WBA's regional NABA super featherweight title. He was to fight Jos√© Miguel Cotto on August 20, 2005 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Had he beaten Cotto, he would have put himself in a position to challenge for the WBO super featherweight title. Cotto was not able to reduce weight to the super featherweight weight limit, however, so the fight was suspended. On 31-05-2006 he fought Cassius Baloyi for the IBF super featherweight title, the same title he'd challenged Molina for back in 1993, and lost by 11th-round TKO. Medina returned to outpoint Kevin Kelley by a twelve-round majority decision, then fought a rematch with Baloyi on 05-07-2007 which was scored a technical draw after Medina suffered a cut from an accidental clash of heads. In his final fight, Medina lost by a two-round TKO to Malcolm Klassen. These final three bouts were all IBF super featherweight Title Eliminators. Medina has a record of 64 wins and 15 losses in 78 professional boxing bouts, with 30 wins by way of knockout.

Biography Cagnola's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy Cagnola was born in Milan. He was sent at the age of fourteen to the Clementine College at Rome, and afterwards studied at the University of Pavia. He was intended for the legal profession, but his passion for architecture was too strong, and after holding some government posts at Milan, he entered as a competitor for the construction of the Porta Orientale. His designs were commended, but were not selected on account of the expense their adoption would have involved. From that time Cagnola devoted himself entirely to architecture. After the death of his father he spent two years in Verona and Venice, studying the architectural structures of these cities. In 1806 he was called upon to erect a triumphal arch for the marriage of Eugene Beauharnais with the princess of Bavaria. The arch was of wood, but was of such beauty that it was resolved to carry it out in marble. The first stone was laid on October 14, 1807. The end result was the magnificent Arco della Pace (\\"Arch of Peace\\") at Porta Sempione in Milan, surpassed in dimensions only by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Among other works executed by Cagnola are the Porta Ticinese and the chapel of Santa Marcellina in Milan, and the church tower in Urgnano. A statue of Luigi Cagnola at Palazzo Brera in Milan He died in Inverigo in 1833, five years before the Arco della Pace was completed. Outside of the town of Inverigo, he built a villa for himself, named Villa La Rotonda, completed by one of his pupils, Francesco Peverelli.

Similarly, the function epilogue appears at the end of the function, and restores the stack and registers to the state they were in before the function was called. The prologue and epilogue are not a part of the assembly language itself; they represent a convention used by assembly language programmers, and compilers of many higher-level languages. They are fairly rigid, having the same form in each function. Function prologue and epilogue also sometimes contain code for buffer overflow protection. Prologue A function prologue typically does the following actions if the architecture has a base pointer (also known as frame pointer) and a stack pointer: *Pushes current base pointer onto the stack, so it can be restored later. *Assigns the value of base pointer to the address of stack pointer (which is pointed to the top of the stack) so that the base pointer will pointed to the top of the stack. *Moves the stack pointer further by decreasing or increasing its value, depending on whether the stack grows down or up. On x86, the stack pointer is decreased to make room for the function's local variables. Several possible prologues can be written, resulting in slightly different stack configuration. These differences are acceptable, as long as the programmer or compiler uses the stack in the correct way inside the function. As an example, here‚Ä≤s a typical x86 assembly language function prologue as produced by the GCC push ebp mov ebp, esp sub esp, N The N immediate value is the number of bytes reserved on the stack for local use. The same result may be achieved by using the \`enter\` instruction: enter N, 0 More complex prologues can be obtained using different values (other than 0) for the second operand of the \`enter\` instruction. These prologues push several base/frame pointers to allow for nested functions, as required by languages such as Pascal. However, modern versions of these languages don‚Ä≤t use these instructions because they limit the nesting depth in some cases. Epilogue Function epilogue reverses the actions of the function prologue and returns control to the calling function. It typically does the following actions (this procedure may differ from one architecture to another): *Drop the stack pointer to the current base pointer, so room reserved in the prologue for local variables is freed. *Pops the base pointer off the stack, so it is restored to its value before the prologue. *Returns to the calling function, by popping the previous frame's program counter off the stack and jumping to it. The given epilogue will reverse the effects of either of the above prologues (either the full one, or the one which uses \`enter\`). Under certain calling conventions it is the callee's responsibility to clean the arguments off the stack, so the epilogue can also include the step of moving the stack pointer down or up. For example, these three steps may be accomplished in 32-bit x86 assembly language by the following instructions: mov esp, ebp pop ebp ret Like the prologue, the x86 processor contains a built-in instruction which performs part of the epilogue. The following code is equivalent to the above code: leave ret The \`leave\` instruction performs the \`mov\` and \`pop\` instructions, as outlined above. A function may contain multiple epilogues. Every function exit point must either jump to a common epilogue at the end, or contain its own epilogue. Therefore, programmers or compilers often use the combination of \`leave\` and \`ret\` to exit the function at any point. (For example, a C compiler would substitute a \`return\` statement with a \`leave\`/\`ret\` sequence).

It is located from the center of Paris.  Name  Map of Arcueil the 3rd Arcueil aqueduct, completed in 1900, and still supplying 145 000 m3 a day to Paris. The name Arcueil was recorded for the first time in 1119 as Arcolo√Ø, and later in the 12th century as Arco√Øalum, meaning \\"place of the arches\\" (Latin radical arcus, \\"arch\\", and Celtic suffix -ialo, \\"clearing, glade\\", \\"place of\\"), in reference to the Roman aqueduct carrying water to the Roman city of Lutetia (modern Paris). Still standing, the arches of the Roman aqueduct are still visible since the Middle Ages, crossing the Bi√®vre River valley near Arcueil.  History  C.W. Eckersberg painting from 1812. Between 1613 and 1624 a bridge-aqueduct over 1300 ft. long was constructed to convey water from the spring of Rungis, south of Arcueil, across the Bi√®vre river to the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. Between 1868 and 1872 another aqueduct, still longer, was superimposed above that of the 17th century, forming part of the system conveying water from the river Vanne to Paris. The commune of Arcueil was officially renamed Arcueil-Cachan in 1894, after the hamlet of Cachan located within the commune. On 26 December 1922, Cachan seceded from the commune of Arcueil-Cachan and became a commune in its own right. The reduced commune of Arcueil-Cachan was renamed simply Arcueil.

Though a comparatively minor character he has often been singled out for praise as one of the novel's most masterly creations.  His role in the novel  Mucklebackit first appears in the novel as one of the rescuers of Sir Arthur Wardour and his companions when they are stranded on a cliff-face and in danger of drowning. His impatience of the title-character Jonathan Oldbuck's interference is also seen for the first time. Much later Mucklebackit's son Steenie is drowned, and at the lad's funeral Saunders is almost incoherent with grief. Since he is too overcome to help to carry the coffin to the graveyard Oldbuck takes his place. While the interment is taking place the Mucklebackit cottage is visited by Lord Glenallan, who, unaware of the funeral, wishes to speak with Saunders' mother Elspeth. Saunders indignantly refuses him entrance, but is over-ruled by his mother. Oldbuck returns to find Mucklebackit repairing the fishing-boat from which Steenie had been swept, and says how pleased he is to find him capable of that job. Mucklebackit replies, > \\"And what would you have me to do‚Ä¶unless I wanted to see four children > starve, because ane is drowned? It's weel wi' you gentles, that can sit in > the house wi' handkerchers at your een when ye lose a friend; but the like > o' us maun to our wark again, if our hearts were beating as hard as my > hammer.\\"Chapter 34 Finding the job too much for him he flings his hammer aside, and Oldbuck offers to send a professional carpenter to repair the boat. Mucklebackit thanks him for this and for the honour he did him in helping to carry the body, and the two men break into tears.  Critical assessment  Several contemporary reviews of The Antiquary quoted the scene of the Mucklebackit funeral as a highlight of the novel. The Monthly Review found the scene strongly drawn with a terrible effectiveness, Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review found it \\"in the highest degree striking and pathetic\\", and the British Critic commented on how cold, forced and heartless various of Byron's poems seemed by comparison. Byron himself and Scott's son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart were both struck by the power of the scene in which Mucklebackit is found repairing his boat despite his son's death. Moving forward to the 20th century, Andrew Lang found the character of Mucklebackit to be an example of Scott's art at its very best. Virginia Woolf presented the same opinion through her character Mr. Ramsay in To the Lighthouse, and in her own voice said that in the funeral scene the various elements \\"come together‚Ä¶drawn, one knows not how, to make a whole, a complete presentation of life\\". The boat- repairing speech put Catherine Macdonald Maclean in mind of David's lament for Absalom in the Second Book of Samuel. John Buchan wrote that Mucklebackit and Edie Ochiltree were the true heroes of The Antiquary, and that through strong emotion the fisherman rose to an epic dignity with the austere quality of the sagas. Scott's biographer Edgar Johnson praised the \\"racy and picturesque Scots\\" of Mucklebackit's dialogue, and found his rhetoric \\"beautiful and effective\\", but wondered whether its poetry and eloquence were true to life. David D. Brown thought the interchange between Mucklebackit and Oldbuck the most poignant in all Scott's work, Mucklebackit being Scott's \\"only spokesman for the incipient working classes\\". Likewise Harry E. Shaw found the boat- repairing scene unforgettable, and saw Mucklebackit as the voice of social protest by the Scottish peasant class against the gentry. Jane Millgate considered the tragedy of Mucklebackit's bereavement an essential strand of the novel's plot, in that it shows us the empathetic and humane side of Oldbuck's character and prepares both Oldbuck and the reader for his generous response to Lord Glenallan's plea for help in recovering his lost son. The scholar Robin Mayhead, noting that Mucklebackit is, with Edie Ochiltree, the character furthest from sham and pretension, was reminded of the stoical Scott who endured the troubled years that followed the death of his wife Charlotte.

Canoelands is 60 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Hornsby Shire and The Hills Shire. Geography Canoelands is a small hamlet within Glenorie, consisting of some 80 houses and 247 people extending out towards the east from Old Northern Road. Canoelands is between the hamlets of Forest Glen and Maroota and is 10 km north of the village of Glenorie and 20 km south of the village of Wisemans Ferry. By road, Canoelands is 55 km north of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The landform of the area is on Canoelands Ridge, a high, undulating, dissected plateau of Hawkesbury Sandstone with many steep gullies covered with dry sclerophyll forest, predominantly tall varieties of hardwood trees of the genus Eucalyptus. It has an area of 60 km¬≤ and is surrounded on three sides by the Marramarra National Park, a wilderness area of 11,759 ha. Mount Blake lies some 2 km east of the eastern end of Canoelands Road. The geodetic survey station there is 270.3 m above sea level. This makes it one of the highest natural points between the northern side of Sydney Harbour and the Hawkesbury River. The highest point at 278m is at 49 Canoelands Rd. All drainage from the area is into the Hawkesbury-Nepean Basin. History =Aboriginal culture= The area was inhabited by Indigenous Australians of the Dharug-speaking tribes. To the west they join the Boorooberongal clan (which extended to Windsor) and the Cattai clan (extending to Richmond) and to the south they joined the Bidjigal people around Castle Hill. To the east they joined the large Eora-speaking tribes which covered the coastal area. Within Canoelands there are many aboriginal rock carvings in caves and on rocky outcrops. These are all under the care of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. =European settlement= In early times, it became a timber-getting area for Sydney. The treefellers found tall stringybark gumtrees (E. cephalocarpa) with large, uniform patches of bark missing. These pieces of bark were cut out with stone axes and used by the local Aboriginal people to make canoes to use on the Hawkesbury River. Such trees were aptly named canoe trees. As the trees were used for mill logs, none remains in the area but preserved specimens may be examined at other places, e.g., in the Pioneers Park at Griffith, New South Wales. The area was originally named \\"The Canoe Grounds\\" and is shown as such in a Gregory's Directory of 1946. Some time after that it became known as \\"Canoelands\\". This name was officially gazetted in the N.S.W Government Gazette dated 12.11.1993 and had its boundaries specified and officially designated as a suburb of Sydney in the N.S.W. Government Gazette No.145, dated 01.12.1995. The first landholding in the Parish of Marramarra, which includes Canoelands, was of on the northern side of Marramarra Creek below Mount Blake. It was purchased by John Blake for One Pound Ten Shillings Sterling on 6 June 1835. The land had been advertised for sale by auction in an advertisement dated 13 December 1834. Transport Old Northern Road was convict-built and is a major connecting route stretching north for 34 km from Baulkham Hills to Wisemans Ferry. The suburb has two other roadways, Canoelands Road which is a 9 km long cul-de-sac and Marra Avenue which is a 2.2 km long cul-de-sac. The former is bituminised for most of its length and the latter has a wholly bituminised surface. Picturesque rural, mountain and city views can be had from many locations along these roads. The first and still the only street light in the suburb was erected on the corner of Old Northern and Canoelands Roads on 6 June 1994. At first it was only activated by the headlights of approaching cars but this proved to be quite erratic. After a month or two this was abandoned and it was lit as at present, from sunset until sunrise. Rural areas Canoelands is at the far northern end of the Hornsby Shire Council's coverage and has the Local Government land usage classification of Rural Lands. Holdings must have a minimum area of 10 ha which cannot be subdivided and only one dwelling may be erected on each. However, the erection of necessary agricultural buildings is permitted. Industry in the area consists of four commercial plant nurseries and three large stonefruit orchards. The orchards are largely covered by synthetic netting to minimise the depredations of grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) which attack the fruit trees when carrying fruit. The fruits grown are peaches, nectarines and plums. There is also some cashcrop market gardening such as tomatoes, snowpeas and zucchini from time to time. Apiarists bring their beehives when the orchards are in flower for their bees to gather honey and assist in the pollination and setting of fruit. A very large nursery exists nearby on the western side of Old Northern Road but as this roadway forms the boundary between two Shires, it is situated in the Shire of Baulkham Hills and is not technically in Canoelands, but in Glenorie. There is an aggregate quarry and a sandstone quarry in the area. The Hawkesbury sandstone is a basically cream-coloured sedimentary rock with colourful patterns of red, orange, yellow and white. It was once used to build houses but is now used as dimension stone and sawn stone, principally for landscaping architecture or as feature panels in housing. The area also contains some lenses of white and blue shale, the former being used as an admixture with clay to make blonde housebricks. Services No shopping facility is available in Canoelands, the nearest being in Glenorie or in the major regional shopping centre of Castle Hill, some 32 km to the south. The Canoelands Rural Fire Brigade station and the local optical fibre telephone exchange are both located at the corner of Canoelands and Old Northern Roads. The area has single and 3-phase electricity, natural gas, telephone and broadband services online but is without reticulated water or sewerage, residents relying on rainwater tanks and dams for water and on septic systems for sewage disposal. Many homes have stand-by diesel-powered generators to safeguard the operation of their water supply pumps and refrigeration in case of power blackouts. One residence is fully solar-powered. The Sydney-Newcastle oil/gas pipeline runs along a good length of Canoelands Road before turning north to go under the Hawkesbury River and has two radio-controlled valve stations in Canoelands.

Content  When the channel first launched in 2005, it mostly focused on US dramas and repeats of Channel 4 programmes. Having shown all five weekday editions of The Daily Show since More4's launch, in January 2011 the channel scaled back its commitment to one episode a week in order to increase investment in its arts programming. On 23 January 2012, More4 refocused towards more lifestyle based content.http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/more4-is-evolving Documentaries which previously aired on the channel moved to its parent station Channel 4. Branding =2005‚Äì2012= More4 share of viewing 2005-2007 BARB figures In September 2005, Channel 4 began running teaser trailers for the new station (although the name was neither mentioned nor seen in the adverts). Showing neon lettering, the teasers hinted at \\"adult entertainment\\". Some people may have been confused by the deliberate double- meaning of these trailers and mistakenly presumed the new channel would be of a pornographic nature. The Daily Mail refused to accept launch advertising for the channel on these grounds. Advertisements starting at the end of September made it much clearer that the \\"adult entertainment\\" being offered was the 'intelligent and insightful' programming. Viewing figures for the launch date gave More4 an average figure of 269,000 viewers, compared to E4's 296,000. The original More4 branding was designed by Spin and animated by DBLG. =2012‚Äì2018= On 23 January 2012, More4 adopted a new logo and on-air branding. The logo and channel idents were designed by London-based design and motion company ManvsMachine and Channel 4's in-house agency, 4Creative. The repositioning of the brand coincided with the channel's move towards more lifestyle content and a move away from documentaries and arts. The idents focus on moving mechanical \\"scrapbooks\\" which also refers to the Digital Scrapbook platform.ManvsMachine - More4 Rebrand 2012 = 2018-present = A new logo and branding was introduced in 2018.https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logos_for_all_channel_4_by_4creative_and_manvsmachine.php The branding was not major, the idents stayed the same but the logo was changed. This was part of the Channel 4 major rebranding across all their channels.  Availability  Space was reserved on Freeview multiplex C for the channel. However, despite Channel 4 saying that the channel would appear on multiplex C, the channel appeared on multiplex 2. A place holder appeared on the Freeview EPG at number 13 on 13 September and after a time, ran a looping teaser trailer. More4 +1 became available on the DTT platform on 14 December 2005. It was removed on 18 May 2006, to make way for live coverage of Big Brother, and the Freeview launch of Film4 later in the year. While More4 is available on most cable platforms, More4 +1 was available on Virgin Media until 20 August 2007 when it was replaced by Channel 4 +1 across the digital television network. It was re-added on 15 January 2013. Despite initial advertising and official internet communication that it would be free-to-air on satellite television, More4 was encrypted under Sky's pay TV scheme until 6 May 2008 when it dropped its NDS encryption and went free-to-air. It joined the BBC and ITV's new satellite platform, Freesat on the same day. More4 is available outside the UK where it is available to viewers in Ireland via Sky and Virgin Media Ireland's digital service. This led to further speculation that Channel 4 would eventually launch on Sky in Ireland, which it did in December 2006. Channel 4 has already made its other flagship channels: E4, E4 +1, Film4 and Film4 +1 available in Ireland via Sky, Virgin Media Ireland digital TV providers. Channel 4 itself is available on almost all Irish cable and MMDS systems (in some cases Channel 4 is replaced with S4C). In Switzerland, the channel is available among other Channel 4 branded channels on UPC Switzerland and on Swisscom TV. More4 +2 launched on 16 April 2012 on Sky channel 269, in the lifestyle section of the guide. The temporary channel, which aired for a limited period between 7:45 pm and 11.00 pm, was short lived, because it closed on 26 June 2012 ahead of the launch of 4seven on 4 July. HD feed Channel 4 anticipated that More4 HD would launch in 2011, however a launch did not occur. As part of More4's rebrand in January 2012, ManvsMachine created the channel logo for More4 HD. On 14 September 2012, Channel 4 announced that More4 HD would launch on Sky. The channel then launched on 4 February 2013. More4 HD also became available to Virgin Media viewers on channel 203 on 1 October 2013.

He developed the Refal programming language, the theory of metasystem transitions and the notion of supercompilation. He was as a pioneer in artificial intelligence and a proponent of the global brain hypothesis. Biography Turchin was born in 1931 in Podolsk, Soviet Union. In 1952, he graduated from Moscow University in Theoretical Physics, and got his Ph.D. in 1957. After working on neutron and solid-state physics at the Institute for Physics of Energy in Obninsk, in 1964 he accepted a position at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics in Moscow. There he worked in statistical regularization methods and authored REFAL, one of the first AI languages and the AI language of choice in the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, Turchin became politically active. In Fall 1968, he wrote the pamphlet The Inertia of Fear, which was quite widely circulated in samizdat, the writing began to be circulated under the title The Inertia of Fear: Socialism and Totalitarianism in Moscow from 1976. Following its publication in the underground press, he lost his research laboratory. In 1970 he authored \\"The Phenomenon of Science\\", a grand cybernetic meta-theory of universal evolution, which broadened and deepened the earlier book. By 1973, Turchin had founded the Moscow chapter of Amnesty International with Andrey Tverdokhlebov and was working closely with the well-known physicist and Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. In 1974 he lost his position at the Institute, and was persecuted by the KGB. Facing almost certain imprisonment, he and his family were forced to emigrate from the Soviet Union in 1977. He went to New York, where he joined the faculty of the City University of New York in 1979. In 1990, together with Cliff Joslyn and Francis Heylighen, he founded the Principia Cybernetica Project, a worldwide organization devoted to the collaborative development of an evolutionary- cybernetic philosophy. In 1998, he co-founded the software start-up SuperCompilers, LLC. He retired from his post of Professor of Computer Science at City College in 1999.

He has two sons named Peter Turchin and Dimitri Turchin. Peter Turchin is a specialist in population dynamics and mathematical modeling of historical dynamics. Work The philosophical core of Turchin's scientific work is the concept of the metasystem transition, which denotes the evolutionary process through which higher levels of control emerge in system structure and function. Turchin uses this concept to provide a global theory of evolution and a coherent social systems theory, to develop a complete cybernetics philosophical and ethical system, and to build a constructivist foundation for mathematics.

Family, education and early life Gruffydd was born in Gorffwysfa, Bethel, in the parish of Llanddeiniolen, Caernarfonshire, the son of a quarryman. In 1894, after elementary schooling at Bethel primary school, he was one of the first students to join the recently opened Caernarvon County School.The school was the first intermediate school to open under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act, 1889. It is now Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen, a bilingual comprehensive secondary school for pupils aged 11‚Äì18, in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. In 1899, he won a place at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating in English literature. In 1904 he was appointed Assistant Master at Beaumaris Grammar School, and in 1906 Lecturer in Celtic at University College, Cardiff (now Cardiff University). In 1909 he married Gwenda Evans, the daughter of a minister of religion from Abercarn. They had one son. During the First World War he volunteered for service with the Royal Navy : he served from 1915 to 1918 as a naval officer in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. On being demobilised, he was appointed Professor of Celtic at University College, Cardiff (succeeding Professor Thomas Powel, who retired in 1918), and he held the chair until his retirement in 1946. Celtic poet and academic Gruffydd specialised in Celtic culture. He became a schoolteacher and worked in Scarborough and then for two years at Beaumaris Grammar School before taking a post as assistant lecturer in Celtic studies at University College, Cardiff in 1906; from 1918 until 1946 he was Professor of Celtic. He was President of Council of the National Eisteddfod of Wales and edited Y Llenor ('The Litt√©rateur', a highly influential Welsh language journal of literature published by the university). He wrote poetry and prose and contributed to Welsh scholarship by publishing important histories of Welsh literature and legend. Politics Gruffydd took an interest in Welsh politics and social questions, coming from a nonconformist, radical family. He was a member of Plaid Cymru and served as deputy vice-president in 1937. However, Gruffydd voiced disagreement with Plaid Cymru party president Saunders Lewis, which eventually led to his leaving the party.[A History of Wales, by John Davies, page 610] Gruffydd was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the University of Wales seat on 29 January 1943 after the sitting MP Ernest Evans became a County Court Judge. Gruffydd's opponent in the by-election was Plaid's Saunders Lewis, and he had effectively split the Welsh-speaking community. He was comfortably re-elected in the 1945 general election and sat until the abolition of University seats in 1950. He did not stand again for Parliament. Historians' judgment The 1945 general election brought a reduction in Liberal strength in the House of Commons and was particularly savage for its leadership. Sir Archibald Sinclair the party leader lost his seat in Caithness and Sutherland, the Chief Whip Sir Percy Harris and William Beveridge were also beaten. In fact apart from Gwilym Lloyd-George who was in any case travelling in the direction of the Tories every Liberal MP who had ever held government office was defeated.Roy Douglas, The History of the Liberal Party 1895-1970; Sidgwick and Jackson, 1971 p.248 This meant a new leader was required. Gruffydd was not a candidate and historians have noted that he was more concerned with his academic work than with trying to make a career in politicsAlun Wyburn-Powell, Clement Davies: Liberal Leader; Poltico's, 2003 pp 140, 142 but the judgment of one historian of the Liberal Party that he was an academic of extremely limited political experience only sitting in the House because of the University seats, seems unduly harsh in the light of Gruffydd's long-time association with Welsh political and social affairsSee, K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics: 1868-1922; University of Wales Press, 1963 p.197 & Emyr Price, David Lloyd George;University of Wales Press, 2006 pp197-8 previous vice-presidency of Plaid Cymru and his managing to be returned to the House of Commons when so many others were falling by the wayside - even candidates for university seats had to win the votes of real voters.Jorgen Scott Rasmussen, The Liberal Party: A Study of Retrenchment and Revival; Constable, 1965 p.41 Death Gruffydd died at his home in Bangor Road, Caernarfon, on 29 September 1954. He was buried in the cemetery at Llanddeiniolen near the yew tree about which he composed one of his most famous poems.

The Irish name Inis Cathaigh was formerly anglicised Iniscathy, which later became Iniscattery and finally Scattery. The island is home to a lighthouse, a ruined monastery, an Irish round tower and the remains of an artillery battery. The last residents left in 1969. Most of the island is now owned by the Office of Public Works, who run a small visitor centre and carry out repairs and maintenance on the island; it was bought by D√∫chas in 1991. Saint Senan St. Senan was born at Magh Lacha, Kilrush, County Clare, ca. 488 (died 1 March 560). His parents were named Erean and Comgella. His birth was prophetically announced by St. Patrick on his visit to the U√≠ Fidgenti (in County Limerick) As a boy Senan was placed under the guidance of an abbot named Cassidan, finishing his studies under St. Naul at Kilmanagh, County Kilkenny.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Senan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 14 Feb. 2014 Senan commenced his missionary career by founding a church near Enniscorthy, in either 510 or 512. The parish is still known as Templeshannon (Teampul Senain). He then visited Cornwall, founding a church at Sennen's Cove, another was founded in Brittany (France) at Plouzane (church of Senan). He is also believed to have visited Menevia, Rome, and Tours. He returned to Ireland around 520. Having founded churches at Inniscarra (County Cork), at Inisluinghe, at Deer Island, Inismore, and Mutton Island, he finally settled at Iniscathay, or Inis Cathaigh, County Clare. He was visited by Saints Ciar√°n and Brendan, and other holy men, who had heard of his sanctity and miracles. Inis Cathaigh became not only a famous abbey but the seat of a bishopric with St. Senan as its first bishop. This event may be dated as somewhere between 535 and 540. St. Senan's jurisdiction extended over the existing Baronies of Moyarta and Clonderalaw in Thomond, the Barony of Connelo, Limerick as well as a small portion of Kerry from the Feal to the Atlantic. The ruins in 2004 The legend of \\"St. Senanus and the Lady\\", as told in Tom Moore's lyric, is founded on the fact that no woman was allowed to enter Inis Cathaigh; not even St. Senan's sister, St. Cannera, was permitted to land there. Yet St. Senan founded two convents for nuns, and was actually on a visit to one of them when he died. Legend has it that when St. Cannera died, she willed it that she should be buried near Senan. To stay true to his own edicts, Senan waited until low tide to bury her in the inter-tidal zone, which was not officially part of the \\"island\\", thus fulfilling his sister's wish while not breaking his own rules.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Senan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 28 Oct. 2014 St. Senan was buried in the abbey church of Iniscathay on 8 March, on which day his feast is observed. One of the earliest references to the Round Tower of Inniscathay is in the Irish life of St. Senan. Viking period The Vikings first raided Inis Cathaigh in 815, killing many of the monks.Irish islands - Scattery The monastery was plundered repeatedly until the Vikings came to settle there themselves in the mid-tenth century. This, in turn, led to attacks by Irish kings. Inis Cathaigh was a part of the Norse Kingdom of Limerick, which included not only Limerick itself but also several other bases in western and even northern Ireland. Given its strategic location at the mouth of the Shannon estuary, it effectively controlled all maritime traffic up the Shannon to Limerick. The Annals of Inishfallen record that during the 970s, Norse kings of Limerick were resident at Scattery Island.\\"Limerick\\", Vikingeskibsmuseet In 974, Maccus mac Arailt, King of the Isles captured Ivar of Limerick, but he \\"escaped over sea\\" the following year. Ivar of Limerick (last Norse king of the city), along with two of his sons, was slain on Inis Cathaigh by Brian Boru in 977. Ecclesiastical history The ruins in 1902 Scattery Island Cathedral and monastery is an early Christian place of pilgrimage, where St Senan, Bishop and confessor, founded a monastery, in the Shannon estuary, 5 km southwest of Kilrush, County Clare, Ireland. There are the remains of his oratory and house and of seven rude churches or chapels, together with a round tower and a holy well still in repute. It is fortified and marked by a lighthouse. At an early period the abbot-bishop of the monastery was considered to exercise authority over what later became the dioceses of Killaloe, Limerick and Ardfert.Butler, The Lives of the Primitive Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints (J. Muir 1798), p. 91 After the Synod of R√°th Breasail in 1111 a canonical diocese of Inis Cathaig (the spelling then current) was established. This was absorbed by the Diocese of Killaloe in 1189,Annette Kehnel, Clonmacnois: The Church and Lands of St Ciar√°n (LIT Verlag, M√ºnster 1997 ), p. 173 but was restored by Pope Innocent VI and continued as a separate see under Bishop Thomas (1358‚Äì68). In 1378 its possessions were divided, and the island remained a portion of the Diocese of Killaloe, being subsequently merged into the parish of Kilrush. However, there is mention of an Englishman, John Grene, as Bishop of Inis Cathaig in 1467. Inis Cathaig is now listed among the titular sees of the Catholic Church.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 909 Titular bishops of Inis Cathaig:Catholic Hierarchy page *Thomas Jerome Welsh (1970-1974) *William Anthony Hughes (1974-1979) *John Edward Heaps (1981-2004) *Frank Joseph Caggiano (2006-2013) Artillery battery The artillery battery, located on the south of Scattery, was built during the Napoleonic Wars and is preserved quite well. The Shannon Estuary was one of 3 invasion places the French had considered along the west of Ireland.http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3997,en.pdf As such, different places along the estuary were considered for establishing a defence. Scattery Island is one of 6 batteries in the estuary.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/battery.html Scattery Island was chosen on the proposal of defected French general Charles-Fran√ßois du P√©rier Dumouriez.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/fortifications/chap1_shannon_fortifications.htm The battery forms a semi-circular D shape with a dry moat. The battery main armament consisted of six 24 pounder long guns arranged along the length of the curved D. These were mounted on traversing mounts in purpose built gun emplacements. Each gun could traverse 90 degrees on its mount, giving the battery a total engagement angle of over 200 degrees. These could fire out over the estuary and coordinated crossfire was possible with its southern shore sister battery on Carrig Island. The block house barracks had two 5¬Ω inch howitzer gun emplacements on the roof for close quarters defence of its vulnerable rear, but these could be deployed to any incident due to their 360 degree mounting platforms. The choice of 5¬Ω inch made interoperability of ammunition between the primary and secondary armaments possible. Even though they by themselves would not have been powerful enough to stop an invasion they would have been able to cause a lot of damage to any enemy fleet. Demographics Former residents In 1842, after the salvaging the Windsor Castle, Inis Cathaigh was home to Shannon Estuary Pilots and their families. The primary families of the island were the Brennan, Melican, Scanlan, McMahon, Costelloe, Hehir, Moran, and Griffin. The river pilots were highly skilled mariners, using only native currachs (canvas boats) to reach incoming and outgoing ships. The inhabitants of Scattery Island appear to have escaped the deaths and emigration associated within Kilrush and most of Ireland during the famine period. The total population of the island including the soldiers, actually increased from 65 in 1841 to 99 in 1851 and to 139 in 1861. The numbers of houses in this period increased from 9 in 1841 to 24 in 1861. The memorial inscriptions on the gravestones do not show any deaths of islanders during the period 1845 to 1850. It is thought that a combination of fishing, additional shipping due to famine exports to England, along with piloting provided good employment for the pilots and their families.Scanlan, Senan, \\"Inhabitants of Scattery Island, Shannon Estuary, Co.

Originally published in Scotland in 1956 and in the United States in 1959,Macionis, John J., and Linda M. Gerber. 2010. Sociology (7th Canadian ed.). Pearson Canada Inc. p. 11. it is Goffman‚Äôs first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association's MacIver award in 1961. In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed the work as the tenth most important sociological book of the 20th century. Background and summary The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life was the first book to treat face-to-face interaction as a subject of sociological study. Goffman treats it as a kind of report in which he frames out the theatrical performance that applies to these interactions. He believes that when an individual comes in contact with other people, that individual will attempt to control or guide the impression that others might make of him by changing or fixing his or her setting, appearance, and manner. At the same time, the person the individual is interacting with is trying to form and obtain information about the individual.Trevino, James. 2003. Goffman's Legacy. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p. 35. Believing that all participants in social interactions are engaged in practices to avoid being embarrassed or embarrassing others, Goffman developed his dramaturgical analysis, wherein he observes a connection between the kinds of acts that people put on in their daily life and theatrical performances. In social interaction, as in theatrical performance, there is a front region where the performers (individuals) are on stage in front of the audiences. This is where the positive aspect of the idea of self and desired impressions are highlighted. There is also a back region, where individuals can prepare for or set aside their role.Ritzer, George. 2008. Sociological Theory. McGraw-Hill Higher Education. p. 372. The \\"front\\" or performance that an actor plays out includes \\"manner,\\" or how the role is carried out, and \\"appearance\\" including the dress and look of the performer. Often, performers work together in \\"teams\\" and form bonds of collegiality based on their common commitment to the performance they are mutually engaged in. The core of Goffman's analysis lies in this relationship between performance and life. Unlike other writers who have used this metaphor, Goffman seems to take all elements of acting into consideration: an actor performs on a setting which is constructed of a stage and a backstage; the props in both settings direct his action; he is being watched by an audience, but at the same time he may be an audience for his viewers' play. According to Goffman, the social actor in many areas of life will take on an already established role, with pre-existing front and props as well as the costume he would wear in front of a specific audience. The actor's main goal is to keep coherent and adjust to the different settings offered him. This is done mainly through interaction with other actors. To a certain extent this imagery bridges structure and agency enabling each while saying that structure and agency can limit each other. = Translated titles = Since the metaphor of a theatre is the leading theme of the book, the German and consequently also the Czech translation used a fitting summary as the name of the book We All Play-Act (German: Wir Alle Spielen Theater; Czech: V≈°ichni hrajeme divadlo), apart from the names in other languages that usually translate the title literally. Another translation, which also builds on the leading theatrical theme, rather than the original title, is the Swedish title of the book The Self and the Masks (Jaget och Maskerna). The French title is La Mise en sc√®ne de la vie quotidienne (The Staging of Everyday Life).  Concepts  = Definition of the situation = A major theme that Goffman treats throughout the work is the fundamental importance of having an agreed upon definition of the situation in a given interaction, which serves to give the interaction coherency. In interactions or performances the involved parties may be audience members and performers simultaneously; the actors usually foster impressions that reflect well upon themselves and encourage the others, by various means, to accept their preferred definition. Goffman acknowledges that when the accepted definition of the situation has been discredited, some or all of the actors may pretend that nothing has changed, provided that they find this strategy profitable to themselves or wish to keep the peace. For example, when a person attending a formal dinner‚Äîand who is certainly striving to present himself or herself positively‚Äîtrips, nearby party-goers may pretend not to have seen the fumble; they assist the person in maintaining face. Goffman avers that this type of artificial, willed credulity happens on every level of social organization, from top to bottom. = Self- presentation theory = The book proposes a theory of self that has become known as self-presentation theory, which suggests that people have the desire to control the impressions that other people form about them. The concept is still used by researchers in social media today, including Kaplan and Haenlein's Users of the World Unite (2010), Belk's Extended Self in a Digital World (2013), and Nell Haynes' Social Media in Northern Chile: Posting the Extraordinarily Ordinary (2016). Reception In 1961, Goffman received the American Sociological Association's MacIver award for The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Philosopher Helmut R. Wagner called the book \\"by far\\" Goffman's best book and \\"a still unsurpassed study of the management of impressions in face-to-face encounters, a form of not uncommon manipulation.\\" In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life as the tenth most important sociological book of the twentieth century, behind Talcott Parsons' The Structure of Social Action (1937).

The words below the statue (\\"... we forgive and ask for forgiveness\\") are a quote from the Letter, which was authored by Kominek. The Pastoral Letter of the Polish Bishops to their German Brothers (; ) was a pastoral letter sent on 18 November 1965 by Polish bishops of the Roman Catholic Church to their German counterparts. It was foremost an invitation to the 1000 Year Anniversary Celebrations of Poland's Christianization in 966. In this invitation letter the bishops asked for cooperation not only with Catholics but with Protestants as well. While recalling past and recent historical events, the bishops stretched out their hands in forgiveness and are asking for forgiveness. Here referred to as Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops it is actually only one part of the extensive groundbreaking invitation and letter, where they declared: \\"We forgive and ask for forgiveness\\" (for the crimes of World War II). Significance It was one of the first attempts at reconciliation after the tragedies of the Second World War, in which Germany invaded Poland; both countries lost millions of people, while millions more, both Poles and Germans, had to flee from their homes or were forcibly resettled. Pope Pius XII had nominated German bishops over Polish dioceses, which was seen as the Holy See's recognition of the German conquest, and generated popular feeling against the Vatican.Life 19 Nov 1945 A much larger part was the invitation and the attempt of the Catholic bishops to gain distance from the Communists who were ruling Poland. Among prominent supporters of this letter was Krakow's Archbishop, Karol Wojty≈Ça, who later became Pope John Paul II in 1978. The letter was answered by bishops of both of the then-two Germanies together. Reaction Widely publicised in Poland's churches, the letter drew a strong reaction from the Communist authorities of the People's Republic of Poland. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka saw it as clearly aimed at countering his propaganda, which saw West Germany as the main external enemy of Poland and continued hostility between Poland and West Germany as one of the main guarantees of social order in the Recovered Territories. To counteract the threat of losing control over people's minds, the Communist authorities reacted with anti-German and anti-Catholic hysteria. The Primate of Poland, Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski, was denied a passport for his trip to Rome and on January 15, 1966, Gomu≈Çka announced preparations for state celebrations of the 1000 Years of the Polish State, intended as a countermeasure against the church-sponsored celebrations of 1000 years of the baptism of Poland. Most German linguists were forced to sign a letter of protest; those who refused were fired from their universities. In addition, the authorities twice refused permission for a planned visit of Pope Paul VI to Poland in 1966. The following year the Polish United Workers' Party planned to limit the number of religious schools, which was also seen as a penalty for the Letter of Reconciliation. The anti-church campaign lasted until Gomu≈Çka's downfall in 1970.

He was former director at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T√ºbingen, Germany. His book Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology became famous in Robotics and among Psychologists, in which he described how hypothetical analog vehicles (a combination of sensors, actuators and their interconnections), though simple in design, can exhibit behaviors akin to aggression, love, foresight, and optimism.http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~beall/vehicles.pdf These have come to be known as Braitenberg vehicles. His pioneering scientific work was concerned with the relation between structures and functions of the brain. Life Valentino Braitenberg grew up in the province of South Tyrol. Braitenberg's father was Senator ,Z am Sonntag, Nr. 37/2011 vom 11. September 2011; S.3 a member of the South Tyrolean nobility. Since the age of 6, Braitenberg grew up bilingual in the two languages Italian and German. German was spoken at home and all schooling was Italian, conform to the historic context. The humanistic Lyceum-Gymnasium (High school) in Bolzano gave him an excellent classic education including Italian literature. The German literary education was based on the classical writers he found in the extensive home library. In addition, he trained as a violinist at the in Bolzano and became a talented violinist and violist. Braitenberg studied Medicine and Psychiatry at the Universities of Innsbruck and Rome between 1945 and 1954. He accompanied his studies with chamber music performances with his viola and violin, where he developed a repertoire of violin-piano duos with a colleague. He completed his medical training with an internship at the psychiatric clinic in Rome, where he decided to prefer a scientific career dedicated to the understanding of brain functions. He spent a few years at Yale University in New Haven (USA) when he was invited by Prof. Eduardo Caianiello in 1958 to set up a biocybernetics research group at the Physics Institute of the University of Naples Federico II, the ‚ÄúLaboratorio di Cibernetica‚Äù. Between 1958 and 1968 he was adjunct Professor of Cybernetics at the Physics Institute of the University of Naples. In 1963 Braitenberg earned the Libera Docenza in Cybernetics and Information Theory, the title that used to grant access to Professorship at Italian Universities. From 1968 until his retirement in 1994 he was co-founder and co-Director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T√ºbingen and Honorary Professor at the Universities of T√ºbingen and Freiburg. After 1994 he was appointed Professor at the Specialization School in Scienze Motorie (Motoric Sciences) at the Rovereto branch of the University of Rovereto. From 1998 to 2001 he was president of the Laboratorio di Scienze Cognitive at the University of Trento in Rovereto. Braitenberg received an honorary doctorate from the University of Salzburg in 1995. Braitenberg was married to the painter Elisabeth Hanna. They had three children, Margareta, Carla, and Zeno.  Works  According to Maier (2012), Maier, E. (2012). Spying on God. MaxPlanckResearch Magazine, 12(3), 86-87. Retrieved from http://www.mpg.de/6348834/S005_Flashback_086-087.pdf Braitenberg's interest in understanding the brain began in 1948, when he looked for the first time at some human brain tissue under a microscope. He said that although the connections seemed unbelievably complex, Braitenberg eventually realised that computers could serve as a useful model for understanding the brain. She said that he made seminal contributions to understanding the neuroanatomy of the cerebellum, the wiring of the eye of the fly, and the organisation of the human cerebrum. Braitenberg published more than 180 scientific works during his lifetime, not including abstracts, reprints, translations into different languages, and different editions of some of his works.http://www.braitenberg.eu According to a search of Google Scholar in September 2014, Braitenberg's book, Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology, had received at least 2622 citations.

The manakins are a family (Pipridae) of small bird species of subtropical and tropical Central and South America. Sound-making mechanism The structures were first noted by P. L. Sclater in 1860, and the sound production adaptations were discussed by Charles Darwin in 1871 Like several other manakins, the club-winged manakin produces a mechanical sound with its extremely modified secondary remiges, an effect known as sonation. The manakins adapted their wings in this odd way as a result of sexual selection. In manakins, the males have evolved adaptations to suit the females' attraction towards sound. Wing sounds in various manakin lineages have evolved independently. Some species pop like a firecracker, and there are a couple that make whooshing noises in flight. The club-winged manakin has the unique ability to produce musical sounds with its wings. Each wing of the club-winged manakin has one feather with a series of at least seven ridges along its central vane. Next to the strangely ridged feather is another feather with a stiff, curved tip. When the bird raises its wings over its back, it shakes them back and forth over 100 times a second (hummingbirds typically flap their wings only 50 times a second). Each time it hits a ridge, the tip produces a sound. The tip strikes each ridge twice: once as the feathers collide, and once as they move apart again. This raking movement allows a wing to produce 14 sounds during each shake. By shaking its wings 100 times a second, the club-winged manakin can produce up to 1,400 single sounds during that time. In order to withstand the repeated beating of its wings together, the club-winged manakin has evolved solid wing bones (by comparison, the bones of most birds are hollow, making flight easier). The wing bones are not as efficient for flying, but are what has evolved via sexual selection. While this \\"spoon-and-washboard\\" anatomy is a well-known sound-producing apparatus in insects (see stridulation), it had not been well documented in vertebrates (some snakes stridulate too, but they do not have dedicated anatomical features for it).

The poem, which takes the French Emperor Napoleon III as its subject, was largely written in Florence in the early 1860s before apparently being abandoned. It appears that the poem was largely forgotten while Browning worked on Dramatis Personae and The Ring and the Book, which raised his profile and commercial appeal. In 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War and the forced end of Napoleon's reign, Browning dusted off his lengthy poem and made some revisions and additions before publishing it as Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau in December 1871. Sales were initially very strong, with more than one and a half thousand copies being sold in the first week, but they soon tailed off sharply; the poem's length and complexity apparently put off prospective readers, and the first printing run failed to sell out. No second edition was ever required. Some critics have called this poem the least-read of all Browning's works, though unlike Sordello 31 years earlier, the poem's reception had no discernible damaging effect on his continued popularity and strong critical reputation.

Corporate governance varies between countries, especially regarding the board system. There are countries that have a one-tier board system (like the U.S.) and there are others that have a two-tier board system like Germany. In a one-tier board, all the directors (both executive directors as well as non-executive directors) form one board, called the board of directors. In a two-tier board there is an executive board (all executive directors) and a separate supervisory board (all non-executive directors).  Germany  German corporation law, the Aktiengesetz, requires all public companies (Aktiengesellschaften) to have two boards: a management board called a Vorstand and a supervisory board called an Aufsichtsrat. The supervisory board oversees and appoints the members of the management board and must approve major business decisions. For German companies with more than 2,000 employees, half of the members of the supervisory board are elected by the employees. When a German company has between 500-2,000 employees, the workers select one-third of the supervisory board. When it comes to internal elections the chairman of supervisory board, the Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender, has two votes in case of a draw. The supervisory board, in theory, is intended to provide a monitoring role. However, the appointment of supervisory board members has not been a transparent process and has therefore led to inefficient monitoring and poor corporate governance in some cases (Monks and Minow, 2001). The discussion about whether a one-tier or a two-tier board system leads to better corporate governance is ongoing in Germany and many other countries.  China  Another example of a two-tier board system: Mainland China In China's corporation law, the so-called (‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÂÖ¨Âè∏Ê≥ï), it stipulates a limited liability company (ÊúâÈôêË¥£‰ªªÂÖ¨Âè∏) to have: a board of directors (Ëë£‰∫ã‰ºö) and a board of supervisors (Áõë‰∫ã‰ºö). Regarding the Chinese requirements of a board of supervisors, under Articles 52 to 57 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China: *a limited liability company requires to set up a board of supervisors, which shall comprise at least 3 persons. A limited liability company, which has relatively less shareholders or is relatively small in scale, may have 1 or 2 supervisors, and does not have to establish a board of supervisors. The board of supervisors shall include representatives of shareholders and representatives of the employees of the company at an appropriate ratio which shall be specifically stimulated in the Articles of Association. The employees' representatives, who are to serve as members of the board of supervisors, shall be democratically elected by the employees of the company through the meeting of the employees' representatives or employees' meeting, or by any other means. The board of supervisors shall have one chairman, who shall be elected by half or more of all the supervisors. The chairman of the board of supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. If the chairman of the board of supervisors is unable to or does not perform his duties, the supervisor recommended by half or more of the supervisors shall convene and preside over the meetings of the board of supervisors. No director or senior manager may concurrently work as a supervisor. *Every term of office of the supervisors shall be 3 years. The supervisors may, after the expiry of their term of office, hold a consecutive term upon re-election. If no reelection is timely carried out after the expiry of the term of office of the supervisors, or the number of the members of the board of supervisors is less than the quorum due to the resignation of some directors from the board of supervisors prior to the expiry of their term of office, the original supervisors shall, before the newly elected supervisors assume their posts, exercise the authorities of the supervisors according to laws, administrative regulations as well as the articles of association. *The board of supervisors or supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors may exercise the following authorities: (1) checking the financial affairs of the company; (2) supervising the duty- related acts of the directors and senior managers, and bringing forward proposals on the removal of any director or senior manager who violates any law, administrative regulation, the articles of association or any resolution of the shareholders' meeting; (3) demanding any director or senior manager to make corrections if his act has injured the interests of the company; (4) proposing to convening temporary shareholders' meetings, and convening and presiding over shareholders' meetings when the board of directors does not exercise the functions of convening and presiding over the shareholders' meetings as prescribed in this Law; (5) bringing forward proposals at shareholders' meetings; (6) initiating actions against directors or senior managers according to other relevant Article of this Law; and (7) other duties as prescribed by the Articles of Association. *The supervisors may attend the meetings of the board of directors as non-voting delegates, and may raise questions or suggestions on the matters to be decided by the board of directors. If the board of supervisors or supervisor of the company with no board of directors finds that the company is running abnormally, it (he) may make investigations. Where necessary, it (he) may hire an accounting firm to help it (him), with the relevant expenses being borne by the company. *The board of supervisors shall hold meetings at least once a year. The supervisors may propose to hold temporary meetings of the board of supervisors. The discussion methods and voting procedures of the board of supervisors shall be prescribed in the articles of association, unless it is otherwise stimulated in this Law. The resolution of the board of supervisors shall be adopted by half or more of the supervisors. The board of supervisors shall make records for the resolutions on the matter it discusses, which shall be signed by the supervisors in presence. *The expenses necessary for the board of supervisors or the supervisor of a company with no board of supervisors to perform its (his) duties shall be borne by the company.

With Charles G.D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, and Archibald Lampman, he is classed as one of Canada's Confederation Poets. Scott was a Canadian lifetime civil servant who served as deputy superintendent of the Department of Indian Affairs from 1913 to 1932. He advocated for the assimilation of Canada's First Nations peoples in that capacity. While Scott was generally known only for his work in poetry and literature in Canada during his life and many decades after his death, Scott's legacy has become a point of contention in the 21st century as his work in Indian Affairs has received more attention and scrutiny, being described as cultural genocide. Life and legacy Scott was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of Rev. William Scott and Janet MacCallum. He was educated at Stanstead Wesleyan College. Early in life, he became an accomplished pianist. Scott wanted to be a doctor, but family finances were precarious, so in 1879 he joined the federal civil service. As the story goes, > William Scott might not have money [but] he had connections in high places. > Among his acquaintances was the prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, who > agreed to meet with Duncan. As chance would have it, when Duncan arrived for > his interview, the prime minister had a memo on his desk from the Indian > Branch of the Department of the Interior asking for a temporary copying > clerk. Making a quick decision while the serious young applicant waited in > front of him, Macdonald wrote across the request: 'Approved. Employ Mr. > Scott at $1.50.' Scott \\"spent his entire career in the same branch of government, working his way up to the position of deputy superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1913, the highest non-elected position possible in his department. He remained in this post until his retirement in 1932.\\" Scott's father also subsequently found work in Indian Affairs, and the entire family moved into a newly built house on 108 Lisgar St., where Duncan Campbell Scott would live for the rest of his life. In 1883 Scott met fellow civil servant, Archibald Lampman. > It was the beginning of an instant friendship that would continue unbroken > until Lampman's death sixteen years later.... It was Scott who initiated > wilderness camping trips, a recreation that became Lampman's favourite > escape from daily drudgery and family problems. In turn, Lampman's > dedication to the art of poetry would inspire Scott's first experiments in > verse. By the late 1880s Scott was publishing poetry in the prestigious American magazine, Scribner's. In 1889 his poems \\"At the Cedars\\" and \\"Ottawa\\" were included in the pioneering anthology, Songs of the Great Dominion. Duncan Campbell Scott Scott and Lampman \\"shared a love of poetry and the Canadian wilderness. During the 1890s the two made a number of canoe trips together in the area north of Ottawa.\\" In 1892 and 1893, Scott, Lampman, and William Wilfred Campbell wrote a literary column, \\"At the Mermaid Inn,\\" for the Toronto Globe. \\"Scott ... came up with the title for it. His intention was to conjure up a vision of The Mermaid Inn Tavern in old London where Sir Walter Raleigh founded the famous club whose members included Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and other literary lights. In 1893 Scott published his first book of poetry, The Magic House and Other Poems. It would be followed by seven more volumes of verse: Labor and the Angel (1898), New World Lyrics and Ballads (1905), Via Borealis (1906), Lundy's Lane and Other Poems (1916), Beauty and Life (1921), The Poems of Duncan Campbell Scott (1926) and The Green Cloister (1935). In 1894, Scott married Belle Botsford, a concert violinist, whom he had met at a recital in Ottawa. They had one child, Elizabeth, who died at 12. Before she was born, Scott asked his mother and sisters to leave his home (his father had died in 1891), causing a long-time rift in the family. In 1896 Scott published his first collection of stories, In the Village of Viger, \\"a collection of delicate sketches of French Canadian life. Two later collections, The Witching of Elspie (1923) and The Circle of Affection (1947), contained many fine short stories.\\" Scott also wrote a novel, although it was not published until after his death (as The Untitled Novel, in 1979). After Lampman died in 1899, Scott helped publish a number of editions of Lampman's poetry. Scott \\"was a prime mover in the establishment of the Ottawa Little Theatre and the Dominion Drama Festival.\\" In 1923 the Little Theatre performed his one-act play, Pierre; it was later published in Canadian Plays from Hart House Theatre (1926). His wife died in 1929. In 1931 he married poet Elise Aylen, more than 30 years his junior. After he retired the next year, \\"he and Elise spent much of the 1930s and 1940s travelling in Europe, Canada and the United States.\\" Scott died in December 1947 in Ottawa at the age of 85 and is buried in Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery. =Honours and awards= Scott was honoured for his writing during and after his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1899 and served as its president from 1921 to 1922. The Society awarded him the second-ever Lorne Pierce Medal in 1927 for his contributions to Canadian literature. In 1934 he was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto (Doctor of Letters in 1922) and Queen's University (Doctor of Laws in 1939). In 1948, the year after his death, he was designated a Person of National Historic Significance. Poetry Cover of Lundy's Lane and Other Poems, 1916 Scott's \\"literary reputation has never been in doubt. He has been well represented in virtually all major anthologies of Canadian poetry published since 1900.\\" In Poets of the Younger Generation (1901), Scottish literary critic William Archer wrote of Scott: The Government of Canada biography of him says that: > Although the quality of Scott's work is uneven, he is at his best when > describing the Canadian wilderness and Indigenous peoples. Although they > constitute a small portion of his total output, Scott's widely recognized > and valued 'Indian poems' cemented his literary reputation. In these poems, > the reader senses the conflict that Scott felt between his role as an > administrator committed to an assimilation policy for Canada's Native > peoples and his feelings as a poet, saddened by the encroachment of European > civilization on the Indian way of life. \\"There is not a really bad poem in the book,\\" literary critic Desmond Pacey said of Scott's first book, The Magic House and Other Poems, \\"and there are a number of extremely good ones.\\" The 'extremely good ones' include the strange, dream-like sonnets of \\"In the House of Dreams.\\" \\"Probably the best known poem from the collection is 'At the Cedars,' a grim narrative about the death of a young man and his sweetheart during a log-jam on the Ottawa River. It is crudely melodramatic,... but its style‚Äîstark understatement, irregular lines, and abrupt rhymes‚Äîmakes it the most experimental poem in the book.\\" His next book, Labour and the Angel, \\"is a slighter volume than The Magic House in size and content. The lengthy title poem makes dreary reading.... Of greater interest is his growing willingness to experiment with stanza form, variations in line length, use of partial rhyme, and lack of rhyme.\\" Notable new poems included \\"The Cup\\" and the sonnet \\"The Onondaga Madonna.\\" But arguably \\"the most memorable poem in the new collection\\" was the fantasy, \\"The Piper of Arll.\\" One person who long remembered that poem was future British Poet Laureate John Masefield, who read \\"The Piper of Arll\\" as a teenager and years later wrote to Scott: New World Lyrics and Ballads (1905) revealed \\"a voice that is sounding ever more different from the other Confederation Poets ... his dramatic power is increasingly apparent in his response to the wilderness and the lives of the people who lived there.\\" The poetry included \\"On the Way to the Mission\\" and the much-anthologized \\"The Forsaken,\\" two of Scott's best- known \\"Indian poems.\\" Lundy's Lane and Other Poems (1916) seemed \\"to have been cobbled together at the insistence of his publishers, who wanted a collection of his work that had not been published in any previous volume.\\". The title poem was one that had won Scott, \\"in the Christmas Globe contest of 1908,... the prize of one hundred dollars, offered for the best poem on a Canadian historical theme.\\". Other notable poems in the volume include the pretty lyric \\"A Love Song,\\" the long meditation, \\"The Height of Land,\\" and the even longer \\"Lines Written in Memory of Edmund Morris.\\" Anthologist John Garvin called the last \\"so original, tender and beautiful that it is destined to live among the best in Canadian literature.\\" \\"In his old age, Scott would look back upon Beauty and Life (1921) as his favourite among his volumes of verse,\\" E.K. Brown tells us, adding: \\"In it most of the poetic kinds he cared about are represented.\\" There is a great diversity, from the moving war elegy \\"To a Canadian Aviator Who Died For His Country in France,\\" to the strange, apocalyptic \\"A Vision.\\" The Green Cloister, published after Scott's retirement, \\"is a travelogue of the sites he visited in Europe with Elise: Lake Como, Ravello, Kensington Gardens, East Gloucester, etc.‚Äîdescriptive and contemplative poems by an observant tourist. Those with a Canadian setting include two Indian poems of near-melodrama‚Äî'A Scene at Lake Manitou' and 'At Gull Lake, August 1810'‚Äîthat are in stark contrast to the overall serenity of the volume.\\" More typical is the title poem, \\"Chiostro Verde.\\" The Circle of Affection (1947) contains 26 poems Scott had written since Cloister, and several prose pieces, including his Royal Society address on \\"Poetry and Progress.\\" It includes \\"At Delos,\\" which brings to mind the poet's approaching death: :::There is no grieving in the world ::::As beauty fades throughout the years: :::The pilgrim with the weary heart ::::Brings to the grave his tears.  Department of Indian Affairs work  Prior to taking up his position as head of the Department of Indian Affairs, in 1905 Scott was one of the Treaty Commissioners sent to negotiate Treaty No. 9 in Northern Ontario. Aside from his poetry, Scott made his mark in Canadian history as the head of the Department of Indian Affairs from 1913 to 1932. Even before Confederation, the Canadian government had adopted a policy of assimilation under the Gradual Civilization Act 1857. One biographer of Scott states that: while Scott himself wrote: In 1920, under Scott's direction, and with the concurrence of the major religions involved in native education, an amendment to the Indian Act made it mandatory for all native children between the ages of seven and fifteen to attend school. Attendance at a residential school was made compulsory. Although a reading of Bill 14 states that no particular kind of school was stipulated. Scott was in favour of residential schooling for aboriginal children, as he believed removing them from the influences of home and reserve would hasten the cultural and economic transformation of the whole aboriginal population. In cases where a residential school was the only kind available, residential enrollment did become mandatory, and aboriginal children were compelled to leave their homes, their families and their culture, with or without their parents' consent. However, in 1901, 226 of the 290 Indian schools across Canada were day schools, and by 1961, the 377 day schools far outnumbered the 56 residential institutions.Dominion Bureau of Statistics, 1963 Letter from Duncan Campbell Scott of Canada Department Of Indian Affairs To Staff In December 1921 Scott authored a letter to agents under his supervision that clearly condescends and derides Indian people and activities in such a way that fully outlayed Scott's authoritative approach and negative opinion on indigenous customs, social activities and hygiene. \\"It is observed with alarm that the holding of dances by the Indians on their reserves is on the increase, and that these practices tend to disorganize the efforts which the Department is putting forth to make them self-supporting,\\" Scott wrote. \\"I have, therefore, to direct you to use your utmost endeavours to dissuade the Indians from excessive indulgence in the practice of dancing. You should suppress any dances which cause waste of time, interfere with the occupations of the Indians, unsettle them for serious work, injure their health or encourage them in sloth and idleness.\\" He goes on to add agents should use tact to \\"obtain control and keep it\\" and prevent Indians from attending \\"fairs, exhibitions etc\\". \\"It is realized that reasonable amusement and recreation should be enjoyed by Indians, but they should not be allowed to dissipate their energies and abandon themselves to demoralizing amusements.\\" Duncan Campbell Scott CBC has reported that \\"In all, about 150,000 aboriginal, Inuit and M√©tis children were removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\\" The 150,000 enrollment figure is an estimate not disputed by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, but it is not clear what percentage were \\"removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\\" Much criticism had been leveled against the Residential school system for the often poor conditions and inhumane treatment of Indigenous children. When Scott retired, his \\"policy of assimilating the Indians had been so much in keeping with the thinking of the time that he was widely praised for his capable administration.\\" At the time, Scott was able to point to evidence of success in increasing enrollment and attendance, as the number of First Nations children enrolled in any school rose from 11,303 in 1912 to 17,163 in 1932. Residential school enrollment during the same period rose from 3,904 to 8,213. Actual attendance figures from all schools had also risen sharply, going from 64% of enrollment in 1920 to 75% in 1930, and Scott attributed this rise partly to Bill 14's section on compulsory attendance but also to a more positive attitude among First Nations people toward education. However, despite the encouraging statistics, Scott's efforts to bring about assimilation through residential schools could be judged a failure, as many former students retained their language, went on to maintain and preserve their tribe's culture, and refused to accept full Canadian citizenship when it was offered. Moreover, over the long history of the residential system, only a minority of all enrolled students went beyond the elementary grades, and many former students found themselves lacking the skills that would enable them to find employment on or off the reserve. In 2015, the plaque beside his grave at Ottawa's Beechwood cemetery was revised to read =Reputation as an assimilationist= In 2003, Scott's Indian Affairs legacy came under attack from Neu and Therrien: According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Scott is \\"best known at the end of the 20th century,\\" not for his writing, but \\"for advocating the assimilation of Canada‚Äôs First Nations peoples.\\" As part of their Worst Canadian poll, a panel of experts commissioned by Canada's National History Society named Scott one of the Worst Canadians in the August 2007 issue of The Beaver.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/trudeau-voted-worst- canadian-in-unscientific-online-poll-1.675408 In his 2013 Conversations with a Dead Man: The Legacy of Duncan Campbell Scott, poet and non-fiction writer Mark Abley explored the paradoxes surrounding Scott's career. Abley did not attempt to defend Scott's work as a bureaucrat, but he showed that Scott is more than simply a one-dimensional villain. =Controversy over Arc Poetry prize= Arc Poetry Magazine renamed the annual \\"Archibald Lampman Award\\" (given to a poet in the National Capital Region) to the Lampman-Scott Award in recognition of Scott's enduring legacy in Canadian poetry, with the first award under the new name given out in 2007. The winner of the 2008 award, Shane Rhodes, turned over half of the $1,500 prize money to the Wabano Centre for Aboriginal Health, a First Nations health centre. \\"Taking that money wouldn't have been right, with what I'm writing about,\\" Rhodes said. The poet was researching First Nations history and found Scott's name repeatedly referenced. In the words of a CBC News report, Rhodes felt \\"Scott's legacy as a civil servant overshadows his work as a pioneer of Canadian poetry\\". The editor of Arc Poetry Magazine, Anita Lahey, responded with a statement that she thought Scott's actions as head of Indian Affairs were important to remember, but did not eclipse his role in the history of Canadian literature. \\"I think it matters that we're aware of it and that we think about and talk about these things,\\" she said. \\"I don't think controversial or questionable activities in the life of any artist or writer is something that should necessarily discount the literary legacy that they leave behind.\\" More recently, the magazine has stated on its website that \\"For the years 2007 through 2009, the Archibald Lampman Award merged with the Duncan Campbell Scott Foundation to become the Lampman-Scott Award in honour of two great Confederation Poets. This partnership came to an end in 2010, and the prize returned to its former identity as the Archibald Lampman Award for Poetry.\\" Publications =Poetry= * - * - - * - - * * -  - * * - * * -  =Fiction= * - * * - mostly prose  =Non-fiction= * - * * -  =Edited=  * See also *Canadian literature *Canadian poetry *List of Canadian poets References External links  * * Representative Poetry Online: Duncan Campbell Scott - Biography and 11 poems (At the Cedars, Enigma, The Forsaken, The Half-Breed Girl, The Height of Land, Night Hymns on Lake Nipigon, Ode for the Keats Centenary, The Onondaga Madonna, Permanence, Rapids at Night, To a Canadian Aviator Who Died for his Country in France) * Collections Canada: Duncan Campbell Scott biography, relating to Treaty 9 * Keith Waddington, \\"Duncan Campbell Scott: Civil Servant and Poet\\" Category:1862 births Category:1947 deaths Category:19th-century Canadian poets Category:20th-century Canadian poets Category:19th-century Canadian civil servants Category:20th-century Canadian civil servants Category:Canadian Methodists Category:Canadian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent Category:Canadian male short story writers Category:Canadian World War I poets Category:20th-century Canadian male writers Category:Canadian male poets Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:First Nations history Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:Writers from Ottawa Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories Category:20th-century Canadian short story writers Category:19th-century Canadian short story writers Category:19th-century male writers Category:Burials at Beechwood Cemetery (Ottawa) ","title":"Duncan Campbell Scott"},{"id":"2360987","text":"Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is a derivative of cellulose with both water solubility and organic solubility. It is used as an excipient, and topical ophthalmic protectant and lubricant. Chemistry HPC is an ether of cellulose in which some of the hydroxyl groups in the repeating glucose units have been hydroxypropylated forming -OCH2CH(OH)CH3 groups using propylene oxide. The average number of substituted hydroxyl groups per glucose unit is referred to as the degree of substitution (DS). Complete substitution would provide a DS of 3. Because the hydroxypropyl group added contains a hydroxyl group, this can also be etherified during preparation of HPC. When this occurs, the number of moles of hydroxypropyl groups per glucose ring, moles of substitution (MS), can be higher than 3. Because cellulose is very crystalline, HPC must have an MS about 4 in order to reach a good solubility in water. HPC has a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, so it has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at 45 ¬∞C. At temperatures below the LCST, HPC is readily soluble in water; above the LCST, HPC is not soluble. HPC forms liquid crystals and many mesophases according to its concentration in water. Such mesophases include isotropic, anisotropic, nematic and cholesteric. The last one gives many colors such as violet, green and red. Uses Lacrisert, manufactured by Aton Pharma, is a formulation of HPC used for artificial tears. It is used to treat medical conditions characterized by insufficient tear production such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca), recurrent corneal erosions, decreased corneal sensitivity, exposure and neuroparalytic keratitis. HPC is also used as a lubricant for artificial eyes. HPC is used as a thickener, a low level binder and as an emulsion stabiliser with E number E463. In pharmaceuticals it is used as a binder in tablets. HPC is used as a sieving matrix for DNA separations by capillary and microchip electrophoresis. HPC is the main ingredient in Cellugel, which is used in book conservation.

Venues included Cockatoo Island, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Pier 2/3 at Walsh Bay, Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney Opera House, Artspace and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The 17th Biennale of Sydney achieved record attendance of more than 517,000 visits across all venues with 68 artists premiering new works made especially for the exhibition. The 17th Biennale of Sydney‚Äôs SuperDeluxe@ArtspaceSuperDeluxe@Artspace programme which combined gallery, performance space and bar was awarded Best Arts Event by popular vote at the 2010 Sydney Music, Arts and Culture (SMAC) Awards2010 Sydney Music, Arts and Culture (SMAC) Awards as well as being a finalist in the Best Major Festival category. The 17th Biennale of Sydney was also a finalist at the 2010 Australian Event Awards2010 Australian Event Awards in the Best Cultural or Arts Event category. 18th Biennale of Sydney (2012) The 18th Biennale of Sydney: all our relations, was held from 27 June ‚Äì 16 September 2012 across five venues: Cockatoo Island, Pier 2/3, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and Carriageworks. Under the artistic direction of Gerald McMaster and Catherine de Zegher, 225 works by 101 artists were selected from Australia, New Zealand, the Asia- Pacific, the Americas, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. Nearly half the artists (49) created works especially for the exhibition, including many substantial collaborative installations. The exhibition drew record crowds, with more than 665,000 visits recorded over five venues, an increase of 29 per cent on the 2010 attendance figures. The Biennale Bar @ Pier 2/3 was a popular after dark event taking place over five Friday nights in August. In the closing week of the exhibition, Carriageworks and the Biennale of Sydney presented the Australian premieres of En Atendant and Cesena, two performances by Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker‚Äôs dance ensemble Rosas. The 18th Biennale of Sydney won the 'Best Cultural, Arts or Music Event' award at the Australian Event Awards in 2013. 19th Biennale of Sydney (2014) The 19th Biennale of Sydney: You Imagine What You Desire was presented from 21 March ‚Äì 9 June 2014, under the artistic direction of Juliana Engberg. Presenting the work of 92 artists from 31 countries, the 19th Biennale was shown at various partner venues including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Artspace, Carriageworks, Cockatoo Island and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia. Other works and events were experienced at various locations throughout the city, including Henrik H√•kansson‚Äôs epic, episodic film and orchestral performance work, THE END (2011), which was presented at Pier 2/3 in Walsh Bay. In 2014, more than 623,000 visited the Biennale partner venues, including close to 125,000 from overseas, the highest international visitation numbers recorded in the Biennale‚Äôs 41-year history. In addition, audiences also experienced outdoor works by Nathan Coley on the Eastern Apron of Cockatoo Island, and the building exteriors of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, as well as numerous performance works in public spaces. In 2014 calls were made by refugee activists for artists and others to boycott the 19th Biennalehttp://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/feature/all-arts/sydney- biennale-faces-transfield-boycott-threat-198020 in response to the perceived 'chain of connections' between the Biennale, Transfield Holdings and Transfield Services, and the latter's contract at the overseas detention centreshttp://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/03/concerns-over-detention- centre-welfare-contract Transfield Holdings, the private company, founded the Biennale of Sydney in 1973 and had continued as the Founding Partner since that time. In 2014, Transfield Holdings had an 11% investment in a public company, Transfield Services, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Transfield Services had, amongst many contracts, a contract for the Australian Department of Immigration at the detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru. The two Transfield companies had also joined together in the Transfield Foundation, which also supported the Biennale. On 19 February 2014, 28 artists participating in the 19th Biennale of Sydney published an open letter to the Board of Directors about their concerns with the sponsorship arrangement with 'Transfield'. The 28 artists stated in their letter \\"We urge you to act in the interests of asylum seekers. As part of this we request the Biennale withdraw from the current sponsorship arrangements with Transfield and seek to develop new ones.\\"http://visual.artshub.com.au/news-article/news/visual-arts/biennale- artists-want-transfield-out-198182 The group of artists who originally signed this open letter were ‚Äî Gabrielle de Vietri, Bianca Hester, Charlie Sofo, Nathan Gray, Deborah Kelly, Matt Hinkley, Benjamin Armstrong, Libia Castro, √ìlafur √ìlafsson, Sasha Huber, Sonia Leber, David Chesworth, Daniel McKewen, Angelica Mesiti, Ahmet √ñƒü√ºt, Meri√ß Alg√ºn Ringborg, Joseph Griffiths, Sol Archer, Tamas Kaszas, Krisztina Erdei, Nathan Coley, Corin Sworn, Ross Manning, Martin Boyce, Callum Morton, Emily Roysdon, S√∏ren Thilo Funder, Mikhail Karikis. On 20 February 2014, 6 additional Biennale artists signed on to the open letter to the Biennale of Sydney Board, these artists were - Sara van der Heide, Henna-Riikka Halonen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Hadley+Maxwell, Shannon Te Ao, Yael Bartana. By 26 February 2014, 41 Biennale artists in total had signed this open letter.http://19boswg.blogspot.com.au/2014/02/open-letter-to- board-of-sydney-biennale.html On 26 February 2014, five artists (Libia Castro, √ìlafur √ìlafsson, Charlie Sofo, Gabrielle de Vietri & Ahmet √ñƒü√ºt) withdrew their participation in the Biennale of Sydney in protest. This protest was due to the artists' perception that 'Transfield' was profiting from the mandatory detention of asylum seekers and the Biennale's refusal to cut sponsorship ties with Transfield as requested by the artists.http://19boswg.blogspot.com.au/2014/02/statement-of-withdrawal- from-19th.html On 5 March 2014, four more artists (Agnieszka Polska, Sara van der Heide, Nicoline van Harskamp and Nathan Gray) withdrew their participation in the Biennale of Sydney. In March, the Board of The Biennale of Sydney announced that it would cut ties with Transfield, following the growing criticism from artists and refugee activists. The majority of boycotting artists returned to participate in the 19th Biennale with the exception of Australian artists Charlie Sofo and Gabrielle de Vietri. 20th Biennale of Sydney (2016) The 20th Biennale of Sydney was curated by Stephanie Rosenthal and took place in 2016.  21st Biennale of Sydney (2018)  The 21st Biennale of Sydney, titled SUPERPOSITION, was curated by Mami Kataoka.

Da Silva plays the loud-mouthed gangster Carl Durham, one of his last roles before becoming blacklisted.. The newspaperman played by Duryea is similar in tone (a reporter that does anything for publicity for himself regardless of ethics) to Kirk Douglas in Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951). This B-movie was shot in black and white by director Cy Endfield and cinematographer Stanley Cortez. Plot When big city newspaper reporter Mike Reese (Duryea) writes and publishes a story (after breaking his promise to withhold it) that results in the murder of a state's witness against a local gang lord, he loses his job. He soon finds that no one else will hire him so he extracts money from the drug lord, (who is actually grateful for the story Reese published) moves to small-town Lakeville and buys a half-interest in the newspaper, The Lakeville Sentinel. The newspaper is owned by Catherine Harris (Storm), who immediately has differences with Reese on how things should operate. Reese, trying to use the paper as a step up, latches onto a murder of a woman who happens to be the daughter-in-law of a newspaper magnate, his former employer. When a local black woman is suspected (revealed to the audience early as a scapegoat), Reese turns the story into a media circus and soon his reporting is back in the spotlight again. Eventually, he finds himself having to decide if he will reform his opportunistic ways. The film is notable for the pejorative use of the word \\"nigger\\", though this is clearly dubbed, not what was originally filmed. Cast * Dan Duryea as Mike Reese * Herbert Marshall as E.J.

Reception =Critical response= The New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther, panned the film. He wrote, \\"It is so poorly made, so haphazard and so full of detectable holes that it carries no impact or conviction, regardless of credibility. Mr. Chester and his associates are free to proclaim, if they wish, that newspaper men are no good. We think the same of his film.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, July 27, 1950. Accessed: August 17. 2013. Film historian and critic Glenn Erickson wrote about the film's theme, \\"The Underworld Story plays like the work of angry men. The title isn't very appropriate, as the story doesn't center on gangsters. Its main focus is the misuse of the power of the press, with side excursions into racism, class arrogance and the influence of organized crime. As in Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole, raw greed leads to gross injustice. Like Wilder's venal Chuck Tatum, the reporter in The Underworld Story thinks of little beyond the next fast buck. 'Times are tough all over,' says a cynical official. 'Pretty soon a man won't be able to sell his own mother.'\\"Erickson, Glenn. DVD Savant, film/DVD review, October 16, 2010.

Wacquant is currently a Professor of Sociology and Research Associate at the Earl Warren Legal Institute, University of California, Berkeley, where he is also affiliated with the Program in Medical Anthropology and the Center for Urban Ethnography, and Researcher at the 'Centre de sociologie europ√©enne' in Paris. He has been a member of the Harvard Society of Fellows, a MacArthur Prize Fellow, and has won numerous grants including the Fletcher Foundation Fellowship and the Lewis Coser Award of the American Sociological Association. Career and education Wacquant was born and grew up in Montpellier in the Southern France, and he received his training in economics and sociology in France and the United States. He was a student and close collaborator of Pierre Bourdieu. He also worked closely with William Julius Wilson at the University of Chicago, where he received his PhD in sociology in 1994. Wacquant has published more than a hundred articles in journals of sociology, anthropology, urban studies, social theory and philosophy. He is also co-founder and editor of the interdisciplinary journal Ethnography as well as a collaborator of Le Monde Diplomatique. His primary research has been conducted in the ghettos of South Chicago, in the Paris banlieue, and in jails of the United States and Brazil.  Research  Wacquant's work explores and links together diverse areas of research on the body, urban inequality, ghettoization, and the development of punishment as an institution aimed at poor and stigmatized populations. His interest in these topics stems from his experience in the black ghetto as a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the mid-1980s. Commenting on this experience in The New York Times in 2003, he said \\"I had never seen such scenes of desolation. I remember thinking: It's like Beirut. Or Dresden after the war. It was really a shock.\\"Emily Eakin (November 8, 2003). A Professor Who Refuses To Pull His Punches. The New York Times. Retrieved January 16, 2015. His intellectual trajectory and interests are dissected in the article \\"The Body, the Ghetto, and the Penal State\\" (2008) In his work, \\"Deadly symbiosis: when ghetto and prison meet and mesh\\" in Punishment and Society 3(1) (pp 95‚Äì134), he offers a middle-range theory, relevant mainly to American racism against blacks in contemporary society. According to Wacquant, African- Americans now live \\"in the first prison society of history\\" (p. 121). The 'hyperghetto' constitutes the fourth stage in the development of 'peculiar institutions', following (sequentially) slavery, Jim Crow, and the early ghettos. According to him, the ghetto and the prison are for all practical purposes indistinguishable, reinforcing each other to ensure the exclusion of African-Americans from general society, with governmental encouragement. As Wacquant vividly characterizes it: the prison should be viewed as a judicial ghetto and the ghetto as an extrajudicial prison. Taken together, these constitute part of a 'carceral continuum'. To understand this concept, Wacquant argues for a single analytical frame unifying expansive 'prisonfare' and attenuating workfare, resulting in a deepening marginalisation and social and political subordination of stigmatized and defamed 'surplus' populations. Inspired by Bourdieu, Wacquant analyzes the structural constraints and consequences, but like Bourdieu endeavours to provide a more nuanced analysis than, for example, a reductionist Marxian economic analysis (cf. Rusche and Kirchheimer's Punishment and Social Structure, referenced by Wacquant in his Punishing the Poor (2009)). The ghetto and the prison are now locked in a whirlpool, when it is no longer clear which is the egg and which is the chicken: the two look the same and have the same function (p. 115). The life in the ghetto almost necessarily leads to more criminal behavior, yet Wacquant presents statistics that show that the distribution of crime between black and white has not changed. Instead he shows that a black, young, man is now \\"equated with 'probable cause' justifying the arrest\\" (p. 117). And in the prisons, a black culture is being reinforced by \\"professional\\" inmates, a culture which later affects the street. In his book Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer, Wacquant denounces popular mainstream conceptions of the underclass and argues that the boxing gym is one of the many institutions that is contained within, and opposed to, the ghetto. He also explores, through an account of his own experiences as an apprentice boxer in a black ghetto of Chicago, the elaborate process by which the \\"body capital\\" of these athletes is formed and managed, and in doing so, building upon the work of his mentor Pierre Bourdieu, he argues for the development of a 'carnal sociology'.

Dry eye syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is a common ocular surface disorder and is characterized by disruption of the tear film and increased inflammation. The tear film coats the surface of the eye and is composed of 3 layers: an aqueous, lipid, and mucous layer. The aqueous layer consists of a mixture of electrolytes, enzymes, antibodies, antimicrobial proteins, and other compounds. The lipid layer consists of fatty compounds that are responsible for decreasing evaporation of the tear film. The mucous layer contains mucins, gelatinous glycoproteins, which allow for an even distribution of the tear film over the corneal surface and decreased friction during blinking. Artificial tears are used to supplement a patient's naturally-produced tears and increase eye lubrication by mimicking characteristics of the tear film. Artificial tears can be supplemented with other treatments to treat dry eye syndrome and are available over the counter. Artificial tears are also used to moisten contact lenses and in eye examinations. Chemistry Artificial tear usage = Overview = Although artificial tears are used to mimic or supplement the roles of the tear film and contain water, electrolytes, and certain polymers, they do not contain the biologically active components found in naturally-produced tears. Moreover, artificial tears often contain chemicals that are not present in naturally- produced tears. Preparations can contain carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (a.k.a. HPMC or hypromellose), hydroxypropyl cellulose and hyaluronic acid (a.k.a. hyaluronan, HA). = With preservatives = Preparations can also contain preservatives in order to prolong usage and avoid bacterial contamination. Preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (BAK), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), purite, chlorobutanol, sodium perborate, thiomersal, disodium edetate, and oxychloro complex (SOC). Preservatives can be toxic and cause damage to the corneal epithelium. For instance, high concentrations of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) can cause cytotoxicity, cause cell lysis, and reduce tear and mucin production. Patients should limit their use of artificial tears with preservatives to less than four to six times a day. If artificial tears need to be utilized more than four to six times a day, a preservative-free formulation should be used. = Preservative-free = Preservative-free artificial formulations are indicated for patients who cannot tolerate artificial tear formulations with preservatives, patients who are using artificial tears more than four to six times a day, and patients who are using multiple topical eye drops with preservatives. Preservative-free eye drops are found in single vials. However, single unit-dose artificial tears without preservatives are more expensive than bottled artificial tears with preservatives. Some patients confuse over the counter drops that contain tetrahydrozoline (i.e. Visine¬Æ), a vasoconstrictor, with artificial tears. Desensitization can occur with extended usage of drops containing tetrahydrozoline. Indications and effects The most common indication for artificial tear use is dry eyes. Risk factors for developing dry eyes includes increasing age, female gender, environments with low moisture, nutritional deficiencies, certain medications, and autoimmune conditions. Examples autoimmune conditions are Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease, and uveitis. Patients with dry eyes may have an inability to produce adequate amount or quality of tears leading to a disruption in their tear film. In addition, those who wear contact lenses or have undergone eye surgeries such as LASIK are at increased risk of having dry eyes. Normal tears are important to keep the surface of eyes clean and moist and protect eyes from infections. They are composed of many components including enzymes that act as natural antibiotics, proteins that prevent bacterial growth, and nutrients. Without adequate lubrication, patients are at risk for infection as well as irreversible scarring and damage. Artificial tears are the recognized treatment of choice for this problem. Artificial tears work by adding similar lubricating elements that natural tears contain. This helps thicken and stabilize the pre-corneal tear film, prolonging tear film breakup time, and allowing for tears to properly protect the surface of the eyes. Most artificial tears do not require a prescription and can be used as often as needed. Patients who use artificial tears more frequently than four to six times a day should choose a brand without preservatives or one with non- irritating preservatives. Thicker artificial tears that come in the form of gel or ointments may be used in more severe cases as they last longer, although they may temporarily blur vision. In more severe cases, providers may prescribe a form of artificial tears that works to reduce inflammation in the tear glands in an effort to improve natural tear production and the quality of tears produced.  Side Effects and Precautions  Artificial tears have no reported interactions. The most common side effect of artificial tears is temporary blurry vision. Allergic reactions have been reported and are associated with itchy or swollen eyes, dizziness, and breathing problems. These symptoms warrant discontinuation of the drops and to see a physician immediately. Prescription drops may have additional side effects such as burning, redness, pain, and a foreign body sensation. For contact lens users, specific drops should be used to avoid ingredients that can damage the contact lens. If using multiple types of eye drops, it is important to wait a few minutes in between application of each to avoid rinsing out the prior drop. Proper technique should be conducted to avoid contaminating the bottle. Washing hands prior to use and avoiding contact between the bottle and eyes can prevent infections. Veterinary uses Artificial tears are a part of the topical therapy for keratoconjunctivitis sicca for animals such as dogs, cats and horses. Similarly to human use, proper care should be performed to avoid contamination of the bottle. A veteranarian should be contacted if any signs of allergy, irritation, or pain develop due to the usage of artificial tears. Research A 2016 Cochrane Review seeking to compare the effectiveness of various over the counter artificial tears in treating dry eye. While the review stated that it is unclear which artificial tear formulation works best, two trials found that 0.2% polyacrylic acid-based tears were more effective in treating dry eye symptoms over 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based tears.

This national park has plants in fossil form that existed in India anywhere between 40 million and 150 million years ago spread over seven villages of Dindori District (Ghuguwa, Umaria, Deorakhurd, Barbaspur, Chanti- hills, Chargaon and Deori Kohani). The Dindori Plant Fossils National Park is an area that spreads over 274,100 square metres. Such fossils are found in three other villages of the district also, but they lie outside the national park. The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow, has done some work on the plant fossils of Mandla, though the study is yet in a preliminary stage. In Ghuguwa and Umaria the standing, petrified trunks of trees have been identified as Gymnosperms and Angiosperms- Monocotyledons and palms. There are certain Bryophytes also. There is some question about whether the fossils are from the late Jurassic or the early and mid Cretaceous age. This is because when the breakup of the single land mass, Pangaea occurred, it was split by the continental drift into Laurasia and Gondwana somewhere between the Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. India formed a part of Gondwana. Depending on the age in which the split occurred, the fossils are either Jurassic or Cretaceous. Interspersed with the plant fossils are to be found the fossils of molluscs. One theory is that the area in which the fossils are located, i.e., the Narmada Valley near Mandla, was actually a deep inundation of the sea into peninsular India until the Post- Cambrian Tertiary age, about 40 million years ago. This means that Narmada was a very short river which terminated in the inland sea above Mandla, and that the recession of the sea caused geological disturbances, which created the present rift valley through which the Narmada River and Tapti River flow in their present journey to the Arabian Sea. All this, however, is speculation and conjecture because it is only recently that an interest has developed in the fossils of Mandla and detailed scientific studies are still wanting. Fossil of a bottle palm at Mandla Plant Fossils National Park A region as ancient as this tells a great deal about what Madhya Pradesh was like millions of years ago. The absence of dicotyledons suggests that plant evolution was still at an early stage. The whole matter requires much more detailed study. The national park is spread over agricultural fields in seven non-contiguous villages, which makes it difficult to protect the fossils. The fossils look like ordinary rocks and are either removed from the fields unwittingly by agriculturists or are damaged by tourists and those unscrupulous people who think they can make quick money out of their sale. In Chargaon and Deori Kohani villages there has been extensive damage, especially by excavation of embedded molluscs. Some say that if the Fossil National Park is to be saved, a separate administrative unit for park management should be set up, the land on which fossils are located should be acquired and fenced and the nearest university, Jabalpur, should be asked to set up a special research unit on the fossils.

His theology is known as Molinism. Life From 1551 to 1562, Molina studied law in Salamanca, philosophy in Alcala de Henares, and theology in Coimbra. After 1563, he became a professor at the University of Coimbra, and afterward taught at the University of √âvora, Portugal. From this post he was called, at the end of twenty years, to the chair of moral theology in Madrid, where he died.Luis de Molina, A Treatise on Money . CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxiii. Besides other works he wrote De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia (4 vols., Lisbon, 1588); a commentary on the first part of the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas (2 vols., fol., Cuenca, 1593); and a treatise De jure et justitia (6 vols., 1593-1609). It is to the first of these that his fame is principally due. It was an attempt to reconcile, in words at least, the Augustinian doctrines of predestination and efficacious grace with the new ideals of the Renaissance concerning free will. Assuming that man is free to perform or not to perform any act whatever, Molina maintains that this circumstance renders the grace of God neither unnecessary nor impossible: not impossible, for God never fails to bestow grace upon those who ask it with sincerity; and not unnecessary, for grace, although not an efficient, is still a sufficient cause of salvation (gratia mere sufficiens). Nor, in Molina's view, does his doctrine of free will exclude predestination. The omniscient God, by means of His scientia media (the phrase is Molina's invention, though the idea is also to be found in his older contemporary Fonseca), or power of knowing future contingent events, foresees how we shall employ our own free-will and treat his proffered grace, and upon this foreknowledge he can found his predestinating decrees. These doctrines, which opposed both traditional understanding of Augustinism and Thomism concerning the respective roles of free will and efficacious grace, and the teachings of Martin Luther and John Calvin, excited violent controversy in some quarters, especially on the part of the Dominican Order and of the Jansenists, and at last rendered it necessary for the Pope (Clement VIII) to intervene. At first (1594) he simply enjoined silence on both parties so far as Spain was concerned; but ultimately, in 1598, he appointed the Congregatio de auxiliis Gratiae for the settlement of the dispute, which became more and more a party one. After holding very numerous sessions, the congregation was able to decide nothing, and in 1607 its meetings were suspended by Paul V, who in 1611 prohibited all further discussion of the question de auxiliis and of discussions about efficacious grace, and studious efforts were made to control the publication even of commentaries on Aquinas . Several regent Masters of the Dominican College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), were involved in the Molinist controversy. The Dominicans Diego Alvarez (c. 1550-1635), author of the De auxiliis divinae gratiae et humani arbitrii viribus, and Tomas de Lemos (1540-1629) were given the responsibility of representing the Dominican Order in debates before Pope Clement VIII and Pope Paul V. The Molinist subsequently passed into the Jansenist controversy. Molina was also the first Jesuit to write at length on economics and contract law.Luis de Molina, A Treatise on Money . CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxv. Prior to Molina‚Äôs time, economic thought was closely tied to Catholic moral theology. Molina was part of an emerging trend which contributed to the separation of analysis of economic activity from theological questions of sin. This trend was a significant step towards the emergence of modern economics with Adam Smith in the 18th century.Luis de Molina A Treatise on Money . CLP Academic, 2015, p.xxvi. In his writings on economics, Molina helped further develop a theory of price inflation proposed by Juan de Medina and Martin de Azpilcueta in Salamanca, writing that \\"[i]n equal circumstances, the more abundant money is in one place, so much less is its value to buy things or to acquire things that are not money.\\"Luis de Molina, A Treatise on Money .

Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah (the founder of Pakistan) became its first Patron-in- Chief. PFF received recognition from FIFA in early 1948. The annual National Championship was organized shortly after. In 1950, the national team gained their first international experience in Iran and Iraq. In 1954, the Pakistan National Team participated in the Asian Games at Manila and also toured the Far East. In 1958, Pakistan again took part in the Tokyo Asian Games. Pakistan also took part in the annual Asian Quadrangular Tournament. However, the game could not develop as smoothly as it should have. Pakistan's participation in international competitions has not been regular. The standard achieved in the early 1950s could not be maintained because of lack of organization of the game.

It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Charles Boyer) and Best Art Direction (Cedric Gibbons and William A. Horning). Its worldwide gross amounted to $2,141,000. But its massive budget led to a loss of $1,397,000. Plot Napoleon Bonaparte (Charles Boyer) launches an unsuccessful seduction of the Countess Marie Walewska (Greta Garbo), who is married to a much older man (Henry Stephenson), but she resists until convinced that giving in will save Poland. After her husband annuls their marriage and Napoleon divorces the Empress Josephine, the pair are free to formalize their happy relationship, but Napoleon shocks her by announcing his decision to wed the Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria for political reasons. While he doesn't expect it to impact his relationship with Marie, she leaves him, without ever telling him that she is expecting his child.

It is the calcium salt of the cyanamide () anion. This chemical is used as fertilizer and is commercially known as nitrolime. It was first synthesized in 1898 by Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro (Frank-Caro process).  History  In their search for a new process for producing cyanides for cyanide leaching of gold, Frank and Caro discovered the ability of alkaline earth carbides to adsorb atmospheric nitrogen at high temperatures.Deutsches Reichspatent DRP 88363, \\"Verfahren zur Darstellung von Cyanverbindungen aus Carbiden\\", Erfinder: A. Frank, N. Caro, erteilt am 31. M√§rz 1895. Fritz Rothe, a colleague of Frank and Caro, succeeded in 1898 in overcoming problems with the use of calcium carbide and clarified that at around 1,100 ¬∞C not calcium cyanide but calcium cyanamide is formed in the reaction. In fact, the initial target product sodium cyanide can also be obtained from calcium cyanamide by melting it with sodium chloride in the presence of carbon:H.H. Franck, W. Burg, Zeitschrift f√ºr Elektrochemie und angewandte physikalische Chemie, 40(10), 686-692 (Oktober 1934). : CaCN2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl + C ‚Üí 2 NaCN + CaCl2 Frank and Caro developed this reaction for a large-scale, continuous production process. The process was particularly challenging due to the equipment requirements required by the high temperatures during the initial igniter step. This process requires meticulous temperature control since the melting point of calcium cyanamide is only about 120¬∞C lower than the boiling point of sodium chloride. In 1901, Ferdinand Eduard Polzeniusz patented a process that converts calcium carbide to calcium cyanamide in the presence of 10% calcium chloride at 700 ¬∞C. The advantage of lowering the reaction temperature by about 400 ¬∞C, however, must be weighed against the high amount of calcium chloride required and the discontinuous process control. Nevertheless, both processes (the Rothe-Frank-Caro process and the Polzeniusz-Krauss process) played a role in the first half of the 20th century. In the record year 1945, a total of approx. 1.5 million tonnes were produced worldwide using both processes. Frank and Caro also noted the formation of ammonia from calcium cyanamide.Angewandte Chemie, Band 29, Ausgabe 16, Seite R97, 25. Februar 1916 : CaCN2 \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí 2 NH3 \\\\+ CaCO3 Albert Frank recognized the fundamental importance of this reaction as a breakthrough in the provision of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen and in 1901 recommended calcium cyanamide as a nitrogen fertilizer. Between 1908 and 1919, five calcium cyanamide plants with a total capacity of 500,000 tonnes per year were set up in Germany, and one in Switzerland. It was at the time the cheapest nitrogen fertilizer with additional efficacy against weeds and plant pests and had great advantages over conventional nitrogen fertilizers. However, the large-scale implementation of ammonia synthesis via the Haber‚ÄìBosch process became a serious competitor to the very energy-intensive Frank Caro. As urea (formed via the Haber‚ÄìBosch process) was significantly more nitrogen-rich (46% compared to ca. 20% nitrogen content) cheaper and faster acting, the role of calcium cyanamide was gradually reduced to a multifunctional nitrogen fertilizer in niche applications. Other reasons for its loss of popularity were its dirty-black color, dusty appearance and irritating properties, as well as its inhibition of an alcohol-degrading enzyme which causes temporary accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body leading to dizziness, nausea and hot flashes when alcohol is consumed around the time of bodily exposure. Production Calcium cyanamide is prepared from calcium carbide. The carbide powder is heated at about 1,100 ¬∞C in an electric furnace into which nitrogen is passed for several hours. The product is cooled to ambient temperatures and any unreacted carbide is leached out cautiously with water. :CaC2 \\\\+ N2 ‚Üí CaCN2 \\\\+ C (ŒîH = ‚Äì69.0 kcal/mol at 25 ¬∞C) It crystallizes in hexagonal crystal system with space group R3m and lattice constants a = 3.67 √Ö, c = 14.85 √Ö.F.

Page layout is the part of graphic design that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a page. It generally involves organizational principles of composition to achieve specific communication objectives. The high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium. It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize. Low-level pagination and typesetting are more mechanical processes. Given certain parameters such as boundaries of text areas, the typeface, and font size, justification preference can be done in a straightforward way. Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always automated. The result might be published as-is (as for a residential phone book interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication). Beginning from early illuminated pages in hand-copied books of the Middle Ages and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of type (text), images (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.  History and layout technologies  =Direct physical page setting= With manuscripts, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide. With ancient woodblock printing, all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions. With the Renaissance invention of letterpress printing and cold- metal moveable type, typesetting was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a composing stick into a galley‚Äîa long tray. Any images would be created by engraving. The original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, markup would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called \\"manuscripts\\" and the markup process was the same.) After the first round of typesetting, a galley proof might be printed in order for proofreading to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup. The final layout would be constructed in a \\"form\\" or \\"forme\\" using pieces of wood or metal (\\"furniture\\") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a chase, and objects which lock down the frame known as quoins. This process is called imposition, and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed. An \\"imposition proof\\" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement. The invention of hot metal typesetting in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce slugs‚Äîentire lines of text‚Äîusing a keyboard. The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine. The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys. =Paste-up era= Editors work on producing an issue of Bild, 1977 in West Berlin. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. Offset lithography allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press. This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed. Type could be set with a typewriter, or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine. The IBM Selectric Composer, for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including proportional fonts), and with text justification. With photoengraving and halftone, physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings. The layout process then became the task of creating the paste up, so named because rubber cement or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper. Completed pages become known as camera-ready, \\"mechanical\\" or \\"mechanical art\\". Phototypesetting was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up. These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape. = Computer-aided publishing = As the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page signatures directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set. In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, cathode ray tubes were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of \\"flat screen\\" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.Flat panel display Printers attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a ditto machine or photocopier. WYSIWYG word processors made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters. Early dot matrix printing was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. Inkjet printing and laser printing did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines. With modern desktop publishing software such as flagship software Adobe InDesign and cloud-based Lucidpress, the layout process can occur entirely on-screen. (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, \\"word processing\\" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.) A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer). Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas. Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use computer to plate technology to skip the physical original entirely. PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission. =Digital media (non-paper)= Since the advent of personal computing, page layout skills have expanded to electronic media as well as print media. E-books, PDF documents, and static web pages mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add multimedia animation, and interactivity. Page layout for interactive media overlaps with interface design and user experience design; an interactive \\"page\\" is better known as a graphical user interface (GUI). Modern web pages are typically produced using HTML for content and general structure, cascading style sheets to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and JavaScript for interactivity. Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a text editor, or a special HTML editor which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids. Additional technologies such as Macromedia Flash may be used for multimedia content. Web developers are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate web designer may be responsible for establishing the layout. A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team. =Projected pages= Projected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages. The magic lantern and opaque projector were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of photographic film (one negative and one positive) or one reversal film can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. Intertitles were used extensively in the earliest motion pictures when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous vanity cards and credits. It became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using overhead projectors in the 1940s, and slide projectors in the 1950s. Transparencies for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers. Computer presentation programs became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using LCD overhead projectors. Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television. Laying out a presentation presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages. Consideration might be given to: * Sizing text and graphics so they can be seen from the back of the room, which limits the amount of information that can be presented on a single slide * Using headers, footers, or repeated elements to make all pages similar so they feel cohesive, or indicate progress * Using titles to introduce new topics or segments * Pacing, so slides are changed at comfortable intervals, fit the length of the talk, and content order matches the speaker's expectation * Providing a way for the speaker to refer to specific items on the page, such as with color, verbal labels, or a laser pointer * Editing the information presented so it either repeats what the speaker is saying (so the audience can pay attention to either) or only presents information that cannot be conveyed verbally (to avoid dividing audience attention or simply reading slides directly) * Use of animation to add emphasis, introduce information slowly, or be entertaining * Making the slides useful for later reference if printed as handouts or posted online  Grids versus templates  Grids and templates are page layout design patterns used in advertising campaigns and multiple-page publications, including websites. A grid is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid. In contrast, a template is more rigid. A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content. Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with master page features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features. Static versus dynamic layouts Static layouts allow for more control over the aesthetics, and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In web design, this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All raster image formats are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics. In contrast, electronic pages allow for dynamic layouts with swapping content, personalization of styles, text scaling, image scaling, or reflowable content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to separate presentation from content, which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed. Static layout design may involve more graphic design and visual art skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more interactive design and content management skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation. Motion graphics don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants motion graphic design more than static graphic design or interactive design. Electronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a web banner may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain transparency and flow content around contours. Front-end versus back-end With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between visual communications (front-end) and information technology (back-end). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require meta data for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data (meta tags) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both. More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the front-end, and function coding as the back- end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as image editing software or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a \\"What You See Is What You Get\\" (WYSIWYG) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back- end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end. Design elements and choices Page layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a house style which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template. There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures). Typical page layout decisions include: * Size of page margins * Size and position of images and figures * Deciding on the number and size of columns and gutters (gaps between columns) * Placement of intentional whitespace * Use of special effects like overlaying text on an image, runaround and intrusions, or bleeding an image over the page margin * Use of color printing or spot color for emphasis Specific elements to be laid out might include: * Chapter or section titles, or headlines and subheads * Image captions * Pull quotes and nut graphs which might be added out of course or to make a short story fit the layout * Boxouts and sidebars, which present information as asides from the main text flow * Page headers and page footers, the contents of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software. The page number is usually included in the header or footer, and software automatically increments it for each page. * Table of contents * Notes like footnotes and end notes; bibliography, for example in academic journals or textbooks In newspaper production, final selection and cropping of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor. Likewise, headlines might be written by the layout editor, a copy editor, or the original author. To make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to typography elements like font size or leading. =Floating block= A floating block in writing and publishing is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and tables is a typical feature of academic writing and technical writing, including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled figure (for pictures, diagrams, plots, etc.) and table. An alternative name for figure is image or graphic. Floating blocks are said to be floating because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page. By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pagesNew Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX, Comprehensive. p. VS-B2. rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, typesetting is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided. For example, an article on geography might have \\"Figure 1: Map of the world\\", \\"Figure 2: Map of Europe\\", \\"Table 1: Population of continents\\", \\"Table 2: Population of European countries\\", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures‚Äîin addition to the table of contents‚Äîthat lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work. Other kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example: : Sidebar:Sams Teach Yourself Dreamweaver CS5 in 24 Hours. p. 406. For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an intermezzo. See sidebar (publishing). : Program: Articles and books on computer programming often place code and algorithms in a figure. : Equation: Writing on mathematics may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart from the main text. Presenting layouts under development A mockup of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready. Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch. A comprehensive layout for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue. A website wireframe is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images. Lorem ipsum text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published. Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled \\"for position only\\".

Founded in 1487 by former Lord Mayor of London Sir Edmund Shaa, it is the second oldest in the North of England, after Lancaster Royal Grammar School, and a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. History =Foundation= The Main School's West Face. The photo (left) was taken after construction in 1916. The photo (right) was taken in 2012. The school was founded in 1487 by Sir Edmund Shaa, the 1482 Lord Mayor of London whose will provided for a school and a small chapel in St Mary's Church in Stockport and funds to maintain a priest to chant masses and teach grammar. Alexander Lowe, the mayor of Stockport, left the school a permanent home in Chestergate in his will. The school became increasingly successful with pupils being accepted at the ancient universities of Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews, while the curriculum became increasingly broad with the rudiments of Greek joining a study of Latin, the Christian religion, writing in English and arithmetic.Nicholas Carlisle, Concise Description of Endowed Grammar Schools (1818)Stockport Grammar School  Stockport Grammar School. facebook.com. Retrieved on September 7, 2012. Five years after the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths met to discuss the possibility of transferring the school to a different site, new buildings open where Greek Street meets New Wellington Road. As well as paying for the building, the Goldsmiths also increased the salaries of the headmaster and usher and paid the running costs. =Current site on Buxton Road= The Greek Street building became unsuitable for the demands of a modern school, and the school was relocated in 1915 to its present site and was inaugurated on 29 January 1916 by the chairman of the Cheshire county council. =Move to coeducation= Path to Convent Site In 1980, girls were admitted to the school. Following the government‚Äôs decision in 1974 to phase out the direct grant status of schools such as Stockport over a seven-year period commencing in 1976, the school would become independent and the Stopfordian Trust was launched to provide bursaries that were increasingly being requested by entrance exam candidates. By 1978, the school had over 600 pupils and in 1979 the convent site was acquired. The school site =The Mile End buildings 1916-1980= View of the Hallam Hall across the Old Quad The construction of the present buildings took twenty months. The exterior of the West Front has remained virtually unchanged since the time. The Hallam Hall, seen from across the Old Quad below was named after the Mayor of Stockport and major benefactor Ephraim Hallam. This was originally the School‚Äôs main library but due to the expansion of the School site, which included a new, multi-resource 14000 book library, the hall was converted into an entertainments room. The main school building was constructed with a Victorian neo-gothic style of architecture, drawing similar appearances to that of Keble College, Oxford, which incidentally was built during the same time period. Other buildings which have been constructed since then have mostly remained continuous with the general style of the main site, particularly the muted red brick and distinctive yellow limestone bands which feature heavily on the main building. =Post-1980 Expansion= New Library and Learning Resource Centre Since becoming co-educational in 1980 the school has developed and grown rapidly. Acquisition of the adjacent convent school site, that is now the English and music block, allowed the enclosure of the playing fields and the creation of several football and rugby pitches, as well as the inheritance of the convent's swimming pool. In 1997 land was bought to extend the junior school, and in 2001 a new sports and technology centre was built featuring a gymnasium and sports hall. Food technology and textiles technology classrooms were also erected. The building further includes a design technology workshop with equipment able to perform computer aided design and computer aided manufacture. The sports hall also holds an indoor climbing wall named after alumnus mountaineer Peter Boardman, squash courts and gives access to the school's swimming pool which is overlooked by a cafeteria area. In September 2005 a new library and learning resource centre was opened with more than 14,000 books, and also new physics labs and an information technology suite. A nursery was opened in 2006. With the purchase of the playing fields at Dialstone Lane, the school site expanded its site to almost 60 acres, one of the largest in Greater Manchester. =New Woodsmoor building 2013-= In 2011, planning permission was received to erect a new teaching block on the Woodsmoor side of the site,Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, notice of planning decision. stockportgrammar.co.uk.

In 2017, an expedition took 41 students to Borneo. Pupils participate in planning the trips and manage their own finances, accommodation, food and transportation. House System The school has four houses - Arden, Nicholson, Vernon, and Warren - into which all pupils are divided for the purposes of competitive sport and quizzes. Each year all four house compete for both the Fallow Shield (sporting success) and the Brown Cup (academic success). The houses encourage integration of all pupils into school life. Sport is not the only competitive activity for the houses, there is also chess and the competition of gaining the highest charitable amount. =Origin of the Houses= The four Houses were created initially in 1924 for competition in games and athletics with the undistinguished names of North, South, East and West. These were replaced in 1949 with rather more appropriate names of distinguished local families associated with the School in the past. Arden Arden House Coat of Arms The Ardernes were an important county family deriving from Sir John de Arnerne who lived in the 18th century and who received a great estate within the Earldom of Chester. Subsequent marriages constantly added to the Arderne estate until they included a great part of Bredbury, Romiley, Werneth, Offerton, Stockport and Alvanley. Ralph Arderne helped to defend Manchester against the Royalists in the Civil War. John Ardern (who changed the spelling of the family name), an Old Stopfordian, went to St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge in 1728 and later became High Sheriff of Cheshire and his son Richard Pepper Arden was appointed as Lord Chief Justice of England with the title Lord Alvanley at the end of the 18th century. The Ardens had two local residences. Their town house was Underbank Hall, a fine half-timbered mansion (now the National Westminster Bank) and Harden Hall which once commanded a moated in Reddish. Nicholson Nicholson House Coat of Arms The Nicholsons were a very numerous, though not a powerful family, who in the 16th century lived in the Reddish district. Their names occur frequently in the early Parish Registers which were first begun in 1584. Their main home was Wood Hall, Sandy Lane. The family originated in Cumberland (Cumbria) and, after a century or two at Reddish, the main branch moved on to become landowners in Essex, but left behind numerous relatives. William Nicholson, born probably in 1561 was a former Master of the School. He attend Caius College, Cambridge in June 1581, then changed to Jesus College, where he took his B.A. in 1585 and M.A. in 1588. No-one can say when he was appointed Master of Stockport Grammar School because the records of the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company are missing from 1579 to 1592, but it is likely to be 1587, after the death of Francis Low. He died in office and was buried at Stockport in September 1597. He was a man of substance, his will showing connections with other county families. He left money to pay for an ‚ÄúUsher‚Äù or assistant in the School as well as dictionaries and other books, which would of course be valuable in those days. Vernon Vernon House Coat of Arms The Vernon family belong to a wealthy, prolific and widespread English family with 11th- century origins in Vernon, France. William de Vernon arrived in England at the time of the Norman conquest and was granted lands in the County Palatine of Chester under the patronage of Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester.Earls of Chester. Retrieved on January 23, 2012. His son Richard was created a medieval Baron and settled at Shipbrook, near Northwich, Cheshire. Branches of the family flourished and its influence spread beyond Cheshire over the following centuries, partly as a result of judicious inter marriage. They were large benefactors of the School around the time of its founding, and out of the four houses, have the longest historic association with Stockport Grammar School. Warren Warren House Coat of Arms The Warren Family were both rich and powerful being Lords of the Manor of Stockport from the time of Sir John de Warren in the 14th century until 1835 when they sold out their manorial rights to the Corporation. The Warrens of Poynton were for centuries benefactors of the School. Sir Edward Warren, Baron of Stockport, gave additional increments to the Masters of the School over and above the salary paid by the Goldsmiths. He was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1598. John and Edward Warren in 1705 arranged for a payment out of the manorial rates to be given to the Schoolmaster and Edward Warren, Lord of the Manor of Stockport in 1711 gave a considerable area of Great Moor to provide a permanent income for the Schoolmaster, the Mayor of the Town and the poor. Hugh Warren, 1669 - 1733, son of Judge Warren and brother of Edward, benefactor, attended the School under Headmaster Timothy Dobson M.A. as did doubtless other Warren of whom records now remain. The Warrens lived at Poynton Hall of which nothing now exists. Their town house was Millgate Hall, a fine Tudor mansion in Newbridge lane taken down in 1927. Warren house are the current holders of the Fallow Shield.

It is sometimes erroneously translated as \\"Tribal Wars\\". It refers to conflicts in territories inhabited by other Baltic Finns, often in Russia or in borders of Russia. Finnish volunteers took part in these conflicts either to assert Finnish control over the areas inhabited by related Baltic Finns or to help them to gain their independence. Many of the volunteer soldiers were inspired by the idea of Greater Finland. Some of the conflicts were incursions from Finland and some were local uprisings, where volunteers wanted either to help the people in their fight for independence or to annex the areas to Finland. According to Roselius, about 10,000 volunteers from Finland took part in the armed conflicts mentioned below. * Estonian War of Independence (1918‚Äì1920) ** Pohjan Pojat (\\"Sons of the North\\") and I Suomalainen Vapaajoukko (I Finnish volunteer corps) helped Estonian troops. * Viena expedition (1918) ** Murmansk Legion * Aunus expedition (1919) * Petsamo expeditions (1918 and 1920) * East Karelian Uprising (1921‚Äì1922) * National revolt of Ingrian Finns (1918‚Äì1920) The phenomenon is closely linked to nationalism and irredentism, as Finland had just won its national independence, and a part of the population felt that they had obligations to help other Baltic Finns to attain the same. Estonia, the closest and numerically largest \\"kindred nation\\", had gained its independence at the same time, but had fewer resources, fewer institutions ready to support its attained position, and more Russian troops within its borders. Other Baltic Finns were at a less organized level of cultural, economic and political capability. The Finnish Civil War had awakened strong nationalistic feelings in Finnish citizens and other Baltic Finns, and they sought tangible ways to put these feelings into action. For the two next decades, Finns participated at a relatively high rate in nationalistic activities (e.g. Karelianism and Finnicization of the country and its institutions). This development was related to the trauma and divisiveness of the Civil War. Many White sympathizers in the Civil War became radically nationalistic as a result of the war. The strenuous five-year period 1939‚Äì45 of total war‚Äîwhich also mostly unified the nation‚Äîreduced this enthusiasm.

Different arrangements and configurations of these machines will affect the system's productivity.Koren, Y., Hu J., and Weber T.: Impact of Manufacturing System Configuration on Performance. CIRP Annals, Vol. 1, pp. 689-698, August 1998. A collection of mathematical tools, which are defined as the RMS science base, may be utilized to maximize system productivity with the smallest possible number of machines.  Rationale for RMS  Globalization has created a new landscape for industry, one of fierce competition, short windows of market opportunity, and frequent changes in product demand. This change presents both a threat and an opportunity. To capitalize on the opportunity, industry needs to possess manufacturing systems that can produce a wide range of products within a product family. That range must meet the requirements of multiple countries and various cultures, not just one regional market. A design for the right mix of products must be coupled with the technical capabilities that allow for quick changeover of product mix and quantities that might vary dramatically, even on a monthly basis. Reconfigurable manufacturing systems have these capabilities.  RMS characteristics  Ideal reconfigurable manufacturing systems possess six core characteristics: modularity, integrability, customized flexibility, scalability, convertibility, and diagnosability. These characteristics, which were introduced by professor Yoram Koren in 1995, apply to the design of whole manufacturing systems, as well as to some of its components: reconfigurable machines, their controllers, and system control software. =Modularity= RMT patent drawing: The compartmentalization of production functions and requirements into operational units that can be manipulated between alternate production schemes to achieve the optimal arrangement to fit a given set of needs. In a reconfigurable manufacturing system, many components are typically modular (e.g., machines, axes of motion, controls, and tooling‚Äîsee example in the Figure below). When necessary, the modular components can be replaced or upgraded to better suit new applications. Modules are easier to maintain and update, thereby lowering life-cycle costs of systems. New calibration algorithms can be readily integrated into the machine controller, resulting in a system with greater accuracy. For example, integrating cross-coupling control into CNC controllers substantially enhances its accuracy. The fundamental questions when designing with the modular approach are: (a) what are the appropriate building blocks or modules, and (b) how should they be connected to synthesize a functioning whole? Selection of basic modules and the way they are connected allow for the creation of systems that can be easily integrated, diagnosed, customized, and converted. =Integrability= Integrability is the ability to integrate modules rapidly and precisely by a set of mechanical, informational, and control interfaces that enable integration and communication. At the machine level, axes of motions and spindles can be integrated to form machines. Integration rules allow machine designers to relate clusters of part features and their corresponding machining operations to machine modules, thereby enabling product-process integration. At the system level the machines are the modules that are integrated via material transport systems (such as conveyors and gantries) to form a reconfigurable system. To aid in designing reconfigurable systems, system configuration rules are utilized. In addition, machine controllers can be designed for integration into a factory control system. =Customization= Customization is to design system/machine flexibility just around a product family, obtaining thereby customized-flexibility, as opposed to the general flexibility of FMS/CNC. This characteristic drastically distinguishes RMS from flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), and allows a reduction in investment cost. It enables the design of a system for the production of a part family, rather than a single part (as produced by DML) or any part (typical FMS). \\"Part family\\" means, for example, several types of engine blocks or several types of microprocessors, or all types of Boeing 747. In the context of RMS, a part family is defined as all parts (or products) that have similar geometric features and shapes, the same level of tolerances, require the same processes, and are within the same range of cost. The definition of the part family must ensure that most manufacturing system resources are utilized for the production of every member part. The RMS configuration must be customized to fit the dominant features of the whole part family by utilizing the characteristic of customized flexibility. Customized flexibility for the part family allows the utilization of multiple tools (e.g., spindles in machining or nozzles in injection molding) on the same machine, thereby increasing productivity at reduced cost without compromising flexibility. =Convertibility= Convertibility is the ability to easily transform the functionality of existing systems, machines, and controls to suit new production requirements. System convertibility may have several levels. Conversion may require switching spindles on a milling machine (e.g., from low-torque high-speed spindle for aluminum to high-torque low-speed spindle for titanium), or manual adjustment of passive degrees-of-freedom changes when switching production between two members of the part family within a given day. System conversion at this daily level must be carried out quickly to be effective. To achieve this, the RMS must utilize not only conventional methods such as off-line setting, but it should also contain advanced mechanisms that allow for easy conversion between parts, as well as sensing and control methods that enable quick calibration of the machines after conversion. =Scalability= Scalability is the ability to easily change production capacity by rearranging an existing manufacturing system and/or changing the production capacity of reconfigurable stations. Scalability is the counterpart characteristic of convertibility. Scalability may require at the machine level adding spindles to a machine to increase its productivity, and at the system level changing part routing or adding machines to expand the overall system capacity (i.e., maximum possible volume) as the market for the product grows. =Diagnosability= Diagnosability is the ability to automatically read the current state of a system for detecting and diagnosing the root-cause of output product defects, and subsequently correct operational defects quickly. Diagnosability has two aspects: detecting machine failure and detecting unacceptable part quality. The second aspect is critical in RMS. As production systems are made more reconfigurable, and their layouts are modified more frequently, it becomes essential to rapidly tune (or ramp-up) the newly reconfigured system so that it produces quality parts. Consequently, reconfigurable systems must also be designed with product quality measurement systems as an integral part. For example, a reconfigurable inspection machine (RIM) embedded in the RMS enables quick detection. These measurement systems are intended to help identify the sources of product quality problems in the production system rapidly, so they can be corrected utilizing control methods, statistics, and signal processing techniques.  RMS principles  Reconfigurable manufacturing systems operate according to a set of basic principles formulated by professor Yoram Koren and are called Koren's RMS principles. The more of these principles applicable to a given manufacturing system, the more reconfigurable is that system. The RMS principles are: # The RMS is designed for adjustable production resources to respond to imminent needs. ## The RMS capacity is rapidly scalable in small, optimal increments. ## The RMS functionality is rapidly adaptable to the production of new products. # To enhance the speed of responsiveness of a manufacturing system, core RMS characteristics should be embedded in the whole system as well as in its components (mechanical, communications and controls). # The RMS is designed around a part family, with just enough customized flexibility needed to produce all parts in that family. # The RMS contains an economic equipment mix of flexible (e.g., CNC) and reconfigurable machines with customized flexibility, such as reconfigurable machine tools, reconfigurable inspection machines, and reconfigurable assembly machines. # The RMS possesses hardware and software capabilities to cost-effectively respond to unpredictable events‚Äîboth external (market changes) and intrinsic events (machine failure).  RMS and FMS  Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) and flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) have different goals. FMS aims at increasing the variety of parts produced. RMS aims at increasing the speed of responsiveness to markets and customers. RMS is also flexible, but only to a limited extent‚Äîits flexibility is confined to only that necessary to produce a part family. This is the \\"customized flexibility\\" or the customization characteristic, which is not the general flexibility that FMS offers. The advantages of customized flexibility are faster throughput and higher production rates. Other important advantages of RMS are rapid scalability to the desired volume and convertibility, which are obtained within reasonable cost to manufacturers. The best application of a FMS is found in production of small sets of products [see Wikipedia]; With RMS, however, production volume may vary from small to large.  RMS science base  The RMS technology is based on a systematic approach to the design and operation of reconfigurable manufacturing systems. The approach consists of key elements, the compilation of which is called the RMS science base. These elements are summarized below. * Given a part family, desired volume, and mix, a system-level process planner can suggest alternative system configurations and compare their productivity, part quality, convertibility, and scalability options.Hu, S.

Carnivorous Plants of New Zealand. Ecosphere Publications. Variants are often known by the localities in which they are found. The plant does not form hibernacula in winter, and is easily grown using the same methods as Drosera capensis. Carnivorous plant growers consider D. spatulata to be a weed because it is very hardy and produces copious amounts of seed when it flowers. The seed also germinates without much difficulty, causing little plants to pop up in surrounding pots. Many \\"D. spatulata\\" distributed in cultivation are mislabeled and are often actually D. tokaiensis. Description Detail of the leaf of Drosera spatulata with the sticky tentacles that it uses to attract and catch flies and other insects. Drosera spatulata is a variable perennial plant that produces small rosettes of numerous spathulate leaves. This species is widely variable, but generally plants are about in diameter. Each leaf is attached to the central rosette by a narrow 8 mm long petiole that is only glandular on the upper half. Individual leaf laminae are typically 5 mm long and 4 mm wide. In early summer, plants will produce tall erect scapes with around six small white or pink flowers on each one-sided racemose inflorescence. Each flower can be up to 6 mm across.Gibson, R. 1994.

Life  Kontrym was born 27 August 1898 in Zaturka, near ≈Åuck in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ. He began his military career by volunteering for the Imperial Russian Army in March 1915. Initially he served in the 106th Infantry Regiment, completing NCO training in Saratov. Between August and December 1915 he commanded a platoon of the 250th Infantry Regiment, and from June 1916 he served as adjutant of the 3rd Battalion of the 127th Infantry Regiment. In August 1917 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and was made commanding officer of a cavalry reconnaissance unit of the 660th Infantry Regiment. Kontrym joined Polish Army units that were forming in Russia and from 1918 served in the 5th Cavalry Regiment of the II Polish Army Corps. In May 1918 the Corps was disarmed and interned by the Germans at Kaniow. Kontrym escaped from the German POW camp and attempted to join Polish Army units in Murmansk, Russia. In October 1918 he was arrested by the Bolshevik Cheka and conscripted into the Red Army. He fought against the Polish Army as commander of 82 Infantry Regiment and 28th Brigade of the 10th Infantry Division. For his abilities and gallantry, he was thrice awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In February 1921 he was transferred from his unit to study at the Frunze Military Academy. During that time, he contacted Polish Military attach√© Colonel Romuald Wolikowski, to whom he passed Soviet military secrets. His espionage activities were discovered, and he had to flee to Poland.

The genus name Drosera comes from the Greek word droseros, meaning \\"dew- covered\\". The specific epithet regia is derived from the Latin for \\"royal\\", a reference to the \\"striking appearance\\" of the species. Individual leaves can reach in length. It has many unusual relict characteristics not found in most other Drosera species, including woody rhizomes, operculate pollen, and the lack of circinate vernation in scape growth. All of these factors, combined with molecular data from phylogenetic analysis, contribute to the evidence that D. regia possesses some of the most ancient characteristics within the genus. Some of these are shared with the related Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), which suggests a close evolutionary relationship. The tentacle- covered leaves can capture large prey, such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles of all Drosera species have special stalked glands on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage. The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond to captured prey by bending to surround it. In its native fynbos habitat, the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs. Of the two known populations of D. regia, the higher altitude site appears to be overgrown and is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making it the most endangered Drosera species, since it is threatened with extinction in the wild. It is often cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and a single cultivar has been registered.  Description  Detail of a leaf A leaf wrapped around prey Detail of a flower Drosera regia plants are fairly large herbs that produce horizontal woody rhizomes and a crown of large, linear leaves up to long and wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly the entire length of the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate vernation (uncurling) and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D. regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy.Gibson, R. 1999. Drosera arcturi in Tasmania and a comparison with Drosera regia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 28(3): 76‚Äì80.Obermeyer, A. A. 1970. Droseraceae. In L. E. Codd, B. Winter, D. J. B. Killick, and H. B. Rycroft [eds.], Flora of South Africa, 13: 187‚Äì201. Department of Agricultural Technical Services, Pretoria, South Africa.McPherson, S. 2008. Glistening Carnivores: The Sticky-leaved Insect-eating Plants. Poole, Dorset, England: Redfern Natural History Productions. pp. 154‚Äì157. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.Stephens, E. L. 1926. A new sundew, Drosera regia (Stephens), from the Cape Province. Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, 13(4): 309‚Äì312. The woody rhizomes produced by the plant are one of the unusual characteristics that it shares only with D. arcturi in the genus; the absence of woody rhizomes in all other Drosera is often cited as an indication of the presumed ancient lineage of D. regia and D. arcturi. Drosera regia also produces relatively few thick, fleshy roots, which possess root hairs along the terminal . Asexual reproduction of mature plants usually occurs after flowering with new plants arising from the rhizome and roots. After a fire, undamaged roots will often re-sprout new plants. Drosera regia flowers in January and February, producing scapes up to long. The scapes emerge vertically, lacking the circinate vernation of its leaves and all other scapes of the genus Drosera, with the exception of D. arcturi. The scapes consist of two primary branches and bear 5 to 20 (sometimes 30) unscented pink flowers with long petals. Bracts are small, bearing some reduced tentacles. Each flower has three unbranched, spreading styles emerging from the top of the ovary and extending beyond the five erect stamens (15 mm long), which surround the ovary. This arrangement minimizes the chance of self-fertilisation. Studies have shown that the operculate pollen shed in tetrads (fused groups of four pollen grains), characteristics that are similar in the related Dionaea muscipula (the Venus flytrap) and Aldrovanda vesiculosa, is incompatible with clones, failing to produce seed when plants are self-fertilised. Seeds are brown to black, linear and ornamented with fine network-like markings, and 2 mm long and 0.5 mm in diameter. Seed is shed by the end of March.Takahashi, H. and Sohma, K. 1982. Pollen morphology of the Droseraceae and its related taxa. Science Reports of the Research Institutes Tohoku University, 4th Series, Biology, 38: 81‚Äì156. The unusual characteristics that set it apart from other species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen.Seine, R., and Barthlott, W. 1994. Some proposals on the infrageneric classification of Drosera L. Taxon, 43: 583‚Äì589. Drosera regia shares other features with the robust Tasmanian form of D. arcturi, including the lack of stipules and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the scape. It has a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera and closer to the diploid chromosome number of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula), another member of the Droseraceae.Behre, K. 1929. Physiologische und zytologische Untersuchungen √ºber Drosera. Planta, 7: 208‚Äì306. Kondo, K. 1969. Chromosome numbers of carnivorous plants. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 96(3): 322‚Äì328. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D. rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.Rivadavia, F. 2005. New chromosome numbers for Drosera L. (Droseraceae). Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 34(3): 85‚Äì91.  Distribution and habitat  Drosera regia is endemic to South Africa and has only ever been found at two sites at altitudes of in the Bainskloof Range near Wellington, Western Cape in South Africa. Despite extensive exploration, D. regia has not been found at any similar location in neighbouring valleys. Small morphological variations such as broader leaves have been recorded from these two small populations, which are restricted to an area of just a few hundred square meters. Drosera regia is found in a natural fynbos vegetation amongst dense marshy grasses. The fynbos habitat is similar to a low or medium shrubland or heathland, dominated by low evergreen shrubs. The lower altitude site where D. regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, often with a gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground when there is a gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D. regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D. regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley. = Conservation status = In a 2009 report of a 2006 trip, botanist Andreas Fleischmann noted that the higher altitude site is overgrown with plants of the family Restionaceae and he could not locate any remaining D. regia. The lower altitude site was in a similar state, but he recorded approximately 50 mature plants, making this one of the most critically endangered Drosera species.Fleischmann, A. 30 April 2009. Wild Drosera regia. CPUK Forum. Retrieved 21 December 2009. While D. regia has not been evaluated under the current International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) standards for a rating on the Red List of Threatened Species, the International Carnivorous Plant Society recognised D. regia on their list of imperiled carnivorous plant species.Rice, B. A. 2003. Appendix: Imperiled Carnivorous Plant Species List. International Carnivorous Plant Society. Retrieved 21 December 2009. Drosera regia was also listed as \\"rare\\" on an early IUCN report in 1997,Walter, K. S., and Gillett, H. J. [eds]. 1998. 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants. International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. p. 240. but these earlier IUCN assessments were often poorly documented and are thus not relied upon today.International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. 2010. Red List Overview. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 9 January 2010. Several other authors have identified how rare D. regia is in the wild, even calling it \\"threatened with extinction\\".Barthlott, W., Porembski, S., Seine, R., and Theisen, I. 2007. The Curious World of Carnivorous Plants: A Comprehensive Guide to Their Biology and Cultivation. Portland, Oregon, USA: Timber Press. pp. 94‚Äì106. The short-term prognosis for natural populations of D. regia was greatly improved when a fire swept through its habitat in 2015. A team from Stellenbosch Botanical Gardens found new populations in the lower elevation zone and rediscovered plants in the higher elevation zone.  Taxonomy and botanical history  Drosera regia was originally described by South African botanist Edith Layard Stephens in 1926.Schlauer, J. 2009. World Carnivorous Plant List ‚Äì Nomenclatural Synopsis of Carnivorous Phanerogamous Plants.. Retrieved 26 December 2009. The binomial name Drosera regia is derived from the Greek word droseros, meaning \\"dew- covered\\" and the specific epithet regia comes from the Latin for \\"royal\\", a reference to what Stephens described as its \\"striking appearance\\". The genus is collectively referred to as the sundews, while Drosera regia is commonly referred to as the king sundew. Stephens was informed about this new species by Mr. J. Rennie, who had found several plants growing by a stream in the upper end of \\"Baviaans Kloof\\" on Easter in 1923. Additional specimens were located directly above this site on a plateau between South Ridge Peak and Observation Point. A second population was located in 1926 about away below the Slanghoek Peak near the headwaters of the Witte River. Stephens placed D. regia in section Psychophila Planch., which at that time included D. arcturi, D. stenopetala, and D. uniflora, though she noted that the many-flowered inflorescence was unusual for this group. In 1970, the South African botanist Anna Amelia Obermeyer suggested that D. regia did not fit into any of the taxonomic groups established by Ludwig Diels in his 1906 monograph on the family. Obermeyer noted the unusual characteristics that set D. regia apart from any other Drosera species: the operculate pollen, circinate leaf vernation, undivided styles, and woody rhizomes. In 1994, R√ºdiger Seine and Wilhelm Barthlott proposed classifying D. regia as the sole species in a new subgenus, Drosera subg. Regiae, to \\"give adequate recognition to the isolated position of D. regia within the genus.\\" This taxonomic position was affirmed by Jan Schlauer in his dichotomous key and taxonomic revisions published in 1996.Schlauer, J. 1996. A dichotomous key to the genus Drosera L. (Droseraceae). Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 25(3): 67‚Äì88. Also in 1996 two Czech researchers, Jind≈ôich Chrtek and Zde≈àka Slav√≠kov√°, proposed changes to the taxonomy of the genus by splitting D. regia off into its own, monotypic genus, Freatulina. Chrtek and Slav√≠kov√° cited the many morphological differences between D. regia and every other member of the genus Drosera in support of their decision to make this taxonomic split.Chrtek, J., and Slav√≠kov√°, Z. 1996. Comments on the families Drosophyllaceae and Droseraceae. Journal of the National Museum (Prague), Natural History Series, 165: 139‚Äì141. They reaffirmed their taxonomic opinions in a 1999 article that also split the tuberous Drosera, members of the subgenus Ergaleium, to Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's resurrected genus Sondera.Chrtek, J. and Slav√≠kov√°, Z. 1999. Genera and families of the Droserales order. Novitates Botanicae Universitatis Carolinae, 13: 39‚Äì46. These taxonomic revisions, however, have not gained any support, being rejected or largely ignored by recent publications on the genus.Rice, B. A. 2006. Growing Carnivorous Plants. Timber Press: Portland, Oregon, USA. pp. 84‚Äì85. = Evolutionary relationships = Phylogenetic analysis of morphological characteristics and gene sequences has supported the basal position within the genus long suspected of D. regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D. regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaea muscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera.Williams, S. E., Albert, V. A., and Chase, M. W. 1994. Relationships of Droseraceae: a cladistic analysis of rbcL sequence and morphological data. American Journal of Botany, 81(8): 1027‚Äì1037. Further analysis in 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D. regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda.Cameron, K. M., Wurdack, K. J., Jobson, R. W. 2002. Molecular evidence for the common origin of snap-traps among carnivorous plants. American Journal of Botany, 89(9): 1503‚Äì1509. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D. regia and D. arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D. regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D. arcturi. Evidence for the evolution of \\"snap-traps\\" of Dionaea and Aldrovanda from a flypaper trap like D. regia has also emerged and been argued for based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data implies that the Venus flytrap (Dionaea) and Aldrovanda snap-traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with the Drosera; the living evidence of a link between Drosera and Dionaea is D. regia and its remnant characteristics. In this evolutionary model, pre-adaptations to evolution into snap-traps were identified in several species of Drosera, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap-trap evolved from the flypaper traps of Drosera, driven by increasing prey size. Larger prey can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; the evolution of snap- traps would largely prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive any benefit from it).Gibson, T. C., and Waller, D. M. 2009. Evolving Darwin's 'most wonderful' plant: ecological steps to a snap-trap. New Phytologist, 183(3): 575‚Äì587.  Cultivation  D. regia in cultivation Drosera regia cultivation was first attempted prior to the formal description of the species in 1926. The author, Edith Layard Stephens, reported the successful cultivation of D. regia, noting that such success required \\"a moist and comparatively cool atmosphere\\", similar to that of its native environment. Drosera regia is often described as being a difficult species to cultivate,Clemens, W. J. 2004. New Cultivars: Drosera regia 'Big Easy'. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 33(3): 83‚Äì89. though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D. regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form.Jacobs, P. 1981. On growing Drosera regia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 10(1): 10.Ziemer, R. R. 1980. Drosera regia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 9(1): 15.Mazrimas, J. 1996. Drosera. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, 25(3): 95‚Äì96. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.Conran, J. G., Jaudzems, V. G., and Hallam, N. D. 1997. Droseraceae germination patterns and their taxonomic significance. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 123: 211‚Äì223. In 2004, William Joseph Clemens registered the only cultivar of this species, D. regia 'Big Easy'. It is reputed to be more robust than other clones of the species and is also more compact with maximum leaf lengths of . Under his culture conditions, 'Big Easy' has also never flowered or gone dormant. Clemens originally obtained his D. regia from a vendor at the International Carnivorous Plant Society conference held in 2000. After sufficient investigation, he registered the new cultivar in a 2004 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter, the quarterly publication of the International Carnivorous Plant Society.

The consumer usually never sees the construction features of an upholstered piece. The overall quality of the materials and construction dictate the comfort level of an upholstered piece and its ability to satisfy the consumer over the long term. A basic upholstered piece may be composed of a frame, springs, foam, cushioning, padding, and textiles. Coil springs are individual coils, open at both ends. They may be knotted at one end. When attached to webbing and twine-tied at the top, they form the platform on which the loose cushion rests. History Ancient coiled helical or spiral shaped wire objects resembling springs have been discovered in the Balkans and across Europe by archaeological teams. Such objects dating from as far back as 4000 BC, the beginning of the first Bronze Age, abound in museums and collections.Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York Wire coiled objects, possibly designed as rings or jewelry, nevertheless exhibit the properties of extension or compression springs. Three technologies drove the development of coiled springs in the mid-1500s, enabled by advances in the quality of steel; these were time-pieces (e.g., clocks and portable watches), firearms (e.g., cannons and pistols), and vehicles (e.g., coaches and carriages). The latter emerged in 16th century Hungary. Sir William Felton's Treatise on Carriages of 1793Sir William Felton, Treatise On Carriages, 1793 and George Thrupp's History of Coaches of 1877George Thrupp, History Of Carriages, 1877 give examples of evolving applications of springs in transportation that directly transferred to furniture. Germany and Sweden were known even in fifteen century Europe as having the best steel because indigenous iron had .05-.07% carbon, which is excellent spring grade iron for steel. In 1690, Sir Ambrose Crowley used German Syrian steel for quality watch springs.W. Blakey, 1780, The Art Of Making Watch Springs, translated by M. L.

In it he explains how anyone can take well formed wire of various compositions and wind it around a form to create a spring. His work demonstrated the phenomenon known today as Hooke's Law, which characterizes springs as providing a restoring force proportional to the extent of their deformation. Clive Edwards, furniture historian, wrote, \\"One of the most tantalizing questions in eighteenth century furniture is that of springing. Commonly thought to have been a nineteenth century innovation, there is evidence of earlier use. The initial demands for springs appear to have come from the coach builders and the second came from furniture-makers. Coach builders were seeking to improve the ride of vehicles as well as to improve upon the interior comfort seats for passengers.\\" Clive D. Edwards, Eighteenth Century Furniture, 1996, Manchester University Press, p. 116 The English guild category is known as \\"The Worshipful Company Of Furniture Makers\\" but in sixteenth through nineteenth century times this trade was known as cabinet- makers. The common nexus was the iron workers and blacksmith shops that were developing carriage springs and supplying hardware parts for cabinet-makers. George Thrupp illustrated a coil spring used in a carriage presented to the French Academy in 1703. In 1706, Henry Mills received Great BritainGreat Britain Patent 376, year 1706 patent 376 \\"For A New Mathematical Instrument For New Sorts Of Springs...And That The New Invented Springs Are Made And Contrived of several forms-semicircular, circular, angular, oval, or other forms...\\" These spring were lighter weight, a set weighing only 20 pounds versus other coach springs in use that weighed 120 pounds per set. These were helical extension springs also known as \\"worm\\" springs due to the spiral nature. in 1762, Richard Tredwell, Great Britain Patent of Rotherham in the County of York, received a patent for a leaf spring for carriages, and, again, in 1763, Richard Tredwell received Great Britain PatentGreat Britain Patent 792 for year 1763 792 for \\"Springs For Carriages\\". There are four pages in this patent and the fourth page clearly shows nine iterations of helical suspension or worm springs and the patent clearly states it is \\"my new method of making and constructing springs for hanging of coaches\\". Coil compression springs would not be used for hanging a carriage. Tredwell's patent had no contribution to upholstery spring developments. In 1780, William Blakey, an expert clock historian, wrote The Art Of Making Watch Springs (translated by M Wayman) where he said that, \\"The art of making watch and clock springs could possibly be, of all mechanical operations, the one which provides the greatest amount of knowledge of the physical properties of steel. In the process of discovering the qualities of iron which are essential in order to convert it into steel, the artisan cannot avoid recognizing the different qualities of metal, such as its hardness, its malleability, its elasticity, etc.\\" He also said it was not easy to ascribe a date in the discovery of steel and its qualities--but this began when clocks and watches were being perfected.The Ferrous Metallurgy Of Early Clocks And Watches In Post Medieval Steel, British Museum Occasional Paper 136, 2000, pp. 13-26 In 1822,Austria Patent Office refer to Technical University where all pre-1850 patents are kept Georg Junigl of Vienna,Technical University of Austria Austria, received a \\"privilidg\\" which was an Austrian legal term for a patent for a wire spring used in combination with upholstery filling. This patent was announced in the April 24, 1822 edition 94, page 1, column 1, item 3, that Mr. Junigl, a bourgeoisie upholsterer of Vienna, had been granted the patent. He died in 1840 according to the Vienna, Austria newspaper. In 1826, Samuel Pratt of New Bond Street, in the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square in the County of Middlesex, received Great Britain Patent 5418Great Britain Patent 5418 of 1826 for \\"Beds, Bedsteads, Couches, Seats and Other Articles of Furniture\\". This patent used coiled shaped springs in an arrangement to minimize for furniture for a nautical sailing vessel. In 1828, Samuel PrattGreat Britain Patent 5668 for year 1828 received Great Britain Patent 5668 for \\"Elastic Beds And Cushions\\", which was to be an improvement in compression spring arrangements in furniture. Page 5 of the patent depicts two hour-glass shaped wire coil compression springs in both circular and triangular shapes. In 1833, August Boschow, a Viennese upholsterer, received an Austrian \\"privileg\\" (patent) that was published in the Vienna, Austrian newspaper on June 26, 1833. Boschow invented a new type of a ‚Äúclock‚Äù spring designed for use in carriages, chairs, and beds; the spring supported the human body in a sitting or supine position.Technical University of Austria In 1834, John Saville CroftonJohn Saville Crofton book in British Library published a book entitled The London Upholsterer's Companion, The Art Of Spring Stuffing. Crofton, a veteran of the upholstery trade, describes using nine circular steel coil springs 7 inches high and 3-1/2 inches wide, made of number 8 charcoal wire, for upholstering easy chairs. His book also describes spring upholstered sofas, beds, mattresses, pillows, and carriage and coach seats also made of circular coil spring of lighter gauges of wire. Crofton notes that coil springs have been in the trade a number of years, indicating the original date of the practice is unknown and this work in the British Library has been unheeded in history accounts on this topic. Crofton wrote on page 34 of his book, in the chapter about \\"Easy Chairs, Spring-stuffing\\": Charcoal wire was an early nineteenth century term that designated crucible manufacturing process for making better quality steel for drawing spring wire. The hand-tire style of crafting springs by tying each to adjacent springs is a method that dates back as far as Crofton writes--and probably much earlier, as he indicates. Modern upholstery methods may still refer to \\"hand tied\\" springs or \\"eight-way hand-tied springs\\" which are closely related to Crofton's method as described. In 1834 Crofton also informs that the upholsterer could make their own springs by obtaining wire and bending it around a wooden mold or purchasing springs by the hundred weight. In 1843, Holland & Sons offered upholstered chair, sofas, and other articles with descriptions such as \\"putting spring in frames\\", \\"spring stuffed\\", \\"double spring stuffed\\", and \\"spring stuffed cushions.Victoria and Albert Museum, records of Holland & Sons, 1843, pages 50 and 53, and 1844 page 58 Considering the evidence from the clock, carriage, and furniture trade, it is likely that upholstery springs may have been in use by local craftsmen before the eighteenth century, certainly existed in the eighteenth century, became normal by the beginning of the nineteenth century, and all types of springs were being developed and commonly used by mid- nineteenth century as both the British and American patent records clearly document. Patents do not necessarily mean first use but can only be used to evaluate and estimate trends. In 1849, T. E. WarrenU.S. Patent Office of the United States of America received patent 6740,Clive D. Edwards, furniture historian which was for a complex leaf spring used in seating and was utilized by the American Chair Company for seating on trains.Clive D. Edwards, Encyclopedia Of Furnishings Textiles, Floor Coverings, and Home Furnishing Practices 1200-1950, 2007, p. 198 In 1850, Alexander Oechslin received an Austrian patent for an \\"improvement in spiral spring upholstery\\".Technical University of Austria Between 1855 and 1900, hundreds of wire spring patents were issued in Great Britain and the United States for seating and bedding. These British patents can be viewed in a Master Abridgement of British Patents in Class 52 1855-1900. Washburn & Moen Manufacturing,Smithsonian Institution of American History, Washburn & Moen Records one of America's first wire drawing companies, founded in 1834, manufactured wire for a range of products from piano wire to telegraph wire, barbed wire, and wire for coil springs. Between 1837 and 1847, Washburn‚Äôs wire quality dictated that all iron billets 12‚Äô by 1-1/8‚Äù were imported from Sweden specifically for drawing wire; once in the United States, the billets were rolled into rods at mills in Troy, New York; Fall River, Massachusetts; or Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The Smithsonian Institution and Library of Congress retain portions of their historical records.Historical American Engineering Record, Washburn & Moen Manufacturing Company, Smithsonian Institution American History Museum Records, pp. 1-20 In 1869, Timothy Rose and Platt BuellU.S. Patent Office received an American patent, number 97,705, for a coil bed spring. In 1871, Edwin Bushnell of Poughkeepsie, New York, received anU.S. Patent Office American patent, number 4,616, for \\"An Improvement In Spring Mattresses\\". Prior to the early 1900s, springs were used as bed bases or box springs; these spring sets were not covered with fabrics. There were no \\"innerspring\\" mattresses manufactured until after 1900. Bushnell's patent has been citedSmithsonian Institution of American History Archive Center, Simmons Company Records, written history by Grant G. Simmons refers to Bushnell patent as first spring mattress to his knowledge - it is incorrect as proven by patents and Crofton, Heal & Sons Illustrated catalog of 1853 as an innerspring but it was an under bed spring--which in the mid-1800s was also called a mattress or base layer of a bed. Crofton's work of 1834 and Felton's work of 1793, in light of archeological finds and great works such as Sir Robert Hooke's Lecture on Springs, clearly indicate that coil springs came into use in the 17th or 18th centuries. The time, location, and inventors are unknown.

Western remained an independent women's college until 1970 when it formed a \\"committee of cooperation\\" with the adjacent Miami University, which opened enrollment between the colleges on a limited basis. This allowed Western students to take classes at Miami and use Miami's computer and hospital facilities, for example, while allowing Miami students access to intramural fields, library space, and cross-country runways on Western grounds. Before the 1973-74 school years, both presidents signed an agreement for an affiliation between the two schools. In 1974, Western became part of Miami due to financial difficulties.

Civil Rights Movement In June 1964, an orientation and training in nonviolence techniques was held on the campus of Western College for Women for volunteers heading south to Mississippi for Freedom Summer. While training at Western was still on-going, Mickey Schwerner, a veteran civil rights worker who had come to Oxford to help train the new recruits, received word that one of the churches that had agreed to host Freedom Summer activities had been attacked and burned. Schwerner and new volunteer, Andrew Goodman, left Oxford immediately to head back to Mississippi. Schwerner's wife, Rita, remained behind at Western College to finish the training. Within days, Schwerner and Goodman, along with James Chaney, a native Mississipian and voting rights activist, had been reported missing in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Their bodies were found months later, buried in an earthen dam. Public uproar over these murders helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act a few months later. A memorial tribute to the Freedom Summer activists was recently dedicated on the Western College campus. Western today In 1974, the Western College for Women merged with Miami University and became the Western College Program (School of Interdisciplinary Studies).

In Nepal, the Tamrakars are found among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley. Pages 110-111. Page 86.  Etymology and names  The name Tamrakar is derived from the Sanskrit words \\"tamra\\", meaning copper, and \\"kaar\\", refers to maker, worker In Nepal Bhasa, they are known as Tamo (Tamrakar from Patan) or Tamot or Tawo (Tamrakar from Kathmandu). They are skilled craftsmen with a distinct culture among Newars. They follow both Hinduism. In India, the various names for the caste include Tamrakar (in Madhya Pradesh), Tambatkar, Tamera, Thathera, Thathara, Kasar, Kasera, Kansara (in Gujarat), Kangabanik (West Bengal), Otari, Twasta Kasar and Tambat (Maharashtra), Tamta (Gharwal & kumaon). In Goa, they claim Brahmin status and call themselves Twashta Kasar Brahmin. In northern India, they also identify themselves as \\"Haihaivanshi Tamrakar Samaj\\", claiming Kshatriya descent from Sahastrabahu Arjuna and Haihaya dynasty.  Geography  In Nepal, Tamrakars are spread all over the Kathmandu Valley, but are mostly concentrated in the heart of Patan, Kathmandu,Bhaktapur and Achham Nepal.Gutschow, Niels and Michaels, Axel (2008) Growing up: Hindu and Buddhist initiation rituals among Newar children in Bhaktapur, Nepal. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag. , 9783447057523. Pages 23, 33. Retrieved 27 March 2012. Many live in various towns across Nepal. In Kathmandu, the main Tamrakar neighborhoods are Maru at Durbar Square, Yatkha Baha and Mahabati (Mahabouddha). In Patan, they are spreaded around the whole Patan area. Traditional occupation Tamrakars are traditional coppersmiths who make household utensils of copper and brass according to the division of labour practiced from ancient times. Jewelry and ritual objects made of silver are other products. They are also known for making traditional musical instruments like the ponga and the payntah, long horns made of copper. Many Tamrakars of Kathmandu participated in the traditional Tibet trade, and used to operate shops in Lhasa in Tibet, Ladakh in India and other trade centers on the Silk Road. Following the Sino-Indian War in 1962 when the caravan route linking India and Tibet through Sikkim was shut down, the centuries-old trade system came to an end, and the merchants and craftsmen based in Tibet closed up shop and returned home to Nepal. Today, Tamrakars are involved in handicraft, retail trade and the professions, and can be found among the leading names in business and industry. Culture The Tamrakars of Maru in Nepal have the task of playing the payntƒÅh (long horn) during the Samyak festival, the greatest Newar Buddhist celebration which is held once every 12 years in Kathmandu and in which each UrƒÅy caste has a duty.

GUIX ‚Äì the embedded UI for ThreadX was introduced in 2014. Express Logic was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Microsoft on April 18, 2019.  Technology  ThreadX implements a priority-based, preemptive scheduling algorithm with a proprietary feature called preemption-threshold. The latter has been shown to provide greater granularity within critical sections, reduce context switches, and has been the subject of academic research on guaranteeing scheduling. ThreadX provides a unique construct called event chaining, where the application can register a callback function on all application programming interfaces (APIs) that can signal an external event. This helps applications chain together various public objects in ThreadX such that one thread can effectively block on multiple objects. ThreadX also provides counting semaphores, mutexes with optional priority inheritance, event flags, message queues, software timers, fixed sized block memory, and variable sized block memory. All APIs in ThreadX that block on resources also have an optional timeout. ThreadX offers multi- core processor support via either AMP or SMP. Application code isolation is available through ThreadX Modules component.  Major components  ThreadX RTOS components include: # Embedded file system # Embedded graphical user interface # Embedded networking # Embedded USB # Safety certification # Packaging = Embedded file system = FileX is the embedded file system for ThreadX. FileX supports FAT12, 16, 32, and exFAT formats. The latter extends FAT file sizes beyond 4 GB, which is especially useful for video files, and it requires license directly from Microsoft for use. FileX also offers fault tolerance and supports direct NOR and NAND flash memory media through a flash wear leveling product called LevelX. = Embedded graphical user interface = GUIX is the embedded graphical user interface (GUI) for ThreadX. GUIX provides a 2D runtime system (environment) for embedded applications running ThreadX. GUIX supports multiple display devices with a variety of screen resolutions and color depths.

He also served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Union government (1998‚Äì1999). Early life Hegde was born at Siddapura in Uttara Kannada district into a Havyaka Brahmin family, he was son of Mahabaleshwar Hegde and Smt. Saraswati Amma Hegde, who hailed from Sirimane village near sringeri. Hegde completed a part of his studies at the Kashi Vidyapeeth in Varanasi and later obtained a degree in law from Allahabad university. A lawyer by profession, he participated in the Quit India Movement of 1942 and was an active member of the Congress Party. Political career Hegde became the president of the Uttara Kannada District Congress Committee from 1954 to 1957 and rose to become the general secretary of the Mysore Pradesh Congress Committee in 1958, a post he held until 1962. Much of his early administrative experience was built up during the governments of S. Nijalingappa (1956‚Äì58 and 1962‚Äì68) and Veerendra Patil (1968‚Äì71). He was first elected to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly in 1957 and appointed a deputy minister. He was later promoted to cabinet-minister rank, holding diverse portfolios such as Youth Welfare and Sports, Cooperation, Industries, Planning, Panchayat Raj, Development, Information and Publicity, Excise and Finance between 1962‚Äì71. During the famous split in the Congress in 1969, Hegde followed in the footsteps of his mentor Nijalingappa and joined the Congress(O), the faction that was opposed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Council for a few years until 1974. The 1975 Emergency crackdown on opposition leaders saw his arrest along with several other state and national level leaders. When the emergency was lifted, he joined the Janata Party and became the first general secretary of its Karnataka state unit. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha during 1978‚Äì83. Chief Minister of Karnataka When the Janata Party came to power by emerging as the single largest party in the 1983 State elections, he emerged as a consensus Brahmin candidate between the powerful Lingayat and Vokkaliga lobbies. In the process, he became the first non-Congress chief minister of Karnataka. A master strategist, he cobbled up a two-thirds majority for his government by an arrangement of outside support from other parties. His government secured the outside support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Left parties and 16 Independents. Following the poor performance of the Janata Party in the 1984 elections to the 8th Lok Sabha (it won only 4 out of the 28 seats from Karnataka), Hegde resigned on the grounds that his party had lost its popular mandate and sought a fresh mandate for his government. In the 1985 elections, the Janata Party came to power on its own with a comfortable majority. As Chief Minister between 1983 and 1985 and again between 1985 and 1988, he became an active votary of State rights within a federal set-up, but one who made no concession to regional or linguistic chauvinism. Secondly, he took innovative initiatives in expanding the federal principle within the State, primarily in the area of devolving power to local bodies and in trying to enforce accountability. During his Chief Minister- ship, Karnataka pioneered legislation on Panchayat Raj that devolved a substantial degree of financial and administrative powers to a three-tiered structure of local government. He supported the tireless work of his Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Abdul Nazir Sab, in promoting devolution of power to the gram panchayats in the state, and the Karnataka implementation became a role model for the rest of India. In 1984 he introduced legislation to deal with official and administrative corruption through the institution of the Lokayukta. Also, he started the 'Kannada watchdog panel' to oversee the implementation of Kannada in administration. He has the rare distinction of presenting thirteen finance budgets in the state assembly. As Chief Minister, Hegde enjoyed immense personal popularity and was acknowledged as an efficient administrator. However, as days passed by, his rule was mired with several scams involving alleged corruption on the part of his own family. His son was accused of taking money for a medical seat. There were allegations made by the Congress (I) against him in a case involving the transfer of shares by the NGEF company. He submitted resignation from Chief Minister-ship on 13 February 1986 when the Karnataka High Court censured his government for the way it handled arrack bottling contracts, but withdrew his resignation after three days on 16 February. He resigned and quit office in 1988 after allegations of phone tapping of prominent politicians and businessmen in the State.http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrint_TOINEW&Type;=text/html&Locale;=english- skin-custom&Path;=TOIBG/2010/04/26&ID;=Ar01501 Hegde then filed a case against Subramanian Swamy in 1989 and 1990 after Swamy accused him in tapping.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1559770/http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=39307http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Watch- out-Your-phone-may-be-tapped/articleshow/1190723.cms?referral=PM Soon after, he quit the Janata Party and joined the Janata Dal. He contested Lok Sabha elections from Bagalkot in 1991 and was defeated by Congress candidate Siddu Nyamagouda.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/former-union-minister-and- congress-mla-siddu-b-nyamagouda-dies-road-accident-82012 Former Union Minister and Congress MLA Siddu B Nyamagouda dies in road accident He was also the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission of India during the tenure of V. P. Singh. He was expelled from Janata Dal by its president Lalu Prasad Yadav, as per the instructions of Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda in 1996. Following his expulsion, Hegde formed the Rashtreeya Nava nirmana vedike a social organisation and then his own political party Lok Shakti. He allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the alliance won a majority of the Lok Sabha seats from Karnataka in the 1998 General Elections. He became the Commerce minister in the BJP led NDA government in 1998. After the Janata Dal split of 1999, the faction led by his prot√©g√©, Chief Minister J. H. Patel, and the Lok Shakti merged to form the Janata Dal (United) and allied with the BJP. However, the alliance suffered a setback in the 1999 General Elections owing to the anti- incumbency against the Patel Government and the Congress party emerged victorious in Karnataka. Personal life Hegde was married at a very young age to Shakuntala Amma, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian way. The marriage, which lasted throughout their lives, was blessed with three children, a son named Bharath and two daughters named Mamata and Samata. Shakuntala is a conventional lady, a devoted wife and mother, who adhered to the traditional view that a woman's dignity exists in staying away from the public gaze and the rough and tumble of public life. She continues to reside in Bangalore after Hegde's death, and had to suffer the pain of witnessing the early death of her only son, Bharath, who died of liver cancer in February 2013. Shakuntala Amma Hegde is now of very advanced age and is being cared for by her two daughters. Hegde was also the romantic partner of a renowned Indian classical dancer Pratibha Prahlad who was junior to him by 36 years, from the 1980s till his death in 2004. He is also the biological father of her twin sons, Chirantan and Chirayu, who were born in 1998. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bangalore-times/Destinys- child/articleshow/444762.cms Later life Despite the weakening of his political stock, Hegde continued to play the role of elder statesman in the fractious Janata Parivar. He gradually moved away from active politics owing to poor health. He died in Bangalore on 12 January 2004 after prolonged illness at the age of 77. His death caused an outpouring of grief in Karnataka. A versatile personality, Hegde also acted in many dramas and films such as Marana Mrudanga, Prajashakti. He was the political mentor of a large number of politicians such as Jeevaraj Alva, Abdul Samad Siddiqui, M. P. Prakash, P. G. R. Sindhia, R. V. Deshpande, and groomed many younger politicians. In the latter part of his life he became depressed and trusted only few friends like Alva, Siddiqui and advocate Manas Ranjan, along with his partner, Prathibha Prahlad, who he confided in and spent his free time with. His wife, Shakuntala, unsuccessfully contested for Rajya Sabha as a BJP candidate in 2004.

It is based on the Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle, using the same (in some cases antique) receivers. The Finnish Army has produced such rifles since the nation was founded. The Mosin‚ÄìNagant bolt-action rifles were modified in 1984 by Valmet who also manufactured new barrels for these rifles. The rifles were assembled in 1984‚Äì1985 by Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) Asevarikko 1 (\\"Arsenal 1\\") in Kuopio, Finland. Though the 7.62 TKIV 85 sniper rifle has been modified extensively compared to the standard Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle, the use of the old receivers in these rifles makes them arguably the oldest small arms in current use by any military. Some of the parts used may date back as far as the 1890s. Another exclusive feature of the 7.62 TKIV 85 is its 7.62√ó53mmR chambering. No other currently used military firearm is chambered for this unique Finnish cartridge. The PKM machine guns and other Russian firearms in Finnish service are chambered for the 7.62√ó54mmR cartridge. The standard operating procedure calls for the use of 7.62√ó54mmR cartridges in 7.62 TKIV 85 rifles only in emergency situations when 7.62√ó53mmR ammunition is not available. The reason for this is the bullet diameter difference of 7.85 mm (0.309 in) in the 7.62√ó53mmR versus 7.92 mm (0.312 in) in the 7.62√ó54mmR. Some 7.62√ó53mmR rounds were also loaded with an intermediate 7.88 mm (0.310 in) diameter bullet.

He is most known for his extensive correspondence with leading scientists and mathematicians such as Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Gottfried Leibniz, Isaac Newton, and John Wallis. His correspondence provides details of many of the discoveries and developments made in his time, and shows his activity as an 'intelligencer'. Life He was the son of a nonconformist minister, and was born at Wood Eaton in Oxfordshire, 5 March 1625. Apprenticed at the age of sixteen to Thomas Allam, a bookseller, living outside the Turl Gate of Oxford, he was driven to quit the trade by the troubles of the time, and accepted a clerkship in the employment of John Marr, clerk of the kitchen to the Prince of Wales. From him he derived some instruction in mathematics, but the outbreak of the First English Civil War drove him to sea for seven years, 1642-9, most of which time he spent on board an English merchantman, engaged by the Venetians as a ship of war in their defence of Candia against the Turks. He devoted his leisure to the study of mathematics and merchants' accounts, and on leaving the service set up in London as a teacher. In 1652 he published An Introduction to Merchants' Accounts, originally drawn up for the use of his scholars. Reprinted in 1665, the major part of the impression perished in the great fire of London, but was replaced in 1674 by a new and amplified folio edition. He next wrote The Sector on a Quadrant, or a Treatise containing the Description and Use of three several Quadrants. Also an appendix touching Reflected Dyalling, from a Glass however posited (London, 1658); and The Description and Uses of a general Quadrant, with the Horizontal Projection upon it Inverted (1658). In 1659 appeared his Geometricall Dyalling, or Dyalling performed by a Line of Chords only, and The Mariner's Plain Scale new Plained, a treatise on navigation for the East India Company's navy. It was well received, and became a class-book with the students of navigation at Christ Church Hospital. After the Restoration, Collins was appointed successively accountant to the excise office, accountant in chancery, and secretary to the council of plantations, exchanging the last post in 1672 for that of manager of the farthing office. With this employment went a house in Fenchurch Street, where he had thoughts of setting up a stationer's shop, and hoped 'to fall into the printing of books,' including some he himself designed to write, 'particularly one of the modern advancement of mathematical sciences, and an account of the best authors of that kind'. He did not, however, succeed in carrying the plan into effect. With the failure of his arguments against the issue of tin farthings his office ceased, and he was glad subsequently to accept a small post as accountant to the Royal Fishery Company. He had refused in March 1669 a situation offered to him in Ireland by the surveyor-general, Sir James Shaen, and about the same time married one of two daughters of William Austen, head cook to Charles II. As his family increased his means of subsistence became more and more precarious. He undertook accountancy work, spending less time on learned correspondence. Several of his writings testify to his acquaintance with the course of trade and interest in public matters. He published in 1680 A Plea for the bringing in of Irish Cattel, and keeping out Fish caught by Foreigners, together with an humble Address to the Honourable members of parliament of the counties of Cornwall and Devon, about the Advancement of Tin, Fishery, and divers Manufactures; and in 1682 a little treatise entitled Salt and Fishery, in which he dwelt upon the several modes of preparing salt in England and abroad, the catching of fish, the salting and cooking of fish and meat, besides offering proposals for the relief of the salt-workers. Collins died, 10 November 1683, at his lodging on Garlick Hill, London, of asthma and consumption, and was buried in the parish church of St. James. Works An enlarged edition of his Doctrine of Decimal Arithmetick, the preparation of which had engaged his attention during about a year before his death, appeared in 1685. It had originally been printed in 1664 on a quarter of a sheet for portability in a letter-case. His Arithmetic in whole Numbers and Fractions, both Vulgar and Decimal, with Tables for the Forbearance and Rebate of Money, &c.;, was published by Thomas Plant in 1688. Collins was elected a fellow of the Royal Society 24 October 1667, and on 11 November of that year communicated an exposition of a theorem by the Jesuit Jacques de Billy.A Method for finding the Number of the Julian Period for any Year assigned, the Number of the Cycle of the Sun, the Cycle of the Moon, and of the Indictions for the same Year being given, together with the Demonstration of that Method (Phil. Trans. ii. 568). He contributed further An Account concerning the Resolution of Equations in Numbers, a survey of recent algebra improvements made in England, and A Solution of a Chorographical Problem; while a letter written to John Wallis, 3 October 1682, was imparted to the society 20 May 1684. This was designed as preliminary to a formal treatise on algebra, never written. He helped forward many important publications. To him was due the printing of Isaac Barrow's Optical and Geometrical Lectures, as well as of his editions of Apollonius and Archimedes; of John Kersey's Algebra, Thomas Branker's translation of Rhonius's Algebra, and Wallis's History of Algebra. He took an active part in seeing Jeremiah Horrocks's Astronomical Remains through the press. Legacy thumb About twenty-five years after Collins's death his books and papers came into the possession of William Jones, F.R.S. They included a voluminous correspondence with Newton, Leibniz, Gregory, Barrow, John Flamsteed, Wallis, Slusius, and others. From it was selected and published in 1712, by order of the Royal Society, the Commercium Epistolicum, of material relevant to Newton's priority over Leibniz in the discovery of the infinitesimal calculus; specimens of results from the use of the fluxional method were transmitted 20 July 1669 through Barrow to Collins, and by him made widely known.

Saudi rule was restored to central and eastern Arabia after the Emirate of Diriyah, the First Saudi State, having previously been brought down by the Ottoman Empire's Egypt Eyalet in the Ottoman‚ÄìWahhabi War (1811‚Äì1818). The second Saudi period was marked by less territorial expansion and less religious zeal, although the Saudi leaders continued to be called Imam and still employed Wahhabist religious scholars. Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad's reconquest of Riyadh from Egyptian forces in 1824 is generally regarded as the beginning of the Second Saudi State. Severe internal conflicts within the House of Saud eventually led to the dynasty's downfall at the Battle of Mulayda in 1891, between the forces loyal to the last Saudi imam, Abdul Rahman ibn Faisal ibn Turki, and the Rashidi dynasty of Ha'il. History The first Saudi to attempt to regain power after the fall of the Emirate of Diriyah in 1818 was Mishari bin Saud, a brother of the last ruler in Diriyah, Abdullah ibn Saud but he was soon captured by the Egyptians and killed. In 1824, Turki ibn Abdullah ibn Muhammad, a grandson of the first Saudi imam Muhammad ibn Saud who had managed to evade capture by the Egyptians, was able to expel Egyptian forces and their local allies from Riyadh and its environs and is generally regarded as the founder of the second Saudi dynasty as well as being the ancestor of the kings of modern-day Saudi Arabia. He made his capital in Riyadh and was able to enlist the services of many relatives who had escaped captivity in Egypt, including his son Faisal ibn Turki Al Saud. Turki was assassinated in 1834 by Mishari ibn Abdul-Rahman, a distant cousin. Mishari was soon besieged in Riyadh and later executed by Faisal, who went on to become the most prominent ruler of the Saudis' second reign. Faisal, however, faced a re-invasion of Najd by the Egyptians four years later. The local population was unwilling to resist, and Faisal was defeated and taken to Egypt as a prisoner for the second time in 1838. The Egyptians installed Khalid ibn Saud, last surviving brother of Abdullah ibn Saud ibn Abdul-Aziz a great grandson of Muhammad bin Saud, had spent many years in the Egyptian court, as ruler in Riyadh and supported him with Egyptian troops. In 1840, however, external conflicts forced the Egyptians to withdraw all their presence in the Arabian Peninsula, leaving Khalid with little support. Seen by most locals as nothing more than an Egyptian governor, Khalid was toppled soon afterwards by Abdullah ibn Thunayan, of the collateral Al Thunayan branch. Faisal, however, had been released that year and, aided by the Al Rashid rulers of Ha'il, was able to retake Riyadh and resume his rule, later appointing his son Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki as heir apparent, and divided his dominions between his three sons Abdullah, Saud ibn Faisal ibn Turki, and Muhammad. Upon Faisal's death in 1865, Abdullah assumed rule in Riyadh but was soon challenged by his brother, Saud. The two brothers fought a long civil war, in which they traded rule in Riyadh several times. A vassal of the Saudis, Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Rashid of Ha'il took the opportunity to intervene in the conflict and increase his own power. Gradually, Ibn Rashid extended his authority over most of Najd, including the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Ibn Rashid finally expelled the last Saudi leader, Abdul-Rahman ibn Faisal, from Najd after the Battle of Mulayda in 1891.

Pembroke's middle school is located on what is now called the King's campus. = Events= In October 2003, arsonists targeted the school's drama building. The structure was damaged and students' art and drama projects destroyed.Riches, S, and Chapman, J. \\"A heartless act\\", The Advertiser, 23 October 2003. In 2006, Pembroke became the first school in South Australia to be granted an exemption from anti- discrimination laws in order to accept a greater number of girls than boys. The exemption was required because a gender imbalance which had arisen in lower year levels had to be redressed. The exemption was extended for a further three years in August 2009.\\"Top school in SOS for girls\\", The Sunday Mail. Pembroke continues to embark upon ambitious building projects, funded in part by donations and fundraising. In November 2007, plans to build a multimillion-dollar visual arts and centre and auditorium were announced.Coultate, A. \\"Pembroke's multi-million dollar centre\\", The East Torrens Messenger, 7 November 2007. The building was completed in March 2009 and officially opened in May. With the advent of the Building Education Revolution, the heritage-listed Angove House on the Girton campus was refurbished and restored. Work on the junior school established new classrooms and the new Early Learning Centre.  School structure  Bills House, King's Campus Pembroke is divided into three \\"sub-schools\\": #Junior School (Early Learning Centre - Year 6) #Middle School (Years 7-10) #Senior School (Years 11-12) In the junior school, students are allocated into one of four \\"houses\\", Torrens (Blue), Yorke (Yellow), Spencer (Green) and Flinders (Red), which are used for sporting events. Upon entry into either the middle or senior schools, students are allocated one of the school's eight houses: Hill (Red), Wright (Dark Green), Smith (Light Blue), Yates (Yellow), Mellor (Navy), Medlin (Purple), Reeves (Orange) and the school's newest house, Oats (Lime Green). In the middle school, houses define tutorial groups and have a significant effect on students' subject teachers. The houses play an important role in the organisation of pastoral care, intra-school sport and other activities. Upon entry into the senior school students remain in the house allocated to them in middle school but do not remain in the same house allocated tutorial groups. Students are placed in a tutorial with one of their subject teachers. Students stay in this group for their two years in senior school, even if their tutor is no longer their subject teacher.  Curriculum  Angove House, Girton Campus The Pembroke School curriculum follows a framework covering the eight nationally recognised key learning areas: English, mathematics, science, humanities, languages, arts, health and physical education and technology. Within each of Pembroke's sub-schools there exists a branch of the \\"Hearing Unit\\" which offers specialist assistance and support for hearing-impaired students. From the ELC to Year 6, students follow the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (IBPYP) and commence studies of a second language with Spanish. Foreign language studies continue with a broader range of options in the middle school up to Year 10. In the Middle School, all students study English, Maths, Science and Physical Education as part of the core curriculum. Students in years 7-9 also study History, Geography and Health, whilst students in year 10 undertake the SACE Personal Learning Plan and Australian History. In year 7, students choose to study two Languages from Spanish, Chinese, French or German for a semester each, and continue to study one or both the languages in year 8. Year 7 students also study Visual Art, Music, Drama, Digital Technology and Design Technology, and can choose to continue these subjects in years 8-10. Geography, World History, Commerce and Film become additional elective subjects in Year 10. Pembroke School also offers English as an Additional Language as a subject, or an intensive English course under the Pembroke Connect Program. In the senior school, a full range of South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses are offered, as are a select and broadening number of Vocational Education and Training (VET) modules. The VET component allows students to gain double credit for work completed at school and may be applied towards Technical and Further Education(TAFE) certificates.  Co-curriculum  = Outdoor education = Pembroke has an outdoor education program designed to promote respect for the outdoors and provide students with skills and knowledge of the environment. In the junior school, students visit places such as Sovereign Hill in Ballarat, and Aldinga. The base of the program in the middle school is \\"Old Watulunga\\", a property on the Finniss River, south of Adelaide. Students participate in camps based at \\"Old Watulunga\\" and participate in activities such as canoeing, sailing, bushwalking, rock climbing and orienteering. In year 7, students spend two nights at Old Watulunga learning the foundations to Outdoor Education. They then build on these foundations in the year 8 program, where they spend three nights at the campsite and experience a one night \\"bushwalk\\" in preparation for the year 9 program in which students go to Innes National Park in the York Peninsula for a four night camp involving a two night expedition. The year 10 camp has students embarking on a five night water expedition from Old Watulanga down the Coorong with one day of training followed by two and a half days of sailing and then two and a half days of kayaking. Through all these experiences, students are exposed to a number of skills such as cooking on trangias, camping in tents and bush safety. Outdoor Education in the Senior School is offered as a SACE subject at either a semester or a full year at Stage 1 and a full year subject at Stage 2. = Sport = The sporting program at Pembroke is designed to encourage participation at all skill levels. Students may participate as members of teams in inter-house and inter-school competitions. Inter-school sporting competitions are facilitated through Pembroke's membership of the Independent Schools Sports Association (ISSA), the Independent Girls' Schools Sports Association (IGSSA) and the Junior School Heads Association of Australia. Pembroke has competed in inter-school matches against Westminster School since 2005. Sports on offer include athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, cross country running, Australian rules football, hockey, Australian HPV Super Series, netball, orienteering, rowing, Rugby Union, soccer, softball, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, touch football, triathlon, volleyball and water polo. = Other activities = Since 1986, when then teacher Campbell Whalley began the program, Pembroke students have participated in teddy bear making classes. Students construct bears by hand and donate the products to disadvantaged individuals. Over 3000 bears have been made over 20 years. By 2002 the program had spread as far as the Aboriginal community in Marree.Jory, R. \\"Bear threads a full life\\", The Advertiser, 17 June 2006.  Cookery book  Green and Gold Cookery Book, 1933 edition The Green and Gold Cookery Book is a heritage icon for both Pembroke School and Australia. The book was first compiled in 1923 as a form of fundraising for King's College. The school community contributed recipes and purchased advertising space in the book in order to cover the cost of publishing its first edition. The book is now in its 36th edition and more than 400,000 copies have been sold in Australia, Canada, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The book is regarded as a classic Australian recipe book.

It is part of the local government area of Torridge District Council. The population of the parish at the 2011 census was 1,305, compared to 1,079 in 1901. The population of the electoral ward in 2011 was 2,068. History During World War II, the RAF Winkleigh Airfield was used by the RNoAF from 1944 as the main training Centre in the UK after Norway shifted from Little Norway in Toronto Canada to re-locate the training facilities to a place nearer to the War theatre. The former RAF base is now the site of the West of England Transport Collection, which stores over 200 cars, lorries and buses of historical interest. It is not normally open to the public. Memorial tablet to Henry Bremridge, vicar of Church of All Saints, Winkleigh for 26 years, succeeding his father In 1975 the deaths of three members of the Luxton family at nearby West Chapple Farm, brought media interest to the area. A book Earth to Earth by John Cornwell was published about this murder and suicide case in 1982. The village was the location of Inch's Cider, producers of White Lightning cider. Inch's Cider was bought by H. P. Bulmer, who then closed the plant down. However some of those involved in the original enterprise now run Winkleigh Cider on the Hatherleigh Road. Local businesses and organisations include a health centre (a branch of the Wallingbrook Surgery in Chulmleigh), a convenience store, a post office, a butchers shop, a florists, a cafe, a veterinary practice, two public houses, and Winkleigh sports centre. Winkleigh also has a primary school.

Early career Viertel was born in Vienna, the capital of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, but later went to work in Berlin. Viertel developed a reputation as a poet and theatre director, before moving into film work from 1922. As a screenwriter and director, he collaborated with some of the leading figures of the silent era of German cinema and worked on several influential films.Richards p.201 Uneasy Money (1926) is a work of New Objectivity film movement. He was married to screenwriter and actress Salka Viertel from 30 April 1918 to 20 December 1947. Arrival in America Following the collapse of Viertel's theatre troupe, he faced severe financial difficulties and accepted an offer from the Fox Film Corporation. He came to Los Angeles in 1928 planning to stay for just three years. Viertel wanted to gain experience working for the booming Hollywood film industry and hoped to earn enough to return to Europe. For four years, he worked for Fox then Paramount Pictures, and Warner Brothers. Viertel grew to intensely dislike the atmosphere in Hollywood, which he found paranoid and which he believed placed too many artistic restraints on him. Viertel wanted to produce socially relevant films and did not believe Hollywood had the capacity to do so. This came to a head when he was working on the Paramount film The Cheat (1928) and after clashing with studio bosses he was replaced by George Abbott.Richards p.202 Europe With the uncertain political situation in Germany in 1932, the Viertels decided to stay in the United States with their children rather than return to an uncertain future in Europe. The Viertels' house in Santa Monica Canyon was the site of salons and meetings of the Hollywood \\"intelligentsia\\" and European intellectuals. It was also an important gathering place for the √©migr√© community. Personal life Previously, Berthold Viertel had been married to Grete Viertel, but they divorced in 1918. After his divorce from Salka in 1947, he married for a third time, this time to Elisabeth Neumann to whom he remained married until his death in 1953. His marriage to Salka Viertel produced three sons: Hans, Peter and Thomas. Peter Viertel (1920‚Äì2007) was a book and screenplay writer. Further reading Christopher Isherwood's novel Prater Violet (1945) is a fictional portrayal of the period Isherwood and Viertel worked together, as screenplay writer and director, respectively, for the British Gaumont feature film Little Friend (1934).

It appears to have seen little in terms of sales, and was withdrawn from the market after only a short time. First released in 1993 as Let's Keep It Simple Spreadsheet, officially abbreviated Let's KISS, the product was renamed Spreadsheet 2000 for its 2.0 release in 1997. Spreadsheet 2000, S2K for short, featured a unique way of building complex spreadsheets from a number of simpler ones containing only input or output data. This contrasts with the traditional spreadsheet model, where inputs, calculations and outputs are all placed into a single sheet and cannot be easily differentiated. For instance, if one wants to add two columns of three numbers, under a normal spreadsheet one would type the two sets of values into columns, say and , and then into type the formula \`=A1+B1\`, which would appear on-screen as the results. The formula is then copied into the other cells in C. A user looking at the sheet would simply see three columns of numbers, and has no way to differentiate which values are the inputs and which the outputs. S2K worksheet; three input sheetlettes (blue) are being used to create several outputs (grey). The operation merges the 2√ó2 and 1√ó2 sheets into a single 3√ó2, while the \`A + B\` results in a single 2√ó2 grid by adding the 1√ó2 grid to both columns of the 2√ó2. Under S2K the same task is separated out to make it easier to understand. The user first creates two separate \\"sheetlettes\\" containing one column each, types the input numbers into them, and then connects the two together with the addition function, represented by an icon. The addition icon also has an output connector, and when this is connected to a third sheetlette, the results of the addition appear there automatically. The user could also connect the output to a sheetlette containing a single cell, in which case the addition function would sum all of the cells and display the single result. Since every step of a calculation was represented by input and output sheetlettes as well as the operator icons, S2K worksheets could become cluttered. In order to address this, whole groups of sheets and icons could be selected and collapsed into a compound operator. From that point on, the operator worked just like one of S2K's built-in functions, allowing the user to connect inputs and outputs to it as normal. The whole idea of S2K was to simplify the construction of simple spreadsheets. While it met that goal, the same features made more complex spreadsheets difficult to work with. For instance, trying to debug a complex formula in Excel simply requires the user to click on the cell and read the formula. The same task in S2K may be difficult, with the formula filling several pages or alternately being built several layers deep (compounds of compounds) so that there is no single view of the formula. Additionally S2K's own set of built-in functions was rather limited. S2K was written entirely in Prograph.

Since 1993 the wine has been classified as a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) and as of 2004 was Italy's largest producing appellation. On an average vintage more than ten times as much Asti is produced in Piedmont than the more well-known Piedmontese red wine Barolo. Made from the Moscato Bianco grape, it is sweet and low in alcohol, and often served with dessert. Unlike Champagne, Asti is not made sparkling through the use of secondary fermentation in the bottle but rather through a single tank fermentation utilizing the Charmat method. It retains its sweetness through a complex filtration process. Another wine called Moscato d'Asti is made in the same region from the same grape, but is only slightly sparkling (frizzante) and tends to have even lower alcohol. On 22 June 2014, Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe- Roero and Monferrato UNESCO This landscape covers five distinct wine-growing areas and the Castle of Cavour, an important site both in the development of vineyards and in Italian history. History Moscato bianco grapes (pre- veraison) The Moscato Bianco grape (also known as Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains) has long been found in the Piedmont and, along with Nebbiolo, may be one of the oldest grapes in the region. However, the production of sparkling Asti from Moscato Bianco is a relatively recent product. The first sparkling Asti is believed to have been produced around 1870 by Carlo Gancia who studied the Champagne method used to produce the notable wine in the Champagne wine region of France. Producing his wine in the town of Canelli along the river Belbo, the wine grew in such popularity that Moscato Bianco developed the synonym of Muscat Canelli that is still seen on wine labels today. After World War II, Asti saw an uptick in popularity in the United States as returning soldiers from the war brought their taste for the light, sweet wine home with them. The increasing demand saw many producers turn to bulk wine production using the Charmat method, which makes the wine sparkling through a closed fermentation in a tank rather than a secondary fermentation the individual bottle as in Champagne and Cava. The large amounts of exported Asti (then known as Asti Spumante) that hit the export market (to both the United States as well as the United Kingdom) garnered a poor reputation for being what wine expert Karen MacNeil describes as \\"a noxiously sweet poor man's Champagne.\\" Remnants of this reputation remained attached to the name Asti Spumante for much of the 20th century. When the wine was promoted to DOCG status in 1993, producers sought to distinguish themselves from that reputation and dropped the use of Spumante altogether in favor of the shortened Asti name. Along with the name change came a change in style, with several producers creating more modern styles of Asti that are less sweet and have more ripe fruit flavors. Production zone The provinces of Piedmont with the Asti producing provinces of Cuneo, Asti and Alessandria located in the southeast. Asti is produced in the southeastern region of Piedmont where the large concentration of rolling hills provides ample space for vineyard plantings. The DOCG production zone is located mostly in the Province of Asti and partly within the provinces of Cuneo and Alessandria. =Original definition= The area was first defined in 1932 as comprising the following 45 communes: In Asti: Asti, Bubbio, Calamandrana, Calosso, Canelli, Cassinasco, Castagnole delle Lanze, Castel Boglione, Castel Rocchero, Castelnuovo Belbo, Cessole, Coazzolo, Costigliole d'Asti, Fontanile, Incisa Scapaccino, Loazzolo, Maranzana, Moasca, Mombaruzzo, Monastero Bormida, Montabone, Nizza Monferrato, Quaranti, San Marzano Oliveto, Sessame and Vesime. In Cuneo: Camo, Castiglione Tinella, Cossano Belbo, Mango, Neive, Neviglie, Rocchetta Belbo, Santo Stefano Belbo, Treiso and Trezzo Tinella. In Alessandria: Acqui Terme, Alice Bel Colle, Bistagno, Cassine, Castelletto Molina, Grognardo, Ricaldone, Strevi, Terzo, and Visone. The province of Cuneo is more mountainous than the other provinces and has fewer vineyards that are concentrated closer to the Po Valley. The Monferrato Hills that extend from the Po southward towards the Apennines covers much of the vineyard area in the Asti and Alessandria area with the name Monferrato sometimes appearing on bottles of Asti. =Expansion= In 1967 the zone was extended to include the communes of Rocchetta Palafea in Asti, Alba, Santa Vittoria d'Alba and Serralunga d'Alba in Cuneo. Since 1976 production of the wine has additionally been permitted in the communes of Castino and Perletto in Cuneo as well as San Giorgio Scarampi in Asti. DOCG regulations and production Vineyards in the Asti producing commune of Costigliole d'Asti. Under Italian wine laws, all Asti DOCG wine must be 100% made from the Moscato Bianco grape with the grapes harvested to a yield no greater than 10 tonnes/hectare. The finished wine must be fermented to a minimum alcohol level that varies depending on the vintage and is usually between 7-9.5%. Asti get their fizziness from a single fermentation that takes place in stainless steel tanks (as opposed to a secondary fermentation taking place in a wine bottle like Champagne). After the grapes are harvested, they are crushed and pressed, with the must transferred to large tanks where the temperature is lowered to just above freezing in order to prevent fermentation from beginning. The tanks are sealed and pressurized, and then the temperature is raised to allow fermentation to begin. Within the tanks the carbon dioxide by-product of fermentation is trapped with the gas dissolving into the wine and creating the ultimate source of the bubbles that are seen in a wine glass. Fermentation is allowed to continue until the wine has reached between 7-9% alcohol and between 3-5% residual sugar. The wine is chilled again to halt fermentation before it is sent to a centrifuge that filters and removes all yeast from the wine to prevent fermentation from resuming. The wine is then bottled and shipped. Most Asti is not vintage-dated, however the large consumption and quick turnover of the wine usually means that the wines on the market are from the most recent vintage. Wine styles Ripe Moscato bianco grapes. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that many of the flavors of Asti wine can be tasted in the ripe grapes of Moscato bianco. This is somewhat unusual in wine since many of the flavors of a finished wine come from phenolic compounds in the pulp and skin that develop in the wine through fermentation and maceration of the skins. In describing a finished Asti wine, Ewing-Mulligan notes that the wines usually have very floral aromas with peach flavors and enough acidity to balance out the sweetness in the wine. According to wine expert Karen MacNeil modern Asti wines have the characteristic \\"muskiness\\" of a Muscat based wine but are \\"not sugary sweet like candy but, rather, dizzyingly fruity and evocative of perfectly ripe peaches and apricots.\\" The wines are typically served chilled and in a champagne flute style glass. Asti is often consumed very young and as close to the vintage as possible. After two years, the wine rapidly loses the fresh, floral notes and becomes heavier and richer in body. While still drinkable, older Asti tends not to exhibit the typical light, fruity flavors that are usually associated with the wine. Despite its sweetness, Asti has enough acidity to be versatile in food and wine pairings. While it is often drunk as an aperitif, it can be paired with salads, spicy Asian cuisine and even, as wine expert Oz Clarke notes, with Christmas pudding.

Since its discovery in 1856, the genus has been subject to taxonomic turmoil, with numerous new species being described from single remains based on minute differences amongst each other, and the fragmentary nature of the holotype specimen makes differentiating remains difficult. There is currently only one uncontested species, the type species D. fontani, though there may be more. The genus is placed into the tribe Dryopithecini, which is either an offshoot of orangutans, African apes, or is its own separate branch. A male specimen was estimated to have weighed in life. Dryopithecus likely predominantly ate ripe fruit from trees, suggesting a degree of suspensory behaviour to reach them, though the anatomy of a humerus and femur suggest a greater reliance on walking on all fours (quadrupedalism). The face was similar to gorillas, and males had longer canines than females, which is typically correlated with high levels of aggression. They lived in a seasonal, paratropical climate, and may have built up fat reserves for winter. European great apes likely went extinct during a drying and cooling trend in the Late Miocene which caused the retreat of warm-climate forests. Etymology The genus name Dryopithecus comes from Ancient Greek drus \\"oak tree\\" and pithekos \\"ape\\" because the authority believed it inhabited an oak or pine forest in an environment similar to modern day Europe. The species D. fontani was named in honour of its discoverer, local collector M. Fontan. Taxonomy Restoration of D. fontani with an orangutan-like build The first Dryopithecus fossils were described from the French Pyrenees by French paleontologist √âdouard Lartet in 1856, three years before Charles Darwin published his On the Origin of Species. Subsequent authors noted similarities to modern African great apes. In his The Descent of Man, Darwin briefly noted that Dryopithecus casts doubt on the African origin of apes: Dryopithecus taxonomy has been the subject of much turmoil, with new specimens being the basis of a new species or genus based on minute differences, resulting in several now-defunct species. By the 1960s, all non-human apes were classified into the now-obsolete family Pongidae, and extinct apes into Dryopithecidae. In 1965, English palaeoanthropologist David Pilbeam and American palaeontologist Elwyn L. Simons separated the genus‚Äìwhich included specimens from across the Old World at the time‚Äìinto three subgenera: Dryopithecus in Europe, Sivapithecus in Asia, and Proconsul in Africa. Afterwards, there was discussion over whether each of these subgenera should be elevated to genus. In 1979, Sivapithecus was elevated to genus, and Dryopithecus was subdivided again into the subgenera Dryopithecus in Europe, and Proconsul, Limnopithecus, and Rangwapithecus in Africa. Since that time, several more species were assigned and moved, and by the 21st century, the genus included D. fontani, D. brancoi, D. laietanus, and D. crusafonti. However, the 2009 discovery of a partial skull of D. fontani caused many of them to be split off into different genera, such as the newly erected Hispanopithecus, because part of the confusion was caused by the fragmentary nature of the Dryopithecus holotype with vague and incomplete diagnostic characteristics. molars of \\"D. carinthiacus\\" Currently, there is only one uncontested species, D. fontani. Specimens are: * Holotype, a male mandible with teeth from Saint-Gaudens in the French Pyrenees. Based on dental development in chimps, it was 6 to 8 years old, and several diagnostic characteristics made from the holotype would be lost in mature D. fontani; A partial left humerus arm bone and five isolated teeth are also known from the site. *An upper incisor, NMB G.a.9., and female upper molar, FSL 213981, come from Saint-Alban-de-Roche, France. *A male partial face, IPS35026, and femur, IPS41724, from Vall√®s Pened√®s in Catalonia, Spain. *A female mandible with teeth, LMK-Pal 5508, from St. Stefan, Carinthia, Austria 12.5 mya, which could possibly be considered a separate species, \\"D. carinthiacus\\". Dryopithecus is classified into the namesake great ape tribe Dryopithecini, along with Hispanopithecus, Rudapithecus, Ouranopithecus, Anoiapithecus, and Pierolapithecus, though the latter two may belong to Dryopithecus, the former two may be synonymous, and the former three can also be placed into their own tribes. Dryopithecini is either regarded as an offshoot of orangutans (Ponginae), an ancestor to African apes and humans (Homininae), or its own separate branch (Dryopithecinae). Dryopithecus was a part of an adaptive radiation of great apes in the expanding forests of Europe in the warm climates of the Miocene Climatic Optimum, possibly descending from early or middle Miocene African apes which diversified in the proceeding Middle Miocene disruption (a cooling event). It is possible great apes first evolved in Europe or Asia, and then migrated down into Africa. Description Dryopithecus facial anatomy is similar to that of gorillas Based on measurements of the femoral head of the Spanish IPS41724, the living weight for a male Dryopithecus was estimated to be . Dryopithecus teeth are most similar to those of modern chimps. The teeth are small and have a thin enamel layer. Dryopithecus has a slender jaw, indicating it was not well-suited for eating abrasive or hard food. Like modern apes, the males have pronounced canine teeth. The molars are wide, and the premolars wider. It has a wide roof of the mouth, a long muzzle (prognathism), and a large nose which is oriented nearly vertically to the face. In total, the face shows many similarities to the gorilla; since early to middle Miocene African apes do not share such similarities, gorilla-like features likely evolved independently in Dryopithecus rather than as a result of close affinities. The humerus, measuring an approximate , is similar in size and form to the bonobo. Like in bonobos, the shaft bows outward, and the insertion for the triceps and deltoids was poorly developed, suggesting Dryopithecus was not as adept to suspensory behaviour as orangutans. The femoral neck, which connects the femoral head to the femoral shaft, is not very long nor steep; the femoral head is positioned low to the greater trochanter; and the lesser trochanter is positioned more towards the backside. All these characteristics are important in the mobility of the hip joint, and indicate a quadrupedal mode of locomotion rather than suspensory. However, fruit trees in the time and area of the Austrian Dryopithecus were typically high and bore fruit on thinner terminal branches, suggesting suspensory behaviour to reach them. Paleobiology Strawberry trees (above) may have been a plentiful and thus important food source in St. Stefan. Dryopithecus likely predominantly ate fruit (frugivory), and evidence of cavities on the teeth of the Austrian Dryopithecus indicates a high-sugar diet, likely deriving from ripe fruits and honey. Dental wearing indicates Dryopithecus ate both soft and hard food, which could either indicate they consumed a wide array of different foods, or they ate harder foods as a fallback. Nonetheless, its unspecialized teeth indicate it had a flexible diet, and large body size would have permitted a large gut to aid in the processing of less-digestible food, perhaps stretching to include foods such as leaves (folivory) in times of famine like in modern apes. Unlike modern apes, Dryopithecus likely had a high carbohydrate, low fibre diet. A high-fructose diet is associated with elevated levels of uric acid, which is neutralized by uricase in most animals except great apes. It is thought they stopped producing it by 15 mya, resulting in increased blood pressure, which in turn led to increased activity, and a greater ability to build up fat reserves. The palaeoenvironment of late Miocene Austria indicates an abundance of fruiting trees and honey for nine or ten months out of the year, and Dryopithecus may have relied on these fat reserves during the late winter. High uric acid levels in the blood are also associated with increased intelligence. Dryopithecus males had larger canines than females, which is associated with high levels of aggression in modern primates. Paleoecology A map of late Miocene Europe The remains of Dryopithecus are often associated with several large mammals, such as elephants (e. g., though not limited to, Gomphotherium), rhinos (e. g., Lartetotherium), pigs (e. g., Listriodon), antelope (e. g., Miotragocerus), horses (e. g., Hippotherium), hyaenas (e. g., Protictitherium), and big cats (e. g., Pseudaelurus). Other associated primates are the great apes Hispanopithecus, Anoiapithecus, and Pierolapithecus; and the monkey Pliopithecus. These fauna are consistent with a warm, forested, paratropical wetland environment, and it may have lived in a seasonal climate. For the Austrian Dryopithecus, plants such as Prunus, grapevines, black mulberry, strawberry trees, hickory, and chestnuts may have been important fruit sources; and the latter two, oak, beech, elm, and pine honey sources. The late Miocene was the beginning of a drying trend in Europe. Increasing seasonality and dry spells in the Mediterranean region and the emergence of a Mediterranean climate likely caused the replacement of forestland and woodland by open shrubland; and the uplift of the Alps caused tropical and warm-climate vegetation in Central Europe to retreat in favor of mid-latitude and alpine flora. This likely led to the extinction of great apes in Europe.

Dodecameric complexes can have a number of subunit 'topologies', but typically only a few of the theoretically possible subunit arrangements are observed in protein structures. A dodecamer (protein) is a protein complex with 12 protein subunits. A common subunit arrangement involves a tetrahedral distribution of subunit trimers (or 3-4-point symmetry). Another observed arrangement of subunits puts two rings of six subunits side by side along the sixfold axis (or 2-6-point symmetry).

When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation or interallelic complementation.Crick FH, Orgel LE. The theory of inter-allelic complementation.

Mutations in PCC, either in the Œ± subunit (PCCŒ±) or Œ≤ subunit (PCCŒ≤) can cause propionic acidemia in humans. When different mutant skin fibroblast cell lines defective in PCCŒ≤ were fused in pairwise combinations, the Œ≤ heteromultimeric protein formed as a result often exhibited a higher level of activity than would be expected based on the activities of the parental enzymes.Rodr√≠guez- Pombo P, P√©rez-Cerd√° C, P√©rez B, Desviat LR, S√°nchez-Pulido L, Ugarte M.

Life He was born at Bath, and from some lines in his own collection of poems, entitled 'Scripscrapologia,' he would seem to have been a tailor's son. He was bred up to the business of a staymaker, but an occupation of that nature ill accorded with his disposition, and he very early in life made his appearance on the Bath stage, and filled many parts there, extending to 'tragedy, genteel comedy, low comedy, and old men and country boys in farces and operas,' a range of character which could not have been uniformly successful. In October 1764, he appeared at the theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin, as young Mirabel in the 'Inconstant,' and 'proved a very respectable acquisition to the Irish stage.' In Ireland, as at Bath, the characters assigned to him were of necessity often varied, but he seems to have always played with credit, and to have made his mark in comic opera. It is stated in the 'Memoirs of Charles Lee Lewes,' i. 79-85, that Collins played Captain Plume at Covent Garden Theatre 'many years ago,' but that a severe cold prevented him from obtaining the success which his talents deserved, and drove him from the London stage into the country. At a later period he returned to London 'with a very entertaining evening's amusement called \\"The Brush,\\" composed of pleasant old theatrical stories well told, with humorous songs well written by him-self.' His entertainment had different names at different periods. Dr. Thomas Campbell of Clogher, who paid a visit to London in 1775, went one evening ' to hear Collins lecture upon oratory at the Devil tavern,' and noted in his diary that ' the fellow displayed good enunciation and good sense. His ridicule of the Scots, Welsh, and Irish was passing well'. At Belfast, in 1776, the performance was styled 'The Elements of Modern Oratory ; ' at another date the title of 'The Brush ' was given to it ; and at a still later year the name was changed to 'The Evening Brush.' In substance, however, the entertainment never changed ; it was from first to last a medley of 'story, song, and sentiment.' During the winter of 1791-2 Collins gave his performance at the Lyceum Theatre in London on fifty-two nights, and with that striking tribute to his popularity he quit the London stage. In January 1793, he was amusing Birmingham audiences by his recitations, and in that year he was so far settled in that town as to occupy a house in Great Brook Street, Ashted. By these performances he obtained a 'well-earned easy competency,' and it must have been with some portion of his gains that he acquired an interest with a Mr. Swinney in a newspaper called The Birmingham Chronicle. Many of the poetic effusions of Collins were inspired by local events, and many of them were published in his paper, from the pages of which, as he complains, they were reproduced without acknowledgment. While he was resident in Birmingham his niece, Miss Brent, lived with him. Collins suffered in the spring of 1808 from a severe illness, but his death at Birmingham on 2 May 1808, in his sixty-sixth year, was sudden. Works The best-known of the poems of Collins, most of which are of unusual excellence for the date of their composition, are 'To-morrow,' 'The Golden Days of good Queen Bess,' 'Date obolum Belisario,' and ' Ben Block,' the last of which was printed in 'Notes and Queries' for 17 April 1886, p. 310 ; and the chief merit of his performances lay in the feeling with which he sang his lyric compositions, the 'rare perfection ' of his musical expression being universally acknowledged. The original manuscript of 'The Brush,' formerly in the possession of Thomas Bell and William Pinkerton, is now the property of Mr. Samuel Timmins of Birmingham. It was printed at Newcastle in 1800. In 1804 there was printed at Birmingham a volume of the poems of Collins, with the queer title of 'Scripscrapologia, or Collins's doggerel dish of all sorts. To it is prefixed a portrait of the author, followed by an apostrophe to Mr. Meyler, bookseller and printer in the Grove, Bath. His name is found on the title-pages of two other works: 1. 'Lecture on Heads [by G. A. Stevens] as delivered by Mr. Palmer at the Royalty Theatre. . . . The Golden Days of good Queen Bess, written by Mr. Collins/ n. d. [1787], 12 pages. 2. 'The Theatrical Banquet, or the Actor's Budget. Together with Collins's \\"Evening Brush.\\" [Compiled] by W. Oxberry,' 1809, 2 vols., the portion belonging to Collins filling pp. 3‚Äì44 of vol. ii.

It was founded in 1895 in Sheffield, England. The company now makes pasta and rice dishes like \\"Pasta 'n' Sauce\\" and \\"Super Rice\\" along with instant soup, in particular Cup A Soup and noodle products such as Super Noodles. The company is the UK market leader in dried soups. Since early 2008, the Batchelors name has also been applied to Premier Foods' condensed soup range, previously sold as Campbell's. The Campbell's brand returned to the UK in 2011, after a five- year non-compete agreement expired. History William Batchelor was born in Habrough, Lincolnshire, in 1860 to Ellen, n√©e Hudson, and James Batchelor, a farmworker who later had his own farm. William discovered a way to can vegetables such as processed peas and formed Batchelors Foods in 1895. He died in August 1913 whilst on holiday in Bridlington. He was 53. His daughter Ella (who became Ella Gasking), aged 22, took over leadership of the company and developed it to include processed peas, with Batchelors eventually becoming a household name. Ella Hudson Gasking (1891‚Äì1966) often known as Mrs. E. H. Gasking, took over the family business of Batchelor's Peas, opening a new factory at Wadsley Bridge Sheffield in 1937 costing ¬£100,000 to build. It was the largest canning plant in Britain, covering 12 acres including playing fields & speaker radios for staff. In 1943 Mrs Gasking was awarded OBE in recognition of her contribution to war effort & grocery industry. Due to staff difficulties and rationing in the war, the company was bought by James Van den Bergh of Unilever in 1943, where it became part of Van den Bergh Foods (later based in Crawley). In 1948, Ella Gasking retired and her younger brother Maurice Batchelor took over. The company took over Poulton and Noel, another soup company. In 1949, the first dried soup, chicken noodle flavour, was sold. In 1972, Cup A Soup was launched. In January 2001, Unilever took over Bestfoods. To be allowed to take over the American company, Unilever had to sell off some brands for monopoly regulation. It sold off Batchelors and Oxo to the UK subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company. Unilever retained ownership of the 'cup-a-soup' brand in America and Australia, rebranding them under Lipton and Continental respectively. In 2006, Campbell's soup withdrew from the UK market, and sold its assets, including Batchelors, to Premier Foods. The Campbell's name was licensed to Premier Foods until 2008, following which Campbell's Soup was rebranded as Batchelors. In 2008, Batchelors was rebranded with a new logo.

The Third Republic was founded on the dissolution of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction that overthrew the Second Republic and established a military government in May 1961. Park Chung-hee, the Chairman of the Supreme Council, was elected President of South Korea in the 1963 presidential election. The Third Republic was presented as a return to civilian government under the National Assembly, but in practice was a dictatorship under Park, Supreme Council members, and the Democratic Republican Party. The Third Republic prioritized South Korea's economic development, anti-communism, and strengthening ties with the United States and Japan. Park was re-elected in the 1967 presidential election and the National Assembly forced through a constitutional amendment to allow him to seek a third term, and was re-elected in the 1971 presidential election. Park declared a state of emergency in December 1971 and announced plans for Korean reunification in a joint communique with North Korea in July 1972. Park launched the October Restoration in October 1972, declaring martial law, dissolving the National Assembly, and announced plans for a new constitution. The Third Republic was dissolved on approval of the Yusin Constitution in the November 1972 constitutional referendum and replaced with the Fourth Republic of Korea. History =Background= In May 1961, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction overthrew the Second Republic of Korea in the May 16 coup, led by Major General Park Chung-hee, in response to its inability to prevent political instability after the overthrow of the First Republic of Korea under President Syngman Rhee in the April Revolution. The Supreme Council established a military junta headed by General Chang Do-yong and the May 16 coup's supporters in the Republic of Korea Army, hoping to kickstart South Korea's economic development that had been ignored for twelve years under the First Republic, and remove so-called \\"liberation aristocrats\\" ‚Äì the ruling class of conservative politicians involved in the Korean independence movement. Power struggles within the Supreme Council allowed Park to engineer the gradual transfer of power from Chang to himself. In July, Park officially replaced Chang as Chairman, effectively becoming the de facto dictator of South Korea. The Supreme Council suspended the National Assembly, reinforced South Korea's anti-communist position, and undertook a number of economy- oriented reforms to help industrialize and develop the country, including the first Five-Year Plan. The Supreme Council's military government was met with instant disapproval from South Korea's main ally, the United States, and Park's early attempts to appease the Americans were disregarded. By 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his administration began to pressure Park into restoring democracy and civilian rule in South Korea. On 2 December 1962, a referendum was held on returning to a presidential system of rule, which was allegedly passed with a 78% majority.Yonhap (2004, p. 271). In response, Park eventually abdicated from his military position to be eligible to run as a civilian in the upcoming presidential election, despite he and the other military leaders pledging not to run for office. Park narrowly won in the presidential election of October 1963, and replaced Yun Posun as the President of Korea. =Establishment= The Third Republic of Korea was inaugurated on 17 December 1963, officially dissolving the Supreme Council and ending the three-year constitutional vacuum. The Third Republic was presented as a return to liberal democratic civilian government under the National Assembly, and a new powerful presidential system with the Prime Minister as the second-highest executive position under the President. In theory, President Park and his Democratic Republican Party operated through their democratically elected majority of seats in the National Assembly. However, in practice, the Third Republic was a continuation of the military dictatorship under Park and his government was predominantly composed of former members of the Supreme Council, which often exercised significant autocratic powers. In May 1967, Park was re-elected President in the 1967 presidential election, defeating Posun of the New Democratic Party with 51.4% of the vote. The South Korean constitution limited the President to two four-year terms, meaning Park was not eligible to run for re-election in 1971 upon the end of his term. However, in 1969 the Democratic Republican Party-dominated National Assembly forced through a constitutional amendment to allow him to seek a third term. Park ran in the May 1971 presidential election and defeated his New Democratic Party opponent Kim Dae-jung with 53.2% of the vote. In December 1971, Park declared a state of emergency \\"based on the dangerous realities of the international situation.\\" On 4 July 1972, Park and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung issued the July 4th North‚ÄìSouth Korea Joint Statement establishing the three principles of Korean unification as independence, peace, and nation-wide unity. =Dissolution= On 10 October 1972, Park launched a self-coup known as the October Restoration, dissolving the National Assembly, suspending the constitution, and declaring martial law across the country. Universities were closed, media outlets such as the press, radio and television were subjected to increased censorship, and speech was significantly restricted. Park commissioned work on a brand new constitution, which was completed in 27 October by the emergency State Council. The new constitution, known as the Yushin Constitution, was highly autocratic and authoritarian in design, lacked provisions regarding presidential term limits and elections were extended to every six years ‚Äì essentially guaranteeing presidency for life for Park Chung- Hee. On 21 November 1973, the Yushin Constitution was approved in the 1972 South Korean constitutional referendum with 92.3% of the vote and came into force, dissolving the Third Republic and establishing the Fourth Republic of Korea in its place. Economy Park Chung-hee served as President for the Third Republic's existence from 1963 to 1972. The South Korean economy grew rapidly during the Third Republic and the government continued to economic development priorities set by the Supreme Council. The South Korean government used the influx of foreign aid from Japan and the United States to provide loans to export businesses with no interest, and also provided financial support for industrial projects, such as the construction of the POSCO steel mill. The Third Republic saw the first major construction of infrastructure in southern Korea since the Japanese colonial era, with many new roads, railways and airports being built across the country. The Third Republic saw the first major growth of the chaebol, the large industrial conglomerates in South Korea that are run and controlled by an owner or family. When the Supreme Council came to power in 1961, they promised to tackle the corruption in the business world that had plagued the First Republic, and this was continued by the new government. However, despite some leading industrialists being arrested and charged with corruption, the new government realized that it would need the help of entrepreneurs if the government's ambitious plans to modernize the economy were to be fulfilled. A compromise was reached, under which many of the accused corporate leaders paid fines to the government. Subsequently, there was increased cooperation between corporate and government leaders in modernizing the economy. South Korea's economic boom came at the expense of severe restrictions on workers rights, and labor movements that arose during industrialization to secure greater protections for workers were actively suppressed by the Third Republic government. The Third Republic continued the program with the government of West Germany to recruit South Korean nurses and miners as Gastarbeiter, which began in the final months of the Supreme Council. The costs were largely paid for by the South Korean government, with only their wages and some language services paid for by their West German employers. The Koreans in Germany were able to wire large sums of money to South Korea because their wages, much higher than available back home, greatly exceeded their subsidized living costs. The Gastarbeiter South Koreans have since been argued as a major cause of South Korea's rapid economic growth in the late 20th century. In 1970, the Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement) was introduced that set out to modernize the countryside and their economies, in response to the growing wealth disparity with the richer urban areas. The Saemaul Undong encouraged communalism and the government provided free materials for locals to develop some infrastructure themselves, rather than relying totally on government-built infrastructure. The government also provided electricity and running water to farmers, built paved roads, and replaced thatched roofs with tin roofs. Reportedly, Park could not stand the sight of thatched roofs on farmers' homes, which for him was a sign of South Korea's backwardness, and their replacement reflected a personal obsession rather than a practical necessity. Controversially, the Saemaul Undong movement actively pushed a type of iconoclasm towards the \\"superstitions\\" in rural South Korea, leading many practitioners of Korean shamanism to be harassed and centuries old Korean traditions to be destroyed. Education The Third Republic introduced several reforms to the South Korean educational system. In 1968, the entrance examinations for middle schools were abolished, placing all middle schools on an equal footing. Also in 1968, a Charter of National Education was adopted, emphasizing nationalism and anti-communism in education. The charter outlined four goals for education: national revitalization, creating self-reliant individuals, promulgating a new cooperative image of the nation, and supporting anti-communism. The Third Republic government sought to reduce the political activism among college students which had brought down the First Republic, and planned to disrupt the activism by increasing academic competition. The government allowed universities and colleges to recruit up to 130% of their graduation quotas, so that student activists would be forced to compete against one another in order to graduate. However, student activism continued at a high but reduced level despite these measures. International relations Soldiers of the South Korean White Horse Division during the Vietnam War The Third Republic began to take an increasingly prominent role in international politics and established new relations with many countries around the world. South Korea's first diplomatic relations with Japan were established under the Third Republic, and South Korea-Japan relations were normalized in the Treaty on Basic Relations signed in 22 July 1965, and in an agreement ratified on 14 August 1965. Japan agreed to provide a large amount of compensation, grants, and loans to South Korea, and the two countries began economic and political cooperation. The Third Republic maintained close ties with the United States and continued to receive large amounts of foreign aid. A status of forces agreement was concluded in 1965, clarifying the legal situation of the United States Forces Korea, which the Park sought to remain stationed in South Korea despite publicly pushing for military self-reliance. Soon thereafter, South Korea entered the Vietnam War as a combatant under encouragement of the Many Flags program, eventually sending a total of 300,000 soldiers (the second-largest foreign contingent after the United States) to fight for South Vietnam against the communist North Vietnam and its allies. Greater attempts to develop diplomatic relationships with Western and Asia-Pacific countries occurred in the Third Republic, including the first state visits to Europe by a Korean head of state. During the 1960s, South Korea formed relations with Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Iceland, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Austria, the Vatican State, and Malta. South Korea held strong relations with Republic of China (Taiwan) and West Germany in solidarity against their rival communist governments, the People's Republic of China and East Germany, respectively. The Third Republic generally rejected trying to form relations with communist countries, most of which did not recognize the Seoul government.

The Fourth Republic was founded on the approval of the Yushin Constitution in the 1972 constitutional referendum, codifying the de facto dictatorial powers held by President Park Chung-hee, and succeeding the Third Republic. Park and his Democratic Republican Party ruled under the centralized and authoritarian Yushin System until the assassination of Park on 26 October 1979. The Fourth Republic entered a period of political instability under Park's successor, Choi Kyu-hah, and the escalating martial law declared after Park's death. Choi was unofficially overthrown by Chun Doo- hwan in the coup d'√©tat of December Twelfth in December 1979, and began the armed suppression of the Gwangju Democratization Movement against martial law. Chun launched the coup d'√©tat of May Seventeenth in May 1980, establishing a military dictatorship under the National Council for Reunification and dissolving the National Assembly, and was elected President by the council in the August 1980 presidential election. The Fourth Republic was dissolved on the adoption of a new constitution in March 1981 and replaced with the Fifth Republic of Korea. History =Background= Park Chung-hee had served as the leader and de facto dictator of South Korea since July 1961, coming to power two months after leading the May 16 coup which overthrew the Second Republic of Korea. Park and his supporters established the Supreme Council of National Reconstruction, a provisional military junta government that prioritized the economic development of South Korea, but faced strong pressure from the United States to restore the civilian government. In 1963, Park abdicated from his military position to run as a civilian in the October 1963 presidential election, defeating the incumbent President Yun Posun. The Third Republic of Korea was inaugurated two months later in December and presented as a return to civilian government under the National Assembly. In reality, it was a continuation of Park's military dictatorship, as the government was predominantly members of the Supreme Council, and the National Assembly was dominated by his Democratic Republican Party. Park won re-election in the 1967 presidential election, and the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment that allowed him to serve a third term, which he narrowly won in the 1971 presidential election against Kim Dae-jung of the New Democratic Party. Park's popularity began to decline in the early 1970s, and he faced growing domestic opposition from both the public and rival politicians. The 1971 presidential election showed that the New Democratic Party achieved significant electoral gains against the Democratic Republican Party, rising from 32.7% of the vote in 1968 to 44.4%. Public dissatisfaction with Park's authoritarian rule increased as the rapid economic growth of the 1960s began to slow down. Additionally, Park became anxious about changes in Cold War politics, especially the United States' policy towards communism under President Richard Nixon's Guam Doctrine. The legitimacy of Park's government depended on staunch anti-communism, and any moderation of that policy from South Korea's allies threatened the very basis of his rule. In December 1971, Park declared a state of emergency \\"based on the dangerous realities of the international situation\\". =Establishment= On 10 October 1972, Park launched a self-coup known as the October Restoration, dissolving the National Assembly, suspending the 1963 constitution, declaring martial law across the country, and commissioning work on a brand new constitution. Park had drawn inspiration for his self-coup from Ferdinand Marcos, the President of the Philippines, who had orchestrated a similar coup a few weeks earlier. =Yushin Constitution= The Fourth Republic was governed under the Yu-shin Constitution, also spelled Yushin (Hangul: Ïú†Ïã† / Hanja: Á∂≠Êñ∞) which in Korean means \\"rejuvenation\\" or \\"renewal\\". Yushin has the same Chinese root of \\"restoration\\" as a component of the Japanese ÊòéÊ≤ªÁ∂≠Êñ∞, Meiji-ishin, meaning Meiji Restoration, the event which brought Japan under the effective rule of the Emperor of Japan and began the country's rise into a world power in the late 1800s. The significance of the term Yushin was the allusion to the \\"imperial\\" role which scholars have seen attached to the presidency under the Yusin Constitution, which effectively concentrated all governing power in Park's hands.E.g., Kim, B.-K. & Vogel, E. F. (eds.) (2011) The Park Chung Hee Era: The Transformation of South Korea. Harvard University Press, p. 27. However, it is argued in the book that the Yusin Constitution merely formalised rather than directly established the \\"imperial presidency\\". The Yushin Constitution was a severely authoritarian document, marked by the sweeping executive and legislative powers granted to the president. His term was extended to six years, with no limits on re-election. The president was indirectly elected through the National Conference for Unification, an electoral college whose delegates were elected by the public. The requirements for presidential candidacy, however, were so stringent that only one candidate could be on the conference's ballot. He was vested with broad powers to suspend constitutional freedoms and rule by decree. He also had the right to appoint one-third of the National Assembly, effectively guaranteeing a parliamentary majority. For all intents and purposes, the Yusin Constitution codified the emergency powers Park had exercised since the previous December, effectively turning his presidency into a legal dictatorship. The new document sparked widespread but ineffective protests. On 21 November 1973, the Yushin Constitution was approved in the 1972 South Korean constitutional referendum with an implausible 92.3% of the vote with a turnout of 91.9%Nohlen et al, p427 and came into force, dissolving the Third Republic and establishing the Fourth Republic of Korea. Park was re-elected as President of South Korea for a fourth term in 1972 and a fifth term in 1978, both times unopposed. The Fourth Republic witnessed greater instability as Park's popularity, and tolerance of his authoritarianism, declined steadily during the 1970s. The Yushin Constitution allowed Park to legally and more openly violate civil liberties, particularly to suppress his mounting opposition, but this exacerbated resistance to his regime. Park repeatedly promised a transition to full democracy. However, these promises were disbelieved due to his increasingly naked autocracy. Kidnapping of Kim Dae-jung Kim Dae-jung was involved in a car accident shortly after the 1971 presidential election which left him with a permanent hip joint injury. Kim believed the accident was a failed assassination attempt from Park, fleeing to Japan for his safety and forming the dissident South Korean democracy movement there. Kim entered permanent self-imposed exile in Japan after the enactment of the Yushin Constitution in 1972. On 8 August 1973, Kim was kidnapped at a meeting of the Democratic Unification Party at the Hotel Grand Palace in Tokyo. According to Kim, his kidnappers probably intended to drown him in the Korea Strait by throwing him overboard en route to Korea. However, they were forced to abandon this plan as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force began pursuit and fired an illuminating shell at the boat just when the kidnappers brought Kim on the deck. Kim was subsequently released in Busan, and was found alive five days after the kidnapping at his house in Seoul. People's Revolutionary Party Incident In April 1975, the People's Revolutionary Party Incident resurfaced when 1024 individuals were arrested by the KCIA without a warrant under the National Security Act. The arrested were accused of attempting to re-establish a North Korean-backed radical socialist organization known as the People's Revolutionary Party, for which eight people were arrested for founding in August 1965 under South Korea's anti-communism laws. Similar to the original incident, the majority of the arrested were acquitted, with 253 of them imprisoned. On April 9, the Supreme Court of South Korea sentenced eight of the arrested to death: Do Ye-jong, Yeo Jeong-nam, Kim Yong-won, Lee Sub-yeong, Ha Jae-wan, Seo Do-won, Song Sang-jin, and Woo Hong-seon. All eight were executed only 18 hours after the announcement of the death penalty. Do Ye-jong was one of the original eight people arrested in 1965. The People's Revolutionary Party Incident received attention outside of South Korea and spawned significant negative press for Park's regime. Internally, knowledge about the incident was limited to first-hand experience and information from foreign newspapers shared secretly through universities and churches due to the country's strict censorship laws. Most people viewed the People's Revolutionary Party as a farce for Park to suppress democracy activists rather than communists, and news of the incident spread and emboldened the democratization movement at home and abroad. =Assassination of Park Chung- hee and dissolution= On 26 October 1979, Park was assassinated in a safehouse inside the Blue House presidential complex by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) and the president's security chief. Park, four of his bodyguards, and his chauffeur were killed by Kim and other KCIA agents for unknown reasons. The death of Park after 18-years of dictatorial rule caused immediate political turmoil in South Korea. Park was succeeded by Choi Kyu-hah, the Prime Minister since 1975, assuming power as acting president but was almost immediately marginalized by competing factions in the military. After the declaration of martial law following Park's death, General Jeong Seung-hwa acted as the government's chief administrator and appointed Major General Chun Doo-hwan the same day to lead a Joint Investigation Headquarters. On 27 October, Chun unilaterally assumed control of the KCIA and the government intelligence apparatus. On 6 December, the National Council for Unification confirmed Choi Kyu-hah as President according to the framework of the Yusin Constitution, but six days later, Chun spearheaded the coup d'√©tat of December Twelfth, forcibly arresting and detaining General Jeong. By this point Choi had lost any meaningful authority in government, and in early 1980 Chun installed himself as Director of the KCIA. In May 1980, Chun launched the coup d'√©tat of May Seventeenth, establishing a military dictatorship under the National Council for Reunification and dissolving the National Assembly, and the following day the Gwangju Uprising began in protest in Gwangju. In response, Chun tightened martial law and violently suppressed protests with troops, with around 200-600 people estimated to have died in the unrest. Although the Gwangju Uprising was successfully suppressed, it consolidated the momentum of nationwide support for democracy in South Korea. In August, Choi resigned and Chun was elected President in the 1980 presidential election by the National Council, running unopposed and winning 99.37% of the vote. In October, Chun abolished all political parties and established his own, the Democratic Justice Party, which was effectively a re-branding of Park's Democratic Republican Party that ruled South Korea since 1963. Chun enacted a new constitution less authoritarian than Park's Yusin Constitution, but still gave fairly broad powers to the president. The Fourth Republic was dissolved on 3 March 1981 when Chun was formally inaugurated as President after being re-elected in the February 1981 presidential election, and the Fifth Republic of Korea was established. Economy The Fourth Republic saw continued dramatic economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than the Third Republic following the Five-Year Plans. The Park government shifted away from light industry, considered to be highly developed, and began to invest in heavy industries in a plan known as the Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive. The heavy industry shift was primarily driven by the Korean DMZ Conflict from 1966 to 1969, which caused the South Korean leadership to fear it lacked the self-sufficiency to defend itself from North Korea without significant assistance from the United States. In the late 1960s, increasing American involvement in the Vietnam War led the South Korean leadership to believe the transfer of enough troops from the United States Forces Korea to Indochina would make South Korea vulnerable to North Korea, which had amassed an enormous army, and an industrial establishment almost wholly devoted to the supply it, on the other side of the DMZ. Therefore, South Korea viewed the development of heavy industries as necessary for survival against potential North Korean aggression and set out to build an industrial infrastructure that could support a modernized military. Park decided to channel the economic development capabilities of the state into the development of several key industries: steel, petrochemicals, automobiles, machine tools, shipbuilding, and electronics. Park enlisted the chaebols, the large family-owned conglomerates, as they possessed the capital to develop these industries. The Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive, which successfully developed heavy industry in South Korea, came at the cost of severe political and social repercussions. Wildcat strikes from the industrial working class and student protests against Park became increasingly frequent due to his undelivered promises of democratization, and are believed to have contributed to his assassination in 1979. Environmental damage and industrial accidents caused serious health issues, with one notable phenomenon known as Onsan illness, a pollution disease affecting people around Onsan, a town on the outskirts of the major city of Ulsan. Increased oil prices set by oil-rich Middle Eastern countries put pressure on the economic development of South Korea's heavy industry, but South Korean construction companies became highly active in the Middle East and saw an influx of foreign currency from these countries. The first reactor of the Kori Nuclear Power Plant near Busan began commercial operation in 1978. International relations A variety of events in international diplomacy led the Park regime to reconsider its diplomatic position. Notable were the normalization of U.S. diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, which cast doubt on South Korea's ability to count on Cold War backing from the United States. The South Korean government began to establish diplomatic relations with many countries, such as Canada. In addition, the first round of Red Cross talks were held between South Korea and North Korea. Park also announced plans for eventual reunification. Society In December 1974, The Dong-a Ilbo, one of the largest newspapers in South Korea, and its subsidiaries began to release media with empty advertisement slots in protest against Park's strict censorship laws. The Dong-a Ilbo had a long history of defying and protesting the authoritarian governments in Korea, and had been in dispute with Park since he led the Supreme Council of National Reconstruction. The Korean Central Intelligence Agency began to force The Dong-a Ilbo's main advertisers to withdraw, and the company relied on small advertisers until it was eventually pressured by the government into ending its protest campaign seven months later. The incident resulted in employees being dismissed, many of whom co-founded the popular newspaper The Hankyoreh. In 1975, Park ordered the homeless to be removed from the streets of Seoul, and thousands of people were captured by the police and sent to thirty-six camps. The detainees were then used as slave labor by the authorities and subjected to degrading treatment with many dying under torture.

The generational planets are the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Sedna, and Quaoar. Uranus was discovered by amateur astronomer William Herschel on 13 March 1781. Uranus exhibits the ideals of the 18th century, where people such as Benjamin Franklin endeavoured to use their inventive mind to move man into a more enlightened era. It has an orbit of 84 years, staying in each sign of the zodiac for approximately 7 years. Uranus is considered to be a higher octave of Mercury, which means that as people develop within their selves, their character and means of communication will exhibit more influences of the sign and house of Uranus. In essence, Uranus can be seen as a person's higher self. Because it takes Uranus 84 years to travel through the zodiac, transiting Uranus just might conjoin the natal Uranus within a person's lifetime. Neptune was discovered on 23 September 1846. Neptune is a 19th-century planet in that it heralded in many of the varied assortment of Protestant religions, as well as spiritualism, took hold. Visionaries such as Edgar Cayce and Rudolf Steiner were born in the second half of the 19th century, and their psychic abilities are indicative of the Neptunian themes of this time. It has an orbit of 165 years, which is approximately twice the time of Uranus. Neptune is considered to be the higher octave of Venus because both planet's are gaseous and both strive to achieve the higher ideals of mankind; Venus through the adoption of beauty and Neptune through unconditional love. Because Neptune has such a long orbit, an individual may see transiting Neptune form an opposition to their natal Neptune. Pluto was discovered by Clyde W. Tombaugh on 18 February 1930. When Pluto was first discovered, it was initially known as Planet X. Astronomers had been searching for another planet past Neptune, hoping to solve the dilemma of its rather irregular orbit. It is now known, however, that the perceived irregular orbit of Neptune was the result of a mathematical error because Pluto, being a planetoid smaller than our own Moon, was far too small to affect any type of gravitational pull on the gas giant. Pluto is very much a 20th-century planet and refers to the two world wars, and weapons of mass destruction, nuclear power, and a desire to totally control the world we live in. It is a planet that reveals to us the extremes we are capable of if we do not set necessary boundaries in our lives. This planet governs the compulsions in our life: those things we are compelled to do but know we should not, such as murder, rape, drug addiction, and even overeating if it is of such an extent that it threatens our health. Pluto is considered to be a higher octave of Mars, and this is evidenced by the fact that both planets co-rule Scorpio. Pluto, circling the Sun in 248 years, has a rather elliptical orbit, which means that it stays in the sign it rules, Scorpio, for a mere 9 years, and the sign of its fall, Taurus for 30! With this in mind, some astrologers believe that Pluto should rightfully rule Taurus, but for the time being it still rules Scorpio. As other trans-Neptunian object planets are discovered, however, this placement just might have to be reconsidered. Quaoar was discovered on 4 June 2002 and is considered to be a trans-Neptunian object. Although a planetoid, it is considered by many to be more of a planet than Pluto because its orbit is more circular in nature, being 286 years. When a person is around 71 years old, transiting Quaoar will form a square aspect to his natal placement. Since this is a recently discovered object, not much is yet known about its astrological significance and what part it plays in the universe. Sedna was discovered by a team using the Samuel Oschin telescope on 14 November 2003 and is a trans-Neptunian object. It has an orbit of 11,250 years, so stays in a sign for approximately a millennium. Because this planet has recently been discovered, not much is yet known about it.

The wines produced from the vineyards are diverse, but they are generally considered to be rich, silky and well balanced, with a complexity which surpasses that of the other wines of Burgundy. In addition to many excellent wines at both the village and premier cru level, the village has six grand crus. =Roman√©e-Conti= The Roman√©e-Conti vineyard dominates the village, with its wines among the most expensive in the world. It is a monopole of Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti. Around 600 cases are made each year from the vineyard's 1.8 ha. Its highly sought after wine develops strongly over several decades. =La Roman√©e= La Roman√©e is a monopole of the Domaine Liger- Belair. Only 300 cases are made each year from this plot of 0.84 ha. =La T√¢che= La T√¢che is Domaine de la Roman√©e Conti's other monopole, and its 6 ha consist of the vineyards of La T√¢che and Les Gaudichots. The wine is notable for being excellent at a very young age, and is of consistent quality even in otherwise poor vintages. =Richebourg= The 8 ha of the Richebourg cru are divided between 10 growers, including Domaine Leroy and Domaine de la Roman√©e Conti. Its wines are often described as \\"voluptuous\\". =Roman√©e- Saint-Vivant= The wine of Roman√©e-Saint-Vivant suffers in comparison to its neighbours, making a lighter and less powerful liquid. Once again Domaine de la Roman√©e Conti own over half of the area's 9.5 ha. =La Grande Rue= The least-renowned of the six grands crus is La Grande Rue, a monopole of Domaine Fran√ßois Lamarche, and was only promoted from premier cru recently. Its 1.4 hectares lie between La T√¢che and Roman√©e-Conti. Premiers Crus Although unable to command the same prices as their grand cru neighbours, the village is home to many excellent premier cru wines. The top vineyards include Les Gaudichots, Les Malconsorts, Les Suchots, Cros Parantoux, Les Chaumes, and Clos des R√©as (a monopole of Domaine Michel Gros).

It is served by Amtrak, the national railroad passenger system, which operates the Texas Eagle through Marshall each day, with service north to Chicago and west-southwest to Dallas, San Antonio and Los Angeles. The station also houses the Texas and Pacific Railway Depot & Museum. The ticket office in Marshall is staffed 7 days a week from 7am to 10am, and 5:30pm to 8:30pm.  History  The museum The station, also known as the T&P; Depot, is the only surviving structure of the Texas and Pacific Railway shops complex which originally consisted of fifty-seven buildings spanning . The building is located in the Ginocchio Historic District of the National Register of Historic Places and was built in 1912 to house a passenger station and the headquarters of railroad's eastern district. The building welcomed soldiers in both World War I and World War II, and at its height housed telegraph and immigration offices. During the 1970s a series of events led to the station being abandoned. Amtrak passenger trains used the building beginning on March 13, 1974, however in 1988 the Union Pacific Railroad, which owned the property, filed for a permit to demolish the building. The community intervened and throughout the 1990s worked to save the Depot and the building was restored and resumed service as the local train station; additionally, much of the building houses the railway museum. In 2008 T&P; Railway #400, a 2-8-2 \\"Mikado\\" type steam locomotive (originally built in 1915 for the Fort Worth & Denver City Railway and later acquired by the T&P;), was moved to the depot museum grounds from where it had been previously kept for years before in City Park, and restoration work on the engine was completed a couple of years later. The restoration work included rust removal and a new coat of paint, as well as stair access to the cab of the engine for visitors. The locomotive is now accessible to the public during regular museum hours. Centennial celebration On October 20, 2012, the station marked its centennial anniversary with a major community celebration, including free tours of the depot and museum, live music from a Dixieland jazz band, and a traditional lunch picnic on the depot's east lawn. Union Pacific Railroad also contributed significantly to the festivities by bringing the legendary Union Pacific 844 steam locomotive and the UP 150th Anniversary Heritage Train to Marshall for the occasion, as part of its whistle-stop tour celebrating Union Pacific's 150th (sesquicentennial) anniversary. The heritage train with UP 844 and a traveling \\"museum-on-wheels\\" baggage car, Promontory, was put on public display at the old T&P; rail yard east of the depot, and a free shuttle provided transportation between the depot and the heritage train during the event. The railroad also brought its famous UP No. 956 Mini-Train, which offered free rides around the depot's parking lot.

Other types of latrinalia include political commentary and notes on love as well as derogatory (sharing low opinions) comments and pictures.

All Your Base Are Belong To Us Etymology The late Alan Dundes, a folklorist at University of California, Berkeley, coined the term latrinalia in 1966 to refer to graffiti found in restrooms. Dundes preferred it over the term shithouse poetry, as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.

Early Work with ERS Collins ‚Äî along with Hannaham, Groff, Profeta, Colleen Werthmann, and Bradley Glenn ‚Äî formed Elevator Repair Service in the fall of 1991.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/27/adaptation-rebecca- mead Shortly thereafter, they were joined by Steve Bodow, who also served as co-Artistic Director until 2002 before joining the writing staff of The Daily Show. The ensemble's first production was a version of Tristan Tzara's The First Celestial Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine, Fire Extinguisher. Collins's early work with ERS was presented at downtown New York City venues such as Nada, Here Arts Center, The Ontological at St. Mark's Church, and Performance Space 122. The company's first original piece to tour Europe was Cab Legs (directed by Collins with Steve Bodow) an original work by the ensemble based loosely on a Tennessee Williams play and infused with choreography based on Bollywood dancing and Max Fleischer cartoons.https://www.elevator.org/shows/cab-legs/ Gatz Collins's best- known work with ERS is Gatz, an 8-hour performance of the entire text of The Great Gatsby. Work on the production began in 1999, but halted after ERS could not obtain performance rights to the book. In June 2004, Collins put together a 3-hour workshop performance of the first half of the novel at Brooklyn's Collapsible Hole venue. In the fall of 2004, Collins approached the Fitzgerald Estate a second time to attempt to secure rights for a full production of Gatz, which by that time had incorporated the entire text of the novel. Negotiations continued for several months. Late in 2004, with plans in place for a short run, The Fitzgerald Estate informed the company that performance rights would not be granted.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/theater/gatz- and-the-great-gatsby-vie-for-broadway-stages.html Notwithstanding, the ensemble continued with a limited number of open rehearsals at The Performing Garage in January 2005. Later that year, ERS was able to secure a licensing agreement with The Fitzgerald Estate to perform Gatz internationally and at select U.S. venues. Gatz officially premiered at The Kunsten Festival des Arts in Brussels in 2006 and had its U.S. premiere in Minneapolis at The Walker Art Center later that year.

The congregation and its members were called after Saint Maurus (died 565), a disciple of Saint Benedict credited with introducing the Benedictine rule and life into Gaul. The congregation was suppressed and its superior-general executed during the French Revolution. History At the end of the 16th century the Benedictine monasteries of France had fallen into a state of disorganization and laxity. In the Abbey of St. Vanne near Verdun a reform was initiated by Dom Didier de la Cour, which spread to other houses in Lorraine, and in 1604 the reformed Congregation of St. Vanne was established, the most distinguished members of which were Ceillier and Calmet. A number of French houses joined the new congregation; but as Lorraine was still independent of the French crown, it was considered desirable to form on the same lines a separate congregation for France. Thus in 1621 was established the famous French Congregation of St. Maur. Most of the Benedictine monasteries of France, except those belonging to Cluny, gradually joined the new congregation, which eventually embraced nearly two hundred houses. The chief house was Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, Paris, the residence of the superior- general and center of the literary activity of the congregation. The primary idea of the movement was not the undertaking of literary and historical work, but the return to a strict monastic r√©gime and the faithful carrying out of Benedictine life; and throughout the most glorious period of Maurist history the literary work was not allowed to interfere with the due performance of the choral office and the other duties of the monastic life. Towards the end of the 18th century a tendency crept in, in some quarters, to relax the monastic observances in favor of study; but the constitutions of 1770 show that a strict monastic r√©gime was maintained until the end. The course of Maurist history and work was checkered by the ecclesiastical controversies that distracted the French Church during the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of the members identified themselves with the Jansenist cause; but the bulk, including nearly all the greatest names, pursued a middle path, opposing the lax moral theology condemned in 1679 by Pope Innocent XI, and adhering to those strong views on grace and predestination associated with the Augustinian and Thomist schools of Roman Catholic theology; and like all the theological faculties and schools on French soil, they were bound to teach the four Gallican articles. Towards the end of the 18th century a rationalistic and freethinking spirit seems to have invaded some of the houses. The congregation (along with all Catholic religious orders) was suppressed in 1790 during the French revolution, and the monks were scattered. The last superior general of the order (Ambroise Chevreux) and forty monks died on the scaffold in Paris in 1792, during the September Massacres. Works Their historical and critical school produced a number of works of scholarship which still are of permanent value. The foundations of this school were laid by Dom Tarisse, the first superior-general, who in 1632 issued instructions to the superiors of the monasteries to train the young monks in the habits of research and of organized work. The pioneers in production were M√©nard and Luc d'Achery. The full Maurist bibliography contains the names of some 220 writers and more than 700 works. The lesser works in large measure cover the same fields as those in the list, but the number of works of purely religious character, of piety, devotion and edification, is very striking. What was produced was only a portion of what was contemplated and prepared for. Some of their most important contributions are: * a revision of Gallia Christiana, * L'art de v√©rifier les dates, * l'Histoire litt√©raire de la France. The French Revolution cut short many undertakings, the collected materials for which fill hundreds of manuscript volumes in the Biblioth√®que nationale de Paris and other libraries of France. There are at Paris 31 volumes of Berthereau's materials for the Historians of the Crusades, not one in Latin and Greek, but in the oriental tongues; from them have been taken in great measure the Recueil des historiens des croisade whereof 15 folio volumes have been published by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions. There exist also the preparations for an edition of Rufinus and one of Eusebius, and for the continuation of the Papal Letters and of the Concilia Galliae. Dom Cafflaux and Dom Villevielle left 236 volumes of materials for a Tr√©sor g√©n√©alogique. There are Benedictine Antiquities (37 vols.) (Claude Estiennot de la Serre), a Monasticon Gallicanum and a Monasticon Benedictinum (54 vols.) Of the Histories of the Provinces of France barely half a dozen were printed, but all were in hand, and the collections for the others fill 800 volumes of manuscripts. The materials for a geography of Gaul and France in 50 volumes perished in a fire during the Revolution. The output was prodigious, coming from a single society.

Since God created the universe after geometric and harmonic principles, to seek these principles was therefore to seek and worship God. The Great Architect of the Universe or Grand Architect of the Universe (G.A.O.T.U.) is a conception of God discussed by many Christian theologians and apologists. As a designation, it is used within Freemasonry to both represent the deity neutrally (in whatever form, and by whatever name each member may individually believe in) and to combine God with math and science. It is also a Rosicrucian conception of God, as expressed by Max Heindel. The concept of the demiurge as a grand architect also occurs in gnosticism as well as Hinduism. Christianity The concept of God as the Great Architect of the Universe has been used many times within Christianity. An illustration of God as the grand architect of the universe can be found in a Bible from the Middle AgesHog, Erik. \\"The depth of the heavens: Belief and knowledge during 2500 years\\" (pdf file) Europhysics News, (2004), 35(3), p. 78, . and the comparison of God to an architect has been used by Christian apologists and teachers. Thomas Aquinas said in the Summa: \\"God, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things created as the architect is to things designed (ut artifex ad artificiata).\\"Summa Theologica I. 27, 1, r.o. 3. Commentators have pointed out that the assertion that the Grand Architect of the Universe is the Christian God \\"is not evident on the basis of natural theology alone but requires an additional 'leap of faith' based on the revelation of the Bible\\". John Calvin, in his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), repeatedly calls the Christian God \\"the Architect of the Universe\\", also referring to his works as \\"Architecture of the Universe\\", and in his commentary on Psalm 19 refers to the Christian God as the \\"Great Architect\\" or \\"Architect of the Universe\\". The concept of a Great Architect of the Universe also occurs in Martinism. Martinist doctrine is that the Great Architect must not be worshipped. Martinists hold that while it is possible to \\"invoque\\" him, it is not to adore him. Hinduism In the Hindu mythology, Lord Vishvakarman is regarded as the ‚ÄúGod of Architecture‚Äù. He is the supremo of craftsmanship, perfection engineering. Vi≈õhw√°karma (meaning \\"all creating\\" in Sanskrit) is the deity of the creative power that holds the universe together according to the Rigveda and is considered to be the original creator, architect, divine engineer of the universe from before the advent of time, also the root concept of the later Upanishadic figures of Brahman and Purusha in the historical Vedic religion. Hindu scriptures describe many of Vishwakarma's architectural accomplishments. Through the four yugas (aeons of Hindu mythology), he had built several towns and palaces for the gods. Among them were, in chronological order, Svarga (Heaven) in Satya Yuga, Lanka in Treta Yuga, and Dwarka (Krishna's capital) in Dvapara Yuga. Freemasonry Masonic historians such as William Bissey Gary Leazer (quoting Coil's Masonic Encyclopaedia), and S. Brent Morris, assert that \\"the Masonic abbreviation G.A.O.T.U., meaning the Great Architect of the Universe, continues a long tradition of using an allegorical name for the Deity.\\" They trace how the name and the abbreviation entered Masonic tradition from the Book of Constitutions written in 1723 by the Reverend James Anderson. They also note that Anderson, a Calvinist minister, probably took the term from Calvin's usage. Christopher Haffner's own explanation of how the Masonic concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, as a placeholder for the Supreme Being of one's choice, is given in Workman Unashamed: The Swedish Rite, which has the prerequisite of professing to Christian Faith, uses the form \\"The Threefold Great Architect of the Universe\\". Hermeticism The Great Architect may also be a metaphor alluding to the godhead potentiality of every individual. \\"(God)... That invisible power which all know does exist, but understood by many different names, such as God, Spirit, Supreme Being, Intelligence, Mind, Energy, Nature and so forth.\\" Mary Ann Slipper, The Symbolism of the Eastern Star Pages 35 and 36. In Hermeticism, each and every person has the potential to become God, this idea or concept of God is perceived as internal rather than external. The Great Architect is also an allusion to the observer created universe. We create our own reality; hence we are the architect. Another way would be to say that the mind is the builder. Rosicrucianism In Max Heindel's exposition, the Great Architect of the Universe is the Supreme Being, who proceeds from The Absolute, at the dawn of manifestation. Gnosticism The concept of the Great Architect of the Universe occurs in Gnosticism. The demiurge is the Great Architect of the Universe, the God of Old Testament, in opposition to Christ and Sophia, messengers of Gnosis of the True God. For example: Gnostics such as the Nasor√¶ans believe the Pira Rabba is the source, origin, and container of all things, which is filled by the M√¢n√¢ Rabb√¢, the Great Spirit, from which emanates the First Life. The First Life prays for companionship and progeny, whereupon the Second Life, the Ultra Mkayyema or World-constituting √Üon, the Architect of the Universe, comes into being. From this architect come a number of √¶ons, who erect the universe under the foremanship of the Mand√¢ d'Hayye or gn√¥sis zo√™s, the Personified Knowledge of Life. Others James Hopwood Jeans, in his book The Mysterious Universe, also employs the concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, saying at one point \\"Lapsing back again into the crudely anthropomorphic language we have already used, we may say that we have already considered with disfavour the possibility of the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer; from the intrinsic evidence of his creation, the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician.\\" To that Jinarajadasa adds his observation that the Great Architect is \\"also a Grand Geometrician. For in some manner or other, whether obvious or hidden, there seems to be a geometric basis to every object in the universe.\\" See also * Brahman * Creation myth * Deism * Intelligent designer * Names of God References Category:Attributes of God in Christian theology Category:Gnosticism Category:Rosicrucianism Category:Monotheism Category:Freemasonry and religion ","title":"Great Architect of the Universe"},{"id":"2361538","text":"IDEF0 Diagram Example IDEF0, a compound acronym (\\"Icam DEFinition for Function Modeling\\", where ICAM is an acronym for \\"Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing\\"), is a function modeling methodology for describing manufacturing functions, which offers a functional modeling language for the analysis, development, reengineering, and integration of information systems; business processes; or software engineering analysis.Systems Engineering Fundamentals. Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001. IDEF0 is part of the IDEF family of modeling languages in the field of software engineering, and is built on the functional modeling language Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT).  Overview  The IDEF0 Functional Modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168. It was derived from the established graphic modeling language Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) developed by Douglas T. Ross and SofTech, Inc. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language (syntax and semantics) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.FIPS Publication 183 released of IDEF√ò December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers \\"to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices\\". Where the Functional flow block diagram is used to show the functional flow of a product, IDEF0 is used to show data flow, system control, and the functional flow of lifecycle processes. IDEF0 is capable of graphically representing a wide variety of business, manufacturing and other types of enterprise operations to any level of detail. It provides rigorous and precise description, and promotes consistency of usage and interpretation. It is well-tested and proven through many years of use by government and private industry. It can be generated by a variety of computer graphics tools. Numerous commercial products specifically support development and analysis of IDEF0 diagrams and models. An associated technique, Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEF1x), is used to supplement IDEF0 for data-intensive systems. The IDEF0 standard, Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 183 (FIPS 183), and the IDEF1x standard (FIPS 184) are maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). FIPS PUB 183 \\"Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0),\\" was withdrawn as a Federal Standard (in favor of OPEN Specifications and Standards) September 2, 2008, as cited in \\"The Federal Register\\", Volume 73, page 51276 (73FR/51276).  History  During the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force Program for Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) sought to increase manufacturing productivity through systematic application of computer technology. The ICAM program identified the need for better analysis and communication techniques for people involved in improving manufacturing productivity. As a result, in 1981 the ICAM program developed a series of techniques known as the IDEF (ICAM Definition) techniques which included the following: * IDEF0, used to produce a \\"function model\\". A function model is a structured representation of the functions, activities or processes within the modeled system or subject area.ICAM Architecture Part II-Volume IV - Function Modeling Manual (IDEF0), AFWAL-TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981. * IDEF1, used to produce an \\"information model\\". An information model represents the structure and semantics of information within the modeled system or subject area.ICAM Architecture Part II, Volume V - Information Modeling Manual (IDEF1), AFWAL- TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981. * IDEF2, used to produce a \\"dynamics model\\". A dynamics model represents the time-varying behavioral characteristics of the modeled system or subject area.ICAM Architecture Part II, Volume VI - Dynamics Modeling Manual (IDEF2), AFWAL-TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981. In 1983, the U.S. Air Force Integrated Information Support System program enhanced the IDEF1 information modeling technique to form IDEF1X (IDEF1 Extended), a semantic data modeling technique. By the 1990s, IDEF0 and IDEF1X techniques are widely used in the government, industrial and commercial sectors, supporting modeling efforts for a wide range of enterprises and application domains. In 1991 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) received support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Corporate Information Management (DoD/CIM), to develop one or more Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for modeling techniques. The techniques selected were IDEF0 for function modeling and IDEF1X for information modeling. These FIPS documents are based on the IDEF manuals published by the U.S. Air Force in the early 1980s.  IDEF0 topics  Top-Level Context Diagram = The IDEF0 approach = IDEF0 may be used to model a wide variety of automated and non-automated systems. For new systems, it may be used first to define the requirements and specify the functions, and then to design an implementation that meets the requirements and performs the functions. For existing systems, IDEF0 can be used to analyze the functions the system performs and to record the mechanisms (means) by which these are done. The result of applying IDEF0 to a system is a model that consists of a hierarchical series of diagrams, text, and glossary cross-referenced to each other. The two primary modeling components are functions (represented on a diagram by boxes) and the data and objects that inter-relate those functions (represented by arrows). = IDEF0 Building blocks = Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) Box Format The IDEF0 model displayed here on the left is based on a simple syntax. Each activity is described by a verb-based label placed in a box. Inputs are shown as arrows entering the left side of the activity box while output are shown as exiting arrows on the right side of the box. Controls are displayed as arrows entering the top of the box and mechanisms are displayed as arrows entering from the bottom of the box. Inputs, Controls, Outputs, and Mechanisms (ICOM) are all referred to as concepts. * Arrow : A directed line, composed of one or more arrow segments, that models an open channel or conduit conveying data or objects from source (no arrowhead) to use (with arrowhead). There are 4 arrow classes: Input Arrow, Output Arrow, Control Arrow, and Mechanism Arrow (includes Call Arrow). See Arrow Segment, Boundary Arrow, Internal Arrow. * Box : A rectangle, containing a name and number, used to represent a function.

May denote bundling of arrow segment meanings * Node : A box from which child boxes originate; a parent box. See Node Index, Node Tree, Node Number, Node Reference, Diagram Node Number. IDEF0 Diagram Example = Graphical notation = IDEF0 is a model that consists of a hierarchical series of diagrams, text, and glossary cross referenced to each other. The two primary modeling components are: * functions (represented on a diagram by boxes), and * data and objects that interrelate those functions (represented by arrows). As shown by Figure 3 the position at which the arrow attaches to a box conveys the specific role of the interface. The controls enter the top of the box. The inputs, the data or objects acted upon by the operation, enter the box from the left. The outputs of the operation leave the right-hand side of the box. Mechanism arrows that provide supporting means for performing the function join (point up to) the bottom of the box. = The IDEF0 process = The IDEF0 process starts with the identification of the prime function to be decomposed. This function is identified on a ‚ÄúTop Level Context Diagram,‚Äù that defines the scope of the particular IDEF0 analysis. An example of a Top Level Context Diagram for an information system management process is shown in Figure 3. From this diagram lower-level diagrams are generated. An example of a derived diagram, called a ‚Äúchild‚Äù in IDEF0 terminology, for a life cycle function is shown in Figure 4. = Federal Information Processing Standards = In Dec 1993 the National Institute of Standards and Technology announcing the standard for Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) in the category Software Standard, Modeling Techniques.

Her late father, Yitzhak Isaac Levy (1919‚Äì1977),\\"Music & Vision\\" was a composer and hazzan (cantor), as well as a pioneer researcher into the history of the Ladino music and culture of Spanish Jewry and its diaspora, being the editor of the Ladino language magazine Aki Yerushalayim.Aki Yerushalayim Career With her distinctive and emotive style, Levy has brought a new interpretation to the medieval Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) song by incorporating more \\"modern\\" sounds of Andalusian flamenco and traditional Persian music as well as combining instruments like the darbuka, oud, violin, cello, and piano. Her debut album was Romance & Yasmin in 2000, which earned her a nomination as \\"Best Newcomer\\" for the fRoots / BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards 2005, followed in 2005 with her second album La Juder√≠a (). In 2006, she was nominated again, then in the category \\"Culture Crossing\\". On her second album, La Juder√≠a, she also covered the popular songs \\"Gracias a la Vida\\" by Violeta Parra and \\"Nac√≠ en √Ålamo\\" from the film Vengo, directed by Tony Gatlif, which in its original version won the 2001 C√©sar Award for Best Music Written for a Film (itself being a cover of \\"The Song of the Gypsies\\" (), written by Greek songwriter Dionysis Tsaknis in 1990). Levy's work earned her the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation Award for promoting cross- cultural dialogue between musicians from three cultures. In her own words: > I am proud to combine the two cultures of Ladino and flamenco, while mixing > in Middle Eastern influences. I am embarking on a 500-year-old musical > journey, taking Ladino to Andalusia and mixing it with flamenco, the style > that still bears the musical memories of the old Moorish and Jewish-Spanish > world with the sound of the Arab world.

It is a scenic place located on a plateau surrounded on three sides by the Myntdu river bordering Bangladesh to the south (about 50 km from the Indo- Bangladesh border). Due to its high altitude of 1365 m above sea level, Jowai experiences warm and pleasant summers with cool to chilly winters. Jowai is an important business and education hub of the entire district catering to students from all over the district as well as the adjacent parts of Assam and Bangladesh. It is well equipped with amenities such as schools, colleges, hospitals, post office etc. Like Khynriams, Pnars have a matriarchal society where the daughters inherit the family property. Connectivity Jowai is well connected by roadways to Shillong which is 64 km away. The town of Jowai lies on the National Highway 44(NH 44) which connects Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and parts of Manipur, specifically Lamka (Churachandpur), where the Highway NH 44 is sole link to it. There are a few buses that ply through this route but are overcrowded with people and goods. The most popular and convenient mode of transport in the district is the Tata Sumo and the Tata Indica that function on a shared passenger basis. The cost for travelling from Shillong to Jowai by either a Tata Sumo or Tata Indica is ‡§∞100 with a fairly good frequency all through the day. There is no rail or air link in the district.

Festivals and food Behdeinkhlam,http://www.north-east-india.com/meghalaya/behdienkhlam- festival.html a major festival of the Jaintia takes place during the wet and rainy months of July. It is a festival that lasts 4 days. 'Behdienkhlam' literally means 'to drive away evils and plague'. It is a colourful festival that is celebrated in all parts of Jaintia Hills. Today, the Christians usually do not participate in it, but is celebrated with pomp and show amongst the followers of the traditional religion 'Niamtre'. This Festival is connected with a series of religious rites. People dance on the street to the accompaniment of drum beating and pipe playing. The women do not participate in the dancing but have an important role to play at home by offering sacrificial food to the spirits of the ancestors. Each locality prepares a decorative tower-like pillar structure called a 'rath'. These are carried by 30 to 40 strong people to a small lake at 'Aitnar' for immersion. The festival climaxes when the khnong (the most sacred tree) is brought to the centre of each locality. In the afternoon 'Datlawakor' is played between two teams from the upper and lower valleys of the Myntdu River. It is a kind of soccer with a wooden ball. Those who win are believed to be blessed with a good harvest. Other festivals include 'Laho Dance' and 'Chad Sukra'. Meat and fish particularly pork is a delicacy. A variety of pork items like Jadoh, Doh Khleh, Doh jem, Doh Snam are prepared in a traditional way to savor your taste buds .

Artocarpus odoratissimus is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is a commonly called marang, madang, timadang, terap, tarap, green pedalai, or johey oak. It is native to Borneo, Palawan, and Mindanao Island, and is closely related to the jackfruit, cempedak, and breadfruit trees which all belong to the same genus, Artocarpus. Description Artocarpus odoratissimus is an evergreen tree growing to tall. The leaves are 16‚Äì50 cm long and 11‚Äì28 cm broad, similar to the Breadfruit's, but are a little less lobed. Many trees lose the leaf lobing once mature. =Fruit= As indicated by the scientific name, the fruit has a strong scent, and is considered superior in flavour to both jackfruit and cempedak. The scent reminds some of the durian but is not so intense, and is in the thick skin and not the fruit pulp. The taste has hints of a mild creamy, almost juicy banana, and is best when not allowed to ripen thoroughly on the tree. Those ripened on the tree turn a more brownish color and will eventually fall to the ground and easily split open. Fruit and foliage Ripe fruits (Philippines) The appearance of the fruit can be regarded as an intermediate shape between the jackfruit and the breadfruit. It is round to oblong, 15‚Äì20 cm long and 13 cm broad, and weighing about 1 kg. The thick rind is covered with soft, broad spines. They become hard and brittle as the fruit matures. When fully mature the expanding arils stretch the outer rind which often appears lumpy, especially if not all seeds were pollinated. The fruit does not fall to the ground until over-ripe. It may be harvested when full size but still firm, and left to ripen until soft. Fruits change colour to greenish yellow when ripe. The ripe fruit is opened by cutting the rind around, twisting and gently pulling. If overripe they are simply pulled apart. The interior of the fruit is somewhat similar to the jackfruit's, but the color is white and the flesh is usually softer. The core is relatively large, but there are far fewer \\"rags\\" and less non-edible parts. Arils are white and the size of a grape, each containing a 15 √ó 8 mm seed. Once opened, the fruit should be consumed quickly (in a few hours), as it loses flavour rapidly and fruit oxidizes. The seeds are also edible after boiling or roasting. Cultivation Artocarpus odoratissimus is cultivated for its fruit in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, southern Thailand and India Tripura. The species is largely grown for local consumption; the short shelf-life of the fruit limits its wider use. The tree is not cold tolerant (as is the breadfruit). It can grow between latitude 15¬∞ north and south, and in coastal regions where temperatures never stay under 7 ¬∞C. Similar fruits The fruits of Artocarpus sericicarpus (known as the peluntan, gumihan, pedalai, or tarap bulu) and Artocarpus sarawakensis (pingan or mountain tarap) are very similar to, and often confused with A. odoratissimus. Both these species are native to the same areas. However, they are still distinguishable based on their appearances when ripe. Artocarpus sericicarpus has hairs, like a large rambutan, and ripens red. Artocarpus sarawakensis is even trickier, because it is the shape of A. odoratissimus, and it is orange. It has smaller kernel sections.  Uses of tarap wastes  There are many uses of the leftover tarap peels, stem axis and seeds. The tarap peels were reported as useful material for the removal of colouring agents (such as crystal violet, methyl violet 2B and methylene blue ) from dye wastewater. The tarap stem axis were reported to be used in the removal of Cd (II) and Cu(II).

The Fifth Republic was established in March 1981 by Chun Doo-hwan, a military colleague of long-time president and dictator Park Chung-hee, after the political instability and military rule in the Fourth Republic since the assassination of Park in October 1979. The Fifth Republic was ruled by Chun and the Democratic Justice Party as a de facto dictatorship and one-party state to extensively reform South Korea for democratization and dismantle the autocratic system of Park. The Fifth Republic faced growing opposition from the democratization movement of the Gwangju Uprising, and the June Democracy Movement of 1987 resulted in the election of Roh Tae-woo in the December 1987 presidential election. The Fifth Republic was dissolved three days after the election upon the adoption of a new constitution that laid the foundations for the relatively stable democratic system of the current Sixth Republic of Korea. History =Background= Park Chung-hee had served as the leader of South Korea since July 1961, during which he was a de facto military dictator and maintained his near-absolute power through legal and illegal channels. Park originally came to power as Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Reconstruction two months after the May 16 coup (which he had led) overthrew the Second Republic of Korea. The Supreme Council established a provisional military junta government that prioritized the economic development of South Korea, but faced strong pressure from the United States to restore civilian rule. In 1963, Park abdicated from his military position to run as a civilian in the October 1963 presidential election, defeating the incumbent President Yun Posun and inaugurating the Third Republic of Korea two months later in December. The Third Republic was presented as a return to civilian government under the National Assembly, but in reality was a continuation of Park's military dictatorship and the government was predominantly members of the Supreme Council. Park won re- election in the 1967 presidential election, and the National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment that allowed him to serve a third term, which he won in the 1971 presidential election against Kim Dae-jung. In December 1971, Park declared a state of emergency. On 10 October 1972, Park launched a self-coup known as the October Restoration, dissolving the National Assembly, suspending the constitution, and declaring martial law across the country. Park commissioned work on a brand new constitution, known as the Yushin Constitution, which essentially formalized his long-held dictatorial powers and guaranteed him as president for life. On 21 November 1973, the Yushin Constitution was approved in the 1972 South Korean constitutional referendum with 92.3% of the vote and came into force, dissolving the Third Republic and establishing the Fourth Republic of Korea. =Establishment= Park's popularity in South Korea declined during the 1970s, as the economic growth of the 1960s began to slow and the public became more critical of his authoritarianism. On 26 October 1979, Park was assassinated at a safehouse by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), causing political turmoil in South Korea. Park's successor, Choi Kyu-hah, was an ineffective president whose authority was largely ignored by the political elite. In December, Major General Chun Doo-hwan, the Chairman of the Defense Security Command and a former military colleague of Park, overthrew Choi's government in the Coup d'√©tat of December Twelfth, and over the next few months gained control over most government apparatuses. In May 1980, Chun launched the Coup d'√©tat of May Seventeenth establishing a military dictatorship under National Council for Reunification and declared martial law. Chun violently suppressed the subsequent Gwangju Uprising democracy movement against his rule in Gwangju, during which 200-600 people may have died. In August, Choi resigned and Chun was elected President in the 1980 presidential election by the National Council, running unopposed and winning 99.37% of the vote. In October, Chun abolished all political parties and established his own, the Democratic Justice Party, which was effectively a re- branding of Park's Democratic Republican Party that ruled South Korea since 1963. Soon afterwards, a new constitution was enacted that, while far less authoritarian than Park's Yusin Constitution, still gave fairly broad powers to the president. The Fifth Republic of Korea was formally inaugurated on 3 March 1981, when Chun was inaugurated as President after being re-elected in the February 1981 presidential election. =Democratization= The Fifth Republic oversaw the transition of South Korea from a historically autocratic state into a democratic country. Although Chun gradually dismantled the autocratic government structures set up by Park, his presidency was plagued by public outrage over his reaction to the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. The killings had consolidated momentum of nationwide support for democracy, and many people protested for faster democratization. Chun reorganized the government system and created numerous new ministries, but South Korea remained a de facto one- party state under the Democratic Justice Party and elections considered legitimate had not been held. In the mid-1980s, Chun began to release political prisoners arrested during his rise to power. In 1985, the New Korea and Democratic Party (NKDP) was founded as the successor of the New Democratic Party, including notable opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam, and campaigned on a focus on greater democratic rights. The NKDP became the opposition in the National Assembly after strong success in the 1985 South Korean legislative election, with only 6% fewer votes than Chun's Democratic Justice Party. Reportedly, the NKDP's electoral success shocked and infuriated Chun. However, in 1986 the NKDP experienced internal ideological conflicts over the severity of opposition to Chun, and in 1987 Kim Young-sam's faction split to form the Reunification Democratic Party. =Dissolution= In January 1987, the death of Bak Jongcheol caused a flare in the democratization movement and sparked widespread protests. Bak, a student at Seoul National University and democracy movement activist, died from causes related to police torture after being arrested at a protest. In June 1987, the death of Lee Han- yeol, a protester killed by a police tear gas grenade at one of the demonstrations following Bak's death, caused the democracy movement put unrelenting pressure on Chun. The protesters demanded elections to be held, as well as instituting other democratic reforms, including direct presidential elections. On June 10, Chun announced his choice of Roh Tae-woo as the next president, which was met with offence from the protesters. However, unwilling to resort to violence before the 1988 Olympic Games and believing Roh could win legitimate elections due to divisions within the opposition, Chun and Roh acceded to the key demands of direct presidential elections and restoration of civil liberties. On 16 December 1987, Roh won the 1987 presidential election with 36.6% of the vote, the first honest national elections in South Korea in two decades. Three days later on 19 December, a new highly-democratic and liberal constitution came into effect, dissolving the Fifth Republic and establishing the current Sixth Republic of Korea. Chun finished out his term and handed the presidency to Roh on 25 February 1988. Economy The Hyundai Pony, South Korea's first mass-produced car, began to be exported during the Fifth Republic. The Fifth Republic experienced economic difficulties during the first half of the 1980s, where foreign debts became a major issue in the aftermath of rapid economic development in the 1960s and 1970s. Many problems surfaced such as the Lee‚ÄìChang scandal, the first financial scandal of Chun's presidency, and the dismantling of the International Group, a major Korean conglomerate. Falling oil prices, falling US dollar value, and falling interest rates also effected the country's economy. By the mid-1980s, the South Korean economy improved, with high-tech industries such as the manufacture of electronics and semiconductors becoming prosperous. In 1986, Hyundai Motors began exporting the Pony and Excel models to the United States, the first signal that South Korea was competing with developed countries in the automobile industry. Thanks to exports, the gross national product (GNP) grew rapidly and the annual average growth rate remained around 10%. In 1987, GNP per capita exceeded $3,000. The start of color television broadcasting in 1980 was also a sign of economic growth. The South Korean economy continued to be dominated by family-owned conglomerates known as chaebols and their influence grew during the Fifth Republic. The share of the 10 largest conglomerates in the gross national product increased from 33% in 1979 to 54% in 1989, while the number of affiliated companies in the 30 largest conglomerates increased from 126 in 1970 to 429 in 1979 and 513 in 1989. The liberalization of imports saw the influx of agricultural and livestock products expanded. However, the government's policies provided a favorable environment for large companies, while the rural economy was seriously damaged by the importation of cheap foreign agricultural products. The self- sufficiency rate of grains fell from 86% in 1970 to 48.4% in 1985. Therefore, foreign agricultural and livestock products occupied a large portion of food consumed by South Korean people. While urban areas grew in wealth and size, in contrast the rural population rapidly declined, and many peasants from the countryside migrated to the cities. Rural migrants often lived in poverty at the very bottom of urban society, engaging in industrial or services work, and sometimes illegal activity. International relations The Fifth Republic openly maintained close relations with the United States and Japan under the banner of anti-communism, promoting a Korea-US-Japan Triangular Alliance. The Chun government's strong pro-American stance caused a reaction of Anti- Americanism in the democratization movement, which had been treated with suspicion by the United States along with other student movements. While military relations with Japan were strong, the Fifth Republic witnessed a rise in Anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea due to various cultural and political disputes, mostly related to the history of Japanese rule in Korea. Examples include the Japanese history textbook controversies and problems with the Japanese immigration system for Zainichi Koreans. South Korea's relations with North Korea thawed during the beginning of the Fifth Republic, and proposed unification plans were announced, but only held favorable conditions for their respective countries and was mostly used for propaganda. North Korean relations soured in 1983 after the Rangoon bombing, an attempted assassination of President Chun during a state visit in Rangoon, Burma. Three North Korean agents detonated a bomb at the Martyrs' Mausoleum intending to kill Chun during a wreath laying ceremony to commemorate Aung San. The blast killed 21 people, including four senior South Korean politicians: foreign minister Lee Beom-seok, minister of power resource Suh Sang-chul, economic planning minister and deputy prime minister Suh Suk-Joon, and minister for commerce and industry Kim Dong-Whie. In September 1984, relations improved when North Korea sent large quantities of aid to South Korea during major flooding. The aid was accepted by Chun despite the North Korean attempt on his life less than a year earlier. In 1985, Chun proposed an inter-Korean summit that was eventually held in September in Seoul. The summit was considered a success in inter-Korean relations, but the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 on 29 November 1987 by North Korean agents damaged relations again. The Fifth Republic continued South Korea's openly pro-Western stance and promoted stronger diplomatic ties with NATO countries in Europe, hoping to form greater economic ties to the European Community. The Fifth Republic also began to establish diplomatic relations with various African and Asian countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Pakistan, Brunei, and Bhutan.

It has its own dialect of Dhivehi which is considerably different from northern and mid-Maldivian speech. History =Secession of the Suvadive Islands= In January 1959, the three southern atolls: Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu, were involved in setting up the breakaway United Suvadive Republic which survived in Addu until September 1963. The name of the secessionist state was taken from the ancient name of this atoll.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, a Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Nova Ethnographia Indica. 1999. In some islands, like Gadhdhoo, there was opposition to the secession, and by means of threats and arson, the groups of people opposing the Suvadive state were forced to agree. The capital of Havaru Thinadhoo was burnt down by soldiers sent by then Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir from Mal√© during the secession in 1962, after which it was left uninhabited for four whole years and the atoll served its capital at Gadhdhoo more than ten(10)years. Geography The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. Demography Economy =Gadhdhoo Kunaa= The local women of Gadhdhoo Island weave beautiful mats with patterns in three colors, off-white, yellow and black. These mats are woven using the strands of the bark of Hibiscus tiliaceus (the same tree which is used for making tapa cloth in Polynesia and a kind of local grass called 'hau', which may be dyed in yellow or black. There are two qualities, thinner mats woven with simple knot, or thicker, good-quality mats woven bu means of more complex knots. Traditionally the best Gadhdhoo mats were used by the Maldive Royal House in Mal√©. Part of the annual tribute from the Huvadu Atoll Chief to the royal court, used to be in the form of Gadhdhoo mats. Nils-Finn Munch Petersen and Annegrethe Ottovar, two Danish anthropologists visited this island in the 1970s and made extensive research about its mat production and the patterns used on them. The production of these mats has suffered much from the reckless activity of intermediaries. While a great price is fetched from the tourists, the women who wove them in Gadhdhoo Island received just a small fraction of the amount. Consequently, production and quality declined during the 1980s and have not recovered since. Young girls refused to go through the difficult and long period of apprenticeship because of the low revenue that could be expected in the future.

Admiral William F. Halsey in carrier rendezvoused with the task force off Midway, and General Jimmy Doolittle's famed raiders launched the morning of 18 April when some 600 miles east of Tokyo. The task force made a rapid retirement to Pearl Harbor, then sped south 30 April 1942, hoping to assist carriers and in the Battle of the Coral Sea. That battle concluded before the task force arrived, and Gwin returned to Pearl Harbor on 21 May for day and night preparations to meet the Japanese in the crucial battle for Midway Atoll. = Battle of Midway = Gwin departed Pearl Harbor 23 May 1942 with Marine reinforcements for Midway and returned to port 1 June. Two days later she raced to join the Fast Carrier Task Force searching for the approaching Japanese fleet off Midway. The battle was all but concluded by the time she arrived on the scene on 5 June 1942. Four large Japanese aircraft carriers and a cruiser rested on the bottom of the sea along with some 250 enemy planes and their crews. Gwin sent a salvage party to assist in attempts to save carrier Yorktown, heavily damaged by two bomb and two torpedo hits in the Battle of Midway. As attempts continued 6 June 1942, a Japanese submarine rocked Yorktown with torpedo hits and sank the destroyer which was secured alongside the carrier. The salvage party had to abandon Yorktown and surviving men were rescued from the sea, The carrier capsized and sank the morning of 7 June 1942. Gwin carried 102 survivors of the two ships to Pearl Harbor, arriving 10 June 1942. =Guadalcanal= Gwin departed Pearl Harbor 15 July 1942 to operate in the screen of fast carriers who pounded Japanese installations, troop concentrations and supply dumps as Marines invaded Guadalcanal in the Solomons on 7 August 1942. In the following months Gwin convoyed supply and troop reinforcements to Guadalcanal. Joining a cruiser‚Äìdestroyer task force, she patrolled \\"the Slot\\" of water between the chain of Solomon Islands to intercept the \\"Tokyo Express\\" runs of supply, troop and warships supporting Japanese bases in the Solomons. On 13 November 1942, Gwin and three other destroyers formed with battleships and to intercept an enemy bombardment‚Äìtransport force approaching the Solomons. The following night the task group found the enemy off Savo Island: the battleship , four cruisers, 11 destroyers, and four transports, The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was intensely fought. Gwin found herself in a gun duel between the light cruiser and two Japanese destroyers ( and ), versus the four American destroyers. She took a shell hit in her engine room. Another shell struck her fantail and enemy torpedoes began to boil around the destroyers. Though shaken by exploding depth charges, Gwin continued to fire at the enemy as long as any remained within range. In a short time the other three American destroyers were out of action; two sinking and surviving with her bow partially destroyed. Gwin attempted to escort the nose-less Benham to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands. But when all hope was lost, survivors transferred to Gwin who sank Benhams abandoned hulk with gunfire. The survivors were landed 20 November at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, and Gwin was routed onward to Hawaii, thence to the Mare Island Navy Yard, arriving 19 December 1942. =Later action in the Solomons= Having been overhauled, Gwin returned to the Southwest Pacific on 7 April 1943 to escort troop reinforcements and supplies throughout the Solomons. On 30 June she served with the massive amphibious assault force converging on New Georgia under the leadership of Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner. She supported the landings of 30 June on the north coast of Rendova Island, across Blanche Channel from Munda. Immediately after the first wave of troops hit Rendova Beach, Munda Island shore batteries opened fire on the four destroyers patrolling Blanche Channel. Gwin was straddled by the first salvo. A moment later a shell exploded on her main deck aft, killing three men, wounding seven and stopping her after engine. The half-dozen enemy shore batteries were soon silenced as Gwin laid down an effective heavy smoke screen to protect the unloading transports. When aerial raiders appeared, her gunners shot down three. Rendova Island was soon in American possession. It served as an important motor torpedo boat base to harass Japanese barge lines and a base for air support in the Solomons. =Sinking= Gwin escorted a reinforcement echelon from Guadalcanal to Rendova, then raced to the \\"Slot\\" 7 July to rescue 87 survivors of cruiser , lost in the Battle of Kula Gulf. She then joined a cruiser‚Äìdestroyer task force under Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth to head off a formidable \\"Tokyo Express\\" force headed through the Solomon Islands to land troops at Vila. The Battle of Kolombangara was joined in the early hours of 13 July and Japanese light cruiser quickly slid to the bottom, the victim of smothering gunfire and torpedo hits. However, four Japanese destroyers, waiting for a calculated moment when Ainsworth's formation would turn, launched 31 torpedoes at the American formation. His flagship, , cruiser and Gwin, maneuvering to bring their main batteries to bear on the enemy, turned right into the path of the \\"long lance\\" torpedoes.Brown p. 16, 88, 209 Both cruisers received damaging hits but survived. Gwin received a torpedo hit amidships in her engine room and exploded. The destroyer took off Gwins crew after their damage control efforts failed and she had to be scuttled. Two officers and 59 men perished with the destroyer. Gwin received five battle stars for service in World War II  References  Bibliography *Brown, David. Warship Losses of World War Two.

She subsequently served in the Ochotnicza Legia Kobiet (Women's Voluntary Legion) of the Polish Armed Forces during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In the interwar period she became a reserve officer but faced discrimination and was stripped of her officer rank. She worked closely with Marshal Pi≈Çsudski and remained an activist in the cause of women in the military. With the outbreak of World War II her experience and skills in Special operations were ultimately recognised by military men and having joined the resistance in 1939 under codename, \\"Lena\\", she became an officer and commander of an all-female battalion in the Home Army. She was awarded the highest Polish military honours, a singular rarity for any woman of her generation to achieve.  Early life and background  She was born Wanda Gertz von Schliess in Warsaw, to Florentyna and Jan Gertz von Schliess. Her family originally came from Saxony, but had settled in the Commonwealth of Two Nations during the eighteenth century, while the House of Wettin occupied the Polish throne. Gertz's father fought in the January Uprising of 1863-64, and Gertz grew up hearing the stories of her father and his comrades. Years later she wrote: :As a five-year-old girl I had never had any dolls, only innumerable toy soldiers, which my older brother, his friends and I played with. Even then, I knew that high military rank was not for girls. My fondest dream was to become an officer. However, as a girl, I could only be a private. In 1913, Gertz completed the Kuzienkowa Gymnasium in Warsaw. She then trained in Bookkeeping with the Warsaw Chamber of Commerce. While still at school she had joined the 4th, Emilia Plater troop of the then illegal Girl Guides. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she joined the Konfederacja Polska (Polish confederation), a national independence lobby organization. Gertz distributed political leaflets and made clothes for prisoners of war. She then joined the 4th Warsaw Battalion, but in August 1915 after the Battalion had been absorbed into the 1st Brigade of the Polish Legion, women were prohibited from serving on the front line.  World War I  Having cut off her hair and dressed in men's clothing, Gertz presented herself at a recruitment office of the Polish Legion as, \\"Kazimierz Zuchowicz\\". All went well until the medical inspection. However, a sympathetic doctor promised to help, and she was assigned to serve as a medical orderly. After a few weeks \\"Kazik\\" was reassigned to an artillery unit, serving there for six months, and seeing action during the Brusilov Offensive. As she was a horse rider, she was able to serve in a signals platoon. After returning to Warsaw in 1917, following the Oath crisis, Gertz joined the women's branch of the clandestine Polish Military Organisation - Polska Organizacja Wojskowa. On 8 December 1917 during a demonstration in Saviour Square - (Plac Zbawiciela) in Warsaw, Gertz was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison, but having paid bail, she was released after a few weeks. Upon release she worked as a courier, and was involved in disarming German troops in November 1918. In December 1918 Poland finally gained its independence, and Gertz joined the People's Militia, and was assigned to the Armaments Section in March 1919.  Polish‚ÄìSoviet War  Women volunteer soldiers of the Polish Army in 1920. In April 1919, soon after the outbreak of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Gertz enlisted in the Polish Army and was assigned to the 1st Lithuanian‚ÄìBelarusian Division. In September 1919, she was appointed commander of the Ochotnicza Legia Kobiet - (2nd Women's Volunteer Legion) in Vilnius. The Women's Legions played an auxiliary role, usually engaged only in guard duties, but during the fighting for Vilnius, the 2nd Legion did see action at the front, helping to fight off the attacks of Hayk Bzhishkyan's Cavalry Corps. In the rank of lieutenant to which Gertz advanced in 1920, she was subsequently awarded the Virtuti Militari medal. At the end of the war in 1921, Gertz was demobilized and moved to the reserve forces. In 1922 her rank of lieutenant was \\"removed\\" from her on the grounds that there was no basis in law for a woman in the Polish armed forces to hold an officer rank. She worked for an engineering enterprise, Koncern Maszynowy S.A. from 1923, and after the May Coup of 1926, she became Chef de Cabinet in the office of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski who was then General Inspector of the Armed Forces. In 1928 Gertz became one of the first 13 members of the Przysposobienie Wojskowe Kobiet (Women's Military Training) where she served as an instructor. After Pi≈Çsudski's death in 1935, she co-founded the Belweder Museum, where she remained in a management role until September 1939. Her spare time was devoted to other military activities. In 1938 she became treasurer of the Federation of Polish Associations of the Defenders of the Homeland.  World War II  Soon after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Gertz was one of the first women to join the resistance movement, Service for Poland's Victory (S≈Çu≈ºba Zwyciƒôstwu Polski - SZP), operating under the code name \\"Lena\\". She organized clandestine communications, acted as courier, and was assistant to the divisional commander, Stanis≈Çaw Kozarski. In April 1942 Gertz was ordered to create and command a new unit Dywersja i Sabota≈º Kobiet - \\"oddzia≈Ç Dysk\\" (Women's Diversion and Sabotage unit), as part of the Kedyw. Its members carried out attacks on German military personnel, airfields, trains and bridges. Gertz seems to have been sceptical about the planned Warsaw Uprising, and prohibited members of her group from taking part, though many did so anyway. She was promoted to the rank of major in September 1944. Captured after the Uprising, still known as Major Kazik, Gertz was held as a prisoner- of-war and recognised by the Germans as commandant of 2,000 other female fighters who had survived. She passed through camps at O≈ºar√≥w, Lamsdorf and M√ºhlberg, and finally in late 1944 arrived at Molsdorf, all the while retaining command and respect among her fellow POWs. On 5 April 1945 the POWs of Molsdorf were marched to nearby Blankenhain before finally being liberated on 13 May 1945 by troops of the U.S. 89th Infantry Division.  Post-war life  Plaque commemorating Wanda Gertz at the Church of John the Baptist, Warsaw. As part of allied Polish forces in Germany under British command, Gertz arrived with them in the United Kingdom, returning to Europe after the German surrender to serve as Inspector for Women Home Army Soldiers. She travelled throughout Germany and Italy in search of displaced Polish women. From May 1946 until February 1949 she was part of the Polish Resettlement Corps, serving as Inspector of Women Soldiers in the north of England. Her task was to prepare them for civilian life in Britain. After demobilisation Gertz worked in a canteen until her death from cancer on 10 November 1958. Her funeral was attended by many veterans, including Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska, and Generals Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski and Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski. In 1960 her ashes were taken to Poland and interred at the PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

Meredith was laid down 1 June 1939 by Boston Naval Shipyard and launched 24 April 1940, sponsored by Miss Ethel Dixon Meredith. The ship was commissioned on 1 March 1941, Lieutenant Commander William F. Mendenhall, Jr., in command. Service history =Atlantic= Following shakedown in Cuban waters, Meredith returned to Boston on 8 June 1941 and was assigned to Destroyer Division 22. Departing Boston on 6 July, she engaged in patrol duty, exercises, and flight operations along the southern coast until 20 September. From 28 September to 31 January 1942, Meredith was based at Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, where she patrolled between Iceland and the Denmark Straits. On 17 October 1941, she rescued survivors of torpedoed British steamer Empire Wave. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Meredith engaged in escort and antisubmarine patrol between Iceland and the Denmark Straits, until she departed Halfjordur late in January, escorting a convoy to Boston. She sailed from Boston for Norfolk, Virginia on 18 February 1942, screening the battleship , and there joined the aircraft carrier in Task Force 18 (TF 18). =Pacific= The force left Norfolk 4 March on a mission as secret as it was important, passed through the Panama Canal, and reached San Diego on 21 March. Departing San Francisco on 2 April, the force rendezvoused with TF 16, 13 April and sailed for the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. On 18 April, the United States Army bombers were launched for this first carrier- based attack on Japan, and Meredith made course for Hawaii, arriving 25 April. Between 13 May and 21 June Meredith escorted fleet oilers bound for New Caledonia, patrolled off Bulari Passage and escorted , returning to Pearl Harbor. Following gunnery and tactical practice, Meredith departed Pearl Harbor on 15 August 1942 for Samoa, arriving Pago Pago 30 August. Meredith next escorted Transport Force 2 to the Solomon Islands with reinforcements landed on Guadalcanal 20 September, then sailed for patrol duty in the New Hebrides. Departing Espiritu Santo on 12 October 1942, Meredith, now commanded by Commander Harry E. Hubbard, was underway as part of a convoy with , , , , and , each pulling a barge carrying barrels of aviation gasoline and 500-pound bombs to the United States forces on Guadalcanal. Two days later it was learned that a Japanese carrier task force was in the vicinity and all ships except Meredith and Vireo turned back. Despite the fact that Meredith was equipped only with surface-search and not air-search radar, Commander Hubbard decided to press on to deliver the critically needed aviation gas. Meredith was sighted by a Japanese patrol plane on the morning of 15 October, and shortly after midday took aboard the 68-man crew of Vireo to depart the area at high speed. However, while preparing to torpedo Vireo to keep her out of Japanese hands, Meredith was attacked by a force of 38 bombers, torpedo planes, and escort fighters from . In the first three minutes of the attack, Meredith was struck by a bomb that exploded beneath her bridge, destroying all communications, steering control, and gun direction. A second bomb struck the forward port side, and a torpedo exploded below the ready ammunition locker, igniting the ship's pyrotechnics and setting fire to fuel oil leaking from her bunkers. Meredith fought fiercely, and brought down three of her attackers, but she was struck by an estimated 14 bombs and seven torpedoes. Meredith rolled over and sank in 10 minutes at . Of the crew of 273 on board that day, only eight officers and 73 enlisted men survived the attack and the three ensuing days of exposure to the open sea and sharks until they were rescued by , and .

Macdonald Parkway, formerly the Ottawa River Parkway, is a four-lane scenic parkway along the Ottawa River in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from Carling Avenue near Connaught Avenue, to Booth Street at the Canadian War Museum and National Holocaust Monument. It is maintained by the National Capital Commission. The speed limit is . Bicycles are allowed on the road and on a parallel recreational path along the parkway. Besides being a scenic route, it serves as a commuter artery for westend residents who work in the downtown area, particularly government employees who work at the Tunney's Pasture office complex, and other areas. It is also used by the transit systems of Ottawa and Gatineau for express buses. Route description The Parkway begins with on and off-ramps from Carling Avenue. The interchange is also the site of the Lincoln Fields Transitway station, with access driveways for OC Transpo buses. The Parkway proceeds north, passing under Richmond Road, then curving eastward along the Ottawa River. The Parkway follows the shore, with both directions separated by a grass median. The area along the river is mostly cleared of trees, allowing a view of the River and far shore line. The area to the south is partially forested, separating the roadway from residential areas to the south. Approximately 1 km from the start of the Parkway, is the Deschenes Rapids scenic lookout area. Driveways connect the two directions of the Parkway to the area, which has a small parking lot and picnic areas. The road meets Woodroffe Avenue a few hundred metres east. Northbound Woodroffe Avenue traffic joins the Parkway's eastbound lanes, while traffic from both directions of the Parkway are allowed onto southbound Woodroffe. The roadway continues east along the river shore until a signalized intersection with the OC Transpo Transitway. From this point east, the roadway is for the exclusive use of non-commercial vehicles and bicycles. The Parkway follows the river bank to the north, while the Transitway diverges east along an old railway right-of-way. The next landmark on the Parkway is Kitchissipi Lookout and Beach. The beach is also known as Westboro Beach. The Parkway passes over a pedestrian access walkway from the residential area to the east, with an intersection to the beach parking area. The beach is provided with a pavilion overlooking the River and the beach, which has changing rooms and a restaurant patio. Bike path beside the Parkway. The Parkway curves east and proceeds to a large intersection with Island Park Drive. Island Park connects north to Gatineau across a series of bridges and a park over the Ottawa River. The intersection's traffic lights are controlled to provide turning signals. Just east of the intersection is another park and lookout area, provided with driveways to a parking lot near the river. The Parkway continues east until a signalized intersection for access to the Tunney's Pasture campus of the federal government. An extra turning lane is provided to access the large parking lot of the campus. Further east, the Parkway passes over Parkdale Avenue, with on and off-ramps between Parkdale and the Parkway. A signalized intersection is provided to the east providing access to the Mechanicsville neighbourhood to the south, and Lemieux Island and its park and filtration station to the north, along an unnamed roadway. Access to and from the Parkway and this intersection is only allowed during off-peak hours. The Parkway continues east into the LeBreton Flats area. The Parkway ends at Vimy Place, which is the roadway to around Lebreton Flats to get to the Museum of War. East of Sir John A MacDonald Park, at Vimy Place, is the beginning of Wellington Street, which belongs to the City of Ottawa (ref: Geo Ottawa GIS Map) ;Use by buses It is closed to commercial traffic, so the majority of vehicles are private cars. From Lincoln Fields to Dominion stations, it shares traffic with the Transitway rapid-bus network, as well as STO buses from Gatineau (between Tunney's Pasture and the Champlain Bridge). ;Summer Sunday closures On Sundays during summer months (Victoria Day to Labour Day), the Parkway's westbound lanes are closed to motor vehicles and opened to pedestrian and bicycle traffic from 9 am until 1 pm. SJAM Winter Trail In 2016, the NCC approved a proposal to turn the parallel recreational path into a mixed use winter trail for cross country skiing, walking, snowshoeing and biking. The trail was an instant success and has since been expanded to cover a distance of 16 km stretching from the Canadian War Museum down to Westboro Beach. The winter trail is now in its fourth season and is jointly managed by the groomer (Dave Adams) and Dovercourt Recreation Centre. History The River Parkway was first proposed as part of Greber Plans for Ottawa in the 1940s. The parkway was built by purchasing former rail lands along the waterfront, and the purchase of private riverfront houses. The Parkway was designed as a scenic drive, with commercial vehicles prohibited. At the time of its construction, Carling Avenue was part of Ontario Highway 17, and the Parkway provided an alternative, scenic drive to the parliamentary precinct. When the Queensway freeway was constructed the River Parkway was not extended to the Queensway, and access from the Queensway is marked from the Richmond Road interchange. In the 1990s, the expansion of the bridge at Island Park was a major issue. The National Capital Commission proposed a fully grade-separated interchange to the River Parkway, with a major expansion in capacity of the bridge over the river. Organized opposition in Ottawa to the plans led to a reduced plan by the NCC. The bridge is three lanes, with the direction of the middle lane switched during different hours of the day. The NCC also built a signalized intersection at Tunney's Pasture at the time. The construction of the new Canada War Museum on Booth Street was done in conjunction with a re-routing of the section of the River Parkway in the area. The River Parkway's original route parallelled the river bank, bypassing the Lebreton Flats area, passing over Booth Street on an overpass, terminating at the Portage Bridge intersection. The War Museum now occupies the riverside location of the old Parkway. The new route connects from just south-west of the Portage Bridge intersection, along a route several hundred metres to the south, passing through Lebreton Flats and intersecting with area streets at signalized intersections. The intersection with Booth Street prohibits turns from Booth Street onto the River Parkway. In 2012, the Ottawa River Parkway was renamed to honour Canada's first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, MP for Ottawa West-Nepean announced the change on August 15, 2012. The renaming followed a grassroots campaign led by author and historian Bob Plamondon and Ottawa media personality Mark Sutcliffe. It was part of a process engaged in by the then government of Stephen Harper of renaming sites in the National Capital Region after prominent former members of the Conservative and Progressive Conservative parties of Canada. On Jan. 11, the former Wellington Street Bank of Montreal had been also renamed the Sir John A. Macdonald Building in January 2012. The name change was not without some controversy. In 2015, the NCC and the City of Ottawa reached an agreement to run the light rail under a reconstructed and realigned Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, from what will be Dominion to Clearly stations (East to West, roughly between present-day Churchill Avenue and Cleary Avenue).

After ten months patrolling and protecting convoys in the icy North Atlantic, Grayson was ordered to the Pacific to join an American fleet battered but resolutely carrying the war to the enemy. She sailed from San Diego on 2 April 1942 as part of aircraft carrier s escort and rendezvoused at sea 13 April with under Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. From this fast carrier force, steaming less than 800 miles from the Japanese home islands, General Jimmy Doolittle launched his B-25 raid, also known as the Doolittle raid on Tokyo on 18 April. The task group sailed into Pearl Harbor on 25 April. Grayson departed almost immediately for repairs in California, but soon returned to the Pacific war. =Guadalcanal= Grayson again found herself with a fast carrier force as she sailed from Pearl Harbor 15 July to escort Enterprise and Hornet. Reaching Guadalcanal via Tongatapu on 7 August 1942, the carriers launched their planes to cover Marine landings there, and then operated in the area to block Japanese reinforcements. As they maneuvered off Guadalcanal, Enterprise was hit by Japanese bombs on 24 August in an action-filled half- hour which saw Grayson down two planes and damage a third. The task group dispersed, Enterprise returning to Pearl Harbor for repairs, and Grayson joined Task Force 11 (TF 11), built around under Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. Action soon followed. Sighting a Japanese submarine on the surface the next day, 25 August, Grayson closed for the kill. After expending 46 depth charges ‚Äì her entire supply ‚Äì in a series of five attacks, the destroyer saw a huge air bubble and oil slick rise to the surface, indicating that they had sunk an Imperial submarine. The battle-proven ship and crew remained in the bitterly contested waters around Guadalcanal for nearly eight months in a variety of duties. Grayson convoyed troop transports loaded with reinforcements from Noum√©a and other staging areas to Guadalcanal, patrolled in \\"The Slot\\", served as a radar picket ship, and performed valuable rescue work. On 18 October she picked up 75 survivors from the destroyer , which had been sunk by aerial torpedo on 16 October, and helped escort the barge Vireo, loaded with needed fuel and ammunition, to Guadalcanal. =Kolombangara= Returning to Pearl Harbor 15 April 1943 for overhaul, Grayson continued on to the States for further repairs and finally sailed to New Caledonia, arriving 24 September. She accounted for at least four and possible two more Japanese barges loaded with evacuees from Kolombangara during three nights of action, 30 September ‚Äì 3 October, with DesRon 21 under Commander A. D. Chandler. After three months of patrol duty, Grayson sailed for Puget Sound Navy Yard 16 December for overhaul. =1944= Grayson soon returned to the Pacific, putting in at Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, 10 February 1944. Patrol duty in the Solomons, Carolines, and Marshalls occupied her the following six months. On 30 March Grayson supported initial assault landings on Pityilu Island, Admiralties, from 22 to 24 April she was fighter-director ship for the landings at Tanahmerah Bay, Dutch New Guinea. She bombarded Biak Island on 27 May and Noemfoor Island on 2 July prior to invasion landings. On 1 September 1944 Grayson joined TG 38, for carrier strikes against the enemy in the Palau Islands, scene of the next major invasion. She returned to Seeadler Harbor on 30 September. She again sailed 2 October for a major strike against Okinawa and the Philippines. Japanese planes harassed the withdrawal, and on 15 October Grayson rescued 194 men from the torpedoed light cruiser , who was towed safely to Ulithi. Prom Ulithi, Grayson sailed straight to Saipan, where on 3 November she took up radar picket and lifeguard duty. Finally Grayson was ordered home, reaching Seattle 9 June 1945 for her first real rest since the war began. =End of World War II and fate= Grayson returned to Pearl Harbor 1 September 1945, the day of the signing of the Articles of Surrender in Tokyo Bay. After brief training she sailed for the United States. transiting the Panama Canal 8 October, she put in at Charleston, South Carolina, 16 October. Eleven days later the battle-scarred \\"tin can\\" hosted over 5,000 visitors as a grateful and jubilant public paid tribute on Navy Day. Grayson remained at Charleston until decommissioned, 4 February 1947, and was placed in reserve. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1972 and sold 12 June 1974 and broken up for scrap. Grayson received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

Commissioned in 1941, the destroyer saw service during World War II in both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Monssen was sunk at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. Service history Monssen was laid down on 12 July 1939 by Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington and launched on 16 May 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Mons Monssen, widow of Lieutenant Monssen. The ship was commissioned on 14 March 1941, Lieutenant Commander Roland N. Smoot in command. Following shakedown and training, Monssen reported to the Atlantic Fleet on 27 June 1941 as a unit of Destroyer Division 22 (DesDiv 22). For the next five months she operated in the northwestern Atlantic, from the coast of New England and the Maritime Provinces to Iceland, on neutrality patrol. Her escort and patrol duties changed from neutral to belligerent 7 December 1941, continuing until 9 February 1942 when she entered the Boston Navy Yard for overhaul in preparation for her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. =Transfer to the Pacific= On 31 March Monssen arrived at San Francisco, joined Task Force 16 (TF 16), and departed 2 April. Steaming west, she was in the antisubmarine screen for the aircraft carrier as the carrier headed for Japan with Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle's B-25s on her flight deck. In the early morning hours of 18 April the force was sighted by the enemy and the air raid was launched to bomb their targets of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. Following the Doolittle Raid, the force returned to Pearl Harbor, from which it sortied 30 April to aid the carriers and in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Reaching the scene after the battle was over, the force returned to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 26 May. Two days later they departed again ‚Äî this time for Midway to repulse an expected assault on that advanced base. By 2 June, TF 16 had rendezvoused with Task Force 17 (TF 17) and was in position northeast of Midway. On 4 June the Battle of Midway commenced as Japanese aircraft flew against installations on the island. By 7 June, the American forces had won the battle, sinking four Japanese aircraft carriers and one cruiser at the cost of the destroyer and carrier Yorktown. =Solomon Islands campaign= After Midway the force remained at Pearl Harbor for a month before departing again for combat. Steaming via the Tonga Islands, they headed for the Japanese held Solomons. By 7 August they were from the targets, Guadalcanal and Tulagi. On 7‚Äì8 August, Monssen with stood off Gavutu and Tanambogo, circling those islands and providing fire support to units of the 2nd Marine Regiment as the U.S. Navy struck with the first of its giant amphibious assaults. She was then assigned to the screening forces guarding the eastern approaches to Sealark, Lengo, and Nggela Channels. She remained in the immediate area through the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, which prevented Japanese reinforcements from reaching Guadalcanal, and then took up duties patrolling the sea routes to Guadalcanal. At the end of the month the carrier was damaged and Monssen was one of the ships designated to escort her to the Tonga Islands. =Sinking at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal= Monssen returned to Guadalcanal 18 September to insure the integrity of an Allied supply line and to block Japanese efforts at resupply. On 8 November, she departed Noum√©a with two cruisers and two other destroyers as Task Group 67.4 (TG 67.4), under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan, as escort for transports carrying reinforcements to the Marines on Guadalcanal. At the same time, another convoy set out from Espiritu Santo, covered by one cruiser and four destroyers under Rear Admiral Norman Scott. Arriving off Lunga Point on 12 November, a day after those from Espiritu Santo they commenced unloading. By dusk as reports of Japanese ship movements from Truk increased, 90 percent of the transports had been unladen despite afternoon torpedo plane attacks, one of which had cost Monssen the use of her fire control radar. The transports were pulled out, escorted through Lengo Channel, and seen safely on their way to Espiritu Santo. Then Admiral Callaghan's force, heavily outnumbered even with the addition of Admiral Scott's ships, reversed course and steamed back to engage the enemy in the initial action of what would later be called the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Shortly, after 01:40, 13 November, they sighted the enemy fleet, under Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe, north of Kukum. The enemy was headed toward Henderson Field ‚Äî to bombard it and cripple Allied air operations long enough to sneak in 11 of their transports, then en route to relieve their beleaguered comrades fighting on the island. Battle was given at 01:50. At about 02:20 Monssen, forced to rely on radio information and optics, was spotlighted, hit by some 39 shells, including three of battleship caliber, and reduced to a burning hulk. Twenty minutes later, completely immobilized in all departments, the ship was ordered abandoned. After daybreak Monssen was still afire. C. C. Storey, BM2c, L. F. Sturgeon, GM2c, and J. G. Hughes F1c, climbed back into the inferno and rescued eight men still aboard and alive, five of whom lived after reaching land. The survivors, 40 percent of the crew, were picked up at about 08:00 and taken to Guadalcanal. The ship herself continued to blaze until early afternoon, when she sank. Monssen was awarded four battle stars for World War II service. Wreck discovery In 1992, an expedition headed by oceanographer Robert Ballard found the wreck of Monssen and other ships sunk during the Solomon Islands battles. The wreck lies upright on the bottom of the sound, with the gun turrets still trained out to the starboard side as they had been in combat.

The Temple of Dendur (Dendoor in nineteenth century sources) is an ancient Egyptian temple that was built by the Roman governor of Egypt, Petronius, around 15 BC, as one of many Egyptian temples commissioned by the emperor Augustus. It was dedicated to Isis and Osiris, as well as two deified sons of a local Nubian chieftain, Pediese (\\"he whom Isis has given\\") and Pihor (\\"he who belongs to Horus\\"). In the 1960s, the temple was removed from its original location and given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, USA, where it has been exhibited since 1978. Architecture and artwork 19th century graffiti The temple is constructed from sandstone and measures from the front stone gate to its rear as well as from its lowest to its highest point. A cult terrace overlooks the Nile. From the gate, two flanking walls ran around the temple and isolated the structure from the cult terrace and the Nile river. The temple is partly decorated with reliefs: the temple base is decorated with carvings of papyrus and lotus plants growing out of the water of the Nile, which is symbolized by depictions of the god Hapy. Over the temple gate as well as over the entrance to the temple proper, depictions of the Winged sun disk of the sky god Horus represent the sky. This motif is repeated by the vultures depicted on the ceiling of the entrance porch. On the outer walls, Emperor Augustus is depicted as a pharaoh making offerings to the deities Isis, Osiris, and their son Horus. The subject is repeated in the first room of the temple, where Augustus is shown praying and making offerings. Augustus is identified as \\"Caesar\\" (actually, \\"Qysrs\\", which is based on \\"Kaisaros\\", the Greek version of Caesar). He is also called \\"Autotrator\\", an alteration of autokrator, or autocrat, the Greek equivalent of imperator, one of the emperor's titles. This misspelling seems to be deliberate, in order to achieve more symmetry in the hieroglyphs. In some other parts of the temple, however, the emperor is simply called \\"Pharaoh\\". The middle room, which was used for offerings, and the sanctuary of Isis at the rear of the temple are undecorated but for reliefs on the door frame and backwall of the sanctuary. The latter shows Pihor and Pedesi as young gods worshiping Isis and Osiris respectively. The temple house is modest but well executed in design with two front columns, an offering hall and a sanctuary with a statue niche. A crypt was also built into the rear wall while a rock chamber in the nearby cliffs may have represented the tombs of Pediese and Pihor who were said to have drowned in the Nile river. In the 19th century, graffiti were left on the temple walls by visitors from Europe. One of the most prominent pieces of graffiti (\\"A L Corry RN 1817\\", at eye level to the left as one enters the temple) was left by the British naval officer and later Rear Admiral Armar Lowry Corry. Another inscription was left by the Italian Egyptologist Girolamo Segato. Relocation Henry Salt. The temple was dismantled and removed from its original location (modern name: Dendur, ancient name: Tuzis, about south of the town of Aswan) in 1963. This was accomplished as part of a wider UNESCO project,Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia World Heritage Committee, UNESCOThe Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites, UNESCO in order to save significant sites from being submerged by Lake Nasser, following construction of the Aswan High Dam. In recognition of the American assistance in saving various other monuments threatened by the dam's construction, Egypt presented the temple and its gate as a gift to the United States of America, represented by Jacqueline Kennedy among others, in 1965. The stone blocks of the temple weighed more than 800 tons in total with the largest pieces weighing more than 6.5 tons. They were packed in 661 crates and transported to the United States by the freighter m/v Concordia Star. In the United States, several institutions made bids for housing the temple, in a competition that was nicknamed the \\"Dendur Derby\\" by the press. Alternative plans proposed re-erecting the temple on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. or on the Charles River in Boston. However, these suggestions were dismissed because it was feared that the temple's sandstone would suffer from the outdoor conditions. On April 27, 1967, the temple was awarded to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it was installed in the Sackler Wing in 1978. Inside the Sackler Wing, designed by the architects Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo, and associates, a reflecting pool in front of the temple and a sloping wall behind it represent the Nile and the cliffs of the original location. The glass on the ceiling and north wall of the Sackler is stippled in order to diffuse the light and mimic the lighting in Nubia.

Massey (born April 5, 1938) is an American educator, physicist, and executive. He is president emeritus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) since 2018 and previously served as its president beginning in 2010 and chancellor in 2016. He is also chairman of the board overseeing construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope, and serves as trustee chair of the City Colleges of Chicago. Massey's career had earlier seen him serve for over 10 years as president of Morehouse College. He is also a former head of the National Science Foundation, laboratory director of Argonne National Laboratory, and chairman of Bank of America. He has served in professorial and administrative posts at the University of California, University of Chicago, Brown University, and the University of Illinois. Massey is the only individual to serve as both President and Chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and as Chair of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD). Additionally, Massey is the only individual to have received both the Enrico Fermi Award for Science and Technology from the Chicago Historical Society and the Public Humanities Award from Illinois Humanities. Early life and education Born on April 5, 1938 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Massey displayed a gift for mathematics as a child, and by the middle of high school his academic achievements had earned him a Ford Foundation fellowship to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. There, he began studying theoretical physics, which he chose in part because it gave him the chance to rise above the discrimination he had witnessed as a youth in the segregated South of the 1940s and 1950s. Massey graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1958. Mentors played an important role in Massey's academic life. Initially, he lacked direction at Morehouse until receiving the guidance of Sabinus H. Christensen, a white physics instructor teaching at the traditionally black college for men. Christensen's tutorials and support helped Massey earn a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. Later, he continued his studies in physics under Eugene Feenberg as a doctoral student at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. While finishing his doctoral studies, Massey began working in 1966 as a member of the research staff at Argonne National Laboratory, which is operated for the U.S. Department of Energy by the University of Chicago. Massey's work at Argonne focused on the study of the many-body theory of liquids and solids, which attempts to explain the properties of systems of interacting particles in various states. He also continued his own research, applying correlated basic functions to both liquid and solid helium. Two years later, Massey accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Illinois.  Career  =Academics and early advocacy= While continuing to pursue his own research, Massey's tenure at the University of Illinois was also defined by his commitment to achieving racial and social equality as well as to improving access to science and technology education. On his first night on campus, 264 black students who had protested racial discrimination at the university were arrested. This incident led him to become advisor to the Black Students Association and first chairman of the Black Faculty and Staff Association. In his teaching, meanwhile, Massey found that many of his black students lacked the preparation in mathematics and the sciences necessary for success at the college level. This led to his interest in and commitment to the improvement of science teaching in high schools. In 1970, Massey was offered an associate professorship at Brown University, which he accepted and would soon after complete some of his most significant academic research to date, collaborating with Humphrey Maris on the study of changes in sound waves in superfluid helium. By 1975, he had been appointed a full professor and dean of the college. Also at Brown, Massey continued his efforts to support diversity in the sciences, developing and directing the Inner City Teachers of Science (INCTOS) program, through which Brown undergraduates studying to become science teachers served as mentors and tutors in urban high school science classes. The impact of this program earned Massey the distinguished service citation of the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1975. In 1979, Massey's demonstrated success as a researcher and administrator at Brown led to his return to Argonne National Laboratory, this time as its director, in addition to which he was also appointed professor of physics at the University of Chicago. =Argonne National Laboratory= At Argonne, Massey assumed control of an annual budget of more than $250 million and a staff of almost four thousand. But he also assumed control of a nebulous public relations image. National laboratories at the time were highly suspect: their work was not being translated to industry. To the outside world, the laboratories lacked clear missions; on the inside, scientists and technicians lacked morale. To address these issues, Massey reorganized the governance of the laboratory in the early 1980s, instituting what D. Allen Bromley, President George H.W. Bush's assistant for science and technology, referred to as \\"participatory democracy\\" among its scientists. At the same time, Massey responded to the lack of outside connections by helping form the Argonne National Laboratory-University of Chicago Development Corporation (ARCH), an organization that expedited the transfer of technologies created in the laboratory to industry and the marketplace. Other initiatives Massey undertook at Argonne include generating support for its nuclear energy programs in a time of drastic cutbacks and providing support and leadership for the funding of major research facilities at the laboratory, including the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS), the Experimental Breeder Reactor 2 (EBR2), and the initial funding for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) While at Argonne and the University of Chicago, Massey also continued his work as an advocate on behalf of science education and awareness. In 1982, he headed the Chicago Mayoral Task Force on High-Technology Development and was the founding chair of the Chicago High-Tech Association. He also served on the Illinois Governor's Commission on Science and Technology and was highly visible on two educational fronts, helping to organize the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, one of the nation's first residential high schools devoted to science and math education, and serving as a trustee for the Academy for Mathematics and Science Teachers, which trained almost 17,000 Chicago public school teachers in those fields. =National Science Foundation= In 1989, Massey served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Massey's efforts to forge a more productive relationship between the scientific community, the U.S. government, and private industry culminated in 1990 with his appointment as director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) under President George H. W. Bush. In this role, Massey embarked on a number of critical initiatives, including efforts to deepen the connection between academia and industry and the establishment of the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and the Commission on the Future of NSF. He also remained a strong proponent of basic research and science education, focusing on providing grants to university research centers and individuals and on upgrading pre-college science education, with an emphasis on attracting more women and minority groups to careers in science. In February 2016, it was announced that scientists at the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave Observatory (LIGO) had observed gravitational waves for the first time ever, confirming Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity. Dr. France Cordova, current director of the NSF, credited Massey's role in securing both approval and funding for the project nearly 25 years before. Massey was honored by LIGO scientist Kip Thorne, with an invitation to the Nobel Prize in Physics ceremony. =Other domestic and international science policy= In concert with his roles at Argonne and the University of Chicago, in 1987 Massey was named president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, after having served as a board member for a number of years. As president, he led an organization listing over 140,000 members and 285 scientific societies. In this position, Massey‚Äîthe first African American ever to hold that post‚Äîwas able to shine a light on the problems of science education on a national level. Under Massey's leadership, the AAAS aimed to improve science education in grades K- 12 by sponsoring Project 2061, which attempted to structure curricula that would emphasize major scientific concepts. In doing so, Massey and the AAAS hoped to address the loss of the United States' economic competitiveness in the world market beginning in the mid-1980s and to better prepare the nation to respond to the health and environmental crises that were afflicting the world at the time. Generally, Massey's aim at the AAAS was to instigate a shift in the national dialogue, in which science and technology had historically been emphasized only ever during times of war. In addition to his experience at the AAAS, Massey has been involved as a member or chair of many other major scientific organizations, societies, and commissions. He was vice president of the American Physical Society; chair of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB); and a member of the President's Council of Advisors of Science and Technology (PCAST) in two presidential administrations. Massey has also served as a member of the National Science Board, as well as on the Board of Trustees of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and the Marine Biological Laboratory. Massey's service to the scientific community extends beyond domestic borders and is global in scope. He has served on the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee for International Programs; was a member of the President's Advisory Board for the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; co-chaired the planning efforts on cooperative programs between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the AAAS; co-chaired the AAAS project to strengthen Scientific and Technical Engineering Infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa; and was a founding member of the African Academy of Sciences, an organization designed to promote the advancement of scientific research and science education in sub-Saharan Africa. Massey was also founding chairman of the National Society of Black Physicists, an organization established to promote the professional development of black physicists and enhance the number of African Americans entering the field of physics, and an advisor for the formation of the Society of Black Physics Graduate Students =Return to academia= Following the completion of his tenure at the NSF, in 1993 Massey became provost and vice president for academic affairs at the University of California system, the nation's largest and perhaps most prestigious. In this role, he held the number two position in the state's university system, overseeing academic concerns at all of its nine campuses and its three national laboratories: Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos. In 1995, he assumed the presidency of his alma mater, Morehouse College. As president of Morehouse, Massey created a vision that would take the college into the new century, which involved reinvigorating its campus, refreshing its core curriculum, and reigniting its fundraising efforts. Massey retired from Morehouse in 2007. From 2007 to 2010, he chaired the board for the Salzburg Global Seminar. In 2010, Massey entered a new phase of his career, accepting the role of interim president, and later as full president, of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a leading school of art and design. He also served a term as chair of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design. In 2016, Massey transitioned to his new role as chancellor of SAIC. Later that year, he also accepted the appointment to chair the board of the organization building the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. In 2017, Massey was named to chair the board of trustees of the City Colleges of Chicago. =Business, civic, and philanthropic career= In addition to his work as a scientist, college president, and leader in national and international science policy, Massey has served on the boards of several major multinational corporations, including McDonald's, where he remains a director, and, previously, Bank of America, where he rose to Chairman, BP, Tribune Company, Motorola, First National Bank of Chicago, Continental Materials, Amoco, Research-Cottrell, and Analytic Services. In 2009, he headed Bank of America, as its Chairman of the Board. He has also served on the boards of numerous philanthropic organizations and foundations in the civic, social, cultural, and educational spaces, including the Mellon Foundation, the Commonwealth Fund, the MacArthur Foundation, the Rand Corporation, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and many others. Awards and honors Massey has received forty-one honorary degrees during his career. He is a recipient of the Distinguished Service Citation of the American Association of Physics Teachers for his exceptional contributions to the teaching of physics, and was a member of the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st century, a commission established by Senator Glenn to recommend methods for improving science and math teaching in the United States. In 1987, Massey was awarded the Order of Lincoln the State of Illinois' highest honor. In 1999, the Georgia State Senate passed resolution SR 113 \\"recognizing and commending Dr. Walter E. Massey, President of Morehouse College.\\" In May 2016, Massey received Illinois Humanities' Public Humanities Award, which \\"recognizes individuals and organizations that have helped transform lives and have strengthened communities through the humanities.\\" In 2012, he received the Chicago Historical Society, Making History‚ÄìEnrico Fermi Award in science and technology.

New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Retrieved on July 11, 2007. To meet escalating water needs, the Aqueduct Commission of the City of New York ordered construction of a new Croton system in 1885. Hydro engineer James B. Francis was brought in as a consultant for the construction. The proposed dam and reservoir were to cover of land occupied by public and private buildings, six cemeteries, and more than 400 farms. Condemnation disputes led to \\"protests, lawsuits, and confusion\\" before payment of claims and the awarding of construction contracts. The work force on the new dam included stonemasons and laborers who had worked on the original dam. John B. Goldsborough, superintendent of excavations and hiring for the project, also recruited stonemasons from southern Italy, who re-located to New York. =Construction= Construction began in 1892 and was completed in 1906. Building the dam meant diverting the river from its normal path and pumping the riverbed dry. To accomplish this, workers dug a crescent-shaped canal long and wide in the hill on the north side of the river, secured the canal with a masonry retaining wall, and built temporary dams to control the water flow. The initial construction lasted eight years, and extensive modifications and repairs went on for another six. Working conditions were often difficult. A silent film, The Croton Dam Strike, released in 1900, depicted labor- management problems related to the dam's construction.

He played 13 seasons in the NFL, and was considered one of the best long snappers while he was playing. He played for the Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots and Eagles. He retired in 2007 after suffering a neck injury in a 2006 game. Early life Bartrum attended Meigs High School in Pomeroy, Ohio and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he passed for 1,900 yards and 24 touchdowns during his junior and senior seasons. College career Bartrum played college football at Marshall University intending to play quarterback, and that lasted all of one practice in August 1988. Bartrum was moved to tight end and was a redshirt in 1988, then backed up All-American Eric Ihnat in 1989. A knee injury in the spring game knocked him out of the 1990 season, but he returned to top form for his junior and senior seasons. In 1991 and 1992, he hauled in 109 receptions and 10 touchdowns, third among tight ends all-time for the Thundering Herd. His senior year, he played on Marshall's first Division I-AA championship team that won a then school record 12 games. Bartrum caught a touchdown pass to open the scoring in the 1992 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game, a 31‚Äì28 win over Youngstown State, the team that had defeated Marshall in the prior season's title game. Bartrum was All-Southern Conference second team TE in 1991 and first team All-SEC in 1992 as well as second team All-American on The Sports Network team that same season. It was his tight end coach, Mark Gale, at Marshall who taught him how to play long snapper, giving him his route to the National Football League. In 2007, Bartrum was elected to the Marshall University Hall of Fame for his collegiate career in football and baseball. Professional career Bartrum saw minimal playing time in his early career and taught special education when he was not playing. Between the Kansas City Chiefs (1993) and the Green Bay Packers (1995) Bartrum only saw action in a total of seven games with no receptions. From 1996-1999, he was a regular long snapper with the New England Patriots playing 57 games with two receptions, both of which were touchdowns. He played in Super Bowl XXXI with the Pats in the loss to the Green Bay Packers and teamed with former Marshall teammate Troy Brown for the four years in New England. Signing with the Eagles in 2000, he took over as the long snapper and tight end. He caught nine passes, four of which went for touchdowns. In 2004, Bartrum handled the long snapper duties in his second Super Bowl appearance when the Eagles lost to the New England Patriots 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX played on February 6, 2005. In 2005, he handled kickoff duties in two games due to an injury to David Akers. His play earned him a selection to the Pro Bowl after the 2005 season. In 2006, Bartrum was the emergency quarterback after an injury to Donovan McNabb. Bartrum has six career touchdowns in 11 receptions. Only Mike Vrabel has a higher percentage of catches for touchdowns, with eight career catches which were all for touchdowns. Due to injuries to his spine in 2006, Bartrum retired in the spring of 2007. He and Brown sponsor a long-running camp at Marshall University for children, and the proceeds of the camp, auction and golf outing weekend have been split between their alma mater and Huntington and Meigs- Pomeroy youth groups for over a decade. In 2007, he was honored on Alumni Weekend at Marshall University as the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year. After a defeat to the Colts in November 2006, Bartrum complained of extreme pain in his neck. Testing revealed that Bartrum had an \\"incidental finding of a small chip on one of the bodies of his vertebrae.\\" An MRI showed some bulging in one disc as well as a disc which was \\"herniated centrally and is lying against his spinal cord.\\" The Eagles placed Bartrum on injured reserve for the remainder of the season, and Jon Dorenbos took over long snapper duties for the Eagles for the remainder of the season. Bartrum remained a member of the Eagles until June 2007, when he announced his retirement from football. Coaching career On February 8, 2019, the Philadelphia Eagles announced Bartrum as the Eagles' assistant tight ends coach. Personal After retiring from his playing career, Bartrum returned to his home town of Pomeroy, Ohio, and started a Christian-based preschool. He also started flag football for the youth of the area and in November 2008 he was elected Meigs County Commissioner. In April 2012, Bartrum was named head football coach of his alma mater, Meigs High School.

The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft that takes part in a variety of missions in West Germany during a hypothetical limited conventional attack by the Warsaw Pact. A-10 boasted one of the most detailed flight models of any game of its era, a physics model that extended to solid-body interactions with the ground and complete aerodynamics for every object in the game, including ordnance. Macworld rated it \\"Best Flight Simulator\\" in a review of Mac simulations.\\"Best Flight Simulator: At-10 Attack\\", Macworld, 1996 The game was followed by a sequel named A-10 Cuba!, originally as a stand-alone game on the Mac and Windows- based PC's, but later re-released on the Mac as a plug-in module for the original game. The Mac OS versions were produced by Parsoft, while the PC version of Cuba was a joint production with Activision. This partnership was renewed for Parsoft's final release, Fighter Squadron: The Screamin' Demons Over Europe. History Development of what would evolve into A-10 Attack! started after the release of Hellcats: Missions at Leyte Gulf, an expansion pack for Hellcats Over the Pacific that was released in 1992. Although Hellcats managed to do a lot with limited capabilities of the hardware, the game had a number of obvious drawbacks. For one, the missions were written in computer code as part of the game engine, which meant the user could not add new missions or modify the existing ones. Another problem was that the vehicles and other objects in the game were hard-coded with various behaviors, which likewise made them difficult to customize. Even the game map itself existed only in the code. Parsoft started experimenting with a plug-in system to replace the hard-coded objects in Hellcats. Known as the Virtual Battlefield Environment (VBE), the system still required programming tools to build out the objects, but once they were completed they could be loaded into the game engine from individual files. Adding these into a game simply required the files to be placed in the appropriate directories in the user's file system. VBE allowed anything to be added in this fashion; aircraft, vehicles, missions, and maps. Another problem with Hellcats was its very basic physics, which simulated only the most basic flight dynamics and resulted in flight that was unrealistic in a number of ways. There were no structural limits either, allowing a number of unrealistic extremely high-g maneuvers. A completely new flight engine was created for the VBE system that simulated subsonic aerodynamics with a fair degree of realism, with effects like dutch roll and adverse yaw \\"falling out\\" of the engine without being deliberately coded in. Additionally the system included a new physics engine that featured simple finite element analysis that allowed damage to be realistically simulated, including its effects on the flight dynamics of the aircraft. The resulting simulation was arguably the most advanced of its era. All of this was combined with an improved version of the graphics engine developed for Hellcats, allowing players to use multiple monitors and any resolution their machine could support. Hellcats used a polygon-based flat-shaded system that used differential updating to avoid bottlenecks in the computer bus and thereby improve frame rates. A-10 retained the basics from Hellcats, but added the ability for small areas of texture mapping to be applied, which was used on the vehicles to add roundels and squadron markings. A combination of improved code in the engine and the rapid improvement in computer performance since the release of Hellcats allowed the new engine to feature greatly increased scene complexity. Early versions of the game were shown at MacWorld Boston in the summer of 1993. At the time the physics and graphics engines were operational, although there was no \\"game\\" per-se. The world consisted of a single-runway airbase and a nearby target range with several \\"bullseye\\" targets. This was followed some time later by a fairly functional demo version, which took place on a mythical island with a number of friendly and enemy objects in the area. For the release version, a series of missions in northern Germany were created, along with a new mission-planning map system that was widely lauded. As the game was being finalized for release, Apple introduced the new PowerMac systems. Running in the 68k emulator the game proved to be very slow, so a delay followed while they wrote a PowerPC \\"native\\" version, and the game was finally delivered in 1995, a full three years after starting development and about a year later than promised. Although it was claimed the VBE could allow any sort of customization of the engine, documentation and tools for VBE was never released, so users could not create their own modules and the power of this system was never fully explored. A-10 Cuba! followed, although at first it did not use VBE and was shipped in the form of a stand-alone application. It was only later that Cuba was re-released to run as a \\"real\\" VBE module in the original shell. The specifications were never released to 3rd parties, and the few public comments on the topic from Parsoft claimed it was simply not ready and required work to clean it up and document it. By 1997 Parsoft had already moved onto a new project, and it was clear that VBE had been abandoned. Description Gameplay in A-10 Attack! switched between a mission map and planning system displayed on a 2D map, and the in-game flying. The switch between the two modes could be made at any time during a game, with the plane turning on the autopilot and following the mission outline when the user was in the map mode. Flight mode was relatively similar to most flight simulators, although control was normally via mouse or a joystick mapped onto the mouse. The \\"2\\" view looked down into the cockpit, showing all the instruments in a layout fairly faithful to the actual layout in the A-10. The mechanical cockpit controls and various displays, including the HUD, were all likewise fairly good simulations of the original. The \\"into the cockpit\\" view displayed an instrument panel that was closely modelled on the real A-10. When holding a hot-key, the user could interact directly with the controls and switches. The game included a unique \\"active hand\\" system that allowed the player to manipulate the switches and controls without having to remember keyboard commands. Holding down the option key turned off mouse control of the aircraft, and made a hand-cursor appear that could operate the controls by clicking on them. The cursor changed as it moved over the controls to indicate what could be done, clicking, rotating or \\"rolling\\" the mechanical controls. Even complex weapons release modes could be controlled in this way, although doing so often required a series of clicks on different controls. Weapons included a variety of conventional bombs and their laser-guided counterparts, as well as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and HARM missiles, cluster bombs and rockets. However the cannon remained one of the most important weapons in the game (because the A-10 was built around the GAU-8A gatling gun). Even without completing the missions, the game engine itself was detailed enough to create a sub-game in which users attempted to place their Hogs in odd positions on the map, or use the engine for various other tricks. The in-game mission map and planner, showing the starting state of the Retaliation mission. Clicking the small triangles on the chits displayed a menu allowing the user to interact with those \\"targets\\". In the map mode any object in the game that was close enough to have become visible to an allied object appeared as a \\"chit\\" on the display. Using controls on the chits the user could move their point of view to those objects, and see what they were doing. At the start of a mission only friendly or nearby neutral chits would be seen, but as the player flew into the mission, more would become visible as they (or other allied forces) approached them. Additionally, the user could display and control the waypoints for the aircraft in the mission through a dialog-box based editor, customizing their flight plans. Games would typically have the player switch back and forth between flight and the mission map, looking at their progress and perhaps newly spotted targets that were not immediately obvious from the cockpit. The selection of missions included with the game generally increased in difficulty with an increasing number of targets and friendly vehicles. They covered a series of events after a fictional invasion of West Germany by limited Warsaw Pact forces, with the map covering the western Baltic area with Denmark in the upper left. Like Hellcats, the A-10 mission system in VBE allowed the missions to be custom programmed, and some of them included such events as an attempted bombing of a dam. However, as in Hellcats, A-10 did not allow the user to create their own missions.

He founded D. E. Shaw & Co., a hedge fund company which was once described by Fortune magazine as \\"the most intriguing and mysterious force on Wall Street\\". A former assistant professor in the computer science department at Columbia University, Shaw made his fortune exploiting inefficiencies in financial markets with the help of state-of-the- art high speed computer networks. In 1996, Fortune magazine referred to him as \\"King Quant\\" because of his firm's pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. In 2001, Shaw turned to full-time scientific research in computational biochemistry, more specifically molecular dynamics simulations of proteins. Early life and education Shaw was raised in Los Angeles, California. His father was a theoretical physicist who specialised in plasma and fluid flows, and his mother is an artist and educator. They divorced when he was 12. His stepfather, Irving Pfeffer, was professor of finance at UCLA, and the author of papers supporting the efficient market hypothesis. Shaw earned a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego, a PhD from Stanford University in 1980, and then became an assistant professor of the department of computer science at Columbia University. While at Columbia, Shaw conducted research in massively parallel computing with the NON-VON supercomputer. This supercomputer was composed of processing elements in a tree structure meant to be used for fast relational database searches. Earlier in his career, he founded Stanford Systems Corporation. Investment career In 1986, he joined Morgan Stanley, as vice president for technology in Nunzio Tartaglia's automated proprietary trading group. In 1994, Shaw was appointed by President Clinton to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, where he was chairman of the Panel on Educational Technology. In 2000, he was elected to the board of directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science served as its treasurer 2000‚Äì2010. In 2007, Shaw was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was appointed by President Obama again to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. In 2012, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and in 2014 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. =D. E. Shaw= In 1988 he started his own hedge fund, D. E.

His work was in the Renaissance tradition, contrasting with the modernist style that prevailed in his time. Life Born in Milan in 1910, Annigoni was influenced by the Italian Renaissance. From the end of the 1920s on, he lived mainly in Florence where he studied at the College of the Piarist Fathers. In 1927, he was admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, where he attended the courses given by Felice Carena in painting, Giuseppe Graziosi in sculpture, and Celestino Celestini in etching. Annigoni enrolled in the nude class run by the Florentine Circolo degli Artisti, while attending the open class in the same subject at the Academy. Annigoni exhibited his work for the first time in Florence in 1930 with a group of painters. He had his first individual exhibition two years later, in 1932 at the Bellini Gallery in the Palazzo Ferroni. In 1932, journalist Ugo Ojetti featured Annigoni in the Arts section of the Corriere della Sera. Also in 1932, he won the Trentacoste prize. =Family= Annigoni was married to Anna Giuseppa Maggini in 1937 until her death of illness in July 1969. They had two children, Benedetto (1939) and Maria Ricciarda. In 1976 he married Rosella Segreto, also a favorite model of the artist. =Death= In May 1988, Annigoni had emergency surgery due to a perforated ulcer, and he did not recover fully from the ailment. He was rushed to the hospital in Florence on October 27, 1988, and died of kidney failure on October 28, 1988. He is buried in the Porte Sante (Holy Doors) cemetery at the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte, overlooking his beloved Florence. Controversy in tradition Between 1945 and 1950, Annigoni produced a succession of important and very successful works. In 1947, he signed the manifesto of Modern Realist Painters. In this manifesto the group, which consisted of seven painters, came out in open opposition to abstract art and the various movements that had sprung up in Italy in these years. It was an insignificant detail in the painter's life but it would become a key point of reference in literature about him. Among others who signed the petition were Gregory Sciltian, and brothers Antonio and Xavier Bueno. In March 1949, the Committee of the Royal Academy in England accepted the works Annigoni offered for its annual exhibition. It was the artist's first experience with England and the beginning of a success which was to acquire worldwide dimensions.Annigoni: Italy's Most Misunderstood Artist 2009-26-11 Art exhibitions Annigoni started showing his work internationally in the 1950s. In London, they were held at Wildenstein's (1950 and 1954), Agnew's (1952 and 1956), the Federation of British Artists (1961), the Upper Grosvenor Galleries (1966), and at many Royal Academy exhibitions. A special exhibition in Paris, France at the Galerie Beaux Arts was held in 1953. New York Wildenstein's showed Annigoni from 1957‚Äì58. By 1969, Annigoni's work was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. Numerous Italian cities that showed Annigoni works during his life included Turin, Rome, Florence, Verona, Brescia, Montecatini Terme, Pisa, Bergamo, Rovereto and Milan.Pietro Annigoni Cronologia Chronology Annigoni Works and Exhibitions Evaluation His work bore the influence of Italian Renaissance portraiture, and was in contrast to the modernist and post-modernist artistic styles that dominated the middle- and late-twentieth century. Annigoni painted two portraits of Queen Elizabeth II, in 1955 and 1969. The earlier one was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and is displayed at their livery hall, Fishmongers' Hall; the 1969 portrait was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery and is on public display there. Following his portrait of the Queen, Annigoni became sought after and painted portraits of Pope John XXIII, US Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the Shah and Empress of Iran, Princess MargaretPietro Annigoni: Princess Margaret National portrait gallery and several other members of the British royal family. Annigoni was chosen by TIME magazine to paint President John F. Kennedy for the (January 5) 1962 Person of the Year cover. The result was perhaps his least-liked portrait as Annigoni had no time or inclination to satisfy Time magazine. Other TIME magazine covers that featured portraits by Annigoni were the issues of October 5, 1962 (Pope John XXIII), November 1, 1963 (Ludwig Erhard), April 12, 1968 (Lyndon B. Johnson), and April 30 1965 (British Prime Minister Harold Wilson). Other subjects around the world that Annigoni painted include HRH Prince Philip and several other members of the House of Windsor as well as the shoemaker Salvatore Ferragamo, Florentine author Luigi Ugolini, ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn, British actress Julie Andrews, Russian ballet star Rudolf Nureyev, and the Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur. An outspoken artist, Annigoni wrote essays challenging modern art that disregarded the basic ability to draw. He alienated critics, who claimed his art was too representational, discounting the unique dramatic signature the artist brought to Renaissance tradition.Pietro Annigoni, Italy's greatest misunderstood artist by Brenda Dionisi; (issue no. 99/2009 / April 9, 2009) Church frescoes Vittorio Miele (left) and Pietro Annigoni (right), in Monte Cassino Annigoni was active painting church frescoes in and around Florence.Annigoni: The Basilica of St. Anthony Frescoes During 1980‚Äì1985 (starting at the age of 70 years) at Monte Cassino monastery, he completed his largest fresco, the dome of the monastery.

It was passed by the dictator Quintus Hortensius in a compromise to bring the plebeians back from their secession to the Janiculum. It was the final result of the long struggle between patricians and plebeians, where the plebeians would periodically secede from the city in protest (secessio plebis) when they felt they were deprived of their rights. The law contained similar stipulations of the two earlier laws, the lex Valeria-Horatia of 449 BC and lex Publilia of 339 BC. Unlike the prior two laws, however, lex Hortensia eliminated the requirement that the Senate ratify, in the case of the lex Valeria-Horatia, or give its prior approval to, in the case of the lex Publilia, plebiscites before becoming binding on all citizens. Its passage secured the end of the Conflict of the Orders, and secured theoretically equal political rights between patricians and plebeians. Causes In the annalistic tradition, around the year 287 BC, a plebeian dictator by the name of Hortensius was appointed to handle a civil uprising that eventually led to the secession of the plebs to the Jaculinum hill; only after the passage of the lex Hortensia in the Centuriate Assembly, or comitia centuriata, did the plebs return to the city. The annals attribute the cause of the uprising to debt problems, with the proximate cause being the call to arms to fight against the Lucanians, giving the plebeians more leverage in depriving the patricians of needed manpower in the war. However, there is considerable reason to doubt this story, which Livy attributes to urban rabble in the forum, as large masses of urban poor did not really exist in the middle Republic. Furthermore, rural landowners controlled the vast majority of the votes in the Plebeian Council (), as they controlled 29 of the voting blocs that never numbered more than 35, since the Council was organised in the same way as the Tribal Assembly (), just with the exclusion of patricians. The more likely cause is therefore the desire of rural plebeians to control the distribution of public lands () won in the Third Samnite War. Due to the extreme measures taken by the consuls, however, it is likely that considerable urban unrest predicated this reform. With both the urban and the rural sections of the populace clamouring for reform and the military necessities of manpower granting the plebs a strong negotiating position, the law entered the realm of the inevitable. Of course, necessary to pass such specific and controlling legislation was an organised movement, likely coordinated by the plebeian tribunes in the city. Provisions The lex Hortensia was a step in a series of reforms that secured political freedom for the plebs. In the early Republic, before the start of reforms, laws passed by the Plebeian Council applied not to all Romans, but only to plebeians, because only plebeians could vote in the council. But after the lex Valeria-Horatia in 449 BC, plebiscites could become binding to all Romans, and not just plebeians, if they were ratified by the Senate. However, after the passage of lex Pubilia, the ratification of laws was moved to before the passage of the bill in the concilium plebis, which apparently reduced the chance of senatorial obstruction. Furthermore, the law created restrictions on when votes could be scheduled. For example, votes could no longer be held on market days, which could have interfered in economic business. However, this served as an impediment towards the participation of rural plebeians in the concilium plebis, as they were then unable to vote on convenient days when they would have been in the city. As a question of legal semantics, there remained a difference between a plebiscitum, a plebeian law, and a lex, a law per se. The lex Hortensia simply changed the recognition of the plebiscitum such that it was treated as if it were a lex. Later, as the distinction became immaterial, all binding laws, formerly leges or plebiscita, became referred to leges as well. Legacy The passage of the Hortensian law ended a significant chapter in the Conflict of the Orders, a centuries long political conflict between the plebs and the patricians. It also cemented the pre-eminence of the Tribal Assembly and the Plebeian Council in legislation, with primarily minor and procedural laws passed in the late Republic. The law cemented the authority of the Roman people, making plebeians and their tribunes important political players, which previous laws had failed to do.

GCP follows the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), and enforces tight guidelines on ethical aspects of clinical research. High standards are required in terms of comprehensive documentation for the clinical protocol, record keeping, training, and facilities, including computers and software. Quality assurance and inspections ensure that these standards are achieved. GCP aims to ensure that the studies are scientifically authentic and that the clinical properties of the investigational product are properly documented. GCP guidelines include protection of human rights for the subjects and volunteers in a clinical trial. It also provides assurance of the safety and efficacy of the newly developed compounds. GCP guidelines include standards on how clinical trials should be conducted, define the roles and responsibilities of institutional review boards, clinical research investigators, clinical trial sponsors, and monitors. In the pharmaceutical industry monitors are often called clinical research associates. A series of unsuccessful and ineffective clinical trials in the past were the main reason for the creation of ICH and GCP guidelines in the US and Europe. These discussions ultimately led to the development of certain regulations and guidelines, which evolved into the code of practice for international consistency of quality research. Legal and regulatory status * European Union: In the EU, Good Clinical Practice (Directive 2001/20/EC) is backed and regulated by formal legislation contained in the Clinical Trial Directive (Officially Directive 2001/20/EC). A similar guideline for clinical trials of medical devices is the international standard ISO 14155, which is valid in the European Union as a harmonized standard. These standards for clinical trials are sometimes referred to as ICH-GCP or ISO-GCP to differentiate between the two and the lowest grade of recommendation in clinical guidelines. * United States: Although ICH GCP guidelines are recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they are not statutory in the United States. The National Institutes of Health requires NIH-funded clinical investigators and clinical trial staff who are involved in the design, conduct, oversight, or management of clinical trials to be trained in Good Clinical Practice.

It has its own dialect of Dhivehi which is considerably different from northern and mid-Maldivian speech. The island was formerly known as Havaru Thinadhoo and it was the traditional seat of the Atoll Chief. History =Early history= Written history of the island is sparse, but Thinadhoo is known to have a rich history. Occupation of Thinadhoo It is told in stories that Thinadhoo reverted from Islam shortly after conversion. This is likely to be a political move in order to establish a military occupation as there is no evidence of practice of Buddhism after the conversion. The first to convert were from Suvadive. That is Addu and then Huvadu and then the rest of Maldives. The story goes that when Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam captured Male' in 1573 AD, he journeyed to the South of the country and visited Thinadhoo to find its inhabitants practicing Buddhism. Bodu Thakurufaanu convinced the people to convert to Islam. Days later a calamity befell the island - all new born children were dying. With the advice of a woman from Rahadhoo who had claimed that this would not have happened if [the islanders] had lived as you lived before, the people reverted to Buddhism. Suvadive was already a flourishing fishing industry with its own sustained economy when the Havaru was established. Bodu Thakurufaanu using the backstory of reversion from Islam sent his Generals, dubbed 'Havaru', who were based in Mal√©. They were organized as two ranks of three divisions each: the Is Thinvaru (the lead three powers) - Dhoshimeynaa Varu, Velaanaa Varu and Hakuraa Varu; and the Fas Thinvaru (the rear three powers) - Maafaiy Varu, Dhaharaa Varu and Faamuladheyri Varu. These 'Havaru' went to Thinadhoo and recaptured the island after much bloodshed. The generals then returned to Mal√© and for their victory Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam offered them the island of Thinadhoo, He ordered that the 'dhandu kolhu', 'medhu ruganddu' and 'Baraaseel' to be given to Havaru along with the islands of Thinadhoo Maahuttaa, Kaadedhdhoo and Kuddu. The island itself was renamed Havaru Thinadhoo signifying the occupation. When 'havaru' were given these six regions they leased them to the people of Thinadhoo under the Vaaru system. Each year Thinadhoo people were to send the annual Varuvaa to the 'Havaru' based in Male'. This practice lasted till the sultanate of Muhammad Mueenuddeen I who was the sultan of the Maldives from 1798 to 1835. This practice was abolished by the orders of Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir. =Separatist Movements= Huvadhoo Invasion On 9 July 1959, the Ministry of Defense called for volunteers to accompany the Government mission to the southern atolls. The Maldivian Government vessel, the Maldive Star was prepared for the mission and a total of 700 volunteers and army personnel were chosen. Accompanying this small force were Mr. Gadhdhoo Ali Kaleyfaanu and Gadhdhoo Khatheeb Hussain Maniku, two of the leaders from Huvadhoo Atoll who had come to Male‚Äô earlier to report on the situation in the atoll. The \\"Maldive Star\\" left Male‚Äô on 14 July 1959, travelling first to Haddummathi, and then on to Gadhdhoo in Huvadhoo Atoll. The population of Gadhdhoo were loyal to the Maldivian Government and played a significant role in keeping the Male‚Äô Government informed of the situation in the atoll. The leaders of this group were Ali Kaleyfaanu, Gadhdhoo Khatheeb Hussain Maniku, and Ahmed Thakurufaanu. The island of Gadhdhoo was targeted for punishment by the dissidents, possibly because they exhibited their loyalty to the Maldivian government. When the ship arrived in Gadhdhoo harbour, hostile activities were instigated by members of a \\"military force\\" from Havaru Thinadhoo, the capital of the atoll, who had been in charge of Gadhdhoo Island since the beginning of the rebellion. These were about 200 men from Havaru Thinadhoo, calling themselves \\"sifain\\" (soldiers) who had roamed the island, looting and terrifying the islanders, consisting mainly of women and children, after most of the able bodied men had been captured and taken away. Soon afterwards, the men from Havaru Thinadhoo capitulated and were handed over to the ship by the islanders. Essential food items were off-loaded from the Maldive Star, which then left for Havaru Thinadhoo. The population of Havaru Thinadhoo was quite hostile to the Maldivian Government. Letters were sent ashore to the leaders of the rebellion, and orders were given the islanders to submit peacefully and that no harm would come to them, but these orders had no effect. When the Maldivian force led by Mr. Ibrahim Nasir, some Government officials, Maldivian army officers and volunteers, arrived in the island harbor, there was a skirmish in which three of the islanders were injured. It was Friday, and at prayer time the Government force went back to their vessel telling the islanders to submit and come in peace after the Friday prayers. After prayers, the Maldivian force went back to the island and eventually the dissidents gave up, and the leaders of the rebellion in the atoll were brought to the \\"Maldive Star\\". The rest of the day and most of the night were spent in unloading necessary foodstuffs from the boat to the island. The Atoll Chief Mr. N.T. Hassan Didi, who had been in Havaru Thinadhoo when the rebellion took place, had been imprisoned, beaten up, and badly mistreated by the rebels, was also brought to the vessel, where he received a very warm welcome. After picking up the leaders of the rebels, the ship left for Male‚Äô on 18 July 1959. Fifty army personnel and one hundred civilians who had come aboard the ship from Male‚Äô were to stay in Havaru Thinadhoo to look after matters in the atoll. 1962 Massacre On 28 January 1962, the Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir left Male‚Äô for the atolls in the yacht \\"Silver Crest\\", accompanied by Mr. Ahmed Hilmy Didi, Mr. Ahmed Zaki, Mr. Muhammad Imadhudhdhin and Mr. Maizan Ibrahim Maniku. Others accompanying him were the navigator Mr. Maalimee Muhammad Maniku and the wireless operator Mr. Maizan Umar Maniku. It was assumed by people in Male‚Äô that this was one of the regular trips the Prime Minister had been making to different atolls. \\"Silver Crest\\" headed south and reached Feeali in North Nilande Atoll where it made its first stop. On 29 January it travelled to Maamendhoo in Hadhdhunmathi. The yacht picked up nine army officers who were at the island and set sail at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning of 30 January, heading towards Huvadhoo Atoll. At this time those on board came to know that the yacht was carrying some sub-machine guns. On 4 February 1962, Havaru Thinadhoo was completely destroyed on the orders of Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir to end the separatist movement of the United Suvadive Republic. The islanders were ordered to go to the shallow reef, where they were forced to stand for hours with water up to their necks. Meanwhile, all houses were razed, all wells destroyed and filled with rubble, all trees were cut down and much property was looted while the islanders watched from afar. The island was then depopulated and its people dispersed. Women and children were allegedly raped in front of their families. Between 200 and 300 prisoners were taken back to Mal√©, where they were tortured and most killed.

Hambleton was in the East China Sea for a second such mission when Japanese acceptance of peace terms was announced 15 August. Joining Admiral William F. Halsey's 3rd Fleet off Tokyo, Hambleton steamed into Tokyo Bay 28 August to clear the way for the occupation forces. In the next few months Hambleton swept a total of 184 mines from Japanese minefields in various straits and channels. During this period she rode out four typhoons, one of which battered her with waves. Departing Japanese waters 20 November, Hambleton steamed via Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego to Norfolk arriving late December. =1946‚Äì1955= Based at Charleston, South Carolina, the veteran minesweeper maintained an operational pattern that kept her prepared for the emerging Cold War struggle. During the next decade Hambleton participated in fleet and tactical exercises in the Caribbean and along the East Coast. In 1949, 1952, and 1954 she deployed to the Mediterranean and operated with the 6th Fleet from the shores of North Africa to the turbulent Middle East. After returning to Charleston from her third Mediterranean cruise on 6 July 1954, Hambleton decommissioned on 15 January 1955, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified DD-455 the same day. Hambleton was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1971. She was sold 22 November 1972 and broken up for scrap. Awards Hambleton received seven battle stars for World War II service.

The Karakum Canal (Qaraqum Canal, Kara Kum Canal, Garagum Canal; , Karakumskiy Kanal, , , ) in Turkmenistan is one of the largest irrigation and water supply canals in the world. Started in 1954, and completed in 1988, it is navigable over much of its length, and carries of water annually from the Amu-Darya River across the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan. The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water. The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster. History The current Karakum Canal was not the first major attempt to bring the Amu-Darya water to the Karakums. In the early 1950s, construction began on the Main Turkmen Canal (), which would start at a much more northerly location (near Nukus), and run southwest toward Krasnovodsk. The canal would have used around 25 percent of the Amu-Darya's water.

M√≠sia is a polyglot. Despite singing mostly fado, she has sung some of her themes in Spanish, French, Catalan, English, and even Japanese. Parentage M√≠sia's mother was Catalan and used to be a cabaret dancer, which accounts for many of the influences that shaped her music: tango, bolero, the use of Portuguese guitar with accordion, violin and the piano. Style Throughout her career, M√≠sia developed a new style: she modernized Am√°lia Rodrigues's fado, shocking orthodox audiences by adding to the traditional instruments (bass guitar, classical guitar and Portuguese guitar) the sensuality of the accordion and the violin, and borrowing their finest verses from the greatest Portuguese poets. Recordings Her first album was released in 1990, at a time when, even at home in Portugal, fado was a poor career choice for a singer. With the exception of Am√°lia Rodrigues and Carlos do Carmo, there was no audience for \\"fadistas\\". Nevertheless, M√≠sia went on to record an album respecting all the traditional features of the genre, including poems from popular fado songwriters, such as Joaquim Frederico de Brito or Jos√© Niza, alongside poems by famous Portuguese poets, such as Jos√© Carlos Ary dos Santos, and even a piece from Vinicius de Moraes's song, \\"Samba em Prel√∫dio\\". The album bore her name, \\"M√≠sia\\", and was very well received by both audience and critics outside Portugal, mainly in France. The album was followed by \\"Fado\\" in 1993, in which she maintained her decision to use lyrics by popular writers and poets. This time she sang songs by S√©rgio Godinho (\\"Liberdades Poeticas\\"), Am√°lia Rodrigues (\\"L√°grima\\"), along with poems from Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes (\\"Nasci Para Morrer Contigo\\"), Rosa Lobato de Faria (\\"Fado Quimera\\" and \\"Velhos Amantes\\" based on a song by Jacques Brel) and even a text by future Nobel prize winner Jos√© Saramago (\\"Fado Adivinha\\"). In 1995, she recorded \\"Tanto Menos Tanto Mais\\" (Means \\"Less Is More\\"), which combines the texture of classical fado instruments, the Portuguese guitar, the acoustic guitar and the bass, with that of the violin, the accordion, the piano and even the harp. Once more, she sang Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes, but also Fernando Pessoa and Jo√£o Monge, one of the most appreciated Portuguese lyrics- writer. The first album to be released in the USA was \\"Garras dos Sentidos\\" (\\"Claws Of The Senses\\") in 1998. The concept of this album was to use lyrics by famous Portuguese poets with melodies belonging to Traditional Fado (where the melody is not bound to specific lyrics). This way, M√≠sia not only sang text by past poets like Fernando Pessoa, M√°rio de S√° Carneiro, Nat√°lia Correia or Ant√≥nio Botto but also contemporary poets like Jos√© Saramago and M√°rio Cl√°udio, and she also invited two writers to write poems for the album, Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, who wrote the lyrics for the titletrack, and L√≠dia Jorge, whose main poem, Fado Do Retorno is sung in two versions: track 4 with piano, accordion, violin and double bass, and track 11 with Portuguese guitar, acoustic guitar, bassa, double bass, violin and accordion. Her 1999 album, \\"Paix√µes Diagonais\\" (\\"Diagonal Passions\\") again used songs from a variety of writers, from Jo√£o Monge, Am√©lia Muge, Antonio dos Santos or Vitorino Salom√©, to Rosa Lobato de Faria or S√©rgio Godinho. In 2001, she decided to pay a tribute to Am√°lia Rodrigues, after the latter's death, and recorded \\"Ritual\\", where all the songs (except the last one) were recorded as traditional three- instrument fados. Her 2003 album, Canto, may be considered as her masterpiece. Mixing pieces of the best works of the Portuguese guitarist Carlos Paredes with poems by Vasco Gra√ßa Moura (and lyrics by S√©rgio Godinho and Pedro Tamen), M√≠sia created a musical work she would describe as belonging to her \\"gallery of impossible things\\". In her 2005 Album Drama Box, M√≠sia depicts herself as a cabaret dancer living in the \\"Drama Box Hotel\\" with her musicians. Transcript of \\"Drama Box Hotel\\" interview on Jard√≠ del Manicomi radio program on Punt 6 R√†dio In her 2009 album, Ruas (streets) M√≠sia goes beyond the boundaries of the fado. The first part of the double album, \\"Lisboarium\\" is an imaginary journey through Lisbon, expressed in fado. The second part, \\"Tourists\\", however, contains performances by M√≠sia of very different kinds of music. It includes music in Turkish, Spanish, English and French. The concept is non-fado music that according to M√≠sia has the \\"fado soul\\". An example of this is her version of \\"Hurt\\", originally by Nine Inch Nails but inspired by the version by Johnny Cash.

Rodman was laid down on 16 December 1940 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 26 September 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Albert K. Stebbins, Jr., grandniece of Admiral Rodman. The destroyer was commissioned on 27 January 1942, Commander William Giers Michelet in command. World War II =1942= Following shakedown, Rodman, assigned to Task Force 22 (TF 22), alternated training and patrol duties at NS Argentia, Newfoundland with screening and plane guard services for the aircraft carrier as that carrier trained aviation personnel along the northeast U.S. coast and ferried planes of the Army's 33rd Pursuit Squadron to Accra on the Gold Coast from 22 April to 28 May 1942. Detached in June, she departed Newport 1 July, escorted a seven-troopship convoy to the Firth of Clyde, then continued on to Orkney where, as a unit of TF 99, she commenced operations with the British Home Fleet. Based at Scapa Flow into August, she alternated patrols from Scotland and Iceland to protect the southern legs of the PQ/QP convoy lanes between those two countries and the north Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangel. With the long summer days, however, the U-boats and Norwegian based Luftwaffe units continued to exact a heavy toll. In early July, they destroyed Convoy PQ 17. Further convoys were postponed until the relative cover of the Arctic winter darkness could be regained. Operation \\"Easy Unit\\" then came into being. Toward the end of July, Rodman was designated to assist in filling the increasing immediate logistics demands of the Russians, and of British and American personnel in northern Russia, and to prepare for bases, men, and equipment to provide air cover for the convoys when they resumed. On 17 August Rodman, with the cruiser and two other American destroyers departed Scapa Flow carrying medical personnel and supplies men, and equipment for the Royal Air Force's 144 and 145 Squadrons, ammunition, pyrotechnics, radar gear drystores, and provisions. Following the route taken by British destroyers three weeks earlier, they entered Kola Inlet after dark on 23 August. The Luftwaffe was grounded. The ships offloaded, refueled, took on merchant sailors survivors of ill-fated convoys, and departed Vaenga Bay on 24 August. En route back to Scotland, the American ships were joined by Royal Navy destroyers. On 25 August, the British ships tracked the German minelayer Ulm ‚Äî one of many ships and boats engaged in laying mines at the entrance to the White Sea and in the shallow waters off Novaya Zemlya ‚Äî and sank her southeast of Bear Island (Norway). Rodman arrived back in the Firth of Clyde on 30 August and on 1 September got underway for New York. An abbreviated overhaul at Boston followed and, at the end of the month, she resumed training and patrols off the U.S. northeast coast. On 25 October she sortied with Task Group 34.2 (TG 34.2) to support the amphibious force of TF 34 in Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. On 7 November, Task Unit 34.2.3 (TU 34.2.3), comprising the escort carrier , destroyer , and Rodman left TG 34.2 and screened the Southern Attack Group to its destination. From then through 11 November, Rodman screened Santee, then put into Safi for replenishment. On 13 November Rodman retired, arrived at Norfolk on 24 November, thence proceeded to Boston where her battery was replaced by 40 mm and 20 mm guns. =1943= In December she steamed to the Panama Canal whence she escorted a convoy back to the U.S. east coast, arriving at Norfolk on 7 January 1943. The next day she sailed again joining Ranger for two more ferry runs to Africa, this time to Morocco. During March and April, she remained in the western Atlantic, again ranging as far north as Argentia on patrol and escort duty. In May, she returned to the United Kingdom. Arriving at Scapa Flow on 18 January, Rodman rejoined the Home Fleet. Into the summer she and her sister ships patrolled out of Scotland and Iceland and screened the larger ships of the combined force, including the battleships , , and , as they attempted to draw the German fleet ‚Äî particularly the battleship ‚Äî out of the protected fjords. With August, Rodman returned to the United States and by 1 September had resumed patrols at Argentia. Detached in October, she departed Norfolk 3 November for Bermuda whence she sailed in the advance scouting line screening the battleship then carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the first leg of his journey to the Teheran Conference. =1944= Returning in mid-December, the destroyer guarded carriers on training exercises out of Newport and Portland, Maine, until April 1944. Then, on the 20th, she headed east with other units of her squadron, DesRon 10. On 1 May she arrived at Mers-el-Kebir, whence she operated as a unit of TG 80.6, a hunter-killer group formed to work with the North African coastal air squadrons against the U-boat menace to shipping in the 325-mile stretch between the Straits of Gibraltar and Oran. The Anglo-American air-sea effort, devised to keep U-boats submerged to the point of exhaustion and then overwhelm them as they surfaced, required time and patience, as well as coordination. It was instrumental in slicing the number of operational U-boats in the Mediterranean by over one-third between March and June. On 14 May Rodman, with others of her squadron, departed Mers-el-Kebir to track a submarine which had sunk four merchantmen in less than two days. A 72-hour air-surface hunt ensued, but on the morning of 17 May, the damaged surfaced, was abandoned, and sank. The force picked up survivors and retired to Mers-el- Kebir only to sail for England the following day. On 22 May Rodman arrived at Plymouth and on 23 May assumed duties as CTU 126.2.1 for Operation Neptune, the naval phase of Operation Overlord the invasion of France. On 24 May, she conducted shore bombardment exercises. Then she waited. On 4 June the convoy B-1, formed, headed out across the English Channel, but then turned back, as the invasion was postponed one day. On 5 June the convoy again formed and headed east, this time continuing on to France and landing reinforcements on Omaha Beach on the afternoon of 6 June. Rodman, detached on arrival in the assault area, joined TG 122.4 and through 16 June provided gunfire support and patrolled in the Baie de la Seine. Brief respite at Plymouth followed, but on 18 June she returned to the Normandy coast. Back in English waters from 21‚Äì24 June, she joined TF 129 on 25 June as that force joined the U.S. IX Army Air Force in supporting the U.S. VII Corps (the 9th, 79th, and 4th Divisions) closing on Cherbourg. Rodman returned to England the same day, proceeded to sea again on 30 June; and, after a 3-day stop at Belfast, got underway for the Mediterranean to participate in Operation Dragoon (\\"Anvil\\"), the invasion of southern France. Arriving at Mers-el-Kebir on 11 July, she was en route to Sicily on 16 July, and into August operated between that island, the coast of Italy, and Malta. On 11 August, assigned to TU 85.12.4, Rodman sailed from Taranto. Two days later French warships joined the formation; and on 15 August, the force arrived off the Delta assault area in the Baie de Bougnon. From 04:30 to 06:41, Rodman covered the minesweeping craft clearing the channels to the beaches. Two hours of shore bombardment followed. She then shifted to call fire support duties, which, with antiaircraft screening duties, she continued until retiring to Palermo on 17 August. Back off southern France on 22 August, she fired on shore batteries at Toulon on 23 August, covered minesweepers in the Golfe de Fos on 25 August, and in the Baie de Marseilles on 26 August. Engaged in screening and patrol duties through the end of the month, she sailed for Oran on 2 September and for the next month and a half escorted men and supplies into the assault area. In late October, Destroyer Squadron 10 escorted a convoy back to the United States. From New York Rodman continued on to Boston for conversion to a destroyer minesweeper. Emerging from the yard as DMS-21 on 16 December, she sailed for Norfolk the following week. =1945= On 1 January 1945, Rodman got underway for the Pacific. During the remainder of that month and into February, she conducted minesweeping and gunnery exercises off California and in Hawaiian waters, then sailed west. On 12 March she anchored at Ulithi and seven days later sailed for the Ryukyus and her last amphibious operation, \\"Iceberg\\". On 24‚Äì25 March she participated in minesweeping operations off Kerama Retto, then prepared for the assault on Okinawa. After 1 April landings on the Hagushi beaches, she remained in the area and was caught in the air-surface action which enveloped the island on 6 April. Assigned to picket duty early that day, she later shifted to screening duties and joined Emmons in covering small minecraft sweeping the channel between Iheya Retto and Okinawa. In midafternoon a large flight of kamikazes flew over. At 15:32 their leader dived out of the clouds and crashed into Rodman port bow. His bomb exploded under her. Sixteen men were killed or missing, 20 were wounded, but Rodmans engineering plant remained intact. Emmons commenced circling Rodman to provide antiaircraft fire as other kamikazes closed in. Six were splashed. Marine Corps F4U Corsairs arrived, joined in, and scored on 20, but not before others got through. Rodman was hit twice more during the 3¬Ω-hour battle. Emmons splashed six more, but was hit by five and damaged by four near misses. Her hulk was sunk the next day. From 7 April to 5 May Rodman underwent temporary repairs at Kerama Retto, then started her journey back to the United States. Arriving at Charleston Navy Yard on 19 June, her repairs were completed in mid-October, and on the 22nd she sailed for Casco Bay for refresher training. Post war USS Rodman underway, in 1954. For the next three years, she operated along the U.S. east coast, ranging from Newfoundland to the Caribbean; then, in September 1949, deployed to the Mediterranean. There for only two weeks, she resumed her western Atlantic operations and during the next six years sailed twice more to the Mediterranean, both times for 5-month tours with the 6th Fleet, 2 June to 1 October 1952 and 19 January to 17 May 1954 with a short diversion to Charleston, South Carolina to serve in the role as the fictitious USS Caine in the film The Caine Mutiny. Reclassified DD-456 on 15 January 1955, she decommissioned 28 July 1955 and was transferred the same day to the Republic of China to serve as ROCS Hsien Yang (DD-16). In ROCN service she became infamous for being involved in collisions twice in 1956 and was subsequently nicknamed \\"G≈çng Y√°ng\\" (\\"ram\\"). After she ran aground c. 1969, her ROCN name and ROCN pennant number were reassigned to the former , which was acquired in 1970. Rodman earned five battle stars during World War II.

Emmons (1811-1884). Emmons was launched 23 August 1941 by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine, sponsored by Mrs. F. E. Peacock, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Emmons. The ship was commissioned on 5 December 1941, Lieutenant Commander T. C. Ragan in command. She was reclassified DMS-22 on 15 November 1944. Service history =1942-1943, Atlantic service= Emmons sailed from Norfolk 31 January 1942 on her shakedown to Callao, Peru, where she embarked Peruvian officers for Valparaiso, Chile, returning to Boston via several ports in Ecuador. She patrolled in New England waters, and in April escorted the aircraft carrier across the Atlantic to the Gold Coast, where the carrier launched Army fighter planes, brought for the base at Accra and other African air bases. The summer of 1942 found Emmons patrolling out of NS Argentia, Newfoundland, and escorting troopships from Boston to Halifax. At Halifax on 5 July she joined an Army transport and a merchantman, whom she shepherded to a mid-ocean rendezvous with a British escort unit to take them safely into Iceland. Emmons sailed on to join the British Home Fleet in Scapa Flow on 16 July. She underwent training necessary to coordinate American and British procedures and tactics. Between 26 and 31 July, she escorted the battleship to Iceland and back to Scapa Flow, then had convoy escort duty on the Scottish coast. On 17 August she cleared Scapa Flow for Iceland where she made rendezvous with a convoy bound through the treacherous northern shipping lanes to Kola Inlet in the Soviet Union, from which she returned to Greenock, 30 August. Emmons returned to New York on 9 September 1942 and trained in Casco and Chesapeake Bays, and at Bermuda, for the invasion of north Africa, for which she sailed from Bermuda 26 October. She screened carriers covering landings at Safi between 8 and 13 November, returning by way of Bermuda and Norfolk to Boston. After brief overhaul and coastwise escort duty, she went to Cristobal to await a convoy to New York. Meanwhile, she passed through the Panama Canal on 9 January 1943 to train briefly with officers of the Ecuadoran Navy. She guarded the passage of a convoy to north Africa in February returning to New York on 11 March for training. On 2 April Emmons put to sea via Argentia for Scapa Flow, where she joined the British Home Fleet again on 19 May. During the next 2¬Ω months, Emmons joined in patrolling northern waters, guarding the movement of convoys across the North Atlantic, unceasingly alerted against the possible sortie of German ships from Norwegian bases. She also guarded British carriers in air attacks on Norway in July. Returning to Norfolk 9 August 1943, she voyaged to Gibraltar between 3 November and 19 December in the advance scouting line guarding the battleship , carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Teheran Conference. =1943-1944, Atlantic and Mediterranean= Emmons near Norfolk Naval Shipyard, November 1943 Between December 1943 and April 1944, Emmons guarded carriers during their operations at Newport and in Casco Bay, aiding in the training of aviators. On 20 April she sailed from Maine waters for the Azores, and Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, arriving 1 May for antisubmarine patrols. On 17 May, her group teamed with British aircraft to sink the , and the next day, Emmons sailed for England, and final preparations for the invasion of France, 6 June. After guarding pre-assault minesweeping, she joined in the heavy bombardment prior to the landing. Emmons and other destroyers engaged in combat, less than a thousand yards, with onshore batteries. She remained off the beachhead for three days as watchdog for the vast armada of ships lining up with men and supplies, then retired across the English Channel to Plymouth, England, screening the battleship . Returning to the assault area 11 June, Emmons served in the screen guarding transports and supply ships from submarine attack. After replenishing at Portland, England, from 21 to 24 June, she kept watch around battleships and cruisers on 25 June in the Task Force 129 Bombardment of Cherbourg supporting the U.S. First Army VII Corps victory at the Battle of Cherbourg. Emmons returned to Mers-el-Kebir 10 July 1944 with a transport convoy she had brought across from Portland, then had escort duty in the Mediterranean ports preparing for the assault on southern France. She sailed from Taranto, Italy, for the beachheads, 11 August, and on the 15th began pre-invasion bombardment. She remained off the beaches all day to provide fire support to troops storming ashore. Escort duty took her away to Italian and Corsican ports, but she returned to patrol off the French Riviera until October. =1944-1945, Transfer to Pacific and loss= Emmons put into Boston on 9 November 1944 for conversion to a high-speed destroyer minesweeper, and was reclassified as DMS-22. After training in the Atlantic and exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, she entered Ulithi to stage for the invasion of Okinawa. Her squadron put to sea 19 March 1945 for the dangerous, vital task of clearing Okinawa's waters to let assault ships close the beaches for the landings on 1 April. She then took up picket duty, and on 6 April, during one of the first of the massive kamikaze attacks, was a target as she sailed with . One of the first planes to attack struck Rodman, and as Emmons circled the stricken ship to provide antiaircraft cover, both DMSs were overwhelmed by kamikazes. Many were shot down, but Emmons was struck by five, almost simultaneously. One hit her fantail, the rest to starboard of her pilot house, of No. 3 gun mount on her waterline, aft, and the port side of her combat information center. Crippled and ablaze, with ammunition exploding in bulk, Emmons found damage control a desperate, losing struggle. That day her crew, who had already won the Navy Unit Commendation for Okinawa, lost 60 dead, 77 wounded. The rest had to abandon ship. Next day, 7 April, the hulk was sunk to prevent its falling into enemy hands. In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, Emmons received five battle stars for World War II service. After minesweeping training, Emmons went by way of Ulithi to the waters around Okinawa in preparation for the planned invasion on April 1, 1945. Early in the morning of March 24, Emmons and other destroyer minesweepers began sweeping assigned areas south and southwest of Okinawa. On April 6, the day of Japan's first and largest of ten mass kamikaze attacks called Kikusui (Floating Chrysanthemum), Emmons and her sister ship Rodman were assigned northwest of Okinawa to provide gunfire support for AM class minesweeper units. At 1532, three kamikaze planes attacked Rodman, with one crashing into the forecastle starting huge fires and another one hitting close aboard to starboard with a bomb rupturing the hull and causing flooding in several compartments. Emmons started to circle Rodman to provide fire support to the seriously damaged ship with an estimated 50 to 75 enemy aircraft heading their way. Combat Air Patrol (CAP) destroyed many Japanese planes, and Emmons shot down six. Another four planes crashed close aboard without causing serious damage. Finally, a kamikaze succeeded in crashing into Emmons at 1732, and four more kamikaze aircraft hit the ship within two minutes killing 60 and wounding 77 [1]. At about the same time, another suicide aircraft hit the damaged Rodman, which suffered casualties of 16 dead and 20 wounded [2] from a total of three kamikaze aircraft hits. About 1800, the decision was made aboard Emmons to abandon ship, and the drifting ship with uncontrolled fires was sunk by gunfire from the high-speed minesweeper Ellyson (DMS-19) in the early morning of April 7, 1945. Several officers and crewmen from Emmons received individual recognition for outstanding performance of duty on April 6, 1945, with awards of one Navy Cross, four Silver Stars, and eight Bronze Stars. All personnel serving on Emmons at the time of the sinking received a Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon from the Secretary of the Navy. The commendation reads as follows: For outstanding heroism in action while attached to Mine Squadron TWENTY, operating under Commander Mine Force, Pacific Fleet, from March 24 to 31; and thereafter under the operational control of Commander Transport Screen, from April 1 to 6, 1945, during operations for the seizure of enemy-held Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands. Although lightly armed and highly vulnerable while operating in dangerous mined waters, the U.S.S. Emmons rendered heroic service in minesweeping, fire support, radar picket, anti-suicide boat, antisubmarine and antiaircraft screen missions. A natural and frequent target for heavy Japanese aerial attack, she was constantly vigilant and ready for battle, firing her guns valiantly against a group of Japanese suicide planes striking in force on April 6, and downing six of the attackers before five others crashed her in rapid succession, killing or wounding many personnel and inflicting damage which resulted in her sinking. By her own aggressiveness and the courage and skill of her officers and men, the U.S.S. Emmons achieved a record of gallantry in combat reflecting the highest credit upon herself and the United States Naval Service. Dive site and vandalism The wreck of Emmons lies in of water off Okinawa's Kouri Island. It has become a popular dive site since its rediscovery in February, 2001. The wreck made national headlines in September 2010 when it was revealed that it had been vandalized by divers. The ship's plaque, or data plate, had been removed without the permission of the U.S. Navy, which still maintains custody of the wreck. To many veterans this act was akin to robbing a grave. As one said, \\"That ship is a resting place (for sixty men). Those men deserve our respect\\". On 7 April 2011, the plaque was recovered by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and is in the hands of proper authorities. The U.S. Navy will determine how the plaque will be displayed. In popular culture * The wreck of Emmons was featured as part of the Cities of the Underworld episode Tunnels of Hell. The episode focused on the caves used during the World War II Battle of Okinawa. Camera crew and show host also dived on the Emmons wrecksite located off the Okinawa coast.

With only five tropical storms having formed, it was a very inactive season; of those that did, three made landfall, of which all occurred on the shoreline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The first storm of the season formed on June 24, while the final dissipated on November 12\\\\. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional systems could have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been proven that these systems were fully tropical. __TOC__  Background  Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern- day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the five known storms in the 1907 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos√© Fern√°ndez-Partag√°s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag√°s also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partag√°s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete. The season was one of only two Atlantic seasons without a storm of hurricane intensity (winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) or higher), the other being the 1914 season. In addition, the maximum winds recorded from the first tropical storm were also the highest of the season; it also broke the record for the weakest \\"most intense\\" storm on record for an Atlantic hurricane season. Reanalysis also indicated that four additional systems could have developed during the season. No deaths occurred during the season and damage was minimal.

Late on June 26, it passed between the Yucat√°n Peninsula and Cuba, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Mexico shortly thereafter. The tropical storm continued to slowly intensify, and started to make sharp curve towards the northeast on June 28. The storm traveled east- northeastward paralleling the Gulf Coast of the United States, and eventually made landfall on the Florida panhandle early on June 29\\\\. It weakened slightly as it traversed inland, and entered the Atlantic Ocean just offshore Georgia during the morning. At this point, the storm attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h), though it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone within the six hours that followed. Late during the day, the extratropical storm reached New Jersey, and entered Maine on June 30. The 2003 reanalysis made only minor adjustments to the storm's intensity and track created by Partag√°s and Diaz, which included moving the point of landfall westward and increasing windspeeds on June 29 based on readings received in Jacksonville, Florida. =Tropical Storm Two= Based on information from historical weather maps, it appeared that eastward-moving lower-atmospheric flow was present between September 16 and 17, though a closed circulation did not appear to be present.Partag√°s and Diaz, p. 58 On September 18, the system developed into a tropical depression between the Bahamas and Florida while it moved west- northwestward. After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on September 19 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) early during September 20\\\\. It began turning north on September 21, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on September 22\\\\. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on September 23. As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partag√°s had doubt as to whether or not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded when the system was classified as extratropical.Partag√°s and Diaz, p. 59 =Tropical Storm Three= The system that would eventually develop into a tropical storm was first noted by a ship north-northwest of Veracruz on September 23. It was recognized as a tropical storm on September 27 while it was located above the Bay of Campeche, and moved northeastward, and slowly accelerated as it intensified. By September 28, it was moving east- northeastward at 24 mph (38 km/h), and simultaneously attained its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). At this point, it remained just offshore the Florida panhandle, and moved inland shortly thereafter on September 29\\\\. It plowed through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia while maintaining its intensity and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina on September 29. The remnants of the storm merged with a cold front the following day while situated south of New York.Partag√°s and Diaz, p. 61 Storm warnings were issued on September 28 for the shorelines of Louisiana and Mississippi, but the states did not receive strong winds. The maximum gust from the storm was , which was recorded at Pensacola, Florida. =Tropical Storm Four= The fourth tropical storm of the season was first detected by a ship on October 17 southwest of Bermuda; in the HURDAT database, this date was considered to be the formation date, although the entire lifespan of the storm is unknown due to a lack of data on the system itself. It initially moved east-northeastward, though later began to turn northeastward on October 18\\\\. The storm curved slightly towards the east-northeast on October 19, and became extratropical later that day before its dissipation on October 20\\\\. The storm maintained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) for most of its lifetime. =Tropical Storm Five= The final tropical storm of the season was previously unidentified until reanalysis by Partag√°s.Partag√°s and Diaz, p. 62 It formed on November 6 while moving south-southwestward, though took a sharp turn towards the west-southwestward on November 7\\\\. The following day, it took another sharp turn, this time towards the north-northwest, while it had winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), which were the maximum estimated winds for the storm. It continued on this path until November 11, when it turned once more, this time towards the north-northeast. It evolved into an extratropical cyclone the following day. The storm was considered to be a tropical storm based on reports of unusually warm waters near which were accompanied by strong winds.Partag√°s and Diaz, p. 63 See also *Atlantic hurricane season  Notes  References * Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:1907 natural disasters Category:1900s meteorology ","title":"1907 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"2361909","text":"Adolfo Carri√≥n Jr. (born March 6, 1961) is an American businessman and former elected official from City Island, located in New York City, New York. He has three sisters Elizabeth Carri√≥n-Stevens, Damaris Carri√≥n-Harris and Lizette Carri√≥n. He served one term as a member of the New York City Council. He served for seven years as the borough president of the Bronx, for a year and five months as the first director of the White House Office of Urban Affairs in the Obama Administration, and then for nearly two years as Regional Administrator for HUD's New York and New Jersey Regional Office. He left HUD in February 2012. In late 2012, Carri√≥n registered as an Independent, to begin exploring a run for Mayor of New York City, and in February 2013 he was granted the Independence Party nomination. Background Adolfo Carri√≥n was born in Manhattan, in 1961. His family moved to the Baychester section of the Northeast Bronx when he was in fourth grade. He attended public school at PS34 (Manh), PS111 (Bx), John Philip Sousa Middle School and Harry S. Truman High School in the Bronx. Later, he graduated from The King's College, a Christian liberal arts college in Westchester County at the time, where he majored in world religions and philosophy. He followed in the footsteps of his father, a Protestant minister, and became an associate pastor at a Bronx church. Carri√≥n went on to serve as a public school teacher in the West Bronx at Intermediate School 115 and CIS 234. During that time he participated in CCNY-based Salvadori Center program which uses the built environment as a teaching tool. Eventually, he went back to school to earn his Master's Degree in Urban Planning from Hunter College, part of the City University of New York. Upon graduating, Carri√≥n worked for three years at the Bronx office of the New York City Department of City Planning. He later served as District Manager for Community Board 5 in the Bronx (where he was responsible for overseeing the delivery of services to 150,000 residents within his district), was hired as Vice President of Human Services and Community Outreach at Promesa, a community development organization, and served as Chairman of the Bronx Puerto Rican Day Parade. He currently lives with his wife, Linda Baldwin, an attorney and former City Planning colleague, and his children, Raquel, Sara, Olivia, and Adolfo James (A.J.) on City Island. Political career Carri√≥n ran for New York City Council in 1997. He won the election and served one four-year term representing the 14th Council District, which includes the West Bronx neighborhoods of University Heights, Morris Heights, Kingsbridge, and Fordham. While on the Council, Carri√≥n belonged to its committees on Economic Development, Education, Higher Education, Environmental Protection, Governmental Operations and Land Use. He also served as chairman of the Special Subcommittee on the 2000 Census. Although Council members are allowed to seek reelection, Carri√≥n did not run for a second term. He had been rumored to be a leading candidate to become the next Speaker of the City Council, but he chose instead to run in the hotly contested 2001 election to succeed Bronx borough president Freddy Ferrer, who was at that time prevented under the City Charter from seeking a third term in office. He edged out then-Councilmember June Eisland and State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. for the Democratic nomination and then won the general election on November 6, 2001, with a landslide 79% of the vote. He easily won reelection in 2005 with 87%. Adolfo Carri√≥n would have been limited by the City Charter from seeking a third term as borough president until a narrow October 2008 vote of the New York City Council allowed third terms for elected city officials (including incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg).See New York City mayoral elections#Terms and term limits (since 1834) The media frequently speculated that Carri√≥n would be a candidate for Mayor of New York City in 2009. However, on December 13, 2007, Carri√≥n announced that he would be a candidate for New York City Comptroller in the 2009 election. On December 6, 2008, Carri√≥n announced in a speech at Yale University that President-elect Barack Obama had selected him for a cabinet- level position. In February 2009, he took office as director of the newly created White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy. Carri√≥n's work at the White House resulted in the establishment of a White House Urban Policy Working Group and the first interagency review in 30 years of the federal government's engagement with urban and metropolitan areas. Carri√≥n's position at the Domestic Policy Council ended on May 3, 2010, when the Obama Administration named Carri√≥n Regional Director for HUD's New York and New Jersey Regional Office. He left HUD in February, 2012. As Regional Administrator, Carri√≥n was responsible for overseeing nearly $6 billion in HUD investments in New York and New Jersey. On February 26, 2013, Carrion announced during an interview with the EFE news agency, that he will run for the mayor of New York as an independent candidate. He also unsuccessfully pursued a Wilson Pakula designation to secure a spot in the Republican primary. Affiliations ;Aspen Institute Carri√≥n was chosen by the Aspen Institute as one of 24 of America‚Äôs most promising emerging leaders to be a member of the Aspen-Rodel Fellowship in Public Leadership. The fellowship consists of 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats and focuses on the ethics and responsibilities of public office and teaching democratic principles. This is only the second class of fellows from the Institute, and Carri√≥n is the only member from New York. ;National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) On July 1, 2007, Adolfo Carri√≥n was elected president of NALEO, the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials. As President, he announced an increase in efforts to help file naturalization papers for eligible legal permanent residents before impending fee increases take effect as part of NALEO‚Äôs ‚Äúya es hora‚Äù campaign. He previously served as Vice President and Treasurer. NALEO is a national organization that offers training and technical assistance to enhance the leadership skills and political empowerment of Latino appointed and elected officials. ;County Executives of America Carri√≥n served as Vice- President of International Affairs for the County Executives of America, an organization committed to empowering county executives by making their voices heard at all levels of government and by offering economic opportunities and programs to improve local services. ;New York Blood Center Adolfo Carri√≥n serves as the Chair of the Volunteer Leadership Team of the New York Blood Center in the Bronx. As the Bronx Chair, he helps the NY Blood Center meet its goal of closing the blood deficit that forces the New York region to rely on donations from other parts of the country. Projects =Yankee Stadium= After his election as borough president, Carri√≥n helped to bring the City and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees, together for negotiations over the construction of a new Yankee Stadium. Early in his presidency, Carri√≥n had advocated Community Benefits Agreements intended to ensure that construction in the borough would help as many residents as possible. In the end, $800 million will be invested in construction of a new Yankee Stadium with at least 25% of the contracts going to Bronx businesses and at least 25% of the jobs going to residents of the Borough. In addition, $160 million will be invested in many public parks including a running track, tennis facilities, and softball and baseball fields on parkland around and including the original Yankee Stadium. Carri√≥n has helped to bring in funding to improve other parts of the community, including $65 million to be invested in restoration of the pedestrian Highbridge, the oldest bridge in New York City which connects the Bronx to Manhattan, and $91 million to be invested in constructing a new Metro-North Station at the new Yankee Stadium. Also being planned in the area is a Yankee Stadium Sports Museum and a fitness/health club. =Bronx Terminal Market= Just south of the new Yankee Stadium is the Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, which replaced a dilapidated public market and the closed Bronx House of Detention. =Hunts Point Vision Plan= Carri√≥n worked with Mayor Bloomberg and community leaders to re-envision industrial area on the Bronx waterfront. Key components of the plan include $110 million invested by the City for infrastructure improvements, $85 million development of the Fulton Fish Market at Hunts Point, $25 million development of the Produce Market, the construction of the new Barretto Point Park, the South Bronx Greenway Initiative, and a re-use plan for the Marine Transfer Station which is still in negotiations. Issues and controversies =Party affiliation= Until the New York City Charter was amended in 2008, it prevented Carri√≥n from seeking a third term as borough president. He raised money for citywide office and it was widely speculated that he was contemplating running for Mayor of New York City. On December 13, 2007, however, he announced that he was running in the 2009 New York City Comptroller's race to replace the existing Comptroller (Bill Thompson) who, at the time, was also term limited. As events turned out in 2009, Thompson ran for Mayor while Carri√≥n left the borough presidency before the end of his second term in order to accept his post in the Obama administration. =Navy bombing exercises in Puerto Rico= In 2001, he and three others including the Rev. Al Sharpton travelled to Puerto Rico to protest the Navy's bombing exercises on the island of Vieques. The ‚ÄúVieques Four‚Äù were imprisoned by the federal government for more than 40 days for protesting the policy. Their actions led to President Bush's imposition of a permanent moratorium on weapons testing on the island =Fire in the Bronx= On March 7, 2007, a fire engulfed the row house at 1022 Woodycrest Ave in the Bronx, killing 8 children and one woman. The two families affected were those of Moussa Magassa, who lost four children, and Mamadou Soumare, who lost four children and his wife. Carri√≥n worked with business and community leaders to raise over $200,000 for the two families, including support from the New York Yankees who financed the cost of the funeral and the Soumare family's travel arrangements to Mali. When the incident occurred, Mr. Soumare's application for permanent residency was still pending approval, so Carri√≥n worked with other elected officials to secure permission from immigration officials for Mr. Soumare to return to the United States after burying his family in Mali. The fire was caused by a space heater and touched off a fire safety awareness campaign by Mayor Bloomberg and the New York City Fire Department. =Congestion pricing= Carri√≥n was the most vocal outer-borough supporter of Mayor Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan which would charge drivers a fee to enter Manhattan between the hours of 8am and 6pm in an effort to reduce congestion and minimize the City‚Äôs air pollution. On June 15, 2007, Carri√≥n held a press conference with Mayor Bloomberg and nearly a dozen other elected officials from the Bronx to announce their support for the plan, though he stressed that proposed improvements to mass transit would need to be clarified before this plan was implemented. Carri√≥n's endorsement is significant because it dispelled the myth that politicians with a large percentage of constituents who commute into Manhattan would be intrinsically against the measure. =German military training video controversy= In April, 2007 a video filmed in June 2006 surfaced on YouTube depicting a German military training exercise in which a German Army instructor orders a recruit to pretend he is in the Bronx and to fire on a van full of African-Americans who are insulting his mother in the worst way. The soldier fires and yells obscenities in English, whereupon he is instructed to yell louder next time. Upon seeing the video, Carri√≥n demanded an apology from the German government and that appropriate action be taken against the offending officer. Carri√≥n, who had just returned from Germany on a tour to promote tourism to the Bronx, offered to return to educate officials about the borough. He also offered to host a contingent of government and military officials to give them a tour of the area. As a result of his remarks, the German Army instructor in the video was relieved of duty and denied retirement benefits. Mayor Andreas Breitner of Rendsburg, the town where the video originated, and German Consul-General Hans-Jurgen Heimsoeth issued formal apologies for the incident.  City Island The local district attorney's office investigated some construction work on a piece of property owned by Carri√≥n, in response to a report by the New York Daily News. In 2007, Mr. Carri√≥n had a porch and balcony added to his Victorian home on City Island, Bronx. According to documents obtained by the Daily News from the contractor, Nationwide Maintenance of the Bronx, and from the New York City Department of Buildings, ‚Äúthe project‚Äôs estimated cost was $50,000. Carri√≥n wound up paying less than half of the estimate ‚Äî $24,000. Hugo Subotovsky, the architect for the project, was seeking approval for a Bronx development called Boricua Village and obtained it while working on Carri√≥n‚Äôs house project. The New York Daily News' reports about the subject suggested that Carri√≥n, as borough president, was instrumental in this approval. The New York Times reported that the project had widespread community support and that though Carri√≥n did recommend the necessary zoning changes after reviewing the project, borough presidents only advise and ‚Äúcannot kill proposals.‚Äù Carri√≥n himself claims that his hiring of Subotovsky had nothing to do with the Boricua Village project. Carri√≥n did not pay Subotovsky for this work until April 2009. Carri√≥n's explanation was that he had not yet requested a final survey of his property and that Subotovsky's ‚Äúpractice was to not bill clients until the permit file at the Buildings Department is complete and closed.‚Äù Coincidentally, the bill was not paid until the same week the Department of Investigation raided the offices of the Boricua Village project developer, Atlantic Development Group, as part of a bribery and corruption probe. Initially, Carri√≥n had reported that he owed Subotovsky $3,627.50 for 51.5 hours of work. The check he sent the architect was for $4,247.50. As of this writing, there is no information about whether Carri√≥n is still under investigation or not. See also *List of U.S. executive branch 'czars' * Timeline of the Bronx, 21st c.

Macomb (1819‚Äì1872) and Rear Admiral David B. Macomb (1827‚Äì1911). Macomb was laid down on 3 September 1940 by the Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine and launched on 23 September 1941; cosponsored by Mrs. Ryland W. Greene and her sister, Mrs. Edward H. Chew, granddaughters of Commodore William H. Macomb. The destroyer commissioned on 26 January 1942, Lieutenant Commander W. K. Duvall in command. Service history = Atlantic service = Following shakedown, she operated off the east coast escorting convoys and aircraft carriers. These convoy missions took Macomb south to the northern coast of South America, east to the West African coast, and north to Newfoundland. Standing out of Boston on 5 July 1942, Macomb escorted a U.S. Army transport and an English ship to Greenock, Scotland, arriving 12 July. She operated between Scotland and Iceland making one round-trip voyage to New York for availability, until 25 September 1942, when she anchored at Norfolk, Virginia Departing Norfolk on 11 October, she screened aircraft carrier anti- submarine patrols in the Caribbean until heading for the north African coast 7 November. Arriving on the 11th, she acted as carrier screen during the landings at Casablanca and returned to Boston after the landings were secure. After overhaul at Boston, Macomb again operated as convoy escort along the east coast and in the Caribbean. Following a cruise which took her close to the coast of north Africa, the destroyer commenced operating out of NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on North Atlantic patrol. While on this patrol her convoy and antisubmarine duties took her to Iceland and England. During this early 1943 period, German submarines were extremely active, sinking many Allied ships with their \\"wolf packs\\". In August 1943 Macomb returned from a tour of duty with the British Home Fleet and operated again off the Atlantic seaboard with only one break until mid-1944. On this one exception she made an uneventful cruise to the Azores; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Dakar, Senegal; and Bermuda before returning to Boston in late December. On 20 April 1944, the destroyer got underway for the Mediterranean where she operated off the Algerian coast on antisubmarine duty. On 18 May, just before midnight, she commenced a 72-hour submarine chase that ended when was blasted to the surface by Macombs depth charges and then sunk by her guns. In mid-August 1944 she took part in the invasion of southern France, returning to antisubmarine patrol afterward Macomb arrived at Charleston Navy Yard 9 November for conversion to a destroyer minesweeper. = Pacific service = Redesignated DMS-23, 15 November, she joined Mine Squadron 20 (MineRon 20) and, after refresher training, departed for the Pacific 3 January 1945. Arriving in the western Pacific in mid-March, Mine Squadron 20 Joined Task Group 52.2 (TG 52.2) and steamed toward Okinawa. They were the first task group to enter Okinawan waters and remained until after the completion of the operations. Only one of the 11 ships in the squadron escaped kamikaze hits, and one, , was sunk on 8 April. The squadron suffered some 300 casualties, including over 100 killed. Macomb, participating in the entire campaign, shot down many enemy planes. On 27 April, in the early predawn hours, an enemy aircraft raid was picked up by her radar. For an hour Macomb fired almost continuously while maneuvering at top speed; three planes were splashed. Her luck ran out on 3 May during a twilight enemy raid. She downed one Japanese plane but a second came in fast and crashed into her, causing extensive damage and killing 7 men.R.Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p.282 For this campaign, Macomb was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for having, \\"...by her own aggressiveness and the courage and skill of her officers and men, contributed essentially to the success of the Okinawa invasion...\\" Macomb proceeded to Saipan for battle repairs following the 3 May engagement. Soon after the repairs were completed, the war's end was announced. Macomb rendezvoused with the 3d Fleet on 13 August en route to the Japanese home islands. On 29 August, Just ahead of the battleships and , she dropped anchor in Tokyo Bay, where she was witness to the formal surrender. Leaving Tokyo Bay on 4 September 1945, she commenced sweeping mines in the Japanese area, off Okinawa, near the entrance to the Yellow Sea, and in the Chosen Straits. = 1945 - 1954 = USS Macomb after conversion to a high speed minesweeper. Departing Sasebo, Japan, on 5 December 1945, Macomb steamed for Norfolk, Va., and Atlantic Fleet duty. In June, 1948, Charleston, South Carolina, become her home port, and until September 1949, Macomb went on patrols and took part in exercises along the eastern coasts of the United States and Canada and in the Caribbean. By the 1950s, Macomb had her Torpedo tubes and aft main 5inch gun removed. On 8 September 1949, Macomb departed Charleston for the first of three brief tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She returned to Charleston on 13 October. Her second trip to the Mediterranean came in 1951, 20 March to 5 October, the third, 22 April to 24 October 1953. During each cruise Macomb participated in the 6th Fleet exercises and operations, lending support to American diplomatic efforts at settling the unstable political situations then existent in many of the Mediterranean countries. = Foreign service 1954 - 1978 = In July 1954, Macomb was placed in reserve. On 19 October she decommissioned and transferred to the Japanese Government, becoming Hatakaze (DD-182) in the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Her removed aft 5inch gun has return to the aft in the 1960s tho Macomb's second 5inch gun was removed. The former Macomb was returned to U.S. custody in 1969. She was then sold to the Republic of China on 6 August 1970, to replace the former Gleaves- class destroyer (which had been damaged after running aground) as ROCS Hsien Yang (DD-16). The former Macomb was decommissioned in 1972, struck in 1974, and was serving as a dockside training ship through 1978.  Battle stars  Macomb received five battle stars for World War II service.

Between Crockett and Nacogdoches, SH 7 passes through the Davy Crockett National Forest. Commissioned on April 4, 1917, SH 7 is one of the original state highways established in Texas, and has been re-routed several times since its original conception. In earlier years, SH 7 mostly followed present day U.S. Highway 84, U.S. Highway 67, U.S. Highway 70 among other highways between northwest Texas and the Louisiana border. By 1939, most of the mileage belonging to SH 7 was transferred to the U.S. Highway System, leaving the highway extant only within eastern Texas. SH 7 subsequently went through several other major reroutings, truncations and extensions between 1939 and 1990, before becoming the highway it is today. Route description Including concurrencies with other state highways, Texas State Highway 7 (SH 7) reaches a total length of between Interstate 35 (I-35) and Farm to Market Road 107 (FM 107) at Bruceville-Eddy and a junction with U.S. Highway 84 (US 84) near the Louisiana state line. The highway travels through mostly flat, rural landscape, that lies between the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston. The highway also passes several small rivers, retaining dams and man made reservoirs, as well as cutting through the Davy Crockett National Forest and passing the northern boundary of the Sabine National Forest. SH 7 currently serves nine counties and nine incorporated towns and cities. =Bruceville- Eddy to Nacogdoches= SH 7 begins at an interchange with I-35 and FM 107 at Bruceville-Eddy in McLennan County. The highway proceeds due east crossing the Falls County line less than a mile east of the I-35 interchange. About east of I-35, SH 7 intersects with the southern terminus of FM 2643\\\\. Just outside of Chilton, SH 7 meets US 77 and Business SH 7-B at an interchange. Where the highway continues straight ahead as the business route, SH 7 proper becomes concurrent with US 77, passing the eastern terminus of FM 1950, then splitting off on its own again, continuing east where US 77 continues south towards Victoria. SH 7 meets up with the eastern terminus of Bus. SH 7-B in Chilton as well as the southern terminus of FM 434\\\\. The highway heads east, passing the eastern terminus of FM 935 and SH 320 near Triangle, then crosses over the Brazos River on a bridge. SH 7 runs east in Centerville East of the river, SH 7 enters the town of Marlin, passing an intersection with Bus. SH 6-N at Williams Street and Craig Street. Further into town, SH 7 passes the southern terminus of FM 147 at Walker Street. On the east side of town, SH 7 intersects with SH 6 at a freeway grade interchange, then proceeds east out of Marlin. Heading away from Marlin, the highway has junctions with FM 2958, FM 3144, FM 1711/1771 and FM 2745 before crossing the Limestone County. SH 7 becomes Washington Street through Kosse, meeting at a junction with SH 14 at Mignonette Street. After crossing the railroad tracks and heading east of Kosse, SH 7 intersects with the southern terminus of FM 2749 at the Kosse Mine, then crosses the Robertson County line. The highway intersects with FM 979 and FM 937 before leaving Robertson county and entering Leon County. After entering Leon County, SH 7 intersects with US 79 and Loop 208 in Marquez, then continues east crossing a set of railroad tracks. After intersecting with FM 1147, the highway then crosses another set of railroad tracks in Concord. In Robbins, SH 7 intersects with FM 39\\\\. Entering Centerville, SH 7 becomes Saint Mary's Street and intersects with I-45 at exit 164\\\\. In the center of town, SH 7 has two junctions, with SH 75 at Commerce Street and the northern terminus of FM 1119 at Cass Street. SH 7 goes straight northeast out of Centerville, passing FM 811 and FM 1511, before curving east again and passing FM 542 and crossing over a creek into Houston County. Following a junction with FM 132, SH 7 arrives at a wye intersection with SH 21\\\\. Both SH 7 and SH 21 run concurrently east, crossing Loop 304 into Crockett. Entering Crockett, SH 7/SH 21 become Goliad Avenue and intersect with the southern terminus of FM 229\\\\. The pair of highways then crosses under some railroad tracks at Commerce Street. Both highways arrive at the Crockett town square, which is comprised by four one-way streets centered around the Houston County Courthouse. The square also acts as a junction between US 287, SH 7, SH 21 and SH 19\\\\. SH 21 and SH 7 split away from each other at the square, with SH 21 heading northeast on Houston Avenue towards Alto, while SH 7 continues east on Goliad Avenue, intersecting a second time with Loop 304 before leaving town. After passing Houston County Airport, FM 232 and FM 1733, SH 7 enters Kennard, becoming Main Street. After passing a junction with FM 2781 at Welch Street, SH 7 arrives at a wye intersection, where it turns away from Main Street, heading northeast, while Main Street continues ahead as FM 357, before turning southeast towards Apple Springs. In Ratcliff, SH 7 turns to head east again at a junction with FM 227\\\\. East of Ratcliff, the highway briefly turns northeast again, crossing over the Neches River into Angelina County. Shortly after crossing the county line, SH 7 arrives at an intersection with the western terminus of SH 103\\\\. Where the roadway continues east as SH 103 to Lufkin, SH 7 turns briefly north, then heads diagonally northeast, passing FM 1819 near Redtown and a grade separated interchange with US 69 further northeast. SH 7 then crosses the Angelina River into Nacogdoches County =Nacogdoches to Joaquin= After passing a junction with FM 2782 in Harmony, SH 7 skirts the southern edge of A.L. Mangham Junior Regional Airport and enters Nacogdoches becoming Fredonia Street, before reaching a freeway interchange with US 59, SH 21 and Loop 224\\\\. Fredonia Street continues northeast into town as Bus. SH 7-N, where SH 7 joins US 59/SH 21/Loop 224 onto Stallings Drive, bypassing downtown Nacogdoches. At the interchange with South Street, which also serves as the southern terminus of Bus. US 59-F, US 59 splits off and continues south on South Street towards Victoria and Laredo. SH 7, SH 21 and Loop 224 continue east on Stallings Drive to an intersection with FM 224 at University Drive near the Cal-Tex Lumber facility. The four highways run concurrently for about two blocks, where FM 1275 splits off, heading south on Rayburn Drive. Shortly afterwards, SH 7/SH 21/Loop 224 meets with FM 2259 at a signalized intersection with Woden Road. East of FM 2259, SH 7/SH 21/Loop 224 curves northeast, to an interchange with East Main Street, which is the eastern terminus of Bus. SH 21-P. SH 21 leaves SH 7 and Loop 224 at this point, heading southeast on Main Street towards San Augustine. SH 7 and Loop 224 continue north to an intersection with Center Highway. While serving as the eastern terminus of Bus. SH 7-N, this intersection is also where SH 7 leaves Loop 224, heading in a northeasterly direction. Leaving Nacogdoches, SH 7 passes junctions with FM 2112, FM 2713 in Swift and a short two block concurrency with FM 95 in Martinsville, then crosses the Attoyac River, briefly entering San Augustine County, then immediately enters Shelby County. Continuing northeast, the highway intersects with FM 2913 and FM 711, then passes a signalized intersection, acting as the western terminus of Loop 500, entering Center as San Augustine Street. In town, SH 7 has a junction with US 96 at Hurst Street, before reaching Center's town square, which is constructed around the Shelby County Courthouse. The town square also serves as a major intersection with SH 87 and the southern terminus of FM 699\\\\. Heading northeast from the town Square on Cora Street and Louisiana Street, SH 7 crosses under a set of railroad tracks, passing intersections with FM 2788 at Sardis Road and Loop 500, before leaving town. On the edge of town, SH 7 passes the southern terminus of FM 1656 at Center Municipal Airport. SH 7 passes intersections with FM 2608 in James and FM 3082, arriving on the outskirts of Joaquin. After passing an intersection with FM 139 and Cunnings Street, SH 7 ends at an intersection with US 84 at a Picnic Area outside town. The highway continues northeast as US 84 across the Sabine River into Logansport, Louisiana. History leftSH 7 was one of the original 25 state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, proposed as a 'Central Texas Highway.' In 1919, the routing was mostly proposed between San Angelo and Goldthwaite, but only the segment to Paint Rock was created. From Goldthwaite, the road follows U.S. Highway 84 to Waco. The remainder follows SH 164 to Personville, FM 39 to Jewett, was unbuilt between Jewett and Crockett, SH 7 then SH 103 to Lufkin, and finally onto the state line via present-day U.S. Highway 69, SH 63, and US 190. On November 20, 1917, SH 7 was rerouted along current U.S. Highway 67 to Brownwood, and U.S. Highway 84 to Waco. Possibly due to the amount of construction necessary to build this route as proposed, on December 18, 1917, the road was rerouted via U.S. Highway 84 to Palestine, and south on U.S. Highway 287 to Crockett, following the proposed route from there. On March 20, 1918, the road was completely rerouted via current U.S. Highway 84 through Lubbock to Sweetwater. Between Sweetwater and Coleman, the road was not constructed as proposed. SH 7 returns to US 84, through Waco to Palestine, heads south on U.S. Highway 287 to Crockett, turns to Lufkin via the current SH 7, then SH 103 and finally onto Jasper and Newton via present-day U.S. Highway 69, SH 63, and US 190. The old route of SH 7 from Brownwood to San Angelo was renumbered as SH 7A. On August 21, 1923, SH 7 had been realigned yet again, mainly due to constructions issues. The Sweetwater-Coleman road was never built, and SH 7 was rerouted over existing roads into Abilene. The road's east terminus was shortened to Long Lake. The Crockett-Lufkin section was cancelled, and the section east of Zavalla had been renumbered as SH 63. In 1926, U.S. Highway 70 (US 70), US 80, and US 67 were overlaid over pieces of SH 7, which maintained its number. On October 26, 1932, the highway was extended east across SH 294 into Alto, SH 21 to Nacogdoches, ending in Joaquin via current SH 7, replacing SH 76. On May 23, 1933, SH 7 Loop was designated through Post. On November 27, 1934, SH 7 Spur was designated to Southland. On July 15, 1935, the section of SH 7 from Elkhart to Alto was cancelled. On February 21, 1937, this section was restored. On February 21, 1938, SH 7 Business was designated in Goldthwaite. On May 24, 1938, a spur to Oglesby was created, but not designated. On December 21, 1938, SH 7 Spur was designated in Oglesby. On September 26, 1939, most of the highway had been overrun by a patchwork of U.S. Highways, leaving only a small portion from Joaquin to Crockett remaining, rerouted yet again to a more southerly route from Nacogdoches, replacing SH 266 and part of SH 103. SH 7 Loop and SH 7 Spur became Spur 18 (Oglesby), Spur 45 (Southland), and Loop 46 (Post). On April 1, 1940, SH 7 was extended west to Centerville. On November 22, 1940, the section from Ratcliff to Crockett was cancelled. On December 3, 1940, SH 7 was extended west to Marquez. On February 20, 1942, the section from Ratcliff to Crockett was redesignated as part of SH 7. SH 7 replaced SH 139 from Chilton to Marquez (originally ended in Marlin; extended east on September 7, 1943) on July 15, 1948. SH 7 was signed (but not designated) to extend west to Eddy on July 31, 1975. The extension to Eddy was officially designated on August 29, 1990, replacing a portion of FM 107. At the request of the City of Nacogdoches, both SH 7 and SH 21 were re-routed onto Loop 224 and part of US 59 around the south side of town on October 25, 2018. left SH 7A was a spur route of SH 7 that split off at Brownwood and traveled southwest to San Angelo designated on March 20, 1918, replacing part of SH 7, which was rerouted. On December 20, 1917, an intercounty highway was designated from San Angelo to Fort Stockton. On February 19, 1919, it extended to Fort Stockton over this intercounty highway. It was transferred to portions of SH 23 and SH 30 (now US 277) on August 21, 1923, with the section from San Angelo to Fort Stockton cancelled. left SH 7B was a spur route of SH 7 designated on January 23, 1922, that split off at Lufkin and traveled southwest through Groveton to Trinity. On August 21, 1923, it was cancelled. Major intersections Business routes SH 7 has two business routes. =Chilton business route= Business State Highway 7-B (Bus. SH 7-B) is a long business loop that runs through Chilton. The route was created in 1990 from a section of FM 107. Bus. SH 7-B begins at an interchange with US 77\\\\. The highway continues west of the intersection as a segment of SH 7\\\\. Where SH 7 heads south, concurrent with US 77, Bus. SH 7-B heads east, before curving south at an intersection with Mooreville Road. Shortly after the southeasterly turn, Bus. SH 7-B passes the eastern terminus of County Road 4023 (CR 4023), followed by the western terminus of CR 4019\\\\. CR 4019 provides access to the center of Chilton. Bus. SH 7-B however, skirts the edge of town and does not serve the town center. From the intersection with CR 4019, Bus. SH 7-B continues south to its terminus with mainline SH 7\\\\. Although this intersection marks the end of the business route, the highway continues south as CR 494N to a dead end at the northern bank of Deer Creek. left This business route was previously designated as a section of FM 107, which used to continue east from I-35 in Bruceville-Eddy to SH 7 right outside of Chilton. Between August 29, 1990 and October 25, 1990, the eastern end of FM 107 was truncated to I-35 and the eastern section transferred to SH 7 and the newly designated Bus. SH 7-B. ;Major intersections =Nacogdoches business route= Business State Highway 7-N (Bus. SH 7-N) is a long business route that runs through Nacogdoches. The route was created on October 25, 2018, after SH 7 was re-routed around Nacogdoches on Loop 224 and US 59. Bus. SH 7-B begins at an interchange with SH 7 and US 59/SH 21/Loop 224\\\\. The business route then travels northeast on Fredonia Street for one mile (1.61 kilometers), then reaches an intersection with Bus. US 59-F at South Street. Bus. SH 7-B and Bus. US 59-F head north on South Street into downtown Nacogdoches, meeting at an intersection with Bus. SH 21-P at Main Street. Bus. SH 7-N turns right, leaving Bus. US 59-F, then heading east concurrently with Bus. SH 21-P on Main Street. Both business routes pass intersections with FM 1275 at University Drive and FM 2259 at Shawnee Street. At Orton Hill, Bus. SH 21-P breaks away from Bus. 7-N, heading east. Bus. SH 7-N continues northeast for a few more miles on Center Highway, before ending at a traffic controlled intersection with Loop 224 and SH 7. ;Major intersections References External links 007 Category:Transportation in Shelby County, Texas Category:Transportation in San Augustine County, Texas Category:Transportation in Nacogdoches County, Texas Category:Transportation in Angelina County, Texas Category:Transportation in Houston County, Texas Category:Transportation in Leon County, Texas Category:Transportation in Robertson County, Texas Category:Transportation in Limestone County, Texas Category:Transportation in Falls County, Texas Category:Transportation in McLennan County, Texas ","title":"Texas State Highway 7"},{"id":"2361916","text":"A fancy mouse (fancy means 'hobby' in this context) is a domesticated form of the house mouse (Mus musculus), one of many mouse species, usually kept as a type of pocket pet. Fancy mice have also been specially bred for exhibiting, with shows being held internationally. A pet mouse is inexpensive compared to larger pets, and even many other pet rodents, but mice are comparatively short-lived: typically only 18 to 30 months.  Description  The term fancy mouse is used to describe a mouse that has been selectively bred for exhibition. Wild-caught specimens that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the fancy type. Fancy mice can vary greatly in size, from small pet mice that are approximately long from nose to the tip of the tail, to show mice that measure nose to tail. Pet mice weigh about but large show mice can weigh up to . = Varieties = Artificial selection in fancy mice has created a variety of colours and patterns. These include colours like black, chocolate, blue, white, cream, lilac, red, fawn, champagne, cinnamon, golden agouti, silver agouti, silver, and dove. Depending on the club, the standards for showing may differ slightly.

THE HISTORY OF FANCY MICE. American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association. Afrma.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25. In Europe the breeding of fancy mice became popular through the introduction of Japanese stock in the early 17th century. By 1895, Walter Maxey founded the National Mouse Club in Victorian England, with its first official show held in Lincoln that year. Since that time, mouse clubs have formed worldwide. Shows are held so competitive breeders can display their mice, where they are judged on colour, body shape and behaviour. Mice are kept as pets in many countries for a number of reasons: Fancy mice are relatively small, inexpensive, never need bathing, and can learn to enjoy regular handling if provided with the correct care.Mouse FAQ. It is not only illegal to feed live animals to such carnivorous animals, however, but it is also not beneficial for the health of the predator. The Rat and Mouse Club of America. Rmca.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25. Female mice are popular with many owners, since they tend to co- habitate with other mice better than males. Additionally, the urine of female fancy mice does not contain as strong an odor as that of male mice. Bucks will often fight with and kill each other when housed together, despite being raised together, due to their very strong and unchangeable territorial instincts. It is difficult to house male mice together without the risk of injury to one or both males. Some people, however, prefer the personality and curiosity of male mice. It is a good idea to keep fancy mice in groups of at least two if possible, as mice are sociable animals. However, if a buck and a doe of breeding age are put in the same cage, it is possible for them to reproduce at a maximum frequency of once every three weeks. Litters of five to 18 are not unusual.  Health  A healthy fancy mouse will live on average 18 to 30 months, depending on genetic predisposition. Like most mammals, mice are susceptible to fleas, mites, ticks, and other skin parasites, as well as intestinal parasites. The cage should be cleaned regularly, and preferably treated with anti-mite spray. Mice are particularly sensitive to drafts and may pick up colds and other flu-like conditions. Mice can also over-groom when stressed, leading to skin irritations and fur loss. Older mice are susceptible to tumors, especially breast cancer in females, as the mammary tissue is distributed around much of the body. Persistent problems should be referred to a veterinarian, although finding a veterinarian with experience in treating mice can be difficult. Like people, fancy mice can become obese if they overeat and do not get enough physical activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are useful for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and can be difficult to retrieve. As rodents, mice must gnaw to keep their incisors from growing too long. Overgrown teeth can cause occlusion (blockage) of the mouth, which in extreme cases can lead to starvation. Hard foodstuffs, small pieces of wood or specially prepared blocks can suit this purpose, although some mice can grind their teeth together (\\"bruxing\\") to keep them short. In rare cases, a mouse may not be able to gnaw effectively, either from malformed incisors or jaws, and so its teeth must be trimmed by a veterinarian. Mice self-groom and do not need to be bathed, unless they have a skin condition which requires special treatment. Also, like people, mice can get diarrhea. For humans in developed countries with access to clean water, this is usually not a life-threatening condition. For mice though, it can be. Once a mouse gets diarrhea, since it is so small, it can very easily lose too much liquid, dehydrate, and die.  Breeding  A white female fancy mouse with her litter of naked pups (pinkies) Mice have a rapid reproduction rate; the gestation period is approximately 19 to 23 days. The average litter size is four to 12 young. In some instances, up to 30 young have been born. Males can mate with the female as soon as the litter is born, which means that a female could become pregnant with another litter within three days of giving birth. Female mice should not be bred before 12 weeks or after eight months; doing so can be very dangerous, and some mice can die while giving birth. Females come into heat around every three to five days, so the pair can be kept together for up to 10 days. Baby mice, called pinkies or pups, are born blind, deaf, and naked. Their eyes are closed and their ears are stuck to the sides of their heads. Mothers may eat any dead or sickly offspring. Pups begin to grow hair at 2 to 4 days. Ears open at 3 to 5 days, and the pups will start vocalising. Eyes open at 14 days, and the pups will start exploring the world around them. At 3 weeks old, they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At 4 weeks the males in the litter should be removed, lest they impregnate their mother and sisters, while the females can be left with the mother.  Showing  There are several clubs all over the world who host shows for mice, similar to rat shows. Shows are held in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia most commonly. Clubs include the FMBA (Fancy Mouse Breeders' Association, U.S.), AFRMA (American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association, U.S.), NMC (National Mouse Club, U.K.), and more. A quote from the NMC describes the ideal mouse body type for showing: \\"The mouse must be long on body with long clean head, not too fine or pointed at the nose, the eyes should be large, bold and prominent. The ears large and tulip shaped, free from creases, carried erect with plenty of width between them. The body should be long and slim, a trifle arched over the loin and racy in appearance; the tail, which must be free from kinks should come well out of the back and be thick at the root or set-on, gradually tapering like a whip lash to a fine end, the length being about equal to that of the mouse's body. Unless the variety standard states otherwise, the coat should be short perfectly smooth, glossy and sleek to the hand. The mouse should be perfectly tractable and free from any vice and not subject to fits or other similar ailments. A mouse with absence of whiskers, blind in one or both eyes, carrying external parasites, having a tumor, sore or legs with fur missing, suffering from any obvious disease or deformity or kinked tail shall be disqualified.\\"  Pet care  = Caging = 256x256px A cage with wire bars and plastic flooring is the most common type of housing. A span between cage bars of less than prevents young mice from attempting to escape by forcing themselves through the bars, where they may get stuck. This can also help prevent predatory pets such as cats, dogs, arthropods, snakes, and other carnivores from killing and eating the mice. Mice are naturally cautious of rats, who may kill and consume them. This behaviour is known as muricide (cf. Muricidal test). The mouse cage should be cleaned every week to prevent odour and disinfected only if a mouse has been unwell to prevent infection and disease. In the wild, mice are able to co-exist with other small rodent species. Compared with larger mammals, the mouse's small body makes it difficult to regulate body temperature effectively. Thus, drafts and large fluctuations in temperature can adversely affect the health of mice. The best products for use in cage bedding are aspen wood shavings. Paper-pulp-based products are also available, as well as a variety of recycled products, though newspaper products may contain inks, dyes and other chemicals from the paper making process. Cedar and pine, even kiln-dried, should not be used as they release aromatic oils that damage the respiratory system and can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory disease.Johnston, Jeff (1996-04-10) Respiratory toxicity of cedar and pine wood: A review of the biomedical literature from 1986 through 1995. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill via Ratfanclub.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25. Recent research suggests that paper- pulp bedding may allow very high concentrations of ammonia to build up in cages, especially those with little ventilation. Small hideaways and toys (such as a cardboard tube) are good to have in the cage. Commercial toys are also available. Mice love to run on a wheel, which provides stimulation as well as exercise. In the U.K., most show breeders keep their mice in wooden boxes measuring about by by , although there has been increasing use of plastic storage boxes. = Feeding = Hand-feeding 10-day-old pinkies Food for fancy mice can range from specially formulated feed mix to kitchen scraps. Carrot, spinach, lettuce and other vegetables are often enjoyed by mice but should be given sparingly as such foods can result in diarrhoea and life- threatening dehydration.Mouse Diet . The Fun Mouse. Retrieved on 2013-07-25. Bread crumbs, wheat and rice can also be good for mice. Laboratories keeping mice as experimental subjects almost uniformly use a product called lab block, a scientifically formulated blend originally designed for mice in laboratories. In order to keep variety in their diets, mice can also eat oats, oily seeds, clean eggshell, breakfast cereal, and stale bread. Fruit and vegetables are part of a more natural and healthful diet. Some owners give it to them as a treat after they do a trick. Mice often chew wood and other hard substances, which keeps their teeth from growing too long; salt licks are also an option. As mice and rats have similar diets, some pet mouse owners choose to feed them rat food. Although it is common practice to feed premixed diets designed for other rodents, for the longevity and health of the animal it is best to feed mouse-targeted diets. Diets for hamsters, for instance, are known to contain higher protein than what is required for mice or rats. House mice primarily feed on plant matter, but they will also accept meat and dairy products. Meats are full of protein and are good for pregnant or nursing mice. They will drink water, but require little of it, relying mainly on the moisture present in their food. If a water source is provided, then a gravity bottle feeder is necessary for maintaining the cleanliness of the water supply. They will eat their feces to acquire nutrients produced by bacteria in their intestines, a behavior they share with rabbits and guinea pigs called coprophagy. House mice, like other rodents, do not vomit. = Handling = Although mice are small animals and care must be taken to avoid injury, they are also surprisingly robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken, as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children, as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behaviour may result from improper handling, as they are generally considered non-aggressive. Mice, especially males who are wild and territorial, have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people Unfortunately, mice cannot be house trained and will often defecate and urinate while first being handled, especially if they are nervous. The feces of a healthy mouse consist of a relatively innocuous solid pellet a few millimetres long. However, their urine is often pungent, particularly with males, and can stain fabric.

He initially worked in telephone research, followed by influential work developing early radio technology, where he was especially known for improvements in tuning. Despite his often advanced designs, the Stone Telegraph and Telephone Company failed in 1908, and he spent the remainder of his career as an engineering consultant. Biography =Early years= Stone was born in Dover (now Manakin) village, in Goochland County, Virginia, the son of Charles Pomeroy Stone, an American Civil War Union general and engineer, and Annie Jeannie [Stone] Stone.Homans, J. E., Linen, H. M., & Dearborn, L. E. (1900). The cyclopedia of American biography. New York: The press association compilers. p. 369.\\"Stone, John Stone\\" From 1870 until 1883, General Stone held the post of Chief of Staff to the khedive of Egypt, and, while growing up in Cairo, John Stone Stone became fluent in Arabic, French, German and Spanish in addition to English. His father tutored him in mathematics, and following the family's return to the United States, Stone attended Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in New York City, after which he studied civil engineering for two years at the Columbia University School of Mines, followed by two years at Johns Hopkins University, where he studied mathematics, physics and theoretical and applied electricity.Clark, George H. (1946). The life of John Stone Stone: Mathematician, physicist, electrical engineer and great inventor. San Diego, Calif: Lithographed by Frye & Smith, ltd., pages 12-17. =Telephone work= After completing his education, in 1890 he began working at the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, Massachusetts, in the experimental department of its Research and Development Laboratory. While there, drawing on the work of Oliver Heaviside, he made a rigorous mathematical analysis of the company's development of a long-distance telephone link between New York and Chicago. His later work involved electrical resonance, which he initially investigated for its potential use in an automatic telephone exchange. In 1892, he attempted to wirelessly transmit audio using \\"high frequency transmissions\\". This effort was unsuccessful, but the work proved applicable to the development of \\"wired wireless\\" (also known as \\"carrier current\\") transmissions over telephone lines, although his patent application was later ruled to have been anticipated by Major George O. Squier. In 1893, he developed a \\"common battery\\" system for telephone use, which provided, from a central location, the electric current needed to operate subscribers' phones. From 1896 to 1906 he also gave an annual short course of instruction in electrical resonance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to graduating classes in physics and electrical engineering. =Radio development= In 1899, Stone resigned from his telephone company position and began to work in Boston as an independent consulting engineer, although he was also retained by his former employer as a \\"Consultant and Expert in patent causes\\". His first client was Herman W. Ladd, who was attempting to perfect his \\"Telelocograph\\" system for using radio signals as \\"wireless lighthouses\\" and for navigational direction-finding. Ladd's approach turned out to be impractical, but the work gave Stone insight about the difficulties facing the embryonic technology of radiotelegraphic signalling, and he recognized that his earlier work on resonant circuits on telephone lines could be applied to improve radio transmitter and receiver designs. Moreover, unlike most other early radio experimenters, Stone had the mathematical background needed to fully analyze electrical circuits. Schematic for four-circuit tuning (1903) In late 1900, the Stone Wireless Telegraphy Syndicate was started in Boston, with an initial funding of $10,000, to do experimental work in devising a commercial system. Stone used his knowledge of electrical tuning to develop a \\"high selectivity\\" approach to reduce the amount of interference caused by static and signals from other stations. Starting with Tesla-style open-core electrical transformers, he developed adjustable \\"selective four-circuit tuning\\" that employed \\"loose coupling\\" to help insure that the transmitter and receiver were operating on a single common frequency. (In some cases an extra intermediary \\"weeding out\\" circuit was added, for additional selectivity. In contrast, transmitters operated by most other companies employed \\"close coupling\\" that produced signals on two separate frequencies). He also took special care to mathematically analyze transmitter and receiver designs to increase efficiency and reduce losses. In early 1900, he applied for a U.S. patent for his tuning work, which was divided into three patents that were issued in 1901 and 1902. In mid-1902 the Stone Telegraph and Telephone Company, also based in Boston, was formed, in order to begin commercial operations. Stone acted as Chief Engineer, and two stations separated by sixteen kilometers (ten miles) were constructed at Cambridge and Lynn, Massachusetts.\\"The Stone Wireless Telegraph System\\", Electrical Review, October 24, 1903, pages 594-596. Beginning in 1905, demonstration radiotelegraph stations, using spark transmitters and electrolytic detectors, were installed for evaluation by the U.S. Navy. By the end of 1906, the government had purchased five ship and three land installations.History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy by Captain L. S. Howeth, USN (Retired), 1963, page 106. The company's first commercial radiotelegraph link was between the Isle of Shoals and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which operated during the summer of 1905, replacing a failed Western Union telegraph cable. In 1907 Stone founded, and served as the president of, the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (SWTE), which was created as an educational resource for his company's employees. (This organization would be merged with the New York-based \\"The Wireless Institute\\" in 1912, creating the Institute of Radio Engineers.) In 1906 the company tested a ship-borne \\"direction-finder\\" designed by Stone that, although fairly accurate, proved impractical as it required the entire ship to turn in order to take readings. Operating as a small independent concern, Stone found that he could not keep up with the advances in the industry, and in 1908 his company suspended operations, and was placed into receivership. Its assets, including its valuable portfolio of patents, were sold to Lee DeForest's Radio Telephone Company, for $10,000 cash and $300,000 of stock.Clark, page 117. In early 1911, he moved to New York City, once again working as a consultant. He also gained prominence as an independent expert, testifying in numerous radio patent cases. In 1912, he acted as an intermediary, making arrangements for Lee DeForest to demonstrate an early version of his three-electrode audion vacuum-tube to AT&T; engineers, who re-engineered the device into an amplifier that was capable of establishing transcontinental telephone service. In 1914-1915 Stone served as president of the Institute of Radio Engineers.Clark, pages 43-120. =Later life= In 1919 he permanently moved to San Diego, California, where his ailing mother resided. Here he became \\"an associate at large of the Department of Development & Research of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\\" until his retirement in 1934.Clark, page 121. Once married and divorced, Stone died in San Diego, California on May 20, 1943 and was buried in Mt. Hope cemetery alongside his mother Jeanne Stone and sister Egypta Stone Wilson. Shortly after his death, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a 1935 decision by the Court of Claims, which ruled that his 1900 tuning patent had priority over the U.S. counterpart (763,772) to Marconi's \\"four sevens\\" patent.Radio's 100 Men of Science: Biographical Narratives of Pathfinders in Electronics and Television by Orrin Dunlap, 1944, page 175. Legacy John Stone Stone was issued about 120 patents in the United States, and a similar number in other countries, covering telegraph and telephone devices and radio technology.Dunlap (John Stone Stone section), pages 149-153. He won the Franklin Institute Edward Longstreth Medal in 1913. He was also awarded the Institute of Radio Engineers' Medal of Honor in 1923, \\"For his valuable pioneer contributions to the radio art\\", and at the presentation ceremony, Frederick A. Kolster acknowledged his contributions with the following: \\"No man has contributed more to the advancement of the Radio Science than has John Stone Stone, and no man is more thoroughly entitled to the full and grateful appreciation of the entire Radio World.\\"Clark, page 137. Other activities Among his political and other activities, he served as a member of the American Defense Society's Board of Trustees. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; past president and vice-president of the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers; vice-president of the Wireless Telegraph Association of America; member of the American Electrochemical Society; Associate of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers; member of the Society of Arts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; member of the Mathematical and Physical Club; the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity,\\"The Johns Hopkins Chapter\\", Catalogue of the Alpha Delta Phi Society (1899), page 641. the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association of New England and a hereditary member of the Aztec Club of 1847.

It lays its eggs most often on Lilium and Fritillaria species. In the absence of Lilium and Fritillaria species, there are fewer eggs laid and the survival rate of eggs and larvae is reduced. It is now a pest in most temperate climates where lilies are cultivated. Description This lily beetle belongs to the order Coleoptera, and the family Chrysomelidae, the leaf beetles. The adult lily beetle is about 6 to 9 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öú in) in length, with relatively long legs and antennae. Its elytra (harder forewings) are bright scarlet and shiny. Its underside, legs, eyes, antennae and head are all black. It has large eyes, a slim thorax, and a wide abdomen.Ernst, C. The Lily Leaf Beetle (Lilioceris lilii): an unwelcome invader. 2005 NALS Yearbook. North American Lily Society. pp. 29-34. Retrieved 2012-08-21. Each antenna is made up of 11 segments. The eyes are notched and there are two grooves on the thorax. This lily beetle may be confused with the cardinal beetle (Pyrochroa serraticornis), which also has red elytra and a black underside. The wing cases of the lily leaf beetle are dimpled and are shinier and more rounded than those of the cardinal beetle, which are relatively dull, and narrower, flatter, and more elongated. The cardinal beetle also has comb-like antennae. The lily leaf beetle is herbivorous, while the cardinal beetle preys on insects. The lily leaf beetle is also confused with unspotted ladybirds, but it is narrower in shape. Natural history =Distribution= The lily leaf beetle is indigenous to parts of Europe and Asia. It is thought to have been introduced to North America through the importation of plant bulbs in 1943. First spotted in Montreal, it spread throughout Canada and appeared in Massachusetts in 1992, and by 2012 was in all six New England States, as well as New York and Washington states. In Canada it is found from the Maritime Provinces west to Manitoba. As of 2001, it spread as far west as Alberta, and as of 2017 full infestations reported as far north as the Edmonton, AB area. It has also become established as an invasive species in the United Kingdom since being first recorded in 1839, although the first colony did not become established until 1939 and it did not spread far until the 1980s, then more rapidly from the 1980s. Since then it has spread from Surrey in southern England as far north as Inverness, Scotland. It is also found in Ireland. It is also found in the Middle East and North Africa. =Life cycle = Larvae eating lily leaf The beetle overwinters in the soil and emerges early in spring. The adult is generally found in moist, cool environments.Lily Leaf Beetle Lilioceris lilii. University of Rhode Island Landscape Horticulture Program Factsheets. 2002. Retrieved 2012-08-21. It emerges in spring to feed and mate. The female can lay up to 450 eggs each season in batches of about 12 on the undersides of leaves. It arranges the red-orange to brown eggs in narrow irregular lines along the midrib, where they are more concealed. The eggs then hatch into yellow, brown or orange larvae in about 1‚Äì2 weeks. The larvae feed for up to 24 days, beginning underneath the leaf then working up the rest of the plant, and cause the most damage. Their preferred feeding locale is underneath the leaf or at the node where the leaf meets the stem. They then burrow in the ground to pupate in a cocoon of soil bound with saliva. In about 20 days they emerge as adults and continue to feed until winter. More than one cycle can occur in one year. =Behaviour= Often the first evidence of lily leaf beetle infestation is sticky brown frass piles containing larvae on leaves. The larvae remain in the frass for protection from the sun and predators. However, the fecal shield is not effective protection against parasitoids, and it may actually make it easier for parasitoids such as the wasp Lemophagus pulcher to locate the larvae.Schaffner, U. and C. Muller. 2001. Exploitation of the fecal shield of the lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris lilii (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), by the specialist parasitoid Lemophagus pulcher (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Journal of Insect Behavior 14(6): 739-57. An adult that senses danger displays a defense mechanism, thanatosis, becoming motionless, folding up its appendages and falling with its black under surface facing up, thereby helping it camouflage with the ground to get away. If unable to escape, they are also able to ‚Äòsqueak‚Äô, by rubbing two parts of their body together, which may be used to startle the attacker. Biology of Leaf Beetles. Jolivet, P. Verma, K.K. 2002. Intercept. This process is known as stridulation and could even shock a bird or any other predator that may attack the lily leaf beetle. Lilies may first show evidence of holes chewed in the leaves from consumption, and if left unchecked rapidly progress to blackening, and total loss of the leaves, leaving only the stem. Beetles and their larvae may also inhabit and devour the developing flower buds. Invasion may occur shortly after the new plants emerge from the soil, particularly if there are nearby Fritillaria which emerge earlier than Lilium. While Lilium and Fritillaria are affected, Hemerocallis is not. All types of lily may be affected, but while Asiatic lilies are the most vulnerable, some Oriental lilies may be more resistant. Resistant types include Lilium henryi 'Madame Butterfly', Lilium speciosum 'Uchida', and Lilium 'Black Beauty'. Other garden plants affected include Convallaria majalis, Polygonatum, potato (Solanum tuberosum), flowering tobacco (Nicotiana), hollyhock (Alcea) and Hosta. Pest impact Adult eating lily leaf Fritillaria and Lilium specimens in Canadian gardens, particularly around Halifax, Nova Scotia are significantly affected by the lily leaf beetle. A garden in Waverley, Nova Scotia has reported decline of lily species and cultivars from 50 in 1996 to only one in 2006. =Control= The most surefire strategy for preventing infestation by any pest is to avoid planting susceptible plants in the first place, with lily beetle this necessitates avoiding growing so many desirable cultivars of Lilium, that other strategies may be preferred. Regular handpicking and crushing of eggs, larvae and adults is effective if somewhat laborious. Domestic insecticides registered for general leaf beetle control containing carbaryl, methoxychlor, malathion and rotenone can prove useful in controlling populations. However, malathion and carbaryl, effective on adults and larvae, are toxic to bees and other insects, respectively. Products based on neem extracts are useful in killing very young larvae and repelling adults without comparable harm to other insects, although this option is perhaps less effective than handpicking. Neem products should be applied every 5 to 7 days after egg hatch. Thiacloprid is also effective. Floating row cover has been effective in preventing the adults from feeding and laying eggs in the spring. =Biological control= In Europe, total parasitism rate in the last instar stage averages about 90% on wild Lilium martagon, 75% in gardens and 60% in cultivated lily fields. Most lily leaf beetle parasitoids are wasps that lay eggs inside the host and effectively kill all infected individuals. Diaparsis jucunda (Ichneumonidae: Tersilochinae), dominates over 90% of the parasitoid infections in lily leaf beetle. However, in gardens and commercial fields, Tetrastichus setifer (Eulophidae: Tetrastichinae) and Lemophagus pulcher (Eulophidae: Campopleginae) become the dominant parasitoids in the later season. There are no natural predators or parasites of lily leaf beetle in North America. In 1996, University of Rhode Island began testing the effectiveness of biological control of lily leaf beetle using six natural parasitoids from Europe. CAB International Bioscience Switzerland Center has also participated in this project from 1998 till 2001. The European parasitoid wasp Tetrastichus setifer was used in Massachusetts from 1999 to 2001; the experiment showed reduction of the beetle population. Population decline was also observed at another experiment site in Rhode Island. In 2003, another parasitoid, Lemophagus errabundus, was released in Massachusetts and is now established in the region. Similar parasitoid releases have been made in Boston with positive results.

Life Son of Free Church minister John Baillie (1829‚Äì1891), and his wife, Annie MacPherson, he was born in the Free Church manse in Gairloch, Wester Ross, on 26 March 1886.Ewings Annals of the Free Church of Scotland: John Baillie A leading theologian, he held academic posts in the UK, USA, and Canada. His brother Donald Macpherson Baillie was Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of St. Andrews and his other brother Peter Baillie served as a missionary doctor at Jalna, India.The Baillie Project, University of Edinburgh Raised in the Calvinist tradition, Baillie studied divinity at Edinburgh University. After graduating he undertook further studies at both Jena and Marburg in Germany and then went to teach in Canada and the United States. He gained a D.Litt. on the theory of religion from Edinburgh University in 1928 which formed the basis of a book published in the same year. He was a professor at Edinburgh University from 1934 to 1959, serving as principal of New College and dean of the Faculty of Divinity from 1950 to 1956. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1943. In 1958 he was awarded an honorary doctorate (D. theol. h. c.) by the University of Jena on the occasion of the university's fourth centenary. He was appointed a Chaplain in Ordinary to the King in 1947. Baillie wrote A Diary of Private Prayer (1936), regarded as a devotional classic. But his most important contribution to theology was an exploration of the relationship of the knowledge of God to spiritual and moral experience. He served alongside of John T. McNeill and Henry P. Van Dusen as a general editor of the Library of Christian Classics series, which includes modern translations of the writings of Christian theologians and thinkers such as Aquinas, Augustine, Calvin, Luther and other reformers and early church fathers. As Convener of the Church of Scotland's General Assembly's \\"Commission for the Interpretation of God's Will in the Present Crisis\\" (\\"The Baillie Commission\\"), reporting to the Assembly 1941 to 1945, Baillie helped the Church to think through its approach and mission to the post-war world.Secretariat for Evangelism (1954) Ecumenical Studies: Evangelism in Scotland Geneva: The World Council of Churches p.55; John Baillie, 'Preface' (1945) God's Will for Church and Nation London: SCM Press, pp.7-8.

Beatty. Beatty was laid down as Mullany on 1 May 1941 at the Charleston Navy Yard. The name \\"Beatty\\" was originally assigned to a destroyer scheduled to be built in San Francisco, but the names of and DD-640 were switched on 28 May 1941 to accommodate Mrs. Charles H. Drayton, the daughter of the late Rear Admiral, who had asked that the ship honoring her father be built at the Charleston Navy Yard. Sponsored by Mrs. Drayton, Beatty was launched on 20 December 1941, and commissioned on 7 May 1942, Lieutenant Commander Frederick C. Stelter, Jr., in command. Service history =1942= Dual launch of \\"Beatty\\" and Tillman Following shakedown, Beatty escorted the Norwegian tanker Britainsea and from the Isles of Shoals to Portland, Maine, on 8 August before she was detached for patrol duty and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training. She next steamed to Boston to embark Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, on 12 August. In company with , the destroyer transported her high-ranking passenger to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland, before disembarking him at Portland on 22 August. The destroyer then escorted , with Admiral Ingersoll aboard, from Portland to New London, Connecticut where she arrived on 23 August. Beatty took part in exercises out of New London with friendly submarines until 25 August and then sailed south to Charleston, South Carolina, for voyage repairs. After that, she steamed to the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, reaching Cristobal in the Panama Canal Zone on 10 September. There, she joined Convoy NC-5, four Army transports which got underway for the British West Indies on 11 September. The warship shepherded her charges to Trinidad, and made port on 15 September. Clearing Trinidad shortly before noon on 16 September, Beatty joined and in an antisubmarine sweep near Tobago Island. At 1858, Eberle reported a submarine contact and carried out an attack, without achieving any definitive results. Beatty then rendezvoused with a convoy on 17 September, escorting it to a dispersal point off Georgetown, British Guiana, and then heading back to Trinidad. After shifting to San Juan, where she made port on the 23rd, Beatty sailed with Convoy NC-5, via Kingston, Jamaica, and Belize, Honduras, to New Orleans. Sailing for the east coast on 6 October, she reached the Charleston Navy Yard on 8 October to prepare for her next operation. Underway again on 16 October 1942, Beatty sailed for Hampton Roads and there joined Task Group 34.10 (TG 34.10) ‚Äì the Southern Attack Group assembling there for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. This group was slated to assault Safi, French Morocco. Arriving off the North African shore on 7 November, TG 34.10 began preparations for landing early the following morning. Beatty joined the transport area's antisubmarine screen at midnight and patrolled south of and as they circled slowly, waiting for the order to land their troops at Safi. Enjoying the element of surprise, Beatty proceeded toward the beach, staying on Bernadous starboard quarter as she and Cole began their movement shoreward. At 0415, Beatty took her station along with other ships of the fire support group, and, at 0430, heard the prearranged code words \\"Play Ball.\\" Uncertain as to the position of the assault groups, Beatty checked fire momentarily until intercepting a radio transmission that told of the assault wave's arrival at the line of departure. Assured that no friendly troops had yet landed in that sector, Beatty opened fire at 0431, continuing for ten minutes before checking fire to await instructions for fire support. Beatty lost communication with the Army troops on shore, and by 0520 maneuvered seaward toward the transport area, to take station in a screen before sunrise. At 0640, she observed enemy fire from batteries at Point de la Tour, and saw some splashes close aboard and in the vicinity of the boat lane to the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" beaches. A minute later, Beatty fired at these guns, silenced them in 20 minutes. For the remainder of her participation in \\"Torch,\\" Beatty served in the screen. She returned to the United States late in November and entered the New York Navy Yard for voyage repairs and alterations. =1943= For the next four months, Beatty covered convoys plying the Atlantic. During this period, she made three round-trip cycles. Ending the third cycle upon her arrival at New York on 28 April, Beatty underwent the usual voyage repairs and conducted type training before getting underway for Hampton Roads on 13 May. Reaching Norfolk the following day, she escorted Vixen, with Admiral Ingersoll embarked, to New York, arriving on 15 May. Further type training in the Chesapeake Bay area followed, before she stood out of Hampton Roads on 8 June, as part of the escort for fast Convoy UGF-9, bound for Algeria. She arrived at Mers-el-K√©bir on 25 June 1943. Patrolling, escorting, and training followed Beattys arrival in the Mediterranean basin. On 5 July, the destroyer sailed for Sicily, assigned to the \\"Cent\\" attack force for the invasion of Sicily. Arriving off the transport area on 9 July, she observed antiaircraft fire in the skies over Sicily at 2240. The fire grew in intensity over Gela, Biscari, Vittoria, and Santa Croce Camerina. She observed several planes crashing around 2325, and a large fire burning to south of Biscari. Beatty screened the southeastern flank of the transport area until they anchored offshore in their assigned zone, and then took her station in her fire support area. Led by and , the first landing craft from began nosing shoreward around 0342. lay on Speeds port beam, with Beatty off Cowies port beam. At about 0407, Speed requested the destroyers to open fire. Beatty promptly complied, beginning with rapid fire and then slowing to eight rounds per gun per minute. Having observed no return fire, she ceased fire at 0416. After the neutralization of the landing zone, Beatty returned to the transport area to take up screening duties and to await contact with her shore fire control party (SFCP). At 0830, SFCP-7A, attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Army's 180th Regimental Combat Team, informed Beatty that the landing had been successful. During the forenoon, Beatty observed enemy planes appearing low and fast out of the Valle Forte, over Lagi di Biviere, and from the valley just west of the Fiume Acati, strafing ground troops, bombing the beaches and seemingly disappearing almost as soon as they were seen. The enemy planes \\"maintained their nuisance value the entire period of daylight,\\" enjoying what almost amounted to immunity because \\"ships could not fire on them also without danger to (our) own forces.\\" The enemy aircraft proved devastating to Allied spotting planes. Beatty observed four Reggiane Re.2001s gang up on and shoot down a SOC Seagull at 1021. At 1315, a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 downed another Seagull to the southeast of Scoglitti. Beatty claimed some solid hits on one of the Re.2001s that had downed the first Seagull, observing it disappear over a nearby section of high ground. At 1046, a plane roared out of the \\"favorite valley\\" toward the ships. Beatty opened fire, pumping out 26 rounds from her Bofors 40 mm guns and 60 from her Oerlikon 20 mm cannons before the plane was seen to be a P-51 Mustang. For the remainder of 10 July, Beatty remained off the invasion beaches. Shell fragments hit Beattys main deck and port side when tank landing craft (LCTs) nearby fired on \\"friendly\\" planes at 1847. The threat of further air attacks prompted the destroyer to help lay a smoke screen over the LCTs. The harassment continued after sunset. A heavy bomb landed about 500 yards astern of the ship, shaking her \\"considerably,\\" while she observed a nearby dogfight. One of the antagonists shot the other down. The latter crashed in flames, starting a brush fire where it fell. Meanwhile, considerable gunfire from the beach and the ships offshore criss-crossed the night skies. Enemy bombing raids ushered in the next day, 11 July, and Beatty fired at a Messerschmitt Bf 110 at 0651, after it had bombed Allied positions on \\"Dime\\" beach. At 0735, SFCP-7A requested Beatty to \\"stand by for target designation.\\" After receiving the target coordinates, Beatty set to work at 0738, blasting a railroad and highway junction until 0811. Her shore party later informed her that the targets had been \\"tanks and bridges.\\" In just over three hours, Beatty hurled 799 rounds at targets designated by her spotters, inflicting what she suspected was a considerable amount of damage on the enemy positions. When she left the beaches only 192 rounds remained. When she was relieved by at 1100, her crew had been at battle stations since 2024 on 9 July. Nevertheless, Beatty took station in the antisubmarine screen at 1140, and sent her men to general quarters several times during the afternoon due to air attacks on transport and beach areas. Near 1900, Beatty moved southeast of a minefield to await the formation of a convoy she had been directed to escort, and took up screening patrol south of Scoglitti, crossing the waters between Point della Camerina and Point Braccetto. At 2224, the enemy began dropping flares and bombs near Scoglitti. The flares cast their light over the ships offshore, marking them as targets. About 2230, eight flares lit up the waters south of Point Braccetto, followed by two heavy bombs. Beatty stood towards the transport area around 2246 and detected the sound of an approaching aircraft. The plane made an unusual amount of noise as it approached the beaches at Scoglitti; the crew could hear it, but not see it. At almost the same time, Beatty suffered hits on her starboard side by what were believed to be machine gun bullets. Beattys men suddenly noticed the plane pass across the ship's bow at about , \\"missing the forecastle by a few feet\\", and turned down the port side of the ship, landing in the water next to the number two stack, about away. Beattys 20 mm guns fired two bursts before the plane came to a stop in the swells alongside. At that point, Beattys sailors could see that the plane was a United States Army Air Forces C-47 Skytrain troop transport. Beatty ceased fire as six flares lit up the area. The destroyer then rang up flank speed as she pulled away from the sinking Skytrain. Beattys executive officer, Lieutenant Commander William Outerson, marked the charts with the American plane's position. After the flares had burned out, Beatty returned to the spot and found a rubber boat with all four members of the Skytrain's crew. The plane, attached to the 15th Troop Carrier Squadron, had endured quite an evening since leaving Malta with paratroops on board. She had been hit by gunfire from both friend and foe alike. The plane had disgorged her paratroops before she crash-landed at sea; her pilot, First Lieutenant P. J. Paccassi, USAAF, earned praise from Beattys commanding officer for the skill with which he had landed his badly damaged aircraft. The large amount of noise Beattys sailors had heard had been caused by one of the Skytrain's engines disintegrating. Beatty remained on antisubmarine patrol until 2100 on 12 July, when she departed the Scoglitti area in the screen for a group of transports returning to Algeria. The warship arrived at Oran on 15 July. Underway for the United States on 21 July, Beatty escorted a convoy to New York where she arrived on 3 August. Following voyage repairs at the New York Navy Yard, she again sailed for the Mediterranean on 21 August. Action soon followed her return to the Mediterranean. On 2 September, while part of the antisubmarine screen of Section II of Convoy UGF-10, bound for Bizerte, Tunisia, Beatty went to general quarters upon the report of enemy aircraft in the vicinity. None came near enough for Beatty to take them under fire, but one managed to torpedo at around 2117. Almost immediately, Beatty closed the damaged destroyer and stood guard until relieved by later that night. While anchored off Bizerte four days later, Beatty received a red alert at 2030 and again went to general quarters. Intense antiaircraft fire commenced at 2050, directed toward what later evaluation considered to have been Junkers Ju 88s. Clearing Bizerte on 7 September, the destroyer joined up with a fast US bound convoy, GUF-10, the next day. Outside a submarine contact one day out, upon which Beatty dropped depth charges, the voyage homeward proved uneventful. She reached the New York Navy Yard on 21 September for voyage repairs. =Fate= Post availability trials and further antisubmarine training were completed by 7 October when Beatty embarked upon her last transatlantic crossing. She screened a convoy to Bangor, Northern Ireland, from 7 to 17 October, and then joined the screen for Convoy KMF-25A, en route to the Mediterranean. Making rendezvous on schedule, the destroyer took her station and proceeded into the Mediterranean. Convoy KMF-25A sailed deployed in three columns, with the escorts steaming in a protective circle around the troopships and merchantmen. Beatty was steaming in the rear of the formation at 1800 on 6 November 1943. At general quarters, Beatty observed machine gun fire on the port side of the convoy at 1803. Many small pips appeared on her radar screen in the direction of , stationed on that side of the convoy. A minute after observing the gunfire, Beatty noted a large bomb explode close aboard her colleague, a glider bomb which had missed its target. Beattys radar picked up five incoming aircraft, two of which passed the port side of the convoy, inside the screen. At 1805, Beattys radar picked up two more incoming planes that showed American IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) signals. Lieutenant Commander Outerson passed the word to his main battery control to pick them up and open fire if they came within range. Control identified one as a Ju 88, but a smoke screen obscured the view over the next few moments, and radar alternatively picked up and lost contacts in the heavy haze. While Beatty strove to fight her assailants, one German plane managed to close to about 500 yards and dropped a torpedo which struck the ship near frame 124 at about 1813, only ten minutes after the start of action. The blast jammed mounts 51 and 54 in train, hurled a K-gun and a depth charge stowage rack overboard, bent the starboard propeller shaft, flooded the after engine room, cut off all electrical power, flooded a magazine and put the ship in a 12-degree list to port. A quick muster showed 11 men missing, one officer and six men injured, and a man at the battle searchlight platform fatally burned by steam. One sailor at the starboard K-gun was blown overboard, and was picked up the next morning by . The torpedo explosion in Beattys vitals broke her back at about frame 124. It left the port side of the main deck awash from the break of the forecastle to about mount 54 and only 30 inches of freeboard on the starboard side. As a result, the ship slowly settled aft. While a bucket brigade valiantly attempted to bail out the flooding compartments, Beattys sailors jettisoned practically everything from ready ammunition to her searchlight and smoke generator. Through a mistake of haste, even the towing cable went overboard as well. Hopes of saving the ship flickered for the next four hours, as Beatty battled for her life. More and more stations were secured to release men for damage control tasks until only a bridge detail and crews on two 20 mm guns remained at battle stations. Around 1900, her sailors placed her boats and rafts in the water. Forty minutes later, Beatty transferred her wounded to . As the list increased, her crew continued abandoning her until around 2230, when the last group left the ship and reached the rescue vessel, . After breaking in two, Beatty sank at 2305 on 6 November 1943. An estimated 25 German aircraft, many equipped with glider-bombs, took part in the raid, and sank two merchantmen in addition to Beatty. Awards Beatty received three battle stars for her World War II service.

In 1996 and 2013, the National Police Agency estimated that there are over 1,000 right-wing groups in Japan with about 100,000 members in total.  Their Philosophies and Activities  Uyoku dantai are well known for their highly visible propaganda vehicles, known as gaisensha () - converted vans, trucks and buses fitted with loudspeakers and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles are usually black, khaki or olive drab, and are decorated with the Imperial Seal, the flag of Japan and the Japanese military flag. They are primarily used to stage protests outside organizations such as the Chinese, Korean or Russian embassies, Chongryon facilities and media organizations, where propaganda (both taped and live) is broadcast through their loudspeakers. They can sometimes be seen driving around cities or parked in busy shopping areas, broadcasting propaganda, military music or Kimigayo, the national anthem. The Great Japan Patriots, supportive of the US-Japan- South Korea alliance against China and North Korea and against communism as a whole, would always have the US national flag flying side by side with the Japanese flag in the vehicles and US military marches played alongside their Japanese counterparts. While political beliefs differ among the groups, they are often said to hold in common three philosophies: the advocation of kokutai-Goji (retaining the fundamental character of the nation), hostility towards communism and Marxism, and hostility against the Japan Teachers Union (which opposes the display of Japanese national symbols and the performance of the national anthem). Traditionally, they view the Russia (and previously the Soviet Union), China, and North Korea with hostility over issues such as communism, the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, the Kurile Islands, and the kidnappings of Japanese citizens by North Korea. Most, but not all, seek to justify Japan's role in the Second World War to varying degrees, deny the war crimes committed by the military during the pre-1945 Sh≈çwa period and are critical of what they see as a \\"masochistic\\" bias in post-war historical education. Thus, they do not recognize the legality of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East or other allied tribunals; consider the war-criminals, enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine as \\"Martyrs of Sh≈çwa\\" ( Sh≈çwa junnansha). They support the censorship of history textbooks or historical negationism.\\"Forgiving the culprits: Japanese historical revisionism in a post-cold war context published in the International Journal of Peace Studies It is difficult to arrest uyoku dantai members because freedom of ideology is protected by the Constitution of Japan.

(Not to be confused with an 1875‚Äì1880 organization of the same name). Activities included organization of anti-communist student movements in various universities and indoctrination of youths in rural villages. On 14 November 1930, Tomeo Sagoya, a member of the society shot Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi at Tokyo Station in an assassination attempt. * ‚Äì originated from a secret society of former samurai, with an aim to restore feudal rule, Genyosha was an ultranationalist secret society. They engaged in terrorist activities such as the attempted assassination of ≈åkuma Shigenobu in 1889. It formed an extensive espionage and organized crime network throughout East Asia and agitated for Japan's military aggression. Forced to disband after the war. * ‚Äì an influential paramilitary group set up in 1901, initially to support the effort to drive Russia out of East Asia. They ran anti-Russian espionage networks in Korea, China, Manchuria, and Russia. Expanded its activities worldwide in the subsequent decades and became a small but significant ultranationalist force in mainstream politics. Forced to disband in 1946. * ‚Äì an ultranationalist secret society established by young officers within the Imperial Japanese Army in September 1930, with the goal of reorganizing the state along totalitarian militaristic lines, via a military coup d'√©tat if necessary. = Traditional groups = * ‚Äì a cultural academy set up in 1939. Runs courses related to Shinto and traditional arts such as waka (poetry) and karate. Conducted several campaigns, such as the restoration of the National Foundation Day's original status of kigensetsu (\\"Empire Day\\") and of the legal designation of Japanese era names as Japan's official calendar. * ‚Äì set up in 1951 by, and centred around, Satoshi Akao, a former anti-war member of the pre-war National Diet who was well-known at the time for his daily speeches at Sukiyabashi crossing in Ginza, Tokyo. The party advocated state ownership of industries with the Emperor as the head decision maker. They emphasized the need for solidarity with the United States and South Korea in the fight against communism. Their propaganda vans were decorated with the Stars and Stripes alongside the Japanese flag, and Akao once stated that Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima) should be blown up as it represents an obstacle to friendship with South Korea. A former party member, Otoya Yamaguchi, was responsible for the 1960 assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, the head of the Japanese Socialist Party, at a televised rally. * ‚Äì formed in 1972 as part of what was then known as the \\"new right-wing\\" movement which rejected the pro-American rhetoric of the traditional right wing. It sees the Japanese government as an American puppet state and demands \\"complete independence\\". Advocates the setting up of a new United Nations on the basis that the current UN structure is a relic of the Second World War. Fiercely critical of the Bush Administration over issues such as the Iraq War and the Kyoto Protocol. = Groups affiliated with yakuza syndicates = * ‚Äì one of the largest organizations with 2000 members. Set up by the Sumiyoshi-ikka syndicate in 1961. Since 1978, members have constructed two lighthouses and a Shinto shrine on the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai), a collection of uninhabited islets claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. In June 2000, two members of the society attacked the offices of a magazine which ran a headline which was allegedly disrespectful to then-Crown Princess Masako. * ‚Äì affiliated to the Inagawa-kai syndicate. In 1987, it conducted a bizarre campaign to smear Noboru Takeshita during his quest for the position of Prime Minister, by constantly broadcasting excessive praise of Takeshita using twenty loudspeaker trucks. The broadcasts were stopped after the intervention of Shin Kanemaru. This incident led to a series of political scandals which eventually highlighted the involvement of organized crime in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In April 2004, a bus belonging to the group rammed the gate of the Chinese consulate in Osaka, damaging the gate. Police arrested Nobuyuki Nakagama, the driver, and Ko Chong-Su, a Korean member of the group, for orchestrating the attack. * ‚Äì a Tokyo-based organization with about 700 members, officially affiliated to the Inagawa-kai syndicate. * ‚Äì a group based in Nagasaki Prefecture set up in 1981. Responsible for a number of violent incidents, including the 1991 near-fatal shooting of the mayor of Nagasaki who stated that Emperor Hirohito was responsible for the war. * ‚Äì an extreme nationalist party. The group set fire to Ichir≈ç K≈çno's house in 1963. The members were armed with guns and katana, took eight hostages, and barricaded themselves in Japan Business Federation's office in 1977. Its leader Sh≈´suke Nomura had admired Korean nationalist An Jung-geun as a patriot. On 37th election of assembly members of the House of Representatives (1983), a secretary of Shintar≈ç Ishihara defamed his opposition candidate Sh≈çkei Arai (Bak gyeong-jae/Î∞ïÍ≤ΩÏû¨) as a \\"Korean\\", the party protested hard against Shintar≈ç Ishihara. = Other groups = * ‚Äì a small neo-Nazi party headed by Kazunari Yamada, who maintains a website and blog which includes praise for Adolf Hitler and the 11 September 2001 attacks. Pictures of Yamada, a Holocaust- denier, posing with Cabinet minister Sanae Takaichi and LDP policy research chief Tomomi Inada were discovered on the website and became a source of controversy; both have denied support for the party. * ‚Äì a Japanese nationalist and conservatism group who seeks the revision of the Japanese constitution and the revision of Japanese history textbooks to whitewash Japan's actions during World War II.Right side up, 6 June 2015, The Economist * ‚Äì a Japanese nationalist and anti-immigration group who calls for the removal of state welfare and alleged privileges to Zainichi Koreans. They are anti-Korean and anti-Chinese. It has been described by the National Police Agency as a potential threat to public order due to its \\"extreme nationalist and xenophobic\\" ideology.

Biographical sketch Aleixo was born in January 25 1559. His father was Lord Dom Aloysius De Menezes, famous lord and family member of Kantlhield and mother Louisa de Norohna. After the initial education, he joined in the order of St. Augustine at the age of 15. He studied philosophy, rhetoric, theology and literature from the university Coimbra. Once, he was offered the status of the rector of the Coimbra academy, but he refused out of humility. Alexi‚Äôs desire was to work for the pastoral care of souls. Later he was appointed as the chaplain of the Portugal palace. He worked as the prior of the Augustinian monastery in santhralsa and ulsiponi. He was consecrated Archbishop of Goa in 1595, when he was only 35. As Archbishop of Goa, Menezes focused on strengthening Catholic ascendancy in Portugal. Part of this mission involved bringing the Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient body formerly part of the Church of the East, under the authority of the Catholic Church. By 1597 the last metropolitan bishop of the Saint Thomas Christians, Abraham, had died, and Menezes was able to secure the submission of Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. That year Menezes convened the Synod of Diamper, which introduced a number of forcible reforms to the church in order to be bring the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. The traditions of the Saint Thomas Christians, created during centuries of maintaining their Christian way of life in a predominantly Hindu and Muslim environment, were disregarded and overturned, and many of their holy writings were condemned as heretical and consigned to the fire. Following the Synod, Menezes consecrated Francis Ros, S. J. as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Angamal√© for the Saint Thomas Christians. In 1612 Aleixo de Menezes was appointed Archbishop of Braga, Portugal. He was viceroy of Portugal during the Philippine Dynasty from 1612 to 1615. He died in 1617, his remains are located at the Populo Church in Braga, Northern Portugal. Controversy Aleixo de Menezes, under the authority of the Goa Inquisition and the Council of Trent, continued the latinisation of the St. Thomas Christians started by the Portuguese in the early 16th century. The result of his Synod of Diamper was unfortunate. The Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) says: > The only case in which an ancient Eastern rite has been wilfully romanized > is that of the Malabar Christians, where it was not Roman authority but the > misguided zeal of Alexius de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, and his Portuguese > advisers at the Synod of Diamper (1599) which spoiled the old Malabar Rite. Nasranis gathered at Mattancherry church on Friday, 24 January 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3), and made an oath that is known as the Great Oath of Bent Cross. The following oath was read aloud and the people touching a stone-cross repeated it loudly. :: By the Father, Son and Holy Ghost that henceforth we would not adhere to the Franks, nor accept the faith of the Pope of Rome.The Missionary Register for M DCCC XXII.

Thorn was laid down on 15 November 1942 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.; sponsored by Mrs. Beatrice Fox Palmer and launched on 28 February 1943. The ship was commissioned on 1 April 1943 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Lieutenant Commander Edward Brumby in command. Service history = Atlantic service, May 1943 ‚Äì January 1944 = Following shakedown and trials out of Casco Bay, Maine, Thorn joined Destroyer Squadron 19 (DesRon 19). Between 28 May 1943 and 2 January 1944, the destroyer conducted four round-trip convoy escort mission signs on the New York‚ÄìNorfolk‚ÄìCasablanca route ‚Äî the first trip as part of Task Force 69 (TF69) and the other three as part of TF64. On her last convoy run, she escorted two oilers to Ponta Delgada, in the Azores, in company with ‚Äî the first ships to enter the port under the terms of the new agreement between the Allies and the government of Portugal. On 3 January 1944, the day after Thorn arrived back in New York harbor, blew up and sank in Ambrose Channel, astern of Thorn. Calling away the ship's motor whaleboat, Thorn sent: a rescue party to try to recover survivors. Lt. James P. Drake, USNR, and Boatswain's Mate, First Class, E. Wells were awarded Navy and Marine Corps Medals for their bravery in the rescue of three Turner survivors, and three other men received commendation bars for their part in the operation. = Southwest Pacific service, February ‚Äì September 1944 = Late in January, Thorn sailed for the Pacific and transited the Panama Canal on 29 January. Ordered to report to relieve DesRon 1 in New Guinea waters, the destroyer and her sisters of Destroyer Division 37 (DesDiv 37) headed for the southwest Pacific. Thorn was detoured to Guadalcanal and Rendova Islands to escort a detached oiler group. She finally arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 29 February. Thorn moved directly from there to Cape Sudest where, on 4 March, the destroyer embarked troops and supplies of the Army's 7th Cavalry and immediately proceeded to Los Negros Island for the invasion of the Admiralties. In addition to making three additional escort trips between Cape Sudest and Seeadler Harbor, Thorn participated in two shore bombardments of Pityilu Island, conducted antisubmarine patrols north of the Admiralties, and acted as a fighter director vessel. On 10 April ‚Äî while making a practice torpedo run during preparations for forthcoming Allied landings at Hollandia ‚Äî Thorn struck an uncharted reef. Damage to her screws and shafts forced the ship back to the West Coast for an overhaul. En route home, she escorted the battleship to Bremerton, Washington. She subsequently escorted the escort carrier from the Puget Sound Navy Yard to San Francisco, California, where she eventually arrived on 22 May. After completing her overhaul at the Hunter's Point Navy Yard, Thorn conducted refresher training and then escorted the battleship to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 August. She then escorted the battleship to Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, where she joined escort carrier Task Unit 32.7.1 (TU 32.7.1) and proceeded to the Palaus for the landings on 15 September. During this deployment as screen and plane guard, Thorn rescued the crews of three Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers which had \\"ditched.\\" = Philippines service, October ‚Äì December 1944 = Detached from escort duty at the end of September, Thorn joined the U.S. Seventh Fleet at Manus Island, in the Admiralties, on 3 October. As American forces massed for the initial assaults on the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands, Thorn joined the fire support screen for TF 77\\\\. She entered Leyte Gulf on the night of 18 October and screened battleships and cruisers during their early shore bombardments. As Allied troops swarmed ashore two days later, the destroyer provided interdiction fire at Abuyog, south of the Leyte beaches, and patrolled the southern end of Leyte Gulf for the following week. At dawn on 21 October, Thorns gunners opened fire on a Japanese Aichi D3A and sent the enemy dive bomber splashing into the sea near the transport area. On 22 October, the destroyer and the cruiser splashed another enemy aircraft. During the fierce night action at Surigao Strait, Thorn screened the American battleships as they mauled the Japanese force coming through the strait. Originally ordered to conduct a torpedo attack on the Japanese battle line, Thorn and her mates were recalled as the Japanese retreated back south through Surigao Strait. She then formed up with the lefthand flank of cruisers and destroyers and headed south to polish off the cripples from the Japanese force. The American ships came across one Japanese destroyer and smothered it with fire which summarily dispatched it to the depths. During her 17 salvoes, Thorn observed 12 hits. On the evening of 25 October, Thorns division received orders to lie-to off Homonhon Island, on the east side of Leyte Gulf, to conduct a torpedo attack on a Japanese force expected from the eastward. The enemy, however, had already retired into the San Bernardino Strait that afternoon, and the American destroyer unit was recalled on the 26th. Ordered to Ulithi, Thorn departed Philippine waters to rejoin the U.S. Third Fleet in the Carolines, for duty with the Fast Carrier Task Force (then designated TF38). From 6 to 24 November Thorn participated in TF 38's strikes against Japanese targets in the Philippines, screening and planeguarding for the fast carriers. She returned to Ulithi with TG 30.8 for duty with a logistics support group. She subsequently resumed planeguarding, this time standing by escort carriers. She assisted during Typhoon Cobra on 18 December. Following this heavy storm ‚Äî which sank three destroyers ‚Äî Thorn searched for survivors in the storm area. = Off Japan, January ‚Äì October 1945 = During the carrier strikes on Lingayen in early January 1945 and the subsequent carrier raids on Japanese shipping in the South China Sea, Thorn escorted a fast oiler group for replenishment evolutions with the aircraft carriers. While returning to the Carolines, via Leyte Gulf and the Mindoro Strait, Thorn rescued the crew of a downed TBM and the pilot of a crashed fighter before arriving at Ulithi on 27 January. The destroyer again screened oilers during the operations against Iwo Jima and also entered waters near the strategic island to screen heavy fire support units. On 21 February, Thorn and learned that the escort carrier had been struck by two Japanese kamikazes, and they rushed to aid the stricken ship. However, when they searched the scene the escort carrier had already gone to the bottom. Two days in Ulithi followed the ship's return, and, on 13 March, Thorn reformed with the U.S. 5th Fleet support group built around the cruiser for the Ry≈´ky≈´ operations. On 25 March, Thorn and made depth charge attacks on a sonar contact and observed an oil slick after the last drop. They conducted a retirement search before rejoining the formation on 26 March, but could not verify that the contact had actually been a submarine. Thorn subsequently conducted four escort missions with the replenishment group, escorting oilers into Kerama Retto to fuel the fire support ships off Okinawa and making her first run on 1 April. On the second run, Thorn observed two enemy planes splashing into the sea, victims of combat air patrol (CAP) fighters and ship gunfire. On the third, a kamikaze hit , two miles (3.7 km) astern, while another enemy kamikaze splashed alongside a nearby small patrol craft. The destroyer then spent two weeks at Ulithi, replenishing for further operations with the logistics support group. She rejoined the oilers and supply ships at sea on 28 May. On 5 June, Thorn rode out her second major typhoon, steaming through the eye of the storm at 05:30. Two days later, she joined a group of four damaged escort aircraft carriers which were retiring to Guam. On 4 July, soon after screening the CVEs out of the \\"front lines\\" for repairs, Thorn resumed work with the replenishment and support group and continued screening and supporting it through the surrender of Japan. During this period, she sank seven drifting mines. Following Japan's surrender, Thorn steamed off Tokyo Bay until 9 September, when the entire group entered Sagami Wan. The next day, the support group's base was established at the Yokosuka Naval Base, where Thorn remained through the end of September. Streaming her homeward-bound pennant, Thorn, in company with DesRon 19, steamed out of Tokyo Bay on 8 October and joined the battleships and off Wakayama the following day. On 15 October, the group sailed on the first leg of their homeward bound voyage, subsequently stopping at Singapore, Colombo, and Cape Town. The destroyer eventually arrived in New York on 7 December 1945, via St. Helena and Ascension Islands in the Atlantic. After a month's overhaul, she proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 6 May 1946. =Reserve and disposal= Thorn being sunk in 1974. Thorn lay in reserve through the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1971, the ship's hulk was authorized for use as a target and was sunk by aircraft from the aircraft carrier on 22 August 1974, approximately 75 miles (140 km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. DANFS says the ex-Thorn \\"was sunk by aircraft from in November 1973.\\" NavSource says, \\"Sunk as target off Florida 26 August 1974.\\" Several veterans of Thorn were invited to observe the SinkEx, including George D.

This controlled the junction to the Severn Valley Line until its closure in the 1970s. =Severn Valley Railway terminus= The Severn Valley Railway's southern terminus shares the same station approach road and is known as Kidderminster Town to distinguish it from the National Rail station. This also reflects the GWR tradition of suffixing the station name with \\"Town\\" if it was closer to the main body of the town served than that of its competitor(s), which Kidderminster Town achieves to the tune of around 60 yards. History Kidderminster station opened with the extension of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton railway from Worcester to Stourbridge on 1 May 1852. It became an important intermediate station on the line which became part of the West Midland Railway (WMR) in 1860. In turn, the WMR amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the South Wales Railway on 1 August 1863. The opening of the Severn Valley Railway in 1862 had no direct effect on Kidderminster because passengers wishing to use the line changed at Hartlebury. The situation changed in 1878, when a \\"loop-line\\" was opened between Bewdley and Kidderminster, linking Kidderminster with the Severn Valley Line. However, despite this most trains using the line ran through Bewdley, and then via the Wyre Forest line to Tenbury Wells or Woofferton. From about 1900, there was a brisk passenger trade of tourists and day trippers from the West Midlands conurbation. Due to dwindling passenger numbers, the Severn Valley Line closed to through traffic in 1963. North of Bewdley, the line closed completely in early 1969 when Alveley colliery was shut down and freight traffic ceased. Passenger services on the Kidderminster, Bewdley and Hartlebury section clung on until 1970. The halt of traffic to Stourport power station in 1979, and Kidderminster - Foley Park sugar corporation traffic in 1982 saw the end of regular British Rail services off the main line. =Station buildings= The earliest station building was replaced by another in 1859. In 1863 the second building was destroyed by fire, and a third station building of a mock Tudor design was built to replace it. This survived until 1968 when it was demolished owing to the effects of dry rot and replaced by British Rail in 1974 with a small utilitarian brick building.Kidderminster & District Archaeological & Historical Society Building Record of Kidderminster Railway Station. As passenger numbers grew, this building became inadequate, and funding for a new building was secured in February 2015, with a new ¬£4.3 million design announced in July 2017. Originally due to open in summer 2019, the new glass fronted building, which is twice the size of the previous one, was eventually opened in June 2020. Future The area has had upgraded signalling and a new connection to the Severn Valley Railway, enabling passenger trains to access the branch in both directions. Electrification of the route is an aspiration of Network Rail and the local rail user group. A service to/from NR metals to Bewdley has also been proposed over the years. This is finally seeing some more local interest.SLUGKidderminster SHUTTLE Gallery File:Kidderminster station, with auto-train to Bewdley geograph-2571495-by-Ben- Brooksbank.jpgKidderminster station in 1963, with auto-train to Bewdley.

She was commissioned on 15 April 1943 and sank after suffering internal explosions on 3 January 1944. Service history =Commission= Turner was named for Captain Daniel Turner and was laid down on 16 November 1942 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. and launched on 28 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Louis E. Denfeld. The ship was commissioned on 15 April 1943 at the New York Navy Yard, Lieutenant Commander Henry S. Wygant in command. =Convoy duty= Turner completed outfitting at the New York Navy Yard and then conducted shakedown and antisubmarine warfare training out of Casco Bay, Maine until early June. On the 9th, she returned to New York to prepare for her first assignment: a three-day training cruise with the newly commissioned aircraft carrier . Returning to New York on 22 June, she departed again the next day on her first real wartime assignment, service in the screen of a transatlantic convoy UGS 11. First, she sailed with a portion of that convoy to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving that same day. On 24 June, the convoy departed Hampton Roads and shaped a course eastward across the Atlantic. After an uneventful voyage, she escorted her convoy into port at Casablanca, French Morocco, on 18 July. She departed with return convoy GUS 10 on 23 July and arrived back in New York on 9 August. Later that month, she was in the screen of a convoy to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, making a brief stop at Hampton Roads along the way. On the return trip, she rendezvoused with the British carrier and accompanied her to Norfolk. =Anti-submarine duty= During the first two weeks of September, Turner conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training at Casco Bay, Maine, and then returned to New York to prepare for her second transatlantic voyage. On 21 September, the destroyer headed south to Norfolk. She arrived there on 23 September and, the following day, headed out across the Atlantic with her convoy. After an 18-day passage, during which she made one depth charge attack on a sound contact, Turner arrived at Casablanca on 12 October. Four days later, she departed again and headed for Gibraltar to join another convoy. The warship reached the strategic base on 17 October and, after two days in port, stood out to join the screen of convoy GUS 18. On the night of 23 October, Turner was acting as an advance ASW escort for the convoy when she picked up an unidentified surface contact on her SG radar. At 19:43, about 11 minutes after the initial radar contact, Turners lookouts made visual contact with what proved to be a German submarine running on the surface, decks awash, at about distance. Almost simultaneously, Turner turned hard to starboard and opened fire with her , Bofors, and Oerlikon guns. During the next few seconds, the destroyer scored one hit on the U-boat's conning tower as well as several 40- and 20-millimeter hits there and elsewhere. The submarine began to dive immediately and deprived Turner of any opportunity to ram her. However, while the U-boat made her dive, Turner began a depth-charge attack. She fired two charges from her port K-gun battery, and both appeared to hit the water just above the submerged U-boat. Then, as the destroyer swung around above the U-boat, Turner rolled a single depth charge off her stern. Soon after the three depth charges exploded, Turner crewmen heard a fourth explosion, the shock from which caused the destroyer to lose power to her SG and SD radars, to the main battery, and to her sound gear. It took her at least 15 minutes to restore power entirely. Meanwhile, she began a search for evidence to corroborate a sinking or regain contact with the target. At about 20:17, she picked up another contact on the SG radar ‚Äî located about off the port beam. Turner came left and headed toward the contact. Not long thereafter, her bridge watch sighted an object lying low in the water. Those witnesses definitely identified the object as a submarine which appeared to be sinking by the stern. Unfortunately, Turner had to break contact with the object in order to avoid a collision with another of the convoy's escorts. By the time she was able to resume her search, the object had disappeared. Turner and the destroyer escort remained in the area and conducted further searches for the submarine or for proof of her sinking but failed in both instances. All that can be said is she probably heavily damaged an enemy submarine and may have sunk her. No conclusive evidence exists to support the latter conclusion. The attacked sub may have been . =Destruction= On 24 October, the two escorts rejoined the convoy, and the crossing continued peacefully. When the convoy divided itself into two segments according to destination on 4 November, Turner took station as one of the escorts for the Norfolk-bound portion. Two days later, she saw her charges safely into port and then departed to return to New York where she arrived on 7 November. USS Turner off Sandy Hook on 3 January 1944. Following ten days in port, the warship conducted ASW exercises briefly at Casco Bay before returning to Norfolk to join another transatlantic convoy. She departed Norfolk with her third and final convoy on 23 November and saw the convoy safely across the Atlantic. On 1 January 1944, near the end of the return voyage, that convoy split into two parts according to destination as Turners previous one had done. Turner joined the New York-bound contingent and shaped a course for that port. She arrived off Ambrose Light late on 2 January and anchored. Early the following morning, the destroyer suffered a series of shattering internal explosions. By 06:50, she took on a 16¬∞ starboard list; and explosions, mostly in the ammunition stowage areas, continued to stagger the stricken destroyer. Then, at about 07:50, a singularly violent explosion caused her to capsize and sink. The tip of her bow remained above water until about 08:27 when she disappeared completely taking with her 15 officers and 123 men. After nearby ships picked up the survivors of the sunken destroyer, the injured were taken to the hospital at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

Written by Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford, the song features lyrics about Difford's marriage and features a quick tempo with a piano-based ending. Released as the debut single from the album, the song saw commercial success in the UK. It has since become a live favorite for the band and has seen positive reception from critics. Background \\"Is That Love\\" was inspired by Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford's then-recent marriage; he explained, \\"This was written around the time I got married. I remember being in the bathroom and seeing Cindy's wedding ring next to the soap, which inspired me to write the lyric. I don't think it was particularly about our marriage, but it started off a sequence of ideas in my head.\\" Difford also went on to say, \\"I'm not strapped to the song emotionally but it was a great live number and sums up being on the road and having fun. It's a comfortable pair of jeans as a song.\\" Glenn Tilbrook stated that the track was originally recorded in mid-tempo but was not coming together, \\"so we sped it up and it made more sense like that[.]\\" Tilbrook also said, \\"I was influenced quite consiously by The Beatles here.\\" Tilbrook noted that the \\"ending was [Elvis Costello's] idea, and he played the piano part accompanying it.\\" Reception =Critical reception= AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that Squeeze's \\"barbed, bouncy pop\\" is \\"best heard on the single 'Is That Love and he cited the track as a highlight from East Side Story.

Issue 1 The Varsity Ragge returned in 1934 for a single edition as a rival to On Dit. ‚Äì Adelaide University archives Name On-dit () is a term for hearsay; its most literal translation is \\"one says,\\" but French uses on similarly to the generic use of \\"they\\" in English.

In protest against French nuclear testing in the Pacific, in 1972 the editors refused to use the paper's original French-language title and substituted . History The newspaper began as a two-page broadsheet but within a few years quickly grew to four pages. The first editors were C.R. Badger (Arts), K.L. Litchfield (Law) and C.G. Kerr (Arts), by Margaret M Finnis, (1975), p 142 who published the first edition on 15 April 1932. Issue 1 Vol 1 In its early years, On Dit focussed mainly on the activities and happenings of clubs and societies at the North Terrace campus of the University of Adelaide. From the beginning, the newspaper attracted the ire of the university administration. Its very first editorial criticised certain regulations of the Barr Smith Library ‚Äì criticism not well received at the time. by Margaret M Finnis, (1975), page 144 On Dit's editorial team in its fifth year of existence, Helen Wighton and Finlay Crisp, later married. One of the paper's first successes was its campaign, in 1936, for a student-elected head of the Adelaide University Union. The paper ceased publication in 1941 due to World War II, but resumed again in 1944. While the paper charged a low price to its readers in its first decades, it switched to free distribution in the 1960s and remains so to this day, supporting itself with advertising and funds from the AUU. In its early years it was an organ of the Student Representative Council, which later became the Students' Association of the University of Adelaide (a body which did not survive voluntary student unionism (VSU), and therefore has since been replaced by the Adelaide University Student Representative Council). Today, On Dit is a publication of the Adelaide University Union. During the 1950s and 1960s the paper attempted to resemble a professionally designed newspaper. This evolved into the Dynasty era during the 1970s and 1980s. During the latter period, the paper broke major stories. By this time, On Dit had developed a very good reputation both within the state and nationally . On Dit was considered an alternative vehicle to attending media schools for budding reporters. One problem many editors struggled with was encouraging submissions and news from University of Adelaide campuses other than the North Terrace site. In the 1968 March orientation issue, On Dit published an issue largely dedicated to supporting a student demonstration against the gerrymander that benefited the Coalition government, then headed by South Australian politician Thomas Playford. That same year saw On Dit publish editorials on the use of torture in Vietnam, and on Australia's treatment of Aboriginals, in keeping with the activism of much of the student press at the time. In March 1991, University student Maria O'Brien wrote a controversial piece in On Dit about the misogyny she experienced during her two years at St Mark's College, one of the residential colleges at the University of Adelaide. That same year, a 21-year-old female student at the college was assaulted and murdered by one of the male students. In 2006, Edition 10 (Sexuality) of On Dit was stolen. It contained an article by 'Pandora' which gave a view on the upcoming Adelaide University Union elections that was largely favourable to some candidates while disdainful towards others (in one instance likening the then Adelaide University Union President to Lord of the Rings character Gollum, and labelling him a 'neo- fascist'). Vol 74 No 11, page 28 Several editions survived. The one held by the Barr Smith Library is available to read online., Vol 74 No 11 2006 was the first year in its long history that two women edited the newspaper. Format For many years the paper was printed in a tabloid format on standard newsprint. This was changed to a magazine (half-tabloid newsprint) format early in 2006 to help the paper cope with financial uncertainty brought about by Voluntary Student Unionism (VSU). Vol 74 No 11 The other change caused by VSU was the paper going from a weekly to fortnightly publication, making Honi Soit the only weekly student publication in Australia. Some issues of On Dit conform to a certain theme, reflected in the graphical style, and occasionally in the articles within it. One such yearly edition is entitled Elle Dit, written primarily or exclusively by women once a year. In more recent years the paper has better resembled other free street press, though with more artistic (or at any rate abstract) covers, usually eschewing headlines, and a focus more broadly on commentary, politics and pop culture than on the popular music common to the format. On Dit is usually distributed outside the university in similar locations to other street press publications. Editorial staff Prior to 2007, in a typical year there were two or three paid editors, elected by the student body the previous year, who planned the paper. The paid editors were assisted by unpaid sub-editors, columnists and other contributors who researched and wrote individual sections. On Dit is unusual among student papers in that for much of its existence it has remained independent of the prevailing political parties on campus. In 2007, the Student Union voted to remove salaries from the editors (by way of comparison, the 3 editors in 1997 split an annual A$30,000 between them). Because of Voluntary Student Unionism, the editors now have to secure some of their funding from advertising space, and the paper has gone from a weekly broadsheet to a smaller fortnightly magazine. =Prominent past editors= Prominent past editors include former South Australia State Premier the Hon.

In 1975 they released an album entitled The Yetties of Yetminster. In 2007 The Yetties celebrated 40 years as a professional folk band. History The Yetties performing at Farnham Beer Festival in 2008 There are two ex-members: Bob Common and Roger Trim. The former left during the 1970s, to spend more time with his family. Until Trim joined, The Yetties then operated as a trio. Trim introduced fiddle-playing to the group and their sound changed somewhat during his stay. Since the latter's departure, The Yetties have again operated as a trio. Sartin was lead singer and group-compere, addressing the audience more than the other two. However, his colleagues both led some songs and both joked with the audience. Shutler played keyboard, though mainly he was a very accomplished accordion player; McCulloch played guitar and banjo. Since turning professional in 1967, their music took them from Dorset all over the UK; appearing extensively in Europe and, under the auspices of the British Council, they performed successfully in many countries, including Thailand, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, Sudan, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, the Philippines, Ethiopia and Canada. One of the secrets of their success, and way of breaking down language barriers, has been their knack of audience participation. Over the years they recorded 45 albums (on various labels). Most of these were a mixture of songs, instrumental folk- dance music and poetry. They also undertook topic-based projects. The famous Dorset writer, Thomas Hardy, was also a musician; he and his family, over several generations, collected hundreds of folk tunes. The Yetties made two recordings on Thomas Hardy's own fiddle and other Hardy family instruments. Another Yetties' projects involved recording a collection of songs and stories about cricketers of the past with Hampshire's John Arlott. The Yetties broadcast a regular BBC Radio 2 series, 'Cider & Song'. They also made numerous other radio and television appearances. Because of their popularity, they were often asked back to locations, becoming regular performers at various annual events, including the Farnham Beer Exhibition and many more. The Yetties lived in Sherborne (a few miles from Yetminster) and drew on their personal experiences of country life for their concert programmes. Some songs recalled life when they were children, helping farmers harvest; scrumping apples; raiding hedges, fields and woods for food and eating rabbit for seemingly every meal. They talked of village characters and village occasions, conveying an atmosphere of bygone village society. Retirement The Yetties announced their retirement in early 2010, and their final performance was a ceilidh and concert at Sherborne in April 2011. On the evening of 21 September 2014, it was announced on the official Yetties website that Pete Shutler had died in Sherborne Hospital.

Containing the only west-facing harbour entrance on the east coast of England, Beadnell is a tourist base, the town consisting largely of holiday homes, with some small- scale fishing. Two large caravan sites neighbour the village, as well as a handful of campsites. The Craster Arms The parish church is the Anglican Church of St. Ebba (named after Saint √Übbe the Elder, founder of abbeys and daughter of King √Üthelfrith), built in the eighteenth century as a chapel and rebuilt in 1860.. A sixteenth-century pele tower remains as part of the public house, The Craster Arms. Near the harbour are historic limekilns dating from 1747, which were later used for curing herring. They are now owned by the National Trust. Beadnell is within the North Northumberland Heritage Coast and the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Beadnell Bay, a sandy beach stretching to the south, contains a nationally important colony of little tern and the largest mainland colony of Arctic tern in the United Kingdom.

It is one of the most expensive in the world of its genre. Also, unlike most adult films based on mainstream films, it is not a parody, but rather a straightforward remake of Ridley Scott's 2000 film Gladiator. The Private Gladiator trilogy was produced on November 28, 2001, total length - 351 minutes. It won the 2003 AVN award for Best Foreign Feature. Storyline The movie is set in 180 AD, and focuses on a Roman general who is on his way to becoming Emperor, also known as Caesar. A jealous man in power decides to usurp the general's destiny and sets in motion a power play to become leader himself. By stripping the general (Toni Ribas) of all his rank and power, then sending him to become a slave who must fight in the arena to entertain the citizens, the thought is that the general will die an early death and never bother him again. Needless to say, the general survives, and thrives, which makes him become a threat to those who stole his position. =In the City of Lust= General Maximus, after becoming a slave, returns to Rome to take revenge on Commodus. But in order to do so, he must first become a gladiator, win glory in the arena, make himself loved by the public, and become a myth. When he arrives in the city, he meets Domitila, Caesar's cousin, and an old love of his. Upon seeing him again, she gives free rein to her passion, but then must do battle with Siria, the slave- girl who is with Maximus. After the fields of battle, Maximus must fight again in the arena at the Colosseum, against gladiators and savage beasts. This second thrilling episode of the saga is also a faithful reconstruction of the amatory arts of Roman women, whether they were patricians with an itch to scratch, or unbridled plebeian women given to sodomy and gangbangs. The orgies in the lupanars and the parties held by Commodus and his henchmen bring to life a series of highly erotic and shocking sex scenes, with disturbing and sinful women, lovers of debauchery and proud of their arts.

The northern section of it is a canal, and the southern section is part of the River Hull. Construction was authorised in 1767, and it was fully open in 1770. Early use of the navigation was hampered by a small bridge at Hull Bridge, which was maintained by Beverley Corporation. After protracted negotiation, it was finally replaced in 1804, and a new lock was built to improve water levels at the same time. One curious feature of the new works were that they were managed quite separately for many years, with the original navigation called the Old Navigation, and the new works called the New Navigation. They were not fully amalgamated until 1888. The navigation gradually became more profitable, and although railways arrived at Driffield in 1846, the navigation continued to prosper and increase its traffic until the 1870s, after which there was a gradual decline. It continued to make a small profit until the 1930s, and the last commercial traffic was in 1951. Following proposals to use it as a water supply channel in 1959, the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association was formed in 1968, with the aim of restoring the waterway to a navigable condition. One problem was that there was no longer a legal body responsible for the assets, and so the Driffield Navigation Trust was formed, which took over the role of the original commissioners. Since that time, most of the navigation has been returned to a navigable condition, although there are still some obstacles to its full use, caused by bridges which have been lowered or built since the 1950s. Location The Driffield Navigation is formed from parts of the River Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and a section of canal. It starts near Beverley, at the point where Aike Beck used to join the river, and is tidal to Struncheon Hill lock. Above the lock, it runs through an artificial cut, to rejoin the river until it reaches Emmotland. The Corpslanding branch follows the original course of the river, while the main navigation channel follows Frodingham Beck to Fisholme junction. The Beck forms a branch to North Frodingham, while the main line continues as a canal through the Holderness Plain to the small market town of Driffield. The Leven Canal used to leave the navigation, in the tidal river section north of Hull Bridge, but is no longer connected to the river. History The River Hull has long been used for transport, and although small boats could reach Fishilme in the 1760s, that was still about short of the small town of Driffield. In 1765, the merchants of the town, with those from Kilham, beyond it, approached the canal engineer John Smeaton for advice on how keels could reach Driffield. He suggested a cut from near Wansford to Driffield Beck. One lock would be required to accommodate the difference in levels, and he estimated the construction cost as ¬£2,586. No action was taken, but John Grundy was consulted, and suggested a larger scheme in December 1766. This involved a cut from Fisholme to Driffield, with a basin in the town, and improvements to Frodingham Beck, to make it navigable to the bridge at Frodingham. Grundy's proposal formed the basis for an Act of Parliament which was granted in May 1767. The preamble read: > An Act for improving the Navigation of the River Hull and Frodingham Beck, > from Aike Beck Mouth to the Clough, on the East Corner of Fisholme, and for > extending the said Navigation, from the said Clough, into or near the Town > of Great Driffield, in the East Riding of the County of York. Commissioners were appointed, who had powers to borrow money, with which to fund the construction of the canal. They also had powers over the River Hull below the canal, as far down at Aike Beck. There were teething problems. A local man called Richard Porter was appointed as engineer, but was replaced six weeks later by Samuel Allam, on the recommendation of Grundy. Two contractors were appointed in October 1767, but gave up, and were replaced by a partnership between James Pinkerton and James Dyson, who ultimately built the whole canal, including a culvert in Driffield to provide a water supply. The canal opened progressively, with the first section completed on 12 December 1768, the next section to Wansford open by 25 May 1769, and the whole canal formally opened on 25 May 1770. The distance by canal from Emmotland to Driffield was , a reduction of on the distance by river. The cost of the work was around ¬£13,000, which was more than the original estimate, and there were insufficient funds to pay Pinkerton for his work. Interest was paid on the amount outstanding until the bill could be paid. The original plans for the canal section of the navigation included four locks, each of which was timber floored, and built to accommodate \\"Driffield-sized\\" Humber keels of . Keels could carry a maximum of 100 tons but were limited to a maximum of 70 tons in the Navigation due to draft limits. The initial locks were: #Sheepwash Lock (now known as Town Lock) #Whinhill Lock #Wansford Lock #Snakeholme Lock In 1776 the commissioners raised an additional ¬£2,000, with which they hoped to construct a new lock at Thornham Bottoms, below Snakeholme, and to dredge the river below that. Instead they opted to convert Snakeholme lock into a two- lock staircase, which allowed vessels to use it over a greater range in water levels. Plans to extend their powers below Aike Beck, so that Hull Bridge at Tickton could be made larger were thwarted by Beverley Corporation in 1777, but some dredging of Frodingham Beck took place. The first recorded dredging between Emmotland and Aike Beck took place in 1783, and subsequently dredging was a prominent item in the accounts. The expected dividends of 5 per cent did not materialise, but dividends were paid in most years after 1774, starting at 1.5 per cent and rising to 4 per cent by 1790. By 1784, the navigation was making enough profit for the commissioners to build a warehouse and granary at Driffield. =Development= The 1790s were a period of prosperity for the navigation, as trade increased. In 1796 George Knowsley, a banker who was one of the mortgagees, proposed further improvements, but although William Chapman produced plans, they were considered too expensive. Two years later, the commissioners were working with William Wilberforce, their local Member of Parliament, to ensure that the proposals for the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Bill would not adversely affect them. In 1797, they considered again the problems posed by the small opening beneath Hull Bridge, and although Beverley Corporation initially said that they would never alter it, an agreement was reached after protracted negotiations, and in July 1801, an Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise its replacement. The new bridge was operational by April 1804, half the cost having been met by Richard Bethell, owner of the Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing beneath the bridge were significantly reduced. The Act also authorised the construction of a towpath from the bridge to Fisholme and Frodingham bridge, a towpath to Corps Landing, a new lock and a cut to remove a large bend in the river. A towpath between Beverley Beck and the bridge was dropped from the plans to secure the co-operation of Beverley Corporation. Chapman was the official engineer for the improvements, with Thomas Atkinson appointed to carry out the river works. A new lock was built at Struncheon Hill, above which a new cut long connected it to Fisholme. This work was completed by 1805; work on the navigation to Corps Landing was not completed until 1811, and did not include an authorised new cut. The cost of the work was ¬£6,143. One curious feature of the new works was that it was managed as a completely separate entity, with separate tolls, bank accounts and minutes, until the old navigation and the new navigation were amalgamated, partially in 1817 and fully in 1882. The new navigation soon paid its way and had repaid its debts by 1820. The old navigation was able to pay dividends of 5 per cent from 1797, and established a sinking fund in 1834, which enabled it to repay all arrears on interest by 1844. The commissioners took legal advice in 1824, and once satisfied that they were empowered to do so, built public wharves at Corps Landing and Frodingham Bridge, which were completed in 1825 and 1826. A new warehouse was completed at Driffield in 1826, and traffic increased, helped by reductions in the tolls as the navigation companies paid off their debts. When a bill to authorise the building of Hull docks was before Parliament, the commissioners unsuccessfully attempted to insert a clause giving free passage to boats from the Navigation which passed through the lower river but did not use the dock facilities. Even with the advent of the railway in 1846, the canal continued to flourish. Plans to make improvements were deferred in 1845, when the effect of the railways was unknown, but although the Hull and Bridlington Railway opened a station at Driffield in 1846, a proposed branch to Frodingham, which would have offered serious competition, was not built. Plans were drawn up for further improvements in 1855, but the bill to authorise the work was defeated over concerns about flooding. However, by 1870, trade started to decrease. Despite this, the commissioners bought a steam dredger in 1898, which kept the channel in good order, and earned some revenue, as it was hired out to Beverley Corporation and Joseph Rank. By 1922 the tolls were ¬£714 and the profits ¬£88. In 1931 receipts were ¬£414 and the profits down to ¬£11. This figure included ¬£7, which was obtained from pleasure boats using the navigation. Decline With less traffic, lower profits, and little prospect of a growth in trade, maintenance standards fell. By 1937 the Locks and Bridges were in a poor state of repair. A report in 1939 records that the canal was weedy throughout its entire length. Water began to leak through the Banks between Whinhill and Snakeholme Lock and a real danger to the surrounding land drainage was evident. Some dredging was carried out during the early 1940s but this did little to improve the condition of the Canal. The last commercial craft to reach Driffield was the Keel Caroline loaded with 50 tons of wheat on 16 March 1945. The last commercial craft on the Navigation was the vessel Ousefleet, delivering coal to Frodingham Wharf during the period to December 1951. With the demise of commercial navigation, the interest of the Commissioners waned. They failed to appoint their own successors, and by 1949, there were too few remaining to take legal decisions. In 1955, the swing bridge across the navigation at Whinhill was fixed, although the Inland Waterways Association received the assurance that, if at any future date the navigation was reopened to Driffield, the bridge would be removed. Another major obstruction to the renewal of the navigation to Driffield occurred in 1967, when the County Council replaced the bridge which carries the public right of way over the Navigation at Wansford with a fixed bridge. Since the Commissioners could not agree to this, as they were inquorate, the legality of this action is unknown. Restoration By 1956, the top three locks on the canal were no longer usable, but Hull Corporation announced a plan to use the channel for the supply of water in mid-1959. This action prompted the Inland Waterways Association to calculate the cost of restoring it for navigation, which was estimated at ¬£17,000, and a local campaign to press for this began. In 1968 the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association (DNAA) was formed to pursue these aims. All of the original Commissioners had died, and as no new ones had been appointed, there was no legal ownership of the navigation. The Amenities Association therefore set up a charitable trust, which the Charity Commissioners recognised, and the trustees of the Driffield Navigation Trust became the new commissioners, with responsibility for the waterway. This paved the way for the two organisations to begin restoring the waterway in 1978, although access to the lower reaches had already been made possible by renovation of Bethels Bridge, a low-level swing bridge, which was completed at Easter 1977. Volunteers kept the remaining navigation structures working to allow navigation to Brigham, and North Frodingham, but since then, grants have become available to fund the restoration of new sections. In 1996 Town Lock was restored completely by volunteers and fund raising. This effort helped to obtain further grants, and in 2003 two major obstacles were officially opened. Brigham swing bridge, last opened in the 1960s and then replaced by a fixed structure in the 1970s, was restored to full operation. This allowed navigation to Snakeholme Lock, away. Snakeholme lock was officially opened later the same year, though a fixed bridge over the tail of the lock limits headroom to . There are plans to replace it with a swing bridge. In the same year, the engineering consultants W. S. Atkins recommended that the navigation should be restored to its original terminus in Driffield, and estimated that this would cost some ¬£6.4 million. Against the cost, they estimated that benefits to the local economy would exceed ¬£310,000 per year. In 2005, Whinhill Lock was restored, and opened to navigation, although another fixed farm access bridge had been placed over the lock chamber, and limited use to boats of in length or less. The necessary funding to restore the lock at Wansford was secured in mid 2008 and work commenced later the same year. The first priority was the creation of a flood relief channel (bywash) around the south side of the lock to carry the excess flow during periods of heavy rain. This work was completed in autumn 2008. The final stages of the restoration were completed during spring and early summer of 2009. The new gates were installed during April and May and considerable restoration work was carried out on the north wall of the lock chamber. The stop planks were removed and the lock was commissioned on 30 May 2009, with the first boat in over 60 years entering the lock.

Herndon was launched on 2 February 1942 by the Norfolk Navy Yard, sponsored by Lucy Herndon Crockett, great-grandniece of Comdr. Herndon, and commissioned on 20 December 1942, Comdr. Granville A. Moore in command. Service history =Atlantic service= After shakedown off the Maine coast, Herndon escorted a convoy from New York City to Casablanca, returning to New York 14 May 1943 escorting a tanker. Sailing from Norfolk on 8 June, she reached Algiers on 24 June and prepared for a key role in the Sicilian campaign. As Allied amphibious forces under the overall command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the initial strike at \\"the soft underbelly of Europe\\" 10 July 1943, Herndon performed antisubmarine patrol duty as well as fire support for Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. 7th Army and General Bernard L. Montgomery's British 8th Army. Departing the Mediterranean on 3 August, Herndon on spent the next nine months escorting troopships across the Atlantic from New York to various British ports as the massive buildup for the invasion of France hit full strike. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, Herndon was off Omaha Beach, down front in \\"Bald-headed Row\\" ahead of the first assault waves. Despite heavy counter fire from enemy batteries, she bombarded enemy targets ashore. Herndon remained off the Normandy beaches providing fire support, screening troopships, and antisubmarine patrol until 19 June, when she served as a screen for Allied landings at Baie de la Seine. Further screening duties followed until 11 July, when she reported to Belfast for training as an escort in the Mediterranean. Operation Anvil was the Allies' next major operation. Herndon was part of the joint task force screening aircraft carriers on 16 August when the invasion of southern France was begun. The destroyer remained in the Mediterranean until sailing for New York on 3 September. After two weeks of experimental operations in Chesapeake Bay for the Naval Research Laboratory, Herndon headed back toward the Mediterranean as a convoy escort on 14 October. Returning to the United States on 12 November, she conducted battle exercises in Casco Bay and escorted convoys along the Atlantic coast through February 1945. In that month. Herndon escorted President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the first leg of his voyage to the historic Yalta Conference. =Pacific Service= The destroyer and her crew turned south 21 April 1945 and headed for the still-hot war in the Pacific, reaching Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal and San Diego on 15 May. After training exercises and duty as a carrier plane guard, Herndon sailed to Eniwetok on 12 July and remained in the rear area escorting convoys between Eniwetok, Guam, and Saipan through the end of the long Pacific war. Japanese capitulation came at last with the formal signing of the surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September, and Herndon proceeded to the China coast to enforce provisions of the peace. Reaching Dairen, Manchuria on 10 September, she continued to Tsingtao, China 16 September. On that day Japanese Vice Admiral Kanako, and his staff came aboard Herndon to sign and implement the unconditional surrender of all Japanese-controlled combatant and merchant vessels in the Tsingtao area. =Post World War II and fate= Herndon spent the fall and winter escorting Japanese prize vessels along the coast, patrolling the Korean and China coasts, and assisting the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and the movement of Chinese Nationalist troops. On 5 December 1945 she was detached from this duty to participate in Operation Magic Carpet, the transfer of troops from the Pacific to the United States, and reached San Diego via Shanghai, Eniwetok, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor on 27 December. After disembarking some of the troops, Herndon continued on to New York with the rest, arriving 15 January 1946. Herndon arrived Charleston on 28 January 1946 and decommissioned there 8 May and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was moved to Philadelphia on January 1947 and in June 1965 was transferred to Orange, Texas under LTJG Robert M. Mead, USN, Officer-in- Charge. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1971, Herndon was sunk as a target off Florida on 24 May 1973. Herndon received three battle stars for World War II service.

(2010-12-01). In Surfing. 46 (12), 112(1). History The area was pioneered by Donald Fleming who, in partnership with Arthur Nicol, took up land in the area including Gnaraloo. At the time it was known as \\"Flemington\\". He later sold it to Frank Mottram but stayed in the area until 1935. In 1908 the station was in size and was held by Forrest, Emanuel and Co. who paid a ¬£70 rental on the property. Under Mottram's ownership in 1910, the station was running about 1,500 sheep with the flock increasing in size to 3,554 in 1911 despite no stock being bought in that time. Following a good season another 800 lambs were tailed in 1912 increasing the size of the flock further. The Mottrams sold the lease to Dansy Powell and Harry Cordes in 1921, with a flock of 9,000 sheep and now encompassing an area of with the lease due to expire in 1948. The property was advertised with dividing it into 12 paddocks with 9 wells, 8 with windmills, tanks and troughs. The homestead had three large rooms, an office and a store room with a detached stone kitchen. The station had a good year in 1922 with 9,000 sheep shorn and with an estimated 1,500 stragglers to be mustered and clipped. 223 bales of wool were produced, and the stock were all reported to be in good condition. Powell and Cordes sold the station in 1927 to a partnership between Alex Fleming and George Baden Powell. It station was sold again in 1928 when the Gnaraloo Pastoral Company formed between the Fleming and Powell families was dissolved; the Fleming family came to own the station outright again with Donald's son, Alex Fleming owning the station from 1928 until at least 1954. Gnaraloo remained in the Fleming family until 1975. In 2015 the station owners had to renegotiate the lease agreement with the state government, including having the government excise sections of pastoral land along the world-heritage listed Ningaloo Coast from the property, for conservation and tourism ventures. Geography Gnaraloo Bay =Topography and surrounding regions= The homestead property is located on elevated ground approximately east of the coast and west of Lake MacLeod. The station has an area of with approximately of coastline. Gnaraloo Bay contains four stretches of sandy beaches. They are paralleled by a near-continuous wide barrier reef off in the adjacent waters. The main beach is the Gnaraloo beach, located about south of the homestead and about in length. Nine Mile Bore and Cape Farquhar, each with three beaches, are located north of Gnaraloo Bay, just before Ningaloo. Red Bluff and the Quobba homestead are located at the south. =Climate= Gnaraloo has a mean and median annual rainfall of respectively. Most of which falls in May to July. The annual evaporation is c. . The area received heavy rains in 1953 with Gnaraloo being deluged with 610 points (155 mm, 6.1 in) of rain over two days. Surrounding stations received falls of up to . Transportation Gnaraloo can be reached by land from Carnarvon through the Gnaraloo road. A small airstrip is also present just outside the Gnaraloo leased area, but there are no scheduled flights. The airstrip was slated for an upgrade in 2008 to allow better access for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Conservation Gnaraloo station commenced its turtle conservation program in 2008 under the guidance and direction of the WA Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). The Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program (GTCP) does daily patrols for the entire loggerhead nesting season (November‚ÄìFebruary). A feral animal control program was implemented in 2009 to work alongside the sea turtle conservation program due to introduced predators being an environmental risk to sea turtle nest success.

Biography Yecke holds a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Hawaii, a master's of science degree in teaching from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the University of Virginia. Yecke served on the Virginia State Board of Education under Governor George Allen (1995‚Äì1998) and then was Virginia's Deputy Secretary of Education (1998‚Äì2001) and Secretary of Education (2001-2002) under Governor Jim Gilmore. She also served as the Director of Teacher Quality and Public School Choice at the U.S. Department of Education for the Bush administration (2002‚Äì2003), during which time she was detailed to the White House as a senior advisor for USA Freedom Corps. Yecke then became the Commissioner of Education for the State of Minnesota for Governor Tim Pawlenty (2003‚Äì2004). As Minnesota's education commissioner, Yecke drew criticism in what was a tumultuous political battle between the newly elected governor and the DFL-controlled Senate. Yecke held her job from January 2003 to May 2004 before being forced out in a party-line vote. She then worked as a senior fellow at the Minnesota-based conservative think tank Center of the American Experiment for education and social policy, but has not been associated with the group since 2005. Yecke ran as a Republican for Congress in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District before being offered a job in Florida as Gov. Jeb Bush's Chancellor of K-12 Education, a position she took up on October 3, 2005. Yecke had previously announced her run for the Florida state education commissioner's chair earlier in 2007, and had been among the list of three finalists being considered. However, it was announced on Oct. 8, 2007, that the position was given to Eric J. Smith, a senior vice president with the New York-based College Board. Having lost her bid for education commissioner, Florida's top public schools job, Yecke resigned as Florida's kindergarten-through-12th-grade chancellor in December 2007.Jeb Bush ally Yecke out as state K-12 chancellor Associated Press, December 20, 2007. From 2008 to 2015, Yecke served as Dean of Graduate Programs for Harding University. Harding is a private liberal arts Christian university located in Searcy, Arkansas. She was considered a contender for president of the university after former President David Burks retired. She is now retired and lives in Searcy, Arkansas.  Controversy  =Intelligent design and Teach The Controversy= In July 2003 during her term as education commissioner, Yecke proposed that the Minnesota Science Standards include a technique favored by intelligent design proponents called Teach The Controversy in science curriculum. She cited the pro-intelligent design Santorum Amendment as supporting her effort.Conflict evolves in science standards debate John Welbers. St. Paul Pioneer Press, July 18, 2003. The versions of the Minnesota Science Standards circulated by Yecke contained language used by intelligent design advocates in the Teach The Controversy campaign which casts doubt on evolution while offering intelligent design as a competing theory.

In her campaign to be Florida's next education commissioner, Yecke has attempted to groom her reputation online.\\"Dr. Cheri Pierson Yecke, K-12 chancellor for Florida's Department of Education, has apparently hired a company called ReputationDefender to search the Internet for information about her and, on her behalf, challenge items she disputes. Florida Citizens for Science member Dr. Wesley Elsberry recently received an e-mail from the organization asking him to remove or modify a quote he has on his personal website about Yecke. The quote was taken from a Minnesota newspaper that reported Yecke specifically had included a go-ahead to schools in that state to incorporate 'intelligent design' into science benchmarks in 2003. Yecke was the Minnesota Commissioner of Education at that time.\\" Yecke Information Challenged Florida Citizens for Science, June 25, 2007. In June 2007, she disputed the accuracy of a 2003 newspaper article which reported her as saying that the Minnesota state education department policy supported schools deciding whether to include intelligent design in science curricula, and hired the Internet accuracy-watchdog service ReputationDefender as her advocate. Wesley R. Elsberry, marine biologist and critic of intelligent design whose blog The Austringer had referenced the article linking Yecke to the Teach The Controversy method of promoting intelligent design was contacted by ReputationDefender in June 2007. They requested that he remove a quote from Yecke on the issue of teaching creationism and intelligent design on the grounds that she disputes the quote in the original newspaper article. In considering the request Elsberry has asked for proof that the newspaper article did indeed quote Yecke inaccurately, going so far to contact the original reporter. Readers of blog then provided links to archived recordings of Twin Cities Public Television broadcasts from 2003 showing Yecke saying that teaching intelligent design was a decision local school districts could undertake and teaching intelligent design is supported by the Santorum Amendment.Yecke in Her Own Words Wesley R. Elsberry. The Austringer, June 29, 2007. Elsberry says her statements in these broadcasts are consistent with the quote Yecke disputed and tried to remove in the newspaper article. PZ Myers, who had commented extensively on Yecke's support of intelligent design in the past,Minnesota education standards and creationism PZ Myers.

During her tenure as Minnesota's education commissioner in 2003, Yecke's husband was appointed as a deputy commissioner with the state's economic development agency by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty during a hiring freeze. Again, in 2005, this time as the K-12 education chancellor in Florida, Yecke's husband was hired as the deputy secretary of professional regulations by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). This hiring later raised questions by politicians whether his qualifications did not significantly distinguish him from the rest of the qualified candidate pool available in Florida. However, the Florida Department of Education pointed out that \\"there was 'absolutely' no discussion of a job for her husband\\" and DBPR secretary Simone Marstiller said that \\"she was 'taken aback'\\" by the concerns, \\"calling his qualifications 'very impressive.'\\"Husband's Hiring Raises Concerns Joe Follick.

Shubrick. Shubrick was laid down on 17 February 1942 by the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, launched on 18 April 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Grosvenor Bemis, great-great-granddaughter of R.Adm. Shubrick; and commissioned on 7 February 1943, Lieutenant Commander Louis A. Bryan in command. Service history =Operation Husky= After shakedown, Shubrick sailed for North Africa with a large convoy on 8 June 1943. Reaching her destination, she prepared for Operation Husky and, on 10 July, provided fire support for the Amphibious Battle of Gela, Sicily. She engaged enemy shore batteries and broke up an enemy tank concentration, then retired to protect the transports offshore. On 11 and 12 July, she shot down two aircraft. After two trips to Bizerte and another period of shore bombardment, she escorted the cruiser to Palermo. There, during a night air raid on 4 August, Shubrick was hit amidships by a bomb which caused flooding of two main machinery spaces and left the ship without power. Nine were killed and 20 wounded in the attack. The damaged destroyer was towed by into the inner harbor for emergency repairs and then to Malta for drydocking. Using one screw, the ship returned to the United States, arriving in New York on 9 October for permanent repairs. =Operation Overlord= After completion of repairs and refresher training in January 1944, Shubrick made two convoy runs to Europe and back before joining the Normandy bombardment group in Belfast. After escorting the battleship and five cruisers to the Normandy beaches Shubrick took her own fire support station and, at 05:50 on 6 June, opened fire on her preassigned targets. She continued her fire as the troops landed, then checked her fire at 06:30 to avoid hitting friendly forces. A third battery of German field cannon, part of the Maisy battery complex between Omaha and Utah landing beaches was targeted and destroyed by Shubrick on 8 June 1944. She remained off the Normandy beaches for over a month, performing escort duties, fire support missions and anti-motor torpedo boat and anti- submarine patrols, with trips to England for replenishment. On 27 June, she escorted six American PT boats to Cherbourg. There, the patrol craft reconnoitered enemy defenses by drawing their fire. Shubrick herself came under fire before the mission was completed. She left Normandy for the last time on 11 July and, five days later, joined a task group bound for the Mediterranean. =Operation Dragoon= On 12 August, Shubrick sailed from Malta with four escort carriers and five other destroyers to provide air cover for the landings in southern France on 15 August. Aside from float lights dropped on the evening after the landings, the force encountered no enemy opposition and was disbanded on 30 August. On 6 September, Shubrick sailed from Oran for overhaul in the United States. =Transfer to Pacific= After overhaul, Shubrick made a convoy trip to Taranto, Italy, and then conducted training along the east coast of the United States. On 1 February 1945, she transited the Panama Canal to join the U.S. Pacific Fleet. After additional training, she departed from Pearl Harbor on 21 April escorting the battleship to Okinawa. On 12 May, she and one other destroyer supported the landings at Tori Shima and shot down two attacking aircraft. Shubrick completed one radar picket patrol in mid-May, but, on her way to her second, she was attacked at 00:10, 29 May 1945, by two kamikaze aircraft, one of which crashed into the ship. The bomb carried by the plane blew a hole in the starboard side, and further damage was done when one of the ship's depth charges exploded. At first the situation looked grim. The destroyer came alongside at 01:13 and removed classified material and all wounded and unnecessary personnel. However, the crew finally controlled the flooding, and Shubrick was towed to Kerama Retto by . The ship lost 35 men killed and missing, and 25 wounded in the attack. =Post World War II and fate= Shubrick underwent emergency repairs until 15 July, when she began the trip back to the United States on one engine, arriving at Puget Sound Navy Yard on 10 August. On 17 August, due to the end of the war, the Bureau of Ships decided not to repair the damage. The destroyer was decommissioned on 16 November 1945 and struck from the Navy list on 28 November. Later sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, for scrapping, her hulk was removed on 28 September 1947. Shubrick received four battle stars for her World War II service.

Luteolin is the principal yellow dye compound that is obtained from the plant Reseda luteola, which has been used as a source of the dye since at least the first millennium B.C. Luteolin was first isolated in pure form, and named, in 1829 by the French chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul. Chevreul named luteolin on p. 144: \\"J'ai fait des recherches sur la composition de la gaude, j'ai obtenu le principe colorant critalis√© par sublimation; je l'ai nomm√© lut√©olin.\\" (I have done some research on the composition of weld; I obtained the principal colorant [which I] crystallized via sublimation; I have called it \\"luteolin\\".)However, Perkin claimed (without citing a source) that Chevreul had isolated luteolin as early as 1814‚Äì1815. See: Luteolin's empirical formula was determined by the Austrian chemists Heinrich Hlasiwetz and Leopold Pfaundler in 1864. ; see pp. 44‚Äì45. Hlasiwetz and Pfaundler melted quercitrin with potassium carbonate. Among the reaction's products, they found paradatiscetin, whose empirical formula they determined to be C15H10O6 (p. 94). They concluded that although luteolin and paradatiscetin were isomeric (i.e., had the same empirical formula), they were distinct compounds. From p. 94: \\"Das Luteolin scheint demnach wohl als isomer oder metamer mit unserer Substanz betrachtet werden zu k√∂nnen. Eine Identit√§t beider liegt jedoch nicht vor, denn an einer Probe Luteolin fanden wir die charakteristischen Farben-reactionen nicht, welche das Paradatiscetin kaum verwechseln lassen.\\" (Luteolin thus seems to be able to be regarded perhaps as an isomer or metamer of our substance [viz, paradatiscetin]. However, the two are evidently not identical, for upon a test of luteolin, we did not find the characteristic color reactions, which hardly allows paradatiscetin to be confused [with it].) In 1896, the English chemist Arthur George Perkin proposed the correct structure for luteolin. See p. 803. Perkin's proposed structure for luteolin was confirmed in 1900 when the Polish-Swiss chemist Stanislaw Kostanecki (1860‚Äì1910) and his students A. R√≥≈ºycki and J. Tambor synthesized luteolin.  Natural occurrences  Luteolin is most often found in leaves, but it is also seen in rinds, barks, clover blossom, and ragweed pollen. It has also been isolated from the aromatic flowering plant, Salvia tomentosa in the mint family, Lamiaceae. Dietary sources include celery, broccoli, green pepper, parsley, thyme, dandelion, perilla, chamomile tea, carrots, olive oil, peppermint, rosemary, navel oranges, and oregano. It can also be found in the seeds of the palm Aiphanes aculeata.

Butler was launched on 12 February 1942 by Philadelphia Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. John Wehle, daughter of General Butler; and commissioned on 15 August 1942, Lieutenant Commander M. D. Matthews in command. Service history After undergoing shakedown trials, Butler engaged in escort work in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. On 14 January 1943, she departed on a trans-Atlantic voyage to Casablanca and thence to Dakar, French West Africa. From there she escorted two Free French vessels, Richelieu and Montcalm, to New York. After overhaul in New York and coastwise convoy escort work she set sail for the Mediterranean on 8 June. Following training exercises at Oran and Algiers, she proceeded to Bizerte whence she departed in July for the Allied invasion of Sicily from 9 July to 12 August. She took part in the Amphibious Battle of Gela and subsequently served on escort duty throughout the remainder of the operation. She then steamed for New York, arriving on 22 August. Butler was engaged in convoy work and overhaul until 5 May 1944 at which time she stood out for the Invasion of Normandy from 6 June to 15 July. She screened heavy units of the bombardment group and served at the inshore fire support station during this assault. From 12‚Äì30 August she escorted Royal Navy escort carriers taking part in Operation Dragoon. Shortly thereafter she returned to New York for overhaul. After a convoy run to Marseilles in October, Butler returned to New York on 27 October for conversion to a high-speed minesweeper. Reclassified DMS-29 on 15 November, her conversion was completed on 21 December, and she proceeded to Norfolk and joined Mine Squadron 20 (MineRon 20). On 3 January 1945, the ship weighed anchor for Naval Station San Diego en route to Pearl Harbor. Upon completion of extensive training in the Hawaiian area, she sailed to Ulithi and then conducted a pre-invasion sweep around Okinawa. She continued screen and picket duty, splashing many planes, throughout the assault on Okinawa (24 March ‚Äì 25 May 1945). On 25 May, bombs from a kamikaze exploded under Butlers keel, killing fourteen men, blowing out steam lines, flooding the forward fire room, causing the loss of all steam and electric power. The battleship stood by Butler until power was regained, and assisted in driving off two more Japanese planes. The next day, Butler proceeded to Kerama Retto for temporary repairs. She arrived in the United States on 26 August and was decommissioned on 8 November 1945. The captain turned the decommissioning duties over to Lt. Clyde L Wilson, Jr., who had been the executive officer and had the helm during Okinawa. Lt. Wilson was given the helm due to his Navy training in avoiding kamikaze attacks; training that the captain had not, yet, received. The Butler had been targeted five times by kamikazes, but had avoided any direct hits. She was sold for scrapping on 10 January 1948. Awards Butler received the Navy Unit Commendation for her service in the Okinawa operation and four battle stars for her World War II service.

Baron Bernhard August von Lindenau (11 June 1779 ‚Äì 21 May 1854) was a German lawyer, astronomer, politician, and art collector. Lindenau was born in Altenburg, the son of Johann August Lindenau, a regional administrator (Landschaftsdirektor). In 1793, Lindeau began studying law and mathematics at Leipzig, and beginning in 1801 he worked at the astronomical observatory in Seeburg. In 1830 he was the Minister of the Interior during a turbulent period in the history of Saxony. Late in the year he oversaw measures to calm violent protests demanding political reform. From 1831 to 1843 he was Minister-President. He created a collection of Italian artwork from the 14th and 15th centuries by Florentine painters in an effort to create artistic awareness. He gave his art collection to the city of Altenburg on the condition that they create a museum to display the pieces. This museum was finished in 1875, and became the Lindenau-Museum.

On 4 August 1936, Metaxas, with the support of King George II, suspended the Greek parliament and went on to preside over a conservative, staunchly anti-communist government. The regime took inspiration in its symbolism and rhetoric from Fascist Italy, but retained close links to Britain and the French Third Republic, rather than the Axis powers. Lacking a popular base, after Metaxas' death in January 1941 the regime hinged entirely on the King. Although Greece was occupied following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941 and the Greek government was forced into exile in the British-controlled Kingdom of Egypt, several prominent figures and features of the regime, notably the notorious security chief Konstantinos Maniadakis, survived for several months in cabinet until the King was forced to dismiss them in a compromise with the representatives of the old democratic political establishment.  Origins of the regime  Metaxas imposed his regime primarily to fight the turbulent social situation prevalent in Greece in the 1930s, in which political factionalization had disrupted Greek parliamentary democracy. The sinking credibility of the Parliament was accompanied by several coup attempts; in March 1935, a Venizelist putsch failed, and in the following October, elections reinforced the Royalist majority, which allowed the exiled King George II to return to Greece. The king re-established the monarchy in the country, but the parliament, split into incompatible factions, was unable to shape a clear political majority so that the government could govern. Meanwhile, the increasing activity of the Communists, whose 15 deputies from the 1936 elections held the balance between 143 Monarchists and 142 Liberals, Agrarians, and Republicans, created a deadlock. In May 1935 widespread agrarian unrest (tobacco farmers) and industrial unrest in the north of the country erupted, which eventually brought General Metaxas to suspend the parliament on the eve of a major strike, on 4 August 1936. Endorsed by the King, Metaxas declared a state of emergency, decreed martial law, annulled various articles of the constitution and established a crisis cabinet to put to an end the growing riots and to restore social order. In one of his first speeches, Metaxas announced: \\"I have decided to hold all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her.\\" Thus the Metaxas dictatorship was born, and the period of time which would follow was named after the day Metaxas rose to absolute power: the 4th of August. The new regime was backed by small extreme political parties, and by conservatives expecting a crackdown on the communists. = Classical influences = Young members of the Greek National Organisation of Youth (EON) hail in presence of Ioannis Metaxas.Metaxas Jugend - A picture album of the Greek Fascist Youth EON (2009), p.11 The roots of Metaxas' \\"New State\\" were sought in Greece's classical history. Metaxas thought Hellenic nationalism would galvanize \\"the heathen values of ancient Greece, specifically those of Sparta, along with the Christian values of the Medieval empire of Byzantium\\".Clogg (1992) Ancient Macedonia was also glorified as the first political unifier of the Hellenes.Hamilakis, Y. (2007) The nation and its ruins: antiquity, archaeology, and national imagination in Greece, Oxford University Press, , p. 177 As its main symbol, the youth organization of the regime chose the labrys/pelekys, the symbol of ancient Minoan Crete. The traditional Greek values of \\"Country, Loyalty, Family and Religion\\", which Metaxas praised repeatedly, were also close to those of the ancient Spartans. The regime promoted the perceived Spartan ideals of self-discipline, militarism and collective sacrifice, while Byzantium provided an emphasis on a centralized state and devotion to the monarchy and Greek Orthodox Church.Hamilakis (2007), pp. 177-178 = External influences = Metaxas considered Ant√≥nio Salazar's Estado Novo of Portugal his main inspiration and surrounded himself with elements from this and other dictatorial regimes of the time. Thus his main ideological slogan was also \\"New State\\" (Neon Kratos) and the 4th of August regime used its own military-like uniforms, greetings, songs and rituals, including the Roman salute (which Metaxas considered Greek in origin as a salutation to the sun god Apollo, and he referred to it as the \\"Hellenikos Hairetismos\\" (\\"Hellenic Hailing\\")). In Metaxas' case we can speak as well of some characteristics typical of authoritarian states such as 1930s Italy and Germany: the regime's propaganda presented Metaxas as \\"the First Peasant\\", \\"the First Worker\\" and as \\"the National Father\\" of the Greeks. Like his contemporaries Hitler with F√ºhrer and Mussolini with Duce, Metaxas adopted the title of Archigos, Greek for \\"leader\\" or \\"chieftain\\", and claimed that his regime had to lay the foundations for the appearance of a glorious \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\" combining the best of ancient Greece and the Greek Byzantine Empire of the Middle Ages.  Greek totalitarianism  The Metaxas regime sought to comprehensively change Greece, and therefore instituted controls on Greek society, politics, language, and the economy. In each of these, the Metaxas government resembled more closely the policies that Spain would adopt later on than those of their contemporaries Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy. = Attempts at social control = Propaganda poster of the regime Having come to power with the stated intent of restoring public order, Metaxas' state largely achieved this goal, under the supervision of what can be described as its most fascist member, minister of public order Konstantinos Maniadakis. Maniadakis created a second fake \\"communist party\\", published a fake \\"Rizospastis\\" and achieved the dissolution of all the communist organizations. Metaxas' policies such as the censorship of the media, the banning of political parties and prohibition of strikes copied contemporary European authoritarian regimes. As its far-right contemporaries Italy and Germany, the Greek State also had its political police force, the Asfaleia, based upon the Gestapo (its chief Maniadakis maintained a close relationship with Himmler on methods and techniques). The objective of Asfaleia was to secure public order. The regime also repressed the rebetiko music due to the uncompromising lyrics and favoured the traditional Greek folk music. Hashish dens, baglamas and bouzouki were banned, or at least playing in the eastern- style manner and scales. Probably inspired by the V√∂lkisch movement, a massive promotion of the Greek folk music took place, though the radio and public festivals, mainly because of the animosity of the state towards the bouzoukis and the rebetiko music. On this point the Greek communist left agreed, considering the rebetiko as \\"reactionary\\". Soon after its inception the regime severely repressed the communists and leftists. About 15,000 people were arrested and jailed, or exiled for political reasons; some were subjected to torture. Metaxas' regime forced the Communist party underground, and also attempted to dismantle the old system of loyalties of the Royalist and Venizelist parties. Those major forces however remained, as they had for the preceding decades, and re-emerged immediately after the four-year Metaxas regime. While Metaxas' regime did play up a supposed communist threat in order to justify its repression, the regime is not known to have committed political murders and did not instate the death penalty. Dissidents were, rather, usually banished to tiny islands in the Aegean sea. For example, the liberal leader George Papandreou was exiled to Andros. The Greek Communist Party (KKE), meanwhile, which had already been outlawed, remained intact. Legal restrictions against it finally were ended in 1974 during metapolitefsi. =Arts and culture= Metaxas, educated in the German Empire and admirer of the German culture, gave emphasis to the Art production (theatrical, literary, musical, visual arts etc.). He collaborated with significant intellectual figures of the era, like Stratis Myrivilis, Nikos Kazantzakis, Angelos Sikelianos, Manolis Kalomoiris, Angelos Terzakis, Nelly's and others, to promote the ideas of the regime, especially to the youth. Another notable policy was the use and promotion of the Demotic Greek (Demotiki) in the educational system -but in a conservative form-, instead of the Katharevousa. Manolis Triantafyllidis was appointed for the creation of the grammar. = The role of the youth = EON on parade (from its official magazine Neolaia). The double axe, emblem of the organisation, is visible on the standard. The emblem of EON. The flag which was used by EON during the Fourth of August regime. In order to keep and maintain the values of the regime in future years, Metaxas gave birth to the Ethniki Organosi Neolaias (ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒüœÅŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩœâœÉŒ∑ ŒùŒµŒøŒªŒ±ŒØŒ±œÇ, National Organisation of Youth, EON). The EON brought together youths of all economic and social strata into one single body. Boys‚Äô education emphasized discipline and physical training, while girls were taught to become supportive wives and caring mothers to breed a stronger, healthier new generation. The EON published a fortnightly magazine called Neolaia (ŒùŒµŒøŒªŒ±ŒØŒ±, Greek for \\"Youth\\"), which had much influence both in schools and in higher education. Metaxas' vision was to create, through the youth, the \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\", a continuity of the ancient Greek and Byzantine civilization. The EON was disbanded by the German-Italian occupying authority in Greece following its vigorous resistance of the invasion. = Nationalism = Statue of Constantine I of Greece, placed in Pedion tou Areos during the regime. In November 1936 his relics were transferred from Italy and buried in Tatoi. As in most other totalitarian regimes, the 4th of August regime adopted a strong nationalistic program: although Metaxas was opposed to the invasion of Asia Minor as part of the Megali Idea, he used strong nationalist language concerning Greek minorities in neighbouring countries and in answering threats from Greece's neighbours in the still volatile southeast Europe. As with many nation states at the time, he used language exalting his people's \\"race\\". Ethnic (mainly Slavic speakers) and religious minorities were persecuted under Metaxas' rule.Kallis The regime, however, was relatively tolerant to the Greek Jews, repealing the anti-Semitic laws of previous regimes. A large community of Sephardic Jews was present in the region of Thessaloniki which was annexed by Greece in 1913, and Jews were largely in opposition to Venizelism. Metaxas was firmly opposed to the irredentist factions of the Slavophones of northern Greece (consisting of Macedonians and Bulgarians mainly in Macedonia (Greece) and Thrace), some of whom underwent political persecution due to advocacy of irredentism with regard to neighbouring countries. Metaxas' regime continued repression of the use of Slavic languages both in public and in private and of expressions of Slavic cultural distinctiveness. Despite their supposed disloyalty, however, Slavophone Greeks identified with the Greek state and fought ferociously for Greece on the Italo-Albanian front. Again in contrast to some totalitarian regimes, no mass killings were ever instituted and there is no evidence that any were planned. = Economic policy = Poster of the Metaxas regime and the General Confederation of Greek Workers promoting the Social Insurance Institute (IKA) One of the 4th of August government's main objectives was the repudiation of the old capitalist system and its replacement with a corporatist economic system in order to promote national and social solidarity. This idea \\"harmonized perfectly with Metaxas' convictions on social and national solidarity as well as his rejection of individualism and class struggle\\". The plan for the creation of a corporatist state was manifest in the early days of the regime by public declarations by Metaxas and by government ministers.Constantine Sarandis, \\"The Ideology and Character of the Metaxas Regime\\", The Metaxas Dictatorship: Aspects of Greece, 1936-1940, pages 156-157. To this end, Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Konstantinos Zavitsianos \\"published details about a horizontal (according to branches of production), not vertical (according to social class), syndicalist organization\\" of the state. However, due to the external crisis with Italy, the plan had to be temporarily postponed with the result that it never fully materialized. Metaxas' government, initially unpopular, also gained popularity through an elaborate program to socialize the Greek economy, including: * Unemployment insurance. * Œúaternity leave. * A five-day, 40-hour workweek. * Guaranteed two-week vacations with pay (or two weeks' double pay in place of vacation). * Stricter work safety standards. Many elements of this program persist in Greek economic policy. Metaxas' regime founded the Workers' Center (ŒïœÅŒ≥Œ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒø), which was established to look after workers' housing and recreation, among other things. The 4th of August regime initially stabilized the drachma, which had been suffering from high inflation. Exploiting the newfound solidity of the currency, Metaxas' government embarked on large public works programs (such as the Ellinikon International Airport), including land drainage, construction of railways, road improvements, and modernization of the telecommunications infrastructure. Metaxas' economic program met with initial success, with a marked rise in per capita income and temporary decline in unemployment in Greece between 1936 and 1938 (unemployment skyrocketed after 1938). Capitalizing on this success, the government instituted debt relief for farmers and instituted price floors on some agricultural goods to redistribute wealth to the countryside. Also, on the legislation sector the Greek civil code, was finally completed by a jurist commission; a plan pending since the years of Otto of Greece. =Other= Another organization established by the regime was for the first time a state radio station; the YRE (today ERT), suitable also for the propaganda of the regime. Also, during the years of the regime, the first law was made to establish the National parks of Greece, as an example of the physiolatry, promoted by the regime. However, during these years, Ilissos river was covered in Athens.  Differences from other fascist regimes  There is some debate over how the regime relates to other fascist regimes of the 1930s, especially Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.Clogg (1987), p. 182 Some of the main and important differences of Metaxas' regime as compared to other fascist governments include: *The anti-imperialist speech of the regime. *The pro-Jewish stance of Metaxas and tolerance to religious minorities. *Absence of a mass political base for the regime, in the form of a political party or movement. *No representative architecture or monuments.  The end of the 4th of August regime  Ioannis Metaxas with King George II and Alexandros Papagos during a meeting of the Anglo-Greek War Council. Foreign policy was one of the main concerns of the 4th of August regime. Metaxas, who had studied in Germany as a youth, was pro-German, while the King was pro-British. This caused heated discussions between the two, but the reality of 1930s Europe was that Greece's security depended less on Germany than on her traditional protector, the United Kingdom, which was the Great Power dominating the Eastern Mediterranean Sea with her fleet. In addition, Italian leader Benito Mussolini's grandiose schemes to build a new Roman Empire in the Mediterranean directly clashed with Greek pretensions to control the Aegean Sea and the Dodecanese islands (by then under Italian control) and to exert stronger influence in Albania. As tensions and threat of war increased in Europe just before World War II, the situation was almost exactly the same as the position before World War I, when Greece had strong pro-German affinities in government, but it depended on Britain for its security. Most observers were anticipating Greece would attempt to remain neutral. Metaxas indeed attempted to maintain strict neutrality, but Italian expansionism eventually led to an Italian ultimatum and to the Greco-Italian War. However, Greek forces repelled the Italian invasion completely and brought the Italian soldiers back into Albania, where the invasion had been launched. In fact, some territories in Albania where a Greek minority lives were claimed to be and Metaxas' plans were to unite them with the rest of Greece. Metaxas died suddenly in January 1941 among dark circumstances. His death raised hopes of a liberalization of his regime and the restoration of parliamentary rule, but King George quashed these hopes when he retained the regime's machinery in place. In the meantime, Adolf Hitler was reluctantly forced to divert German troops to rescue Mussolini from defeat, and began the Battle of Greece through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 6 April 1941. Despite British assistance, by the end of May, the Germans had overrun most of the country. The 4th of August regime collapsed on May 29th, 1941. The King and the government escaped to Crete, where they stayed until the end of the Battle of Crete. They then transferred to Egypt, where a Greek government in exile was established. An alternative destination of Cyprus was rejected by the British, who feared that it might reinforce Greek claims on the island. Meanwhile, in Greece a fascist puppet government was placed into power by the Axis powers.  Legacy  As the Axis occupation ended, Greece descended into civil war between the communist-dominated forces of the left, operating in Greece and from bases in the south of Yugoslavia, and the U.S.- and UK-aligned forces of the political right. This was the first major protracted combat of the Cold War, one of the first exercises in U.S. policy of Containment, and a subject of the Truman Doctrine of U.S. President Harry Truman. The alignments were quite different from the Venizelist-Monarchist National Schism, as most Venizelists supported the right-wing alliance during the civil war.

History Hardgainer was available only through subscription, and was initially published on a bi-monthly basis starting with the July-August, 1989 issue. Stuart McRobert, a transplanted Englishman living in Nicosia, Cyprus, was the publisher and editor, operating under the name of CS Publishing. At the beginning of 2004, it was announced that the frequency was being scaled back to quarterly. However, only two quarterly issues were published; the April-June, 2004 issue was the final one, bringing the total production to 89 issues. Although the magazine is no longer being published, McRobert has continued to operate the Hardgainer web site and book publishing operation. Hardgainer built its reputation as a source of no- nonsense training advice. In contrast to most popular bodybuilding magazines, which typically promote training methods of the top competitors, McRobert chose to focus on training methods that were suitable for the typical trainee rather than the genetically gifted and without the use of drugs. A wide variety of writers contributed articles over the years, but the common theme was always abbreviated training, with a concentration on basic, multi-joint exercises such as the squat, deadlift and bench press. In Brother Iron, Sister Steel: A Bodybuilder's Book, Dave Draper summarizes the Hardgainer approach as follows: :Hardgainer, made popular by Stuart McRobert, is another offshoot of abbreviated training that encourages the utilization of basic, multi-joint movements to near muscular fatigue without compromising form, endangering the body or miscalculating recovery time. In the book Dinosaur Training, Brooks Kubik included Hardgainer in a list of four publications (along with Milo, The Iron Master, and H.I.T. Newsletter) to which he recommended that his readers should subscribe, referring to them as \\"excellent sources of information about productive weight training\\". McRobert has published several books on weight training under the Hardgainer / CS Publishing umbrella, including Brawn (1991), The Insider's Tell-All Handbook On Weight-Training Technique (1996), Beyond Brawn (1998), and Further Brawn (2001).

McCalla, who served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and would eventually attain the rank of rear admiral. Construction and commissioning McCalla was laid down 15 September 1941 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 20 March 1942; sponsored by Mary MacArthur (Mrs. Arthur MacArthur), the daughter of R.Adm. McCalla The ship was commissioned on 27 May 1942, Lieutenant Commander W. G. Cooper, in command. Service history = 1942 = During shakedown McCalla undertook her first war assignment, escorting a New York-bound convoy from Cape May, New Jersey, 19 July 1942. On 3 August, she formally reported at Norfolk for brief antisubmarine (ASW) employment along the mid Atlantic coast. Two weeks later she escorted oilers to Aruba and continued on to the Pacific, reporting to Commander, South Pacific Area (ComSoPac) 28 September at Noum√©a. McCalla immediately joined in the campaign for the Solomons. On 7 October she Joined Task Force 64 (TF 64), Rear Admiral Norman Scott's cruiser force, then protecting transports carrying supplies and reinforcements to marines on Guadalcanal. Ordered to search for and destroy enemy ships and landing craft, the force patrolled primarily north of the island. On the nights of 11 and 13 October, they encountered a Japanese force off Cape Esperance under Rear Admiral Aritomo Got≈ç convoying reinforcements to Guadalcanal. In the ensuing battle both forces accomplished their missions, but the cost to the Japanese was greater. Admiral Got≈ç was killed, heavy cruiser and destroyer were lost, and heavy cruiser was forced to return to Japan for repairs. In addition, as they attempted to rescue survivors the next day, two Japanese destroyers, and , were sunk by aircraft from Henderson Field. Admiral Scott's force lost the destroyer , while damage to the cruiser required navy yard repairs. McCalla rescued 195DANFS says 197; but the article on Duncan says 195. The Destroyer History Foundation page for Duncan says 160 unwounded survivors plus 35 wounded. of Duncans crew, and captured three Japanese sailors. As the campaign for Guadalcanal extended, McCallas anti-shipping activities continued. On 2 November, she depth charged an area in which submarine contact had been made. On 25 November, she was cruising off Tassafaronga Point when a number of landing boats were reported maneuvering along the coast; McCalla destroyed 40 of the Japanese craft. = 1943 = During the first half of 1943 McCalla sailed among the Fiji, New Hebrides, and Solomon Islands performing plane guard, escort and antisubmarine patrol duties. Toward the end of June the New Georgia campaign began. McCalla departed Efate on 26 June to escort troop transports to Rendova Island. On 30 June, after the landings, the force was attacked by Japanese aircraft. As the first wave, torpedo planes, pressed in, the transport was torpedoed. McCallas guns splashed one with two possibles; in the second wave, dive bombers, they splashed one and assisted with another kill. She then rescued 98 of McCawleys crew. By 5 July, McCalla was back in the New Georgia area to screen the landing of Marine Raiders at Rice Anchorage. On 9 July, she took part in the bombardment of Munda airfield and then returned to escort and antisubmarine work. At the end of September McCalla and the destroyer collided, with serious damage to McCallas bow. Temporary repairs were effected at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, before she departed for shipyard repairs at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. While en route, she rescued 868 survivors of the torpedoed troop transport . = 1944‚Äì1946 = Ready for war duty again by 8 January 1944, McCalla got underway for the South Pacific. A month later she was at Majuro to resume ASW operations and escort assignments in the Marshalls. On 24 April she returned to Pearl Harbor for aircraft carrier group exercises and upon her return to Majuro, 30 May, was attached to fast carrier TF 58\\\\. Until the end of October she operated as a unit in the fast carrier screen, participating in strikes on the Marianas, Bonins, Palaus, Philippines, Formosa, and Okinawa. McCalla returned to escort work 24 October and for the next four months conducted convoys between ports on Ulithi, Eniwetok, Pelelieu, Manus, and Leyte. At Leyte in mid-February 1945 she commenced interisland escort duties in the Philippines, extending her range to the Netherlands East Indies in June. Early in July she received her last World War II assignment, mopping-up operations in the western Carolines. On 22 July, she got underway for Portland, Oregon, arriving 9 August for overhaul preparatory to deactivation. By the end of January 1946 she was en route to Charleston, South Carolina. There she decommissioned 17 May and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. McCalla received 10 battle stars for World War II service. = TCG Giresun (D 345) = Recommissioned 11 December 1948, McCalla prepared for transferring to the Turkish Navy. She took several short cruises up and down the Atlantic coast with a nucleus Turkish crew aboard for training purposes. Then, in the spring of 1949 she sailed for Turkey where she decommissioned 29 April 1949, transferred to the Turkish Navy and recommissioned the same day as TCG Giresun (D 345).

In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44‚Äì45 Construction and career Kidder, named for Hugh Kidder, was launched 10 July 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Miss Ethel Murry Jonstone; and commissioned 7 February 1921, Cmdr. H. J. Abbett in command. After shakedown along the coast, Kidder was assigned to Destroyer Division 34, Battle Fleet, at San Diego, California. From 1921 to 1924 she operated along the West Coast between Washington and the Panama Canal Zone engaging in training maneuvers, fleet problems, and gunnery exercises. The destroyer played a significant role in the development of naval warfare through using experimental torpedoes in exercises. Kidder transited the Panama Canal during January 1924 for fleet concentrations in the Caribbean, returning San Diego 22 April. She continued her training operations before clearing San Francisco 15 April 1925 for a fleet problem and joint exercises off Hawaii. Kidder then accompanied the Battle Fleet to Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand before returning to Mare Island 26 September. For the rest of her naval service she was almost constantly at sea, including winter fleet concentrations in the Caribbean during 1927 and a joint submarine exercise off Hawaii in the spring and summer of 1928. Fate During her final year of service, Kidder operated out of San Diego and decommissioned there 18 March 1930. After scrapping, her materials were sold 31 October 1930 in accordance with the terms of the London Treaty limiting naval armament. As of 2005, no other ship of the US Navy has been named Kidder.

Mervine was laid down on 3 November 1941 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 3 May 1942, sponsored by Miss Mildred Mervine great-granddaughter of the admiral. The ship was commissioned on 17 June 1942, with Lieutenant Commander S. D. Willingham in command. History Following a shakedown cruise off Cuba, Mervine reported for duty with the Gulf Sea Frontier at New Orleans, 30 August 1942. Assigned to escort work, she accompanied merchantmen as they plied the Gulf and West Indian shipping lanes, which during the preceding months had gained the dubious distinction of suffering the heaviest losses to U-boat activity in the eastern Atlantic. In October Mervine left the gulf and steamed to Norfolk where she Joined Task Force 34 (TF 34) and sailed east. Toward midnight on 7 November she arrived off Safi, Morocco, and took up her station for Operation TORCH the invasion of North Africa. During the landings on 8 November, she acted as control vessel and provided fire support for the assault forces on Red Beach, north of Safi. She remained on patrol in the area for the next five days and then returned to New York. There she resumed escort assignments and for the next seven months guarded coastal and transatlantic convoys. On 8 June 1943 Mervine departed with TF 65 for North Africa. Arriving at Mers-el-Kebir on 22 June, she joined TF 85 and on 5 July departed for Sicily and Operation HUSKY. From 10 July through 13 July, she cruised off Scoglitti and along the coast of the Camerina Plain, providing fire support for the 7th Army's assault troops. She then returned to escort work in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. In late October 1943 the troopships of convoy KMF25 left Liverpool bound for Alexandria. Mervine was the escort flagship when the convoy was attacked by German bombers off the coast of Algeria on 6 November 1943; and rescued over 600 survivors, including 100 nurses, from two ships sunk by the attack. Without facilities for so many passengers, Mervine transported the survivors to Malta within 24 hours. =Pacific Theater= In the spring of 1945, as Allied forces in the Pacific pushed closer to the Japanese home islands and their need for minesweepers increased‚Äîdoubly so with the disastrous toll among that type ship in the Ryukyus‚ÄîMervine was designated for conversion. On 23 May she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she became a destroyer minesweeper. Reclassified as DMS-31 on 30 May 1945, she departed for Norfolk on 15 July, and continued on to the Pacific. En route at the time of the Japanese surrender she arrived at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 28 September. In October, she swept mines off the China coast near Kokuzan. Shifting to Japanese waters the following month, she operated first off Ky≈´sh≈´ and then off Honsh≈´. =Post war= Mervine reported to San Francisco on 31 March 1946 for two years of west coast operations before returning to the Far East. On 25 March 1948 she arrived at Yokosuka and continued on to Tsingtao, China, where she carried out escort, rescue, and training assignments until 5 October when she departed for the United States. Arriving at her homeport San Diego, in November, she soon departed again for training and availability at Pearl Harbor. On 15 February 1949 she returned to southern California for the last time. On 27 May she decommissioned and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. Redesignated DD-489 again on 15 July 1955, she remained at San Diego until the end of the decade and then was transferred first to the Columbia River Reserve Group and finally to Bremerton. Struck on 31 July 1968 from the Navy list, she was sold for scrap in 1969. Awards Mervine received three battle stars for her World War II service.

He was considered controversial for his efforts to build a sustainable relationship between the United States and Native American peoples. Biography =Early life= Valentine Trant O'Connell McGillycuddy or M'Gillycuddy was born on February 14, 1849 in Racine, Wisconsin to Irish immigrants Daniel McGillycuddy (1821-1892), a merchant, and Joana (Trant) McGillycuddy (1813-1892). He had a brother 6 years older named Francis. via When Valentine was 13, the McGillycuddy family moved to Detroit. He graduated from the Detroit Medical School at 20 years of age. He began working as a doctor at the Wayne County Insane Asylum and practiced medicine for one year. Next he began teaching at the medical college. McGillycuddy's longstanding love for the outdoors led him to leave the city medical field. =Career= From 1871 to 1874, McGillycuddy worked for the United States Boundary Survey Commission. He became a topographer and surgeon for the International Expedition. This group headed an expedition to define the border between the United States and Canada along the 49th parallel. They began their expedition in North Dakota, where the ground had frozen due to a wet season. In order to keep their feet warm, the men wore several pairs of socks, wrapped their feet in a square blanket, and last wore a pair of over-sized moccasins. After the expedition ended, McGillycuddy returned to Washington, DC. He was soon sent out to Wyoming to continue his career as a topographer.M'Gillycuddy is credited with the discovery of the original warm mineral springs in Hot Springs. The following year, in 1875, he was invited on the Newton-Jenney Party. As the surveyor for the expedition, McGillycuddy was the first person to record their climb of Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak) in the Black Hills of South Dakota. He was responsible for mapping the topography and geology of the region, while the expedition assessed the area for major gold deposits. Upon returning from the expedition, McGillycuddy married Fanny Hoyt. He was recruited as the Contract Surgeon with General George Crook during the Battle of the Rosebud (June 17, 1876), the Battle of Slim Buttes (September 9 and 10, 1876), and the Horsemeat March (1876). Relations with Indians Suspension Letter of McGillycuddy McGillycuddy was appointed Assistant Post Surgeon at Fort Robinson in what became Nebraska. Because of his mustache that drooped to a length of two inches below the corners of his mouth, the Sioux named him \\"Putin hi chikala\\" or \\"Little Whiskers.\\" He was known to the Lakota at the agency as a \\"Friend of Crazy Horse,\\" a notable Lakota leader. McGillycuddy treated Crazy Horse after he was fatally stabbed by guards who said he was trying to escape. After Crazy Horse's death, McGillycuddy went to Washington D.C. to lobby for more humane treatment of Indians at Fort Robinson. McGillycuddy was appointed as Indian Agent in 1879, when he was 30. He served at the Pine Ridge Agency (now Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota). He did not manage to achieve such friendly relations here as he had with Crazy Horse and other Lakota. Red Cloud, a major chief, accused McGillycuddy of mismanagement, leading to several investigations of the Agent's administration. Despite this, McGillycuddy established an Indian police force, and set up a boarding school to educate Indian children of the region. However, persistent claims followed him of tyranny, fraud and the graft typical of the 'Indian Ring', including one in the Boston Advertiser claiming that he had been in receipt of annuities for 2,600 more people than actually lived at Pine Ridge, a loss to the Government of $284,700. Ostensibly under pressure to fire a loyal clerk for no reason he could see, McGillycuddy eventually resigned his post. He was suspended from his position in October 1882 (see letter above). Later, in the days leading up to the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890), Red Cloud said that McGillycuddy had been a \\"young man with an old man's head on his shoulders.\\" Other government appointments After leaving Pine Ridge, McGillycuddy settled in Rapid City, South Dakota. He would later serve as president of Lakota Bank and as Dean of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. He also was appointed as South Dakota's first State Surgeon General. While living in Rapid City, he built a mansion in 1888, which is still standing. In 1890 McGillycuddy was elected as a delegate to the South Dakota State Constitutional Convention. Continuing his activism in politics, he was elected mayor of Rapid City in 1897. His wife, Fanny, died that same year. =Later life= Plaque on Black Elk Peak engraved with the words Valentine T. McGillycuddy \\"Wasicu Wakan\\" 1849‚Äì1939. After Fanny died, the widower McGillycuddy moved to San Francisco, California. There he met Julia Blanchard, who as a girl had asked Fanny if she could marry the doctor after her death. A daughter, also named Valentine, was born to Julia. He served as a medical inspector for an insurance agency until retiring in 1912. But McGillycuddy enlisted in World War I. He was sent to Alaska and other western states to treat patients with influenza during the pandemic of 1918-1919. McGillycuddy died in Berkeley, California in 1939. He was cremated, and his ashes were entombed at the top of Black Elk Peak. A plaque was installed that reads: \\"Valentine T.

Quick (1870‚Äì1922), who received the Medal of Honor \\"for gallantry in action\\" at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 14 June 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Quick was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey on 3 November 1941. The ship was completed and launched on 3 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. William T. Roy, niece of Sergeant Major Quick. She was commissioned on 3 July 1942, with Lieutenant Commander R. B. Nickerson in command. Service history Following her initial shakedown off the coast of New England and the Maritime Provinces, Quick departed New York, 6 September 1942, for the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Assigned to escort work, she accompanied United States Army transports and merchantmen as they plied the Gulf and West Indian shipping lanes ‚Äî lanes which in preceding months had suffered the greatest losses to U-boat activities in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. In October, Quick left the Gulf and steamed to Norfolk, Virginia where she joined Task Force 34 (TF 34) on 23 October and steamed east. Just before midnight on 7 November, she arrived off the coast of Safi, Morocco, and took up station in the transport area for the Southern Attack Group of Operation TORCH the invasion of North Africa. During the landings the following day, she provided gunfire support, then resumed anti- aircraft and anti-submarine duties. On 14 November, she shifted to Casablanca and two days later assisted in sinking . On the 17th, she got underway for the United States and at the end of the month anchored in New York harbor. She resumed escort work and for the next six months guarded coastal and trans- Atlantic convoys. On 8 June 1943, Quick departed the east coast with TF 65, bound for North Africa. Arriving at Mers-el-Kebir on the 22 June, she joined TF 85 and on 5 July sailed for Sicily and Operation HUSKY. From 10-13 July, she cruised off Scoglitti and along the Camerina plain, providing fire support for the U.S. 7th Army's assault troops. She then returned to escort work in the North Atlantic until May 1944, and on Mediterranean runs until the end of the war in Europe. The war in the Pacific Ocean raged on, however, and, as Allied forces pushed closer to the Japanese home islands, their need for minesweepers increased, doubly so with the toll among that type in the Ryukyus. Quick, no longer needed for escort work in the Atlantic, was designated to help fill the need, and on 13 June 1945, she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard where she became a destroyer-minesweeper. Emerging from conversion on 2 August as DMS-32 (effective 23 June 1945), she sailed for the west coast, arriving at San Diego after the cessation of Pacific hostilities. Toward the end of September, she sailed for Pearl Harbor, thence to Eniwetok for abbreviated operations after which she returned to Hawaii. On 2 December 1946, she headed west again, arriving at Sasebo on 16 December for a nine-month tour during which she operated off the China coast and off Okinawa in addition to working in Japanese waters. Spending a little over a month on the west coast, she operated in the Marianas from December 1946 to February 1947, then returned to Japanese waters. In April 1947 she resumed operations in the Trust Territories and in August returned to the west coast. The following spring she deployed to the Marshall Islands and Marianas for another three months, returning to San Diego on 4 June. Eight months later she was designated for inactivation and, on 1 March 1949, she reported to Commander, Pacific Reserve Fleet, decommissioning 28 May 1949. Reclassified DD-490 on 15 July 1955, Quick was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 1972 and sold 27 August 1973 and broken up for scrap.

History leftSH 8 was one of the original twenty five state highways on June 21, 1917, proposed as an 'East Texas Highway.' In 1919 the routing follows the present day SH 8 from the Arkansas State Line to its terminus in Linden, then continued south on present day U.S. Highway 59 through Marshall, to Carthage. On U.S. Highway 96, SH 8 traveled through San Augustine, Jasper to its junction with SH 62, where it turned towards to its terminus in Port Arthur. On August 21, 1922 SH 8 was rerouted from Buna to Beaumont and into Port Arthur via present day US 96. On October 20, 1924, it was rerouted over SH 38, which was cancelled, and concurrent with part of SH 43. In 1926, SH 8 was rerouted back on its previously planned route, with the old route being transferred to SH 43 and SH 26A. US 59 was co-located over most of SH 8. On November 28, 1933, SH 8 Loop was designated in Beaumont. On February 18, 1936, SH 8 Loop was designated in Buna. On December 20, 1937, two SH 8 Spur routes were designated in Jasper. While the entirety of the route maintained its number, on September 26, 1939 the co-designations were dropped (with US 96 replacing part of US 59), leaving only the Arkansas-Corley segment to the old highway. The SH 8 Loop and SH 8 Spur routes were renumbered Loop 7 (Jasper), Loop 8 (Beaumont), and Loop 68 (Buna). On October 13, 1947 a small segment was reassigned back to SH 8 from US 59 from Corley to Linden when US 59 was rerouted further east. SH 8 was rerouted around the western side of Linden on June 22, 1964, with the old route becoming FM 125 and Spur 400. left SH 8A was an alternate routing designated on June 17, 1918 just east of SH 8 from Shelbyville to Orange. On August 21, 1923, it had been renumbered as SH 87, with the section from Shelbyville to Milam cancelled. SH 8A was reassigned as a spur from SH 8 to Gary. This highway was erroneously omitted from the March 19, 1930 log, so was unnumbered that day. On November 30, 1932, the former SH 8A was added to the highway log, but was renumbered as SH 181. Another SH 8A had been planned from SH 8 in Horton to SH 64 on January 11, 1927. This was eliminated shortly after designation. left SH 8B was a spur route designated on May 21, 1923 from Buna to Orange. On August 21, 1923, this was renumbered as SH 62. It was reassigned as a spur route on September 16, 1926 going from St. Augustine south to Zavalla. On March 19, 1930, this route was renumbered as SH 147. Route description SH 8 begins on the south side of the city on Linden at an intersection with SH 155, less than a quarter of a mile west of its intersection with US Route 59 (Future Interstate 369). The highway travels north through northern Cass County, crossing over Wright Patman Lake into Bowie County. The highway briefly turns west with US Route 67 when they intersect in Maud. The route then turns back north, running along the western edge of the Red River Army Depot. It then passes through the city of New Boston and intersects Interstate 30. The route then continues north, crossing the Red River, and the Arkansas State Line, where it becomes Arkansas Highway 41.

Caml was developed in France at INRIA and ENS. Caml is statically typed, strictly evaluated, and uses automatic memory management. OCaml, the main descendant of Caml, adds many features to the language, including an object layer. Examples In the following, represents the OCaml prompt. =Hello World= print_endline \\"Hello, world!\\";; =Factorial function (recursion and purely functional programming)= Many mathematical functions, such as factorial, are most naturally represented in a purely functional form. The following recursive, purely functional Caml function implements factorial: let rec fact n = if n=0 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1);; The function can be written equivalently using pattern matching: let rec fact = function  0 -> 1  n -> n * fact(n - 1);; This latter form is the mathematical definition of factorial as a recurrence relation. Note that the compiler inferred the type of this function to be , meaning that this function maps ints onto ints. For example, 12! is: # fact 12;; \\\\- : int = 479001600 =Numerical derivative (higher-order functions)= Since Caml is a functional programming language, it is easy to create and pass around functions in Caml programs. This capability has an enormous number of applications. Calculating the numerical derivative of a function is one such application. The following Caml function computes the numerical derivative of a given function at a given point : let d delta f x = (f (x +. delta) -. f (x -. delta)) /. (2. *. delta);; This function requires a small value . A good choice for delta is the cube root of the machine epsilon. The type of the function indicates that it maps a onto another function with the type . This allows us to partially apply arguments. This functional style is known as currying. In this case, it is useful to partially apply the first argument to , to obtain a more specialised function: # let d = d (sqrt epsilon_float);; val d : (float -> float) -> float -> float = Note that the inferred type indicates that the replacement is expecting a function with the type as its first argument. We can compute a numerical approximation to the derivative of x^3 - x - 1 at x=3 with: # d (fun x -> x *. x *. x -. x -. 1.) 3.;; \\\\- : float = 26. The correct answer is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 1 \\\\rightarrow f'(3) = 27 - 1 = 26. The function is called a \\"higher-order function\\" because it accepts another function () as an argument. We can go further and create the (approximate) derivative of f, by applying while omitting the argument: # let f' = d (fun x -> x *. x *. x -. x -. 1.) ;; val f' : float -> float = The concepts of curried and higher-order functions are clearly useful in mathematical programs. In fact, these concepts are equally applicable to most other forms of programming and can be used to factor code much more aggressively, resulting in shorter programs and fewer bugs. =Discrete wavelet transform (pattern matching)= The 1D Haar wavelet transform of an integer-power-of- two-length list of numbers can be implemented very succinctly in Caml and is an excellent example of the use of pattern matching over lists, taking pairs of elements ( and ) off the front and storing their sums and differences on the lists and , respectively: # let haar l = let rec aux l s d = match l, s, d with [s], [], d -> s :: d  [], s, d -> aux s [] d  h1 :: h2 :: t, s, d -> aux t (h1 + h2 :: s) (h1 - h2 :: d)  _ -> invalid_arg \\"haar\\" in aux l [] [];; val haar : int list -> int list = For example: # haar [1; 2; 3; 4; -4; -3; -2; -1];; \\\\- : int list = [0; 20; 4; 4; -1; -1; -1; -1] Pattern matching allows complicated transformations to be represented clearly and succinctly. Moreover, the OCaml compiler turns pattern matches into very efficient code, at times resulting in programs that are shorter and faster than equivalent code written with a case statement (Cardelli 1984, p. 210.). History The first Caml implementation was written in Lisp by Asc√°nder Su√°rez in 1987 at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA).\\"A History of Caml\\", inria.fr Its successor, Caml Light, was implemented in C by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez, and the original was nicknamed \\"Heavy Caml\\" because of its higher memory and CPU requirements. Caml Special Light was a further complete rewrite that added a powerful module system to the core language. It was augmented with an object layer to become Objective Caml, eventually renamed OCaml.

McCook (1839‚Äì1886), who was an officer in the Union Navy during the American Civil War. McCook was laid down on 1 May 1941 at the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington and launched on 30 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Reed Knox, granddaughter of Comdr. McCook. The ship was commissioned on 15 March 1943, Lt.Comdr. S. G. Anderson, in command. History =Initial operations= After shakedown out of San Diego, McCook sailed for the east coast 22 May 1943. She reported at Norfolk for duty in the Atlantic Fleet, 6 June, and by the end of the month had begun her first escort assignment, a convoy to Casablanca, departing Norfolk 26 June and returning 17 July. Before the end of the year she completed two more north African convoys, one to the United Kingdom and numerous escort assignments along the northeastern coast. On 15 December, she reported to COTCLANT and spent the next six weeks training destroyer crews out of Norfolk. Detached from training duties, McCook resumed escort work 31 January 1944 when she sailed for Trinidad with new aircraft carrier on her shakedown cruise, returning with her to Boston on 27 February. Further training in antisubmarine and antiaircraft warfare took up much of March as McCook prepared to return to European waters. On 18 April, she joined Task Group 27.8 (TG 27.8) and steamed for the United Kingdom, arriving at Plymouth, England on 28 April. The destroyer continued on to Portland and from there participated in a month of intensive amphibious landing exercises at Slapton Sands and at Belfast. At Weymouth Roads 28 May McCook was caught in an air raid in which she suffered damage to her radar, sound equipment, range finder, and main battery director in addition to having five guns disabled and losing steering control from the bridge. Luckily there were no personnel casualties. The damage threatened to keep her out of the upcoming invasion for which she had been training for the past month. But the fast and efficient craftsmen on board the destroyer tender quickly had her back in fighting trim. =Normandy landings, Operation Anvil= McCook alongside a carrier in the Atlantic Ocean. On 5 June, McCook departed with Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon 18) and ships of Assault Force \\"O\\" for the coast of France. Early 6 June, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ralph Lester Ramey she arrived in the Baie de la Seine and at 03:20 commenced bombardment of the beaches and waterfront of the Pointe du Hoc‚ÄìVierville-sur-Mer area. By 06:16 she had neutralized her assigned targets (three pillboxes, 13 machine gun nests and three shore guns) and had begun to take on targets of opportunity. By the end of the day, she had added to her score seven pillboxes, eight gun emplacements and ten stone houses, in which enemy machine guns and snipers had been placed. Resupplying and fueling at Portland and Plymouth, McCook continued to operate in the invasion area until 14 July. Four days later she was en route to Bizerte screening a convoy of LSTs and infantry landing craft. She delivered her charges on 28 July and steamed to Mers-el-Kebir, where she remained until 4 August. She then sailed to Naples to join the forces assembling for Operation Anvil, the invasion of southern France. On 13 August she sailed for France, arriving on 14 August to take up a screening position south of Toulon. For the next 35 days she remained in the assault area providing gunfire support and screen protection to the Allied combatants and to the supply and reinforcement convoys from Corsica and Naples. She departed for the United States via Oran and Gibraltar on 21 September. She arrived at New York 3 October, and operated off the east coast until close to the end of the year. She again resumed transatlantic convoy duties on 28 December, completing six by 24 May 1945 when she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard. There she commenced conversion to a destroyer- minesweeper. She was reclassified DMS-36 on 30 May. Her conversion completed on 12 July, she conducted minesweeping exercises until 12 August. She then departed for postwar duties in the western Pacific. =Postwar services= McCook arrived at Okinawa 28 September and, after riding out two typhoons, commenced minesweeping operations in the Yellow Sea toward the end of October. Working with MinRon 1, she cut 77 of the 500 mines swept by that group during the period 23 October to 15 November. She arrived at Sasebo for duty in the coastal waters of Japan on 17 November. Assigned a courier trip to Wakayama, 14 December, she suffered extensive damage in a typhoon on the return voyage. Repairs were begun upon her return to Sasebo on 18 November and finished the next month. She sailed to the Kure‚ÄìHiroshima area to check the swept channels in the Inland Sea on 3 February 1946. Accomplishing that mission by the 26th she steamed to Shanghai, returning two weeks later to Japan. She departed Yokosuka on 12 March for the United States, arriving at San Francisco on 31 March. McCook remained at San Francisco until 14 January 1947 when she was ordered to San Diego. Working primarily with the Underwater Training Unit, San Diego, she operated out of that port for the next two years. She also participated in destroyer squadron exercises and battle problems off the California coast and in the Hawaiian Islands. A cruise to the Marshalls and the Marianas, 7 July to 11 September 1947, was her only oversea deployment during this period. By January 1949, deactivation had begun aboard McCook and on 27 May she was decommissioned and was berthed at San Diego as a part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Reclassified DD-496 on 15 July 1955, McCook was stricken from the register on 15 January 1972. She was sold 27 August 1973 and broken up for scrap. McCook received three battle stars for World War II service.

The base is named after former Montgomery mayor William Adams Gunter. Until 1992 it was known as Gunter Air Force Base or Gunter Air Force Station. It has been a military training base since its opening in 1940. Gunter Annex is a subordinate installation under the administration of the 42d Air Base Wing at nearby Maxwell Air Force Base. Overview Gunter Annex is the home of the Business and Enterprise Systems (BES) Directorate. The BES provides and supports secure combat information systems and networks for the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense and other Federal Government Agencies. The BES Directorate is a part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), which is headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and its subordinate activity at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts. The 26th Network Operations Squadron provides network defense for the Air Force Enterprise Network (AFNET). The 689th Network Operations Squadron is a Classic Associate Unit to the 26th NOS and is also located on the Annex but falls under Air Force Reserve Command. The host unit of Gunter Annex is the 42d Air Base Wing, headquartered at Maxwell AFB. The former 42d Bombardment Wing took over host duties at both Maxwell AFB and Gunter AFB on 1 October 1994 when the wing was redesignated and reassigned from the closing of Loring Air Force Base, Maine. History =William Adams Gunter= The facility is named after William Adams Gunter (1871‚Äì1940), a long-time mayor of Montgomery Alabama. Mayor Gunter was an aviation advocate who championed aviation and was a major force behind the construction of the original Montgomery Municipal Airport at this site in 1929. There were several efforts to have the airport officially named in his honor while he was still living. Although he successfully resisted these efforts, the site is still commonly referred to by residents as 'Gunter Field'. =World War II= In 1940, the 'Plan for the Expansion of the Air Corps Training Program' was published and indicated a need for a preliminary flying school in the Montgomery area. The Commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Colonel Walter Weaver, picked the Montgomery Municipal Airport and the surrounding area as the location for the flying school. This included a newly built, but as yet unoccupied state hospital for tuberculosis patients. In June 1940, the War Department approved the recommendation to lease the land. In August 1940 the first military personnel arrived and construction began. The hospital was used as a headquarters building and Colonel Aubrey Hornsby was the project officer and later the first commanding officer. The Army leased the 187 acre municipal airport and purchased an additional 300 acres for the cantonment area. Complicated leasing agreements delayed construction and the Army facilities were not completed in time, so the first two classes, Class 41-A with 107 students and Class 41-B, trained at Maxwell Field on the other side of town. The first class to train at Gunter was 41-C which began instruction on November 28, 1940. In late 1940, Mayor Gunter died and, on the recommendation of Colonel Hornsby, the flying field was officially named \\"Gunter Field\\" in early 1941. By July 1941, construction of the field was largely complete. In addition to the main airfield, the following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were used: * McLemore Auxiliary Field * Elmore Auxiliary Field (now Wetumpka Municipal Airport) * Mount Meigs Auxiliary Field * Taylor Field * Dannelly Auxiliary Field * Deatsville Auxiliary Field In 1943, 3,500 foot long hard surfaced runways were added. Gunter Field 1942 Classbook Gunter Field 1943 photo pictorial Gunter was the first base established by the Southeastern Training Center exclusively for Basic Flight Training. As such, it also trained instructors and other personnel for the other Basic Training bases opened in the Southeast that included Cochran AAF in Macon, Georgia; Bainbridge AB, Georgia; Greenville AAF, Mississippi; Shaw AAF in Sumter, South Carolina; and at Augusta, Georgia's civilian-run Bush Field. Students would come to Basic Flight Training after completing Primary Training. In 1941, the Basic course was 10 weeks in length in which the student received 70 flying hours. After completion of the course, students would be chosen for advanced single or multi-engine training. During World War II, the field served as a flying school for not just Army pilots, but for British (under the Arnold Scheme), French and Canadians as well.see, for example, Willard Largent, \\"RAF wings over Florida: Memories of World War II British air cadets\\", Purdue University Press, 2000 By 1944, there were nearly four hundred aircraft assigned to Gunter Field. The primary aircraft used for Basic Training, by both the Army and the Navy, during most of the war was the fixed gear Vultee BT-13 and BT-15 Valiant. By later 1944, the BT-13s and 15s were worn out and they began to be replaced by the North American AT-6 Texan. After World War II ended, flight training was transferred to Spence AAF (Georgia) and, other than some contingents of French and Chinese flight students, aviation training ended at Gunter. By February 1946, Gunter's remaining aircraft were transferred to Maxwell Army Air Base and the field went to \\"stand by\\" status. In January 1948 Gunter Field was redesignated Gunter Air Force Base. In May 1950, the Air University located its Extension Course Institute there. In October of that year, a branch of the School of Aviation Medicine was also established. =Air Defense Command= In 1957 a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-09) was established at Gunter AFB. The SAGE system was an early generation computer network linking Air Force (and later FAA) general air surveillance radar stations into a centralized center for continental air defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the Montgomery Air Defense Sector (MoADS), established on 8 September 1957. MoADS was synonymous with 32nd NORAD Region, which encompassed an area from the Cuban landmass north to Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. MoADS was a blockhouse with 18 inch thick steel-reinforced concrete walls designed to withstand anything but a direct nuclear hit. There were 4 floors, with the bottom floor for inputs, the second floor for computer systems, and the fourth floor for operations. SAGE sites had twin AN/FSQ-7 computers that encompassed an area the size of a football field. These IBM-built systems were tube-based with wire and washer memory banks. IBM also built in excellent diagnostics and redundancy, so the system should always be operational. The memory was 64K, with the incoming radar information storage was on magnetic drums and the maximum response overload before collapse was around 45 seconds. In the 1960s, MoADS also assisted in hosting William Tell, a then-annual competition of Air Defense Command (ADC), later Aerospace Defense Command (ADC), and Royal Canadian Air Force fighter-interceptor squadrons that was held at Tyndall AFB, Florida. In the 1960s, this competition included live shoot-downs of Firebee aerial target drones launched from Tyndall AFB, and obsolescent QB-47E Stratojet bombers and BOMARC missiles launched from nearby Eglin AFB, Florida. On 16 December 1960, the SAGE facility at Gunter controlled two BOMARC-B missiles launched from Eglin AFB and directed their interception of a QB-47E Stratojet drone flying at 500 mph at 30,000 feet. William Tell also showcased various air defense development programs. One was the Mach 3+ YF-12 interceptor that later became the basis for the SR-71 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. In the early 1960s, a YF-12 would launch from Edwards AFB, California, climb to around 70,000 feet and intercept a drone over the Gulf of Mexico that was launched Eglin AFB, shoot it down, and then return to Edwards AFB. This was a spectacular show of advanced technology of that time. MoADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966 and redesignated as the 32d Air Division. DC-09 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 32d Air Division until it and the Air Division were inactivated on 31 December 1969 when technology advances allowed the Air Force to shut down many SAGE Data Centers. =Gunter Annex= In 1971, nearly of Gunter were returned to the city of Montgomery. In that year the Air Force Data Systems Design Center moved there and in 1972 the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy came to Gunter. In early 1973, Gunter was redesignated an \\"Air Force Station\\". Major construction was undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to the advocacy of Congressman William Dickinson, and in 1988 Gunter was redesignated an \\"Air Force Base\\". The primary tenants were still the Extension Course Institute, the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy and the Air Force Data Systems Design Center. In March 1992, Gunter was again redesignated, this time as Maxwell Air Force Base, Gunter Annex, and now falls under the command of nearby Maxwell Air Force Base. =Previous names= * Army Air Corps Basic Flying School, Municipal Airport, Montgomery, Alabama, 27 August 1940 * Gunter Field, 10 February 1941 * Gunter Air Force Base, 13 January 1948 * Gunter Air Force Station, 1 February 1973 * Gunter Air Force Base, 1 July 1988 * Maxwell Air Force Base, Gunter Annex, 1 March 1992 =Major commands to which assigned= * Southeast Air Corps Training Center, 27 August 1940 * Air Corps Flying Training Command, 23 January 1942 : Re- designated: Army Air Forces Flying Training Command, 15 March 1942 * Army Air Forces Training Command, 31 July 1943 * Army Air Forces School, 15 December 1945 * Re-designated: Air University, 12 Mar 1946 * Air Training Command, 15 May 1978 : Re-designated: Air Education and Training Command, 1 July 1993 =Major ADCOM units assigned= * Montgomery Air Defense Sector, 8 September 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1966 : Redesignated: 32d Air Division, 1 April 1966-31 December 1969 * Fourteenth Air Force, 1 April 1966 ‚Äì 1 July 1968 See also * Air Training Command * Maxwell Air Force Base * Alabama World War II Army Airfields * 74th Flying Training Wing (World War II) * United States general surveillance radar stations References * Shaw, Frederick J.

He feels that most of the workouts that are published in the bodybuilding press and magazines are not effective for normal people (without genetic advantages and/or the use of steroids) and will either be ineffective or induce injury if attempted. McRoberts emphasizes strict, correct form for lifts to avoid the possibility of injury, and his publications are exhaustively detailed about correct and incorrect forms. Trainees are also encouraged to use only weights that allow strict form to be maintained. Routines are also to be entered into gradually, again to prevent injury. McRobert also endorses Active Release Techniques and Trigger Point Therapy between workouts to minimize discomfort and injury. In his latest book he also espouses the benefits of yoga to improve flexibility. References *McRobert, Stuart, \\"A Biographical Sketch\\", Hardgainer, July‚ÄìAugust, 1994.

The first vessel, Stevenson (DD-503), was cancelled during construction and never completed. Both ships are named for John H. Stevenson. Stevenson was laid down on 23 July 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 11 November 1942, sponsored by Miss Mary Stevenson, daughter of Pay Inspector Stevenson. The ship was commissioned on 15 December 1942, Lieutenant Commander Thomas C. Greene in command. Service history Stevenson commenced shakedown in late December immediately after commissioning, but, on 4 February 1943, she collided with SS Berwind Vale off Newport, Rhode Island, losing part of her bow. After repairs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, she escorted five merchant convoys between the U.S. east coast and North African ports. During that period, March through December 1943, she made several attacks on suspected submarine contacts, but none resulted in a confirmed kill. On 23 January 1944, Stevenson left Norfolk to join the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Southwest Pacific. Shortly after arriving, she saw her first action, providing gunfire support for the landings on Los Negros Island in the Admiralties on 29 February 1944. For the next five months she took part in the leap-frogging assaults along the New Guinea coast, participating in the landings in Humboldt Bay in April, at Wakde in May, and at Sansapor and Noemfoor in July. On 20 August, Stevenson departed New Guinea to join the Palau Islands invasion force. She was employed during the landings as a unit of the transport screen, both en route and at the objective. Upon completion of the Palau operations, she sailed on 14 October for Seattle, Washington, for overhaul. Refresher training lasted until 27 January 1945, when she left Pearl Harbor for Ulithi. From February to August 1945, Stevenson escorted the replenishment units of the Logistics Support Group, which supported the fast carrier forces during the Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations and the air strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 5 June, she weathered a typhoon; by the end of the war, she was operating within 200 miles (370 km) of the Japanese coast to support Admiral William F. Halsey's carriers. After brief occupation duty, during which she rode out Typhoon Louise in Japan between 9‚Äì11 October, the destroyer sailed for home via Singapore and Cape Town. She arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, on 20 January 1946, where she was decommissioned on 27 April 1946 and placed in reserve. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1968. Stevenson earned seven battle stars for her World War II service.

Stockton. Stockton was laid down on 24 July 1942 at Kearny, New Jersey, by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. and launched on 11 November 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Horace K. Corbin. The ship was commissioned on 11 January 1943, Lieutenant Commander R. E. Braddy in command. Service history =Atlantic service= After shakedown, Stockton joined the Atlantic Fleet on 15 March 1943 and began escorting convoys between New York and North African ports. Between 28 May 1943 and 3 January 1944, she escorted four convoys. On her last convoy run, she escorted two oilers to Ponta Delgada, in the Azores, in company with ‚Äî the first ships to enter the port under the terms of the new agreement between the Allies and the government of Portugal. On 24 January 1944, Stockton got underway for the South West Pacific theatre. =Transfer to Pacific and Admiralties campaign= On arrival, Stockton joined the Seventh Fleet forces assembled for the invasion of Los Negros Island in the Admiralties. She participated in the initial bombardment that cleared the way for the landings on 29 February and remained in the area for three days, patrolling and giving fire support to the forces ashore. From 9 to 13 March, she supported similar but smaller landings in Seeadler Harbor. As American forces leapfrogged along the northern coast of New Guinea, Stockton acted as an antiaircraft and antisubmarine screening vessel during the landings in Humboldt Bay on 22 April and at Wakde on 17 May; and she provided gunfire support for the Biak landings on 27 May. While off Biak, she received minor damage when hit by a shell from a shore battery on 28 May, and on 12 June, she towed into Humboldt Bay, after that destroyer had been immobilized by a bomb hit amidships. =New Guinea operations= On 2 July, she was with the invasion forces off Noemfoor and acted both as screening and fire-support ship during the landings. After a month of escort and training duty along the northern coast of New Guinea, she sailed from New Guinea on 22 August to join units of the 3rd Fleet for the invasion of the Palau Islands. The destroyer escorted the transports as they approached Peleliu on 15 September and protected them after the landings until she headed home on 14 October. =Iwo Jima and Okinawa= After overhaul at Seattle, Washington, Stockton completed refresher training at Pearl Harbor on 24 January 1945. Between 10 February and 9 March, she screened escort carriers as they provided air cover for the landings on Iwo Jima. On 21 February, two days after the landings, Stocktons group was attacked by four suicide planes, which sank the escort carrier , and damaged .

It was led by John Bean. The group, which was subject to internal divisions during its brief history, established some areas of local support before helping to form the National Front in 1967. Scholar Nigel Fielding described the BNP as having a \\"firmly Nazi\\" ideology. Formation The party was formed in 1960 by the merger of the National Labour Party and the White Defence League (WDL), two political splinter groups from the League of Empire Loyalists pressure group.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 177 Both groups had been active in Notting Hill and had been co-operating closely there since the previous year when a merger was agreed. The new group, which was based at Arnold Leese House in Notting Hill (the former home of the Imperial Fascist League leader, used by WDL leader Colin Jordan as his base of operations), adopted the motto \\"For Race and Nation\\" and pledged to oppose the \\"international Jewish-controlled money-lending system\\" in its founding policy statement. Indeed, so strong was BNP anti-Semitism that the party advocated the immediate deportation of all Britain's Jews to either Israel or Madagascar, recalling the Madagascar Plan that was briefly considered by Nazi Germany. It also demanded an end to immigration, repatriation of immigrants, and the impeachment of the Conservative government for what the BNP felt to be their complicity in allowing uncontrolled immigration. The party was led by John Bean, with Andrew Fountaine holding the position of Party President, and other leading members including John Tyndall, Colin Jordan (who served as Activities Organiser), Denis Pirie and Ted Budden. Leese's widow, who had given Jordan access to her home during his time as WDL leader, served as vice- president of the party. Activities The party's early activities were hamstrung by a lack of money, and so it was restricted to the sort of headline-grabbing that had been the stock-in-trade of the WDL. These included demonstrating at railway stations where immigrant-carrying trains were arriving, holding a counter-demonstration to one organised by the Anti- Apartheid Movement, and holding a rally to oppose the Lord Mayor's Show because the presiding Lord Mayor of London, Bernard Waley-Cohen, was Jewish. Even so, the BNP managed to secure an 8.1% share of the vote in Deptford in the 1960 London County Council (LCC) election, a large result for a new party without name recognition. A National Youth Movement was also organised; this was sponsored by General Sir Richard Hilton, who was leader of his own Patriotic Party. Although rumours circulated at the time that German neo-Nazi groups were funding the BNP, there is no evidence to support this; it seems likely that the party was supported by a mixture of collections held in Trafalgar Square and funds from Fountaine who was personally well-off. Elements within the party also expressed support for Nazism, and a paramilitary arm, Spearhead, was set up by Tyndall.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p. 178 Spearhead had initially been set up as group aimed at establishing the BNP outside London although its very youthful membership soon lent it a more violent character. Colin Jordan, who would later become a fierce critic of Tyndall would later suggest that Spearhead was set up as much to get Tyndall out of the way as anything else. The party also hosted a summer camp on Fountaine's land and this grew into an international event, beginning in 1961 when delegates attended from the National States' Rights Party and the Nordic Reich Party among others. In early 1962 Oswald Mosley had approached both Jordan and Bean and had offered them positions as national organisers within his group, which would subsume the BNP. However the plan was rejected as neither man had faith in Mosley while the two were increasingly on a collision course within the BNP itself.

Bean had first raised the issue in 1961 when he almost unseated Jordan from his role as national organiser and in February 1962 he presented a resolution condemning Jordan's open Nazism at a meeting of the national council. The resolution was passed 7 votes to 5 and, after a struggle, the party split with around 80% of the membership backing Bean and the rest, including Tyndall and Pirie, leaving with Jordan to join a new National Socialist Movement. The remaining BNP came under effective control of John Bean, who had previously been limited in his control by the presence of Jordan, as a result of the split. Opposition The departure of Jordan and the subsequent arrest of the leaders of the NSM brought a lot of public attention to the far-right in general and the BNP's 1962 summer camp, where a Falangist and an Organisation arm√©e secr√®te leader were among the guests, was surrounded by press photographers despite Fountaine telling them that it was merely a \\"holiday camp\\". Meanwhile, the BNP, along with the Union Movement and other extremist groups, faced increasing opposition from the Jewish \\"Yellow Star Movement\\", which had itself become increasingly radicalised with a group of 40 BNP members attacked and beaten up on 2 September 1962 in London. Bean's BNP Under the sole control of Bean the party, like most of its contemporaries on the far right, had a severe shortage of money and as early as 1963 an issue of the party journal Combat spoke of possible doom for the BNP if new sources of money were not found. However against this backdrop a new area of local support opened up for the BNP. Following changes in the local demographics a group of whites set up a Southall Residents Association which, while not specifically anti-immigration, wanted the immigrants already in the area to integrate while stopping further migrants from settling locally. Although this was the official policy some members, notably chairman Arthur Cooney and treasurer Doris Hart, wanted stronger opposition and in the 1963 local elections they nominated two BNP candidates to stand in the Glebe and Hambrough wards. Although neither was elected their votes were respectable, 13.5% in Glebe and 27.5% in Hambrough where the Labour Party lost a normally safe seat to the Conservative Party after a swing from Labour to BNP. Bean saw the potential in this sort of local issue as a springboard to finally building the sort of mass party that he desired and as such he stood as a candidate in Southall in the 1964 general election. Adopting a platform based on ending all \\"coloured\\" immigration and offering National Assistance only to immigrants who agreed to accept repatriation Bean secured 9% of the vote, which was at that point the highest ever won by a candidate running on an avowedly racialist ticket. With a \\"Stop Immigration Now\\" campaign the party finally enjoyed some comparative success. However within the political mainstream the major parties began to turn away from the immigration issue and this mood was reflected by the electorate in the 1966 general election with vocal anti-immigration politicians either suffering reduced majorities, as happened to Enoch Powell, or the loss of seats, like Peter Griffiths. This shift in attitudes impacted upon the BNP with Bean's personal vote in Southall falling to 7.4%, a candidate in Deptford winning 7% and a candidate in Smethwick, where much local work had been undertaken by the party, managing only 1.5%. Under Bean the BNP grew to become the largest political party on the far right and the only one with a comparatively good track record in electoral politics yet its ambitions were consistently hamstrung by a terminal lack of money and increasingly it looked like the future for the BNP lay in working much more closely with other groups.David Boothroyd, The Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, London: Politico's, 2001, p. 21 The National Front With a new spirit of unity prevalent on the far right, John Tyndall approached the BNP in early 1966 with a request that it should merge with his Greater Britain Movement and the Racial Preservation Society. However Ron Cuddon, a member of the BNP Council and staunch opponent of Tyndall, vetoed the request while it was also rejected by the RPS. In September that same year however the BNP agreed with leading RPS member Dr David Brown that they would seek to unify as the National Democratic Party. Within a week however this plan had been abandoned both due to Bean still wanting to find an accommodation with the GBM and his reluctance to serve under Brown, who insisted on full leadership of the new party for himself. Sensing that his own presence was putting Chesterton off, due to his own neo-Nazi background, Bean resigned from the BNP Council in September 1966 with his place being taken by Philip Maxwell, who was close to Chesterton. As a result, merger negotiations that began with the LEL soon afterwards were not attended by Bean but rather saw Maxwell and Fountaine present the BNP's case. Maxwell addressed the LEL conference in October 1966 by which time merger discussions were so far advanced that the names National Independence Party and British Front were already being considered for the new group. At the conference a working party was established to finalise details of the new group, consisting of Philip Maxwell, Bernard Simmons and Gerald Kemp from the BNP and Austen Brooks, Rosine de Bounevialle, Avril Walters and Nettie Bonner representing the LEL. On 7 February 1967 the BNP officially went out of existence as the new movement, by now officially known as the National Front, was declared in existence.

In commission from 1942 to 1947, she saw service in World War II, primarily in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Service history =Construction and commissioning= Dual launch of Tillman and Beatty Tillman was laid down on 1 May 1941 at the Charleston Navy Yard in Charleston, South Carolina; launched on 20 December 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Charles Sumner Moore; and commissioned on 4 June 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Francis Douglas McCorkle in command. = 1942 = From June until September 1942, Tillman underwent sea trials and shakedown off the United States East Coast. In September and October, the new destroyer escorted convoys and participated in exercises on the Eastern Sea Frontier before getting underway on 23 October from the Chesapeake Bay with a convoy bound for Operation Torch. Shortly before midnight on 7 November, Tillman reached a point some off the coast of Africa and began screening the unloading transports of the Center Attack Group during the Naval Battle of Casablanca near Fedhala. While screening off the transport area, Tillman engaged Vichy French patrol vessel, W-43, which had attempted to slip six merchant ships into the transport area despite the destroyer's warnings. After coming under fire from Tillmans guns, the patrol vessel exploded and beached herself. Tillman later captured three French merchant ships. On 10 November, American troops advancing on Casablanca from the east came under fire from Vichy French destroyers. Tillman, the heavy cruiser , and the destroyer attacked the French ships, at the same time drawing fire from the French shore batteries, including that at El Hank. Maneuvering at speeds of up to , Tillman fired on the French ships, leaving one vessel steaming in circles, before she returned to her station off the transport area. On 12 November, Tillman departed the area escorting a convoy which weathered seas before arriving safely at New York on 1 December 1942. = 1943 = Tillman continued convoy duty in the wintry Atlantic and then participated in exercises off Casco Bay, Maine. Departing New York Harbor in the early hours of 8 February 1943, a dark night with unusually strong tides, Tillman sideswiped the paravane boom of an improperly illuminated merchant vessel anchored directly in the channel. After repairs at New York, Tillman operated on the Eastern Sea Frontier in February and March 1943, performing escort duties and participating in exercises. In the spring of 1943, Tillman protected convoys in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. On 6 July 1943, Tillman screened the sortie from Oran of a convoy bound for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. In the days that followed, she provided neutralizing fire on beach defenses and picked off artillery which menaced troops landing near Scoglitti. Before dawn on 10 July, Tillman fired her first salvo into Yellow Beach at 03:31, as the assault got underway. At 04:30, a stick of six bombs dropped by enemy aircraft exploded off Tillmans starboard bow, temporarily knocking out her radar. An hour later, Tillman silenced a shore battery which had been firing on Yellow Beach. Enemy aircraft, flying in low over the land where they were indiscernible by radar, harassed landing troops and supporting ships. Fear of hitting troops on the beaches forced the Allied ships to withhold their fire when aiming at the low- flying planes. During the night of 10‚Äì11 July, Tillman patrolled off the invasion beaches. On 11 July, she repelled enemy aerial bombing attacks and supplied fire missions called in by shore observers. On 16 July, Tillman returned to Oran to guard returning transports. During the remainder of 1943, Tillman escorted convoys in Mediterranean and Atlantic waters, experiencing many dangerous moments as she protected vulnerable merchant vessels from enemy submarines and airplanes. While en route from New York to Bizerte on 2 September 1943, one day after passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, Tillman was attacked by a Luftwaffe torpedo plane. Patchy haze limited visibility to when the plane, incorrectly identified as friendly, dropped torpedoes. Quick maneuvering saved Tillman from destruction by the torpedo which crossed about ahead and passed down her port side trailing a sinister wake. During the same attack, the destroyer was damaged by a German torpedo. Two days later, the convoy arrived at Bizerte, but the illusion of safety in port was dispelled on 6 September 1943 by a 30-minute air attack on the harbor. Tillman engaged the attackers with her main battery and machine guns. Thirteen members of her crew were injured when a spent shell exploded on the deck of the ship. On 6 November 1943, as she steamed off the coast of French Algeria, Tillman helped repel a German air attack on the port quarter of a convoy carrying troops and supplies for the Italian campaign. An estimated 25 German aircraft, many armed with glide bombs, took part in the raid, and sank two merchantmen and Tillmans sister ship . In the first wave of the attack, a Dornier 217 singled out Tillman as the target of her glide bomb. The radio-controlled missile came in at a terrific speed, but Tillmans machine guns splashed it in a violent explosion only off the destroyer's port bow. Soon after, a second glide bomb intended for Tillmans destruction splashed and exploded, again only away, as Tillman shot down its launching plane. A third glide bomb splashed off the ship's starboard beam as its parent craft turned back in the face of Tillmans concerted fire. During this first stage of the attack, Tillman maneuvered constantly and rapidly to evade the glide bombs. Her own safety temporarily secured, Tillman then turned her guns on planes attacking the convoy and splashed another attacker. Soon, the final and fiercest phase of the attack began as five German planes attacked Tillman. As her main battery engaged the raiders, Tillman turned left full rudder to evade torpedoes, two of which passed nearly parallel to the ship at distances of . Moments later, as Tillman swung to port to regain her station, a heavy explosion shook the ship. This detonation, thought to have been caused by a torpedo exploding in the destroyer's wake, caused her no serious damage, and she turned to the task of rescuing survivors from the sinking merchant freighter SS Santa Elena. She then proceeded to Philippeville to disembark the survivors. = 1944 ‚Äì 1946 = Japanese approaching Tillman in preparation for the surrendering of Yap Island Japanese atoll commander on Tillman for the surrendering of Yap Island During December 1943 and throughout 1944, Tillman escorted convoys between ports in the United States, the Mediterranean, and the United Kingdom. Occasionally, she varied this duty with overhaul at New York or exercises off New England. In the first three months of 1945, Tillman participated in exercises in the Caribbean and off the United States East Coast before departing on 28 March 1945 from the Delaware Bay and steaming via the Panama Canal Zone and San Diego, California, for Hawaii. Following her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 21 April, she took part in exercises in Hawaiian waters, then departed the area on 1 May 1945. Until September 1945, Tillman performed life guard and antisubmarine picket duties, based at Guam and Ulithi Atoll. On 6 September 1945 at Tamil Harbor, the commanding officer of the Imperial Japanese Army garrison on Yap Island formally surrendered to the American atoll commander from Ulithi on board Tillman. Tillman continued to operate in the Caroline Islands and southern Mariana Islands until 3 November 1945, when she proceeded to Pearl Harbor. Then, continuing on, she steamed via the Panama Canal to the United States East Coast, arriving at Charleston on 11 December 1946 for inactivation. Tillman was decommissioned on 6 February 1947. =Final disposition= After over 23 years of inactivity, Tillman was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1970. She was sold for scrapping on 8 May 1972.  Honors and awards  Tillman received three battle stars for World War II service.

Nelson, who served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. Nelson was laid down on 7 May 1942 at the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 15 September 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Nelson Stewart, daughter of Rear Admiral Nelson. The ship was commissioned on 26 November 1942, Lieutenant Commander M. M. Riker in command. Service history After shakedown along the Atlantic coast, Nelson reported to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 21 January 1943. Through 29 May, she operated on convoy duty as flagship of Destroyer Squadron 17, making runs to Bermuda, Port of Spain, Trinidad, Dakar, French West Africa; Aruba, Netherlands West Indies; Casablanca; and Gibraltar. = Invasion of Sicily, 1943 = Upon completion of a short training period at Norfolk, Virginia, Nelson got underway 7 June to take part in the invasion of Sicily. During the crossing she screened the cruiser , arriving at Algiers on 20 June. Serving as flagship for Commander Task Force 81 (TF 81) during the Sicily operation, Nelson was assigned duty with the central part of the Western Task Force. This group was to land assault troops on beachheads near Gela, Sicily, to expand the captured area, and to seize the nearby airfield at Ponte Olivo. At 02:46 on 10 July the first assault waves hit the Gela beaches. Plunging in through the breakers, the shock troops encountered light opposition. But furious gunfire raked the follow-up waves. Caught in the blue- white glare of searchlights, landing craft were subjected to intense fire, and LCIs took direct hits. At 03:00 Nelson commenced figure eight patrols to the east of the transports. Shortly after dawn Axis aircraft joined the fight, flying out of the Acate River valley on the eastern coast and attempting to bomb and strafe Allied ships, landing craft, and beaches. Nelson fired sporadically at the planes throughout the day. At 12:30 she received word that the destroyer had been sunk. Enemy aircraft continued the attack the next day, delivering a high level bombing attack on Nelsons area and obtaining a direct hit on the Liberty ship . By 23:02 the ships commenced laying a heavy smoke screen, and the Axis attacks were beaten off. German dive bombers buzzed in on a surprise attack from the northeast at 17:33 on 12 July, dropping bombs and making strafing runs. Nelson splashed one plane at 17:42 and an hour later departed in convoy for Algiers, North Africa. Returning to the battle area on 17 July, she took up antisubmarine patrol station around Gela and Scoglitti until 23 July, when she returned to Algiers. Later, on 30 July, she escorted troopships into Palermo Harbor on the north coast of Sicily. During this operation she was harassed by constant German air attacks. At 05:48 on 1 August she opened fire on a single plane, splashing it with the third salvo. Nelson returned to New York on 22 August, where Lt. Comdr. Thomas D. McGrath relieved Lt. Comdr. Riker of command on 3 September. The ship was assigned to North Atlantic convoy runs for the winter. This duty took the destroyer to Belfast, Northern Ireland three times and to Greenock Bay, Scotland, and Gibraltar once each. = Invasion of Normandy, 1944 = In May 1944 Nelson steamed to England to stage for the coming Normandy invasion. While moored alongside a tanker at Plymouth, England on 24 May, her port screw fouled a mooring buoy, causing extensive damage to the screw and shaft. Nelson was placed in drydock where the screw and shaft, deemed beyond repair, were removed. But the need for fighting ships was so great that Nelson got underway on 2 June with only a starboard screw. At Milford Haven she rendezvoused with a convoy, and by 8 June was in the Normandy assault area. The next day she steamed into position No. 13 on the \\"Dixie Line\\" as part of the anti-submarine and E-boat screen around the Omaha beachhead. E-boats were the German version of PT boats ‚Äì speedy, agile, hard-hitting, and hard to hit. Armed with 40 mm guns and torpedoes, they specialized in night attacks. On the night of 8/9 June several destroyers on the \\"Dixie Line\\" had taken under fire and chased several of these E-boats, sinking two. Nelson was anchored in position 13 the night of 12 June. Thus far her only contact with the enemy had been in the form of a glide bomb which had exploded harmlessly off the starboard quarter during her first night in the area. At 01:05 on 13 June she made a radar contact, challenged the contact by flashing light, and opened fire. The target slowed, turned away, and split into three distinct blips. The destroyer had loosed ten salvos when a torpedo struck her just aft the No. 4 gun mount blowing off the stern and No. 4 mount. stood by to transfer personnel, and Nelson was taken in tow. Twenty-four of her crew were killed or missing and nine wounded. After emergency repairs at Derry, Northern Ireland, where her #2 turret and torpedo tubes were removed as a weight saving/stability measure, the destroyer was towed to Boston where she received a new stern. Nelson being towed back to Boston for repairs, after losing her stern from#4 turret aft to a German E-boat torpedo on 13 June 1944, off Normandy. Extensive repairs completed 23 November 1944, Nelson returned to Atlantic patrol duty. During December she steamed to Plymouth, England, conducting anti-submarine patrol en route. She departed New York late in February 1945 on a convoy run to Oran, Algeria, returning 31 March. Throughout April and May Nelson served as plane guard and screen for the escort carrier , and on 16 May Lt. Comdr. Clark W. Freeman, USNR, relieved Comdr. McGrath as skipper. The destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 1 August en route Pearl Harbor, and then to Tokyo Bay 3‚Äì14 September, following Japan's surrender. The last part of September she steamed to Okinawa, Korea, and Singapore, which she reached on 24 August. En route home, she arrived Colombo, Ceylon on 30 August. There, two days later, Lt. Comdr. Scott Lothrop relieved Lt. Comdr. Freeman as commanding officer; and on 3 November, Nelson sailed for New York, via Cape Town, South Africa, arriving 6 December. She got underway again on 29 January 1946 for Charleston, South Carolina. By directive dated January 1947, Nelson was placed out of commission, in reserve, U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and berthed at Charleston. She was struck from the Naval Register on 1 March 1968 and sold in July 1969. Nelson earned two battle stars for World War II service.

She was the only ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Charles H. Baldwin, an 1864 Medal of Honor recipient. Baldwin was laid down on 19 July 1941 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington and launched on 14 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Ida E. Crawford, daughter of Acting Master's Mate Baldwin. The ship was commissioned on 30 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander George Knuepfer in command, and reported to the United States Atlantic Fleet. Service history =1943= After shakedown training along the West Coast, the destroyer put to sea from San Francisco, California, on 1 July, bound for the East Coast. The flagship of Destroyer Division 36 (DesDiv 36), Baldwin led her division into Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 July and operated along the east coast until getting underway from New York on 13 August in the screen of a convoy bound for Casablanca, Morocco. Similar arrangements occupied her time until late January 1944, when she resumed duty along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. =1944= Some three months later, on 17 April 1944, Baldwin headed for Europe in the screen for , , and . The destroyer arrived at Plymouth, England, on 28 April and began a routine that combined patrols in British waters with preparations for the invasion of Normandy. USS Baldwin in 1944 On 5 June, she departed the Isle of Portland in company with other units of the Western Naval Task Force. As a unit of the gunfire support group during the assault, Baldwin assisted the troops ashore with naval gunfire. In return, she suffered two hits from a light-caliber shore battery on D-Day, but sustained only slight damage. On 9 June, Baldwin joined in repulsing an attack by German E-boats and received credit for destroying one of them. She operated off the coast of France until 15 July when she returned to England. Three days later, the destroyer departed Plymouth in the screen of a 50-ship convoy bound for North Africa and arrived in Bizerte, Tunisia, on 28 July. She operated in the western Mediterranean mostly between Oran, Algeria, and Naples, Italy before arriving off Saint-Tropez on 15 August, D-Day for the invasion of southern France. Baldwin served there as an element of the Antisubmarine and Convoy Control Group, Task Group 80.6 (TG 80.6) which screened follow up convoys between Oran and southern France. On 23 September, she concluded her part in that operation and departed Oran in company with her division mates bound for the United States. =1945= Upon her arrival at New York on 3 October, the destroyer resumed operations in American coastal waters. On 21 January 1945, Baldwin put to sea from Norfolk to rendezvous with the cruiser which carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the first leg of the trip to the \\"Big Three\\" conference at Yalta. She returned to New York on 27 February and began four months of operations in American waters. During that time, Baldwin escorted to the Panama Canal Zone and operated off the east coast in the antisubmarine screens of the aircraft carriers and . On 24 June, the destroyer sailed from New York on her way to the Pacific. Steaming in company with , she visited Guantanamo Bay in Cuba; Balboa in the Canal Zone and San Diego before arriving at Pearl Harbor on 12 August. A month later, the warship joined Task Force 55 (TF 55) at Okinawa to prepare for the occupation of Sasebo, Japan, and participated in that operation between 20 September and 2 October. By 7 October, Baldwin was at Pusan, Korea, supporting forces sweeping mines along the Chinese and Korean coasts, a task at which she labored for the remainder of 1945.

Harding was launched on 28 June 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington, sponsored by Mrs. Sherwood A. Taffinder. The ship was commissioned on 25 May 1943, Lieutenant Commander G. G. Palmer in command. Service history After shakedown out of San Diego, Harding sailed 1 July for Norfolk, via the Panama Canal. Arriving Hampton Roads on 19 July, she trained in Chesapeake Bay and off the East Coast. She joined a convoy at Norfolk on 16 August 1943 and for the next eight months was assigned antisubmarine patrol for merchant convoys in the Atlantic. During this period of guarding the sea Harding made three round trips to Casablanca. After escorting the battleship on training exercises, Harding sailed 18 April with a convoy for Europe, and began her first great combat operation ‚Äî the invasion of Normandy. She spent the month of May training with other ships between Plymouth and Clyde. Then, early on 6 June 1944, Harding joined other naval units in the historic assault. Harding was assigned fire support station, and delivered close gunfire support to the troops ashore for the first hours of the landing. Her accurate gunfire destroyed pillboxes and machine gun emplacements, blasting a way for the troops. Harding also sent a boat ashore at Pointe du Hoc to take supplies to the Rangers and bring out prisoners and wounded. She continued operations in the assault area until 16 July, protecting against air attack and assisting several transports in distress. Shifting her operations to the Mediterranean, Harding sailed on 1 August for Oran, Algeria, and from there proceeded to the southern France assault area, as a screening ship. She sailed almost immediately to Corsica, later returning to take up patrol station outside the assault area in southern France. On the night of 17 August, she detected a downed German plane, and after recovering bodies, proceeded to investigate an unidentified contact. As Hardings signalman sought to illuminate the stranger, a burst of machine-gun fire extinguished the light and revealed the presence of four E-boats. In company with three other destroyers, Harding began a running, twisting battle with the four boats, illuminated by star shell fire, and despite their superior maneuverability, all four were sunk, three by Harding. She brought survivors ashore and resumed her patrol until 24 August. Harding joined a convoy of LCIs en route to Oran, Algeria on 24 August, returned to southern France until 6 September, and sailed for New York on 25 September 1944. Arriving New York on 3 October, she proceeded to Boston for conversion to a destroyer minesweeper; she was reclassified DMS-28 on 15 November. Emerging on 1 December for her trials, Harding underwent training until 30 December and sailed for the Pacific. She arrived San Diego via the Panama Canal Zone on 15 January 1945, and continued her training in minesweeping techniques. Sailing on 10 February via Pearl Harbor, Harding arrived at Ulithi on 9 March to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa, the last and largest of the giant Pacific amphibious assaults. She departed for Okinawa on 19 March and began her minesweeping operations in the surrounding areas on 24 March. During the initial landings on 1 April 1945 Harding served as an outer screening ship, and continued this dangerous duty during the savage air attacks which followed. After a near miss by a horizontal bomber during the first heavy raids of 6 April, Harding was assigned to provide fire support to forces ashore the night of 8 April. She returned to screening duties the next day, and on 16 April was attacked with other ships by four kamikazes. One was driven off, another shot down, but a third steered directly for Hardings bridge. As gunfire ripped into her, the aircraft splashed close aboard to starboard, tearing a huge gash in Hardings side from keel to main deck when her bomb exploded. The stricken ship backed toward Kerama Retto, counting 14 men killed, 8 missing, and 9 wounded. She repaired at Okinawa, and arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 22 August via Saipan. From Hawaii, Harding transited the Panama Canal via San Diego and arrived at Norfolk on 17 September. She decommissioned on 2 November 1945, and was sold for scrap on 16 April 1947 to Luia Brothers Co., Inc., of Philadelphia. Awards Harding received three battle stars for World War II service.

While remaining a member of the Unitarian church, in 1930-1957 he was the dean of the Abraham Lincoln Center in Chicago, which served as a clearinghouse for humanists active in political and intellectual programs.See \\"Curtis Williford Reese.\\" Religious Leaders of America (Gale, 1999) References Category:1887 births Category:1961 deaths Category:American Unitarians Category:American humanists Category:Christian humanists ","title":"Curtis W.

The village is about 5 miles from Ponteland on the A696, which links the village with Newcastle upon Tyne and Jedburgh. The population of the civil parish was 436 at the 2001 census, increasing to 518 at the 2011 Census. Scottish nobleman and doctor John de Strivelyn was granted the manor around 1340 by Edward III. On his death, the estate passed to his daughter, who was married to Sir John Middleton, and has remained with the Middleton family since. Belsay parish includes the former parishes of Bitchfield, Black Heddon, Bolam, Bolam Vicarage, Bradford, Gallowhill, Harnham, Newham, Shortflatt, Trewick, and Wallridge.https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/sheet/os_maps_revised_1944/Northumberland_1931_1944 Belsay is home to Belsay Castle, a fine medieval castle, and to Belsay Hall.  Landmarks  Belsay Castle is a 14th-century medieval castle situated at Belsay. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building. The main structure, a three-storey rectangular pele tower with rounded turrets and battlements, was constructed about 1370, and was the home of the Middleton family. In 1614 Thomas Middleton built a new manor house attached to the tower. A west wing was added in 1711 but was later largely demolished in 1872 by Sir Arthur Middleton when the remainder of the house was considerably altered. The castle was abandoned as a residence by the family in the early 19th century when Sir Charles Monck built Belsay Hall close by. It is administered by English Heritage and is open the public. Belsay Hall Belsay Hall is a 19th-century country mansion and a Grade I listed building. The house was built between 1810 and 1817 for Sir Charles Monck (then of Belsay Castle close by). Sir Charles himself was the designer of the building. It is a notable and early classical building. The house measures square with a lower kitchen wing attached to the north side. It is in two storeys. The hall was the residence of the Middleton family until 1962. 15th-century Bitchfield Tower and Shortflatt Tower are in the parish. Aruna Ratanagiri Buddhist Monastery of Thai Forest Tradition lies on a hilltop 3 miles to the north-west of Belsay, in the hamlet of Harnham.

It connects Interstate 14 (I-14), U.S. Route 190 (US 190), and U.S. Highway 190 Business (Bus. US 190) outside of Copperas Cove to Farm to Market Road 116 (FM 116) on the north side of Copperas Cove. The highway opened on February 20, 2014 with a ribbon cutting at 2:00 PM. Route description The entire current route of SH 9 is a two-lane expressway sandwiched between the city of Copperas Cove and Fort Hood. It is and is entirely in Coryell County. SH 9 begins at an intersection with FM 116 (which is briefly a four-lane highway with a wide median) north of downtown Copperas Cove. It travels east entering the border of Fort Hood first crossing over Old Georgetown Road, then under Tank Destroyer Boulevard. Tank Destroyer Boulevard has a partial interchange with SH 9 allowing eastbound traffic to exit towards the base while traffic exiting the base may enter to the westbound lane. After passing over a railroad, SH 9 ends at a partial interchange with Bus. US 190 east of the city. The only movements allowed at the interchange are eastbound SH 9 to eastbound Bus. US 190 and vice versa. This interchange is within the same complex where Bus. US 190 has its eastern terminus at an interchange with Interstate 14 and US 190. History leftState Highway 9 (SH 9) was one of the original 25 Texas highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaid on top of the Puget Sound-Gulf Highway. In 1919 the routing follows the present day U.S. Highway 87 from Amarillo, through Canyon, Plainview, Lubbock, Big Spring, San Angelo, Brady, Mason, Fredericksburg, into San Antonio. From San Antonio, it follows U.S. Highway 181 from San Antonio, to Sinton and terminated in Corpus Christi. In 1919 the direct segment between San Angelo and Brady had not yet been built, so SH 9 was rerouted through Paint Rock for a short time (The segment would be completed by 1922). Much like other highways at the time, multiple alternate routings has been created using the same number, and SH 9 was no exception. From San Antonio, the second route left the city south via Pleasanton Road, merging with present-day U.S. Route 281 from Las Gallinas through Pleasanton splitting off onto present day Interstate 37 into Oakville. It continued west on SH 234 into Odem, and south on U.S. Route 77 back to I-37 to its terminus in Corpus Christi. The split date is unknown. left On February 17, 1920, SH 9A was designated on the more direct route from San Angelo to Brady. leftOn April 18, 1921 a third routing, signed as SH 9A was created alongside the previous two, overrunning the ambitious SH 12 route from Skidmore to Alice, and continuing south to its terminus in Pharr. On August 21, 1923, the original routing was resigned as SH 16 and had U.S. Route 181 overlaid on top of that. The second routing retained the SH 9 designation, continuing the numbering into Corpus Christi that way. The third routing was given its SH 12 assignment back from Skidmore to Alice and given a new assignment of SH 12 from Alice to Pharr. SH 9 was rerouted over SH 9A from San Angelo to Brady, which was cancelled. The old route through Paint Rock was cancelled (San Angelo to Paint Rock would be restored as SH 268 on May 24, 1938). The south end was truncated to Mathis. On April 21, 1924, SH 9 was to be rerouted from Three Rivers to Alice when right of way is acquired and the bridges were dedicated to the state of Texas. In 1926, U.S. Route 385 (now US 87) was overlaid on the original routing from Amarillo to San Antonio. On April 25, 1929, SH 9 was extended back to Corpus Christi. On March 19, 1930, the road from Three Rivers to Alice was renumbered as SH 145. On December 2, 1931, SH 9 was extended north from Amarillo to Stratford, replacing SH 115. On November 30, 1932, SH 9 was extended north to the Oklahoma border. On February 8, 1933, SH 9 Loop was designated in Tulia. The section from Amarillo to Oklahoma would eventually be overlaid with U.S. Route 287. On June 11, 1935, a new route through Comfort was created, and the old route is now Old No. 9 Highway. On July 15, 1935, the section of SH 9 from Stratford to Oklahoma was cancelled. On September 26, 1935, SH 9 Loop was designated in O'Donnell. On January 21, 1936, SH 9 Spur was designated in Ackerly. On August 1, 1936, the section from Stratford to Oklahoma was restored. On September 26, 1939, most of SH 9 was cancelled, leaving only the Three Rivers-Corpus Christi segment to the old highway. The SH 9 Loop and SH 9 Spur routes became Loop 67 (Ackerly), Loop 76 (O'Donnell), and Loop 77 (Tulia). On April 24, 1958, SH 9 was to be cancelled in Corpus Christi when I-37 was completed in Corpus Christi. On February 26, 1965, SH 9 was truncated to I-37 at Loma Alta Road in Corpus Christi, with the section east of there redesignated as Spur 407 (but was signed as Business SH 9). On May 31, 1971, a minute order said SH 9 will be cancelled with the completion of I-37. When I-37 was completed, SH 9 was cancelled, with the sections that were not replaced by I-37 redesignated as FM 3024 and Spur 459.

Welles was laid down on 27 September 1941 at Seattle, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp. and launched on 7 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Suzanne Dudley Welles Brainard. The ship was commissioned on 16 August 1943, Lieutenant Commander Doyle M. Coffee in command. Service history Following shakedown training along the west coast of the United States, Welles returned to Puget Sound on 26 October. After post-shakedown availability there, she got underway on 15 November in company with two British escort carriers which she escorted as far as San Diego, California. Continuing on her way, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 28 November and set a course for New York. She stopped along the way at Norfolk and, upon her arrival at New York on 4 December, joined Destroyer Division 38 (DesDiv 38). Ordered farther north, the warship departed New York on 26 December and arrived in Boston harbor the following day. On the 28th, she and her division mates got underway for the western Pacific in the screen of the battleship . The task unit stopped briefly at Norfolk where New Jerseys sister battleship, , joined it for the voyage to the Pacific. The unit transited the Panama Canal during the first week in January 1944 and continued its voyage west on 8 January. = Southwest Pacific Area = Welles and her traveling companions arrived at Funafuti in the Ellice Islands on 21 January and remained there for a week before getting underway for New Guinea. The destroyer arrived at Milne Bay on 5 February and joined the U.S. 7th Fleet. Later in the month, she escorted a convoy of LSTs to Cape Gloucester on the island of New Britain. On 29 February, Welles provided gunfire support for elements of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division then landing on Los Negros Island in the Admiralties. During that operation, the destroyer came under fire from enemy automatic weapons and at least one field gun but sustained no damage. After completing her portion of the mission, she moved out to the transport area to provide antisubmarine defense. Periodically, she returned close to shore to provide all fire for American troops fighting ashore. In March, she returned south to the area around Buna to prepare for operations to capture the remainder of the northern coast of New Guinea. During the Hollandia assault, the first of five leap frog steps to the Vogelkop, Welles was assigned to Task Group 77.2 (TG 77.2), the Central Attack Group which mounted its assault at Humboldt Bay on 22 April. About a month later, on 18 May, she supported the landings at Wakde Island and at Sarmi on the New Guinea mainland. From there, the warship continued with General Douglas MacArthur's amphibious jump to Biak Island where she provided gunfire support during the landings and consolidation operations from 27 May to 2 June. During that time, she destroyed several Japanese barges, harassed enemy ground forces, silenced a shore battery or two and helped to repel several air attacks. Leaving Biak on 2 June, the warship screened logistics convoys along the New Guinea coast for about a month before arriving off Noemfoor Island, located just west of Biak, to support the capture of that island. At the end of July, she participated in the last amphibious operation in New Guinea when troops went ashore at Cape Sansapor on the Vogelkop. She returned to Aitape early in August and then moved from there down the coast to Finschhafen whence she departed on 23 August, bound for the Solomon Islands. Welles arrived at Florida Island on 6 August and became a unit of the U.S. 3rd Fleet. She immediately plunged into preparations for the impending Palau attack. For the assault on Peleliu and Angaur, the destroyer initially screened the carriers providing air support. After the mid-September landings on the two islands, she was detached from the carriers and moved into the transport area to provide antisubmarine defense and to guard against any attempts to reinforce the two islands. At the conclusion of her participation in the Palau operation, she joined TG 77.2 and began preparations for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. = Western Pacific = She moved into Leyte Gulf on 18 October, two days before the actual landings, to cover preinvasion minesweeping and underwater demolition team operations. Her shells also contributed to the preinvasion bombardment of the objective. After the 20 October landings, the warship delivered call fire in support of the troops advancing ashore and defended the invasion fleet against the heavy enemy air attacks launched against it. In the latter role, she claimed one unassisted kill. When the Japanese launched their three-pronged surface attack to break up the Leyte assault, Welles joined the screen of Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's line of old battleships which virtually annihilated the enemy force which attempted to push through the Surigao Strait south of Leyte on the night of 24/25 October. Soon thereafter, she concluded her part in the Philippine operation and retired to Ulithi Atoll where she joined the screen of the Fast Carrier Task Force. For the remainder of her participation in the war Welles cruised with either the fast carriers or with their logistics unit as the flattops launched air strikes on Japan's inner defenses and supported from a distance the invasions at Luzon, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In June 1945, she retired to Leyte for rest and upkeep. On the 21st of that month, she received orders to return to the United States for a major overhaul. Steaming via Eniwetok and Oahu, the destroyer arrived in Bremerton, Washington on 16 July. She remained there through the end of hostilities in August and until late September. On 29 September, she got underway for the east coast. After a stop at San Pedro Harbor, she transited the Panama Canal on 14 October and headed for New York where she arrived on 20 October. In November, the ship moved south to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was placed out of commission on 4 February 1946. Welles was berthed with the Charleston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, until 10 February 1968 at which time her name was struck from the Navy list. On 18 July 1969, she was sold to the Union Minerals and Alloy Co. for scrapping. Welles earned eight battle stars during World War II.

The ship was commissioned on 23 June 1942, Lieutenant Commander Richard B. Levin in command. Service history After shakedown off New England, Knight arrived Norfolk 6 October to prepare for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. She cleared Chesapeake Bay on 23 October, joined her task force on 27 October, and arrived off Safi, French Morocco, 8 November. After serving as landing control ship during the assault, she conducted antisubmarine patrols until she sailed 13 November for the United States, arriving Norfolk on 24 November. From 12 December to 28 April 1943, Knight escorted three convoys between New York and the Moroccan ports of Casablanca and Fedhala. Steaming to Norfolk 29 May, she departed 8 June in convoy for the Mediterranean, where she arrived Oran, Algeria, 22 June to prepare for the invasion of Sicily. Sailing 5 July with Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk's Task Force 86 (TF 86), she arrived off Scoglitti during first watch on 9 July. As a fire support ship during Central Force landings on 10 July, she silenced enemy shore batteries and screened transports from hostile submarines and planes. On 11 July she downed an attacking enemy fighter and on 13 July sailed, arriving at Oran on 16 July. Knight made escort and patrol runs along the Algerian and Tunisian coasts, then returned to Sicily on 31 July to provide fire support for General George Patton's 7th Army. She operated out of Palermo until 22 August, helping repel several German night-bombing attacks and bombarding targets along the northern coast to Cape d'Orlando.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 13. is a small village on the River South Tyne in Northumberland, in England. It is situated southeast of Bardon Mill and to the west of Hexham. Beltingham is a most attractive village with stone houses surrounding a little green with pretty flowering gardens. There is a fine Georgian house near the church, and another nearby looks as if it was once a bastle house.  Governance  Beltingham is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.  Religious sites  The church is dedicated to St. Cuthbert and stands in a churchyard containing three massive yew trees, which are more than 700 years old,(see below) and may well have been used for the making of longbows before guns came. Bishop Nicholas Ridley was keen on archery, which was compulsory school sport in the days of Henry VIII. The yew tree indicates an old church, but the present church was built about 1500 in Perpendicular style. There is no division between nave and chancel, and the roof carries a little bell tower. There is an old cross shaft at the west end. In 1883-4 the church was very much restored, and some of the old memorials were destroyed. One, recorded by John Hodgson, requested prayers for the soul of Nicholas Ridley, who died in the fifteenth century (1490). There is a memorial now in the church to the Revd. Anthony Hedley of Chesterholm, friend of Hodgson, who died 17 January 1835, having caught a fatal chill in going out to supervise an excavation at Vindolanda fort. He was born near Otterburn and related to Capability Brown. Both had served the Marquis of Bath at Longleat. Hedley was inspired to improve vicarage gardens as well as to search for antiquities. Standing halfway between Ridley bridge and Willimoteswick, the little church stands above a burn, making it look like an island, and clustered round the green and the lych-gate are the few houses and the village school. This church, another dedicated to St. Cuthbert, was founded in Saxon days but little of the Saxon building remains. The church we know today was restored at the end of Queen Victoria's reign by Francis Bowes-Lyon, who was an uncle of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The yew tree in the churchyard would be young when Nicholas Ridley died and the forefathers of men who sleep beneath its shade may well have cut their bows from it to draw at Flodden. The almost perfect leper's squint is still there, to remind us that in the Dark Ages the outcasts were banned from the house of God. \\"Churchyards can be little havens for wildlife, as they are often quiet and undisturbed.\\" Ancient yews offered a sanctuary for the region's wildlife, one of which [in St Cuthbert's churchyard] is believed to be up to 2,000 years old.

A whaleboat picked up survivors while minesweepers and arrived on the scene, one passing a towline while the other swept ahead of the damaged destroyer. The destroyer escort closed in the wake of the minesweepers to assist, then felt a heavy explosion as she slowly rounded Glennons stern to clear the area. Minutes later a second explosion blew off a section of Richs stern, followed by a third mine explosion under her forecastle. Rich sank within 15 minutes of the first explosion. The minesweeper Staff found she could not budge Glennon, whose stern seemed to be firmly anchored to the bottom by her starboard propeller. Most of her crew boarded Staff, and those remaining on Glennon lightened her stern by pumping fuel forward and jettisoning depth charges and topside gear. On 9 June, salvage equipment was assembled, and some 60 officers and men of Glennon came back on board. The following morning, just as Cdr. Johnson was preparing to resume efforts to save his ship, a German shore battery near Quin√©ville found her range. A second salvo hit Glennon amidships and cut off all power. After a third hit, Cdr.

Life Elstob was born and brought up in the Quayside area of Newcastle upon Tyne, and, like Mary Astell of Newcastle, is nowadays regarded as one of the first English feminists. She was proficient in eight languages, and was a pioneer in Anglo-Saxon studies, an unprecedented achievement for a woman in the period. An orphan, she was raised by her uncle Charles Elstob, a prebendary in Canterbury, who disdained female education, believing that \\"one tongue is enough for a woman\\", but allowed her to learn Latin and French as a child. Her brother William Elstob (1673‚Äì1715) was sent to Eton and Cambridge and entered the church. Like his sister, he was a scholar and edited Roger Ascham's Letters in 1703. Elizabeth lived with him at Oxford from 1696, and in London from 1702. As a teenager he introduced her to a small but enthusiastic circle of scholars who worked on Anglo-Saxon history and culture. In London Elstob translated Madeleine de Scud√©ry's Essay upon Glory in 1708, and an English-Saxon Homily on the Nativity of St Gregory in 1709. Both works are dedicated to Queen Anne, who is praised in feminist prefaces. From 1702 Elstob was part of the circle of female intellectuals around Mary Astell, who helped to find subscribers for her Rudiments of Grammar for the English-Saxon Tongue (1715), the first such work written in English. The preface, \\"An Apology for the Study of Northern Antiquities\\", took issue with the formidable Jonathan Swift, and seems to have caused him to amend his views. After her brother's death in 1715, she was left without a home and plagued by debts he had incurred in financing their expensive publications. She tried to start a girls' school in Chelsea, but despite obtaining so many pupils that she had \\"scarcely time to eat\\", they only paid a groat (4d.) a week, and the school failed within six months. In 1718 she fled London and her creditors, leaving behind her books and a partial manuscript of √Ülfric‚Äôs Catholic Homilies, now preserved at the British Library, and ended up in Evesham in rural Worcestershire. She lived there for many years dependent on her friends, running a small dame school under the assumed name of Frances Smith. Her whereabouts were apparently unknown to anyone in the scholarly community until 1735. In the autumn of 1738 Elstob was introduced to the wealthy Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, and was made governess to her children, remaining in her service until her death, at Bulstrode Park, Buckinghamshire, on 3 June 1756. In her last years she lived \\"surrounded by the congenial elements of dirt and her books\\". She wrote in a letter that \\"this is not an Age to hope for any encouragement to Learning of any kind\\". She was buried in the churchyard of St Margaret's, Westminster.John Chambers, Biographical Illustrations of Worcestershire (1820), p. 347 References Further reading     External links  * Category:1683 births Category:1756 deaths Category:18th-century linguists Category:18th-century British women writers Category:18th-century English writers Category:Anglo-Saxon studies scholars Category:British women historians Category:English feminists Category:English historians Category:English women non-fiction writers Category:Founders of English schools and colleges Category:French‚ÄìEnglish translators Category:English governesses Category:Linguists of English Category:Linguists from England Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:18th-century philanthropists ","title":"Elizabeth Elstob"},{"id":"2362204","text":"The Newton‚ÄìJenney Party of 1875, led by Henry Newton and Walter P.

Explanation Since most radio receivers are of the superhet design, they typically contain local oscillators which generate a radio frequency signal in the range of 455 kHz above or sometimes below the frequency to be received. There is always some radiation from such receivers, and in the initial stages of RAFTER, MI5 simply attempted to locate clandestine receivers based on picking up the superhet signal with a quite sensitive receiver that was custom built. This was not always easy because of the increasing number of domestic radios and televisions in people's homes. By accident, one such receiver for MI5 mobile radio transmissions was being monitored when a passing transmitter produced a powerful signal. This overloaded the receiver, producing an audible change in the received signal. Quickly the agency realized that they could identify the actual frequency being monitored if they produced their own transmissions and listened for the change in the superhet tone. Soviet transmitters Since Soviet short-wave transmitters were extensively used to broadcast messages to clandestine agents, the transmissions consisting simply of number sequences read aloud and decoded using a one-time pad, it was realized that this new technique could be used to track down such agents. Specially equipped aircraft would fly over urban areas at times when the Soviets were transmitting, and attempt to locate receivers tuned to the Soviet transmissions. Tactics Like many secret technologies, RAFTER's use was attended by the fear of over- use, alerting the quarry and causing a shift in tactics which would neutralize the technology. As a technical means of intelligence, it was also not well supported by the more traditional factions in MI5. Its part in the successes and failures of MI5 at the time is not entirely known. In his book Spycatcher, former MI5 officer Peter Wright related an incident in which a mobile RAFTER unit was driven around the backstreets in an attempt to locate a receiver, but the search proved futile. Initially, MI5 believed interference and the effects of large metal objects such as lamp posts in the surrounding frustrated the search. Later, however, they concluded that the receiver itself had been mobile, and the receiver may at one point have been parked next to the RAFTER unit but hidden by a high fence.
