Joseph George Holman, 1785 painting by Samuel de Wilde Early life Born in August 1764, he was son of John Major Holman of St. Giles's, Middlesex, an ensign and adjutant in the British service, who died when his son was two years of age. He was placed by an uncle at Barwis's school in Soho Square, where amateur acting was in vogue. With a view to the church as a career, he matriculated 7 February 1783 at The Queen's College, Oxford, but took no degree. At Covent Garden On 25 October 1784, at Covent Garden, as Romeo, Holman made his first appearance on the stage. An address was spoken by Thomas Hull, who played Friar Lawrence.Macbeth, Don Felix in the ‘Wonder,’ Achmet in ‘Barbarossa,’ Richard III, Chamont in the ‘Orphan,’ Hamlet, Hippolitus in ‘Phædra and Hippolitus,’ Morcar in ‘Matilda,’ and Lothario followed in Holman's first season. Holman's performances were attended by fashionable audiences, and he remained at Covent Garden until 1800.He played Hastings, Posthumus, Benedick, Edgar, Timon of Athens, Comus, Florizel in the ‘Winter's Tale,’ Richmond, Orlando, Jaffier, Lord Townley, Jason in ‘Medea,’ Antony in ‘All for Love,’ Alexander the Great, Oroonoko, and many other leading parts in tragedy and comedy. His original characters include Harry Thunder in John O'Keeffe's Wild Oats, 16 April 1791, Harry Dornton in Thomas Holcroft's The Road to Ruin, 18 February 1792, and many parts in plays by Frederic Reynolds, Hannah Cowley, and other dramatists. At the end of his third season Holman left Covent Garden on a question of terms. He acted in Dublin and in English and Scottish towns, but soon returned to Covent Garden. In the season of 1799–1800 a serious quarrel took place between the proprietors of Covent Garden and eight of the principal actors. A pamphlet A Statement of the Differences subsisting between the Proprietors and Performers of the Theatre Royal Covent GardenA Statement of the Differences subsisting between the Proprietors and Performers of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden. Given in the Correspondence which has passed between them. By John Johnstone, Joseph George Holman, Alexander Pope, Charles Incledon, Jos. S. Munden, John Fawcett, Thomas Knight, Henry Erskine Johnston. was published in 1800, and went through several editions: its authorship was attributed to Holman. The actors objected to restrictions on their power of giving orders for admission, and to change in the charges for benefits and the amount of fines for the refusal of a character. The Lord Chamberlain's verdict was hostile to the actors, and there was a public row. Seven actors accepted the decision and remained at Covent Garden. Holman either resigned or was dismissed. Later life Holman depicted in Thomas Holcroft's The Road to Ruin Holman appeared a few times at the Haymarket Theatre, (located at 18 Suffolk St, London SW1Y 4HT, UK) where he produced his What a Blunder, a comic opera in three acts, in which he was Count Alphonso d'Esparza. Holman went to Dublin, where he took for a time a share with Frederick Edward Jones in the management. He then took to farming. On 31 July 1806 Holman played in Dublin for his benefit Antony in All for Love, by John Dryden, to the Ventidius of Thomas Potter Cooke. On 22 August 1812, as Jaffier in Thomas Otway's Venice Preserved, he reappeared at the Haymarket after eleven years' absence; and played a few further parts. In 1812 Holman and his daughter Amelia performed at the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden and then performed opposite each other in the provinces. Both were at the Georgian Theatre, Wisbech (now the Angles Theatre) run by Thomas Shaftoe Robertson in April, 1812. On 8th he played Rolla in Kotzebue's Pizarro, on 10th Othello in Shakespeare's play and on 11th (their last night) Macbeth in Macbeth, King of Scotland. The handbills for these plays are amongst the hundreds held in the collection of the Wisbech & Fenland Museum. Holman went to America in 1812, and took with him Amelia, his daughter, who played in New York, Lady Townly in The Provoked Husband to his Lord Townly, and supported him throughout his American career. In a letter of introduction he took out he is described as a fellow of Queen's College. In 1813 Holman and Miss Holman played at the Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. He undertook the management of the Walnut Street Theatre in the city, and failed there. Holman then (1815) managed Charleston Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina, went to England for additional performers, and married a singer. He died, according to one account, of apoplexy at Rockaway on Long Island, on 24 August 1817, and, according to another, of yellow fever, which also carried off his wife. Works His dramatic works consist of: *Abroad and at Home, 1796, a comic opera in three acts, originally called The King's Bench, but the licenser objected to the title. It was acted 29 times, twice printed in the same year, and acted frequently in England and America. *Red Cross Knights, in five acts, 1799; Haymarket, 21 August 1799. This is taken from Schiller's The Robbers, a translation of which by Holman was refused by the licenser. *The Votary of Wealth, 1799; Covent Garden, 12 January 1799; a comedy. *What a Blunder, 1800; Haymarket, 14 August 1800, and Covent Garden, 31 May 1803; a comic opera in three acts. *Love gives the Alarm, a comedy given once at Covent Garden, 23 February 1804, a failure, and never printed. Holman only acted in one of his own plays. Family In 1798 Holman married Jane, youngest daughter of the Hon. and Rev. Frederick Hamilton, a direct descendant of the Duke of Hamilton. She died June 11, 1810. He was the father of Amelia Holman Gilfert.

He studied at the School of Applied Arts between 1947 and 1951, and he married Marie-Claude Charels in 1963. His work, which was strongly linked with the emergence of Pop Art, matured between 1964 and 1972. He based many of his paintings on images collected through Delpire, the publishing house where he worked as a librarian. His photorealistic reproductions of enlarged black-and- white photographs have affinities both with the images in family albums and with publicity photos. Despite the success of these works, Gasiorowski turned away from painting (but not drawing) after 1972. His work changed radically as he became more critical of the tradition of western painting and the structure of the art world, and he turned to photomontage to express his ideas in works such as The Horrors of War. To stage these photos, he created miniature battlefield sets using purchased and homemade toy planes, trains, tanks, and so on. He even costumed himself with a bloody head bandage to serve as one of the wounded. Gasiorowski himself later saw his obsession with this work as one reason that his wife left him in 1976. Another tack Gasiorowski took in his critical investigations was to begin creating fictive artworks such as Worosiskiga Academy, a fake art school run by a tyrant (the name is an anagram of his own last name) which produced a variety of artworks, from drawings and gouaches to objects. One such issue was a set of hats signed with the names of 500 famous artists, intended as a critique of the art market and of the compromises it forced on artists. The first exhibition of the Worosiskiga Academy project was at the Galerie Maeght in 1981; despite the dismal failure of this show, the gallery continue to support and exhibit works by Gasiorowski. The Museum of Modern Art, Paris held a retrospective of his work in 1983. Gasiorowski's fictions succeeded in confusing visitors to his exhibitions. It was difficult for audiences of the time to know what to make of—for example—an imaginary artist named Kiga, a member of the 'Worosis' tribe, who was the embodiment of 'primitive' painting and who mixed her paints from excrement and aromatic plants in order to make paintings in the style of Cézanne. Gasiorowski's fictive productions took a wide range of forms: paintings, drawings, painted objects, organic sculptures. After 1983, Gasiorowski finally returned to painting and developed several bodies of work, often at monumental scale, in which the groups of paintings were understood to form a single larger work. His final work was a 12-panel polyptych, Fertility. He died suddenly of a heart attack on August 19, 1986, in Lyon, and is buried there in Saint-Julien-du-Sault cemetery. His work is included in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. References * De Loisy, Jean (ed.). Gérard Gasiorowski. Editions du Centre Pompidou, 1995.

Land granted under Aboriginal title is inalienable; it can not be bought, sold, traded or given away. The Land Trust is the organisation appointed by the community to legally hold the title deeds. Establishment and operation of Aboriginal land trusts Several states and territories have enacted laws to establish Aboriginal Land Trusts, but not all. =Northern Territory= In the Northern Territory, Land Trusts are governed under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1976, which also governs the way in which groups can make claims to land. The ALTs hold the title to land handed back to the traditional Aboriginal owners through the Land Rights Act. =Queensland= In Queensland, there are multiple Land Trusts. They were created under the state's Aboriginal Land Act 1991. =South Australia= In South Australia, there is a single statutory body known as the Aboriginal Lands Trust. It was created under the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act 1966.

The concept, and form of government, is similar to that of people's democracy, which was implemented in a number of Central and Eastern European Communist-controlled states under the guidance of the Soviet Union. The premise of the \\"People's democratic dictatorship\\" is that the CPC and state represent and act on behalf of the people, but in the preservation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, possess and may use powers against reactionary forces.Meisner, Maurice, Mao's China and After 3rd Edition, (New York: The Free Press, 1999), pp. 58-60. Implicit in the concept of the people's democratic dictatorship is the notion that dictatorial control by the party is necessary to prevent the government from collapsing into a \\"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\\", a liberal democracy, which, it is feared, would mean politicians acting in the interest of the bourgeoisie. This would be in opposition to the socialist charter of the CPC.  Origins  The term's best known usage occurred on June30, 1949, in commemoration of the 28th Anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Painting by Francesco Hayez, circa 1852. The Two Foscari: An Historical Tragedy (1821) is a verse play in five acts by Lord Byron. The plot, set in Venice in the mid-15th century, is loosely based on the true story of the downfall of doge Francesco Foscari and his son Jacopo. Byron's play formed the basis of Verdi's opera I due Foscari. Synopsis Jacopo Foscari, son of the Doge of Venice, has twice been exiled, once for corruption and once for complicity in the murder of Donato, a member of the Council of Ten. He has been recalled from his second exile to answer the capital charge of treason, and as the play opens he is between sessions of interrogation on the rack. The Council decide to sentence him to a third exile, this time perpetual, rather than to death. His father, doge Francesco Foscari, signs the sentence of exile, though his spirit is broken by this new disgrace. Jacopo's patriotic spirit cannot brook such a sentence, he longs to die, and he duly does die of a broken heart. The Council of Ten orders the doge to abdicate, and, as the bells begin to toll to signify the election of a new doge, the old one falls and dies.  Composition and publication  First edition title page Byron wrote The Two Foscari in Ravenna in less than a month, between 12 June and 9 July 1821. It was published by John Murray on 19 December 1821 in the same volume as his Sardanapalus and Cain. Byron originally intended to dedicate The Two Foscari to his friend Sir Walter Scott, but in the event he transferred that dedication to Cain and left Foscari without one. He added an appendix to The Two Foscari in which he launched a stinging attack on what he considered the hypocrisies of the Poet Laureate, Robert Southey. Southey responded in a letter to a London newspaper in which he dared Byron to attack him again. Byron initially wanted to challenge Southey to a duel, but then turned instead to poetry and wrote his stinging satire The Vision of Judgment. The Two Foscari in other media Verdi's opera I due Foscari, with a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, was based on Byron's play. It also inspired two paintings, Les deux Foscari by Delacroix, and L'ultimo abboccamento di Jacopo Foscari con la propria famiglia prima di partire per l'esilio cui era stato condannato by Francesco Hayez.

The surrounding mountain peaks rise up to 800 m (2,620 ft). The mild climate and the hot mineral springs of the valley have attracted settlers since prehistory. A neolithic settlement has been discovered around the mineral springs, close to today's main Thermal bath building. It existed there from around 6000 BC until the late chalcolithic age, around 4000 BC. Many of the findings from the site's archeological excavations, mainly pottery, tools made of stone, horn, bone and copper, and other pieces of prehistoric art, are now displayed in the Neolithic Dwellings Museum in Stara Zagora. An impressive 2500 m2 (26,900 sq ft) Roman thermae was also discovered in the village in 1965. It was built around the 2nd century AD and was used at least until the 12th century AD by the population of the Bulgarian village founded south of the thermae. In 1967 the village gained the status national balneotherapy resort. This led to big investments in developing tourism in the area. Tourism The economy of Starozagorski bani is dominated by tourism.

According to the legend, this is a footprint of the Virgin Mary, which is filled with water that never drains. It is believed that the Virgin Mary's footprint is a sacred natural site for Christians, so a small chapel was built in the place called Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. =Starozagorski bani lake= Starozagorski bani lake The Starozagorski bani lake is situated in the south-western part of the resort.

A reviewer commented that Henri Monteux reminded everyone what a remarkable actor he was, displaying dramatic intensity coupled with fantasy.Le Monde illustré 10 April 1937 p281 (review by Antoine). The play was based on It Can't Happen Here by Nadine Landowski. At the time of his arrest in Paris he was playing with acclaim the drunken father in Gorky's The Mother.

The campaign began in 648 and ended on 19 January 649, after the surrender of the Kuchan forces following a forty-day siege in Aksu. Kuchean soldiers tried to recapture the kingdom with the assistance of the Western Turkic Khaganate, but were defeated by the Tang army. Background The Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited Kucha in 630. Kucha, a kingdom in the Tarim Basin, was a vassal of the Western Turkic Khaganate. Under the reign of Emperor Gaozu, the king Suvarnapushpa (Chinese: Sufabushi) provided the Tang court with tribute in 618. In 630, Suvarnapushpa's successor Suvarnadeva (Chinese: Sufadie) submitted to the Tang as a vassal. A Buddhist of the Hinayana sect, Suvarnadeva had hosted the Buddhist monk Xuanzang when he arrived in Kucha during the same year. Kucha supported Karasahr when the oasis state made a marriage alliance with the Western Turks and ended its tributary relationship with the Tang court in 644. The king of Kucha, Suvarnadeva, renounced Tang suzerainty and allied with the Western Turks. Emperor Taizong responded by dispatching a military campaign led by the general Guo Xiaoke against Karasahr. Karasahr was besieged in 644 by Guo. Tang forces defeated the kingdom, captured the king, and a pro-Tang member of the royal family was enthroned as ruler. The new king was deposed by the Western Turks soon afterwards, and the Western Turks regained suzerainty over Karasahr. Suvarnadeva died between 646 and 648, and his brother Haripushpa (Chinese: Helibushibi) inherited the throne as Kucha's king. Although Haripushpa sent two tribute embassies to the Tang court, Tang Taizong had already decided to punish Kucha's pro-Turk stance by launching an expedition against the kingdom. In 646 Irbis Seguy of the Western Turks sought a Chinese princess for his bride. In return, Taizong asked for several Tarim Basin cities. Ibris' refusal was one of the pretexts for the war.Baumer, History of Central Asia, vol 2, 205 Most of the Tang expeditionary army was made up of 100,000 cavalry supplied by the Tang empire's Tiele allies. The commander-in-chief of the Tang expeditionary army, Ashina She'er, was a member of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate ruling family. He joined the Tang forces after his surrender in 635, and served as a general leading a campaign against Karakhoja. His familiarity with the region as a former Turkic ruler contributed to his success commanding the campaigns against Kucha and Karasahr. Prior to his recruitment as a Tang general, he reigned for five years between 630 and 635, governing the city of Beshbalik in the Dzungarian Basin. Ashina She'er's deputy commanders were Qibi Heli (a Tiele chieftain who had also become a Tang general) and Guo Xiaoke. Campaign Emperor Taizong launched military campaigns against the oasis states of the Tarim Basin Ashina She'er's soldiers were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha from the north by moving through the Dzungarian Basin, which was the territory of the Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a defensible position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him. The forces defending Kucha, consisting of 50,000 soldiers, were lured and ambushed by Ashina. They chased after a group of 1,000 horsemen employed by Ashina as a decoy, but encountered additional Tang forces that mounted a surprise attack. The Kuchean forces were defeated and retreated to Aksu, a nearby kingdom in the Tarim Basin. Ashina captured the king following a forty-day siege, ending with the surrender of the Kucha forces on 19 January 649. One of Ashina's officers, acting as a diplomat, persuaded the chieftains of the region to surrender instead of fighting back. Guo Xiaoke, who had led the first Tang campaign against Karasahr in 644, was installed in Kucha as protector-general of the Anxi Protectorate, or the Protectorate of the Pacified West. The headquarters of the protector-general was thus moved from its original location in Gaochang to Kucha. While Ashina was in pursuit of the Kuchean king, Nali, a Kuchean lord, traveled to request the help of the Western Turks. Guo was assassinated after the Kuchean soldiers retook the kingdom with the military assistance of the Western Turks. Ashina returned to Kucha, captured five of the kingdom's cities, and forced the remaining cities to surrender. Tang control was re-established in the oasis state. The brother of the former king, a yabgu or viceroy, was enthroned by the Chinese as a subject of the Tang empire. The king of Kucha, Haripushpa, was taken to the Tang capital as a prisoner. Execution was the punishment of rebellion in accordance with Tang law. The king was pardoned by Taizong and released after a ritual venerating the emperor's ancestors. He was also named Great Army Commander for the Militant Guards of the Left, a title he received from the emperor. Aftermath Bust of a bodhisattva from Kucha, 6th–7th century In retribution for the death of Guo Xiaoke, Ashina She'er ordered the execution of eleven thousand Kuchean inhabitants by decapitation. It was recorded that \\"he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women... the lands of the west were seized with terror.\\" After Kucha's defeat, Ashina dispatched a small force of light cavalry led by the lieutenant Xue Wanbei to Khotan, ruled by the king Yuchi Fushexin. The threat of an invasion persuaded the king to visit the Tang court in person. The Tang expeditionary army replaced Haripushpa with his younger brother (the \\"yabgu\\"), erected an inscribed stele to commemorate its victory, and returned to Chang’an with Haripushpa, Nali, and Kucha's top general as captives. All three men were given sinecures and kept at the imperial court until 650, when they were sent back to Kucha after it became clear that the vacuum of power created by their absence had reduced the kingdom to a state of civil war and anarchy. The Kucha expedition also killed the pro-Turk king of Karasahr and replaced him with a cousin, but there is no evidence that a Tang military garrison was stationed in Karasahr between 648 and 658. Likewise, the Khotan king's coerced trip to Chang'an does not seem to have resulted in a Tang garrison being sent to Khotan. It has long been claimed that the conquest of Kucha established Tang rule over the entire Tarim Basin. This is in part due to a number of inaccurate Chinese sources linking the expedition to the establishment of the Four Garrisons of Anxi, which comprised Kucha, Karasahr, Khotan, and Kashgar. However, Zhang Guangda has used excavated texts from Gaochang (Karakhoja or Turfan) to show that the Tang abandoned the attempt to move the headquarters of the Protectorate of the Pacified West to Kucha after Guo Xiaoke's assassination. Instead the headquarters returned to Gaochang until 658, when it was moved back to Kucha following a Tang army's suppression of a local pro- Turk revolt against Haripushpa (who died from an illness during the revolt). The Tang only gained a loose suzerainty over the Tarim Basin states in 649, and did not establish military garrisons in the Tarim Basin. Most of the Tarim Basin states transferred their vassalage to the new Western Turk qaghan, Ashina Helu, in 651, reflecting the fact that they regarded the Western Turks as their traditional overlords. The establishment of the Four Garrisons, and with them a formal Tang military protectorate over the Tarim Basin, should be dated to 658 (after Ashina Helu's defeat) or even to 660, since Kashgar remained allied with the Western Turk leader Duman until Duman's defeat in later 659. It has also been claimed that the fall of Kucha led to the decline of Indo-European culture in the Tarim Basin and its replacement by first Chinese and then Turkic culture. In fact, the opposite is true. Kuchean culture flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries and Kuchean music was popular in the Tang capital, in part due to the movement of Kuchean musicians to the Tang court. The Turkicization of the Tarim Basin is a later development that came after the end of the Tang dynasty and had no relation to the earlier Tang protectorate in the Tarim Basin. After 649, the Tang Dynasty continued their war against the Western Turks under the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor. Gaozong conducted a campaign led by general Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan, Ashina Helu in 657. The qaghan surrendered, the Western Turks were defeated, and the khaganate's former territories were annexed by the Tang. The Tang retreated from beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan after a Turkic revolt in 662, and lost the Tarim Basin to local revolts and Tibetan incursions in 665-670. The Tang regained the Tarim Basin in 692 and again lost it to the Tibetans in the 790s, the Four Garrisons having already been cut off from the rest of the Tang empire by a Tibetan conquest of the Gansu Corridor. Although the Tibetan empire collapsed in the middle of the ninth century, the Tang Dynasty lacked the means to regain dominance in the Tarim Basin and itself ended in 907 with the abdication of Emperor Ai.

After serving in the United States Marine Corps, Fagaly returned to Vancouver in the mid-1930s and founded Columbia Photoengraving in order to get the local newspaper, The Columbian, to publish his cartoons. He offered to supply the newspaper engraving plates for free if the newspaper would pay him for the cartoons. Since the cost of photoengraving was much more than the going rate for artwork, the newspaper agreed, and Mr. Fagaly became the staff cartoonist for The Columbian. In 1935, he created a comic strip, Skip Logan, for the Thompson Service in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1943 Fagaly was a staff artist at MLJ Comics (now Archie Comics) when he created the Superman parody Super Duck. He went on to be the lead artist on Super Duck Comics, which debuted in 1944; Fagaly was a main contributor to the title at least through the early 1950s. Fagaly was also the main contributor to Fauntleroy Comics, a spin-off from Super Duck that published three annual issues from 1950 to 1952.

Many of his oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings feature urban and industrial scenes rendered meticulously over the course of months and even years of plein-air sessions, deftly imbuing quotidian subjects with abstract significance. A large portion of Campbell's work captures the vibrancy and intricacy of urban and suburban vistas, especially around his former residence in Somerville, Massachusetts.Gerold Wunderlich & Company, David Campbell, introduction by Josiah Lee Auspitz, (New York: Gerold Wunderlich & Co., 1990), p. 5.  Early life  Born in Takoma Park, Maryland on March 31, 1936, Campbell studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1957-1961.http://www.greenhutgalleries.com/pdfs/images/20111025001714C.pdf Following a stint in the U.S. Army in Korea, Campbell spent six years in Italy before moving back to the United States in 1968.Pat Davidson Reef, \\"Frost Gully is Serious about good art,\\" Sun Journal (Lewiston, MA), November 13, 1998, p. 12.  Work  Critical evaluations of his work are as varied as his subjects, which range from fallow fields, to crowded streets and industrial parks framed by piles of scrap metal and junk. While one reviewer noted a recurring \\"theme of desolation, which when coupled with the subject matter can also be understood as comment on America's ever diminishing industrial base and the lives it once sustained,\\" others have found wellsprings of different emotions. Referring to Campbell's 1980's work \\"Reading\\", in which \\"a woman sits on her claustrophobic back porch, closed in by household junk on either side...the neighborhood houses are close behind, and an ugly apartment building blocks the sky,\\" art critic Linda Bamber nonetheless finds that the woman's \\"posture speaks of her complete absorption in the book on her lap...The smoke from the woman's cigarette could be her spirit ascending, completely unconstrained by all the enclosures.\\"Linda Bamber, \\"Made in Somerville,\\" Boston Review, Dec. 1986, p. 15. Often returning to the same location throughout the year to capture seasonal changes, Campbell insists on rendering all his works through plein-air sessions. \\"Some people work from photographs,\\" Campbell explained in an interview for the Boston Review, ::\\"and that's fine; but for my part I'd rather bag groceries in the supermarket than do that. For me the whole part of it is to make contact with my surroundings. I want to get to a caring level about where I am. How can you do that with a photograph? It's more than just the visual act. You have to immerse yourself in the scene.\\" This attention to detail and place is what gives Campbell's paintings \\"scientific, cerebral, and spiritual\\" significance, as author Michael Kammen wrote in his book A Time to Every Purpose: The Four Seasons in American Culture.Michael Kammen, A Time to Every Purpose: The Four Seasons in American Culture (Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 244. Campbell described his work Summer (1987), which depicts a rolling field in North Andover, MA, in an interview with the author: ::\\"Because I see nature as the basis of life, it is sacred to me...The fact that I live in a city makes me feel especially exhilarated when I visit this field. The look of things is so thoroughly different through the seasons that my industrial home neighborhood is changeless by comparison. Important cycles other than the cycle of the seasons are recorded in the series.\\"Michael Kammen, A Time to Every Purpose: The Four Seasons in American Culture (Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 244-245. Complex and dominating cloudscapes also feature prominently in Campbell's work, often occupying two- thirds or more of the canvas. One review in the artsMEDIA section of the Boston Globe found that his \\"heavy, colorless skys, which foretell an impending doom\\" appeared to be \\"angry; and they seem ready to burst with a fury powerful enough to mercifully finish off the slow destruction taking place below.\\"Adam Lambert, \\"Streets and Roads,\\" Boston Globe, artsMEDIA section, May 1997, p. 23. Recently, Campbell has found inspiration in maritime scenes around his home in Portland, Maine prompting him to paint a series of oil tankers to fill out his corpus of industrial and cityscapes. \\"I've always been attracted to complexity in whatever subject I am painting,\\" Campbell explained in an interview for the Maine Sunday Telegram, \\"And let's face it, there's a lot of complexity in these tankers. There are a lot of elements, and a lot of things going on.\\"Bob Keyes, \\"Size Matters,\\" Maine Sunday Telegram, March 14, 2010, D1-2. His paintings of these behemoth ships have appeared in an exhibition at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath, titled \\"Some Burdensome: Big Ships, Big Cargoes,\\" and are scheduled to appear in a new exhibition at the Portland Public Library in August 2013. In 1993, the Somerville-based Home First organization recognized Campbell at its \\"Somerville Pride Night,\\" the first artist to be granted the distinction.\\"Somerville painter first 'Home First' honoree,\\" The Somerville Journal, Oct. 1993, p. 1. Indeed, the prominence of Somerville throughout Campbell's paintings has led art critic Nancy Curtis to comment that \\"David Campbell has done for Somerville what Vermeer did for Delft,\\" a reference to the 17th century Dutch painter whose work immortalized the middle-class lifestyle of his city.Nancy Curtis, \\"Six From Around Town,\\" Boston Observer, August 1983, p. 4.

Exhibitions  Campbell's work has been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions around the United States and internationally. His solo exhibitions include appearances at the Galleria III in Florence, Italy, Boston City Hall, and Babson College.

The name refers to two structures, both located on Lexington Avenue near Grand Central Terminal. The original structure was a six-story structure built in 1893 between 43rd and 44th Streets. It was demolished during the construction of Grand Central Terminal, and a new 13-story structure was constructed between 46th and 47th Streets. The second Grand Central Palace was designed by Grand Central Terminal architects Warren and Wetmore and Reed and Stem in the Beaux-Arts architectural style, and had almost twice as much room as the original structure. The Palace served as New York's main exposition hall from 1911 until 1953, when the exhibition space was replaced by office space for the Internal Revenue Service. The building was demolished starting in 1964. Throughout its history, the Grand Central Palace hosted auto, boat, flower and trade shows, though parts of the Palace were used as office space. The first Palace was also used as a temporary railroad terminal during the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the 1900s.  History  = Original structure = The original Grand Central Palace was constructed in 1893 on the block bounded by Lexington Avenue, Depew Place, and 43rd and 44th Streets. At the time, Depew Place was an alley located west of Lexington Avenue, which formed the eastern boundary of Grand Central Depot to the west. The original Palace, a six-story structure made of brick, contained of floor space. The land under the original Grand Central Palace was originally owned by the estate of the entrepreneur Robert Goelet, who died in 1899. His will prohibited the sale of the land on which the Palace was located. In 1902, in preparation for Grand Central Terminal's construction, the trustees of the Goelet estate offered the land to the New York Central Railroad, operator of Grand Central Depot, for use as the site of a proposed new post office. However, the land would have to be acquired through condemnation of the site. New York Central bought two blocks of land east of the future terminal, bounded by Lexington Avenue, Depew Place, and 43rd and 45th Streets, in December 1904. This land acquisition included the Grand Central Palace. After the land acquisition, New York Central continued to receive bookings for events at Grand Central Palace. As Grand Central Terminal was being completed and the New York Central's steam- railway lines into Grand Central were electrified, the railroad's commuter rail lines moved their operations to a temporary station under Grand Central Palace. The temporary station had fourteen tracks, ten of which were electrified with third rail. The Hudson Line was the first to be electrified, on September 30, 1906. The temporary station was not ready until November of that year. By that time, trains on the Harlem Line were electrified, and its operations moved to the basement of Grand Central Palace. New Haven Line electric trains started running to Grand Central Palace in October 1907. The Palace was used as the terminal for all three lines while the old Grand Central Station was being demolished in sections, a process that started in 1910. The original Palace was demolished by 1913 to make way for Grand Central Terminal. = New structure = A new 13-story building was opened on May 19, 1911. The 13-story building, with twice as much floor space as the previous structure, was located on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets, occupying the air rights over the railroad tracks leading into Grand Central Terminal. The Palace was designed by Warren and Wetmore and Reed and Stem, who had also designed Grand Central Terminal. It was the first structure designed as part of Terminal City, a series of commercial developments that were built after Grand Central's formerly open-air rail yards were covered over. The Palace was New York's main exposition hall until it closed in 1953. Its location and the proximity of Grand Central Terminal spurred the construction of a hotel district in the area. Greece, a 1920 exhibition at the Palace Alfred I. du Pont and a group of associates took over the Grand Central Palace's lease in May 1918. Subsequently, in August 1918, the building was rented to the U.S. government, which used the structure as a hospital during World War I. The government relinquished the Palace to du Pont's syndicate in April 1919. The following year, du Pont and his associates announced that no new exhibitions would be held in the Grand Central Palace after April 1921, effectively leaving the city without a major exhibition space. The syndicate later clarified that only the International Exposition of Industries would continue to be held in the Palace. In 1920, the structure's lease was transferred to Robert M. Catts. The following year, Catts proposed $500,000 worth of improvements to the Palace as part of the construction of a $3 million, 18-story office building on an adjacent empty plot. The plan entailed converting the Grand Central Palace into an office building and attaching it to the adjacent structure via an arcade. The main entrance to the remodeled structure would be relocated to Park Avenue to the west, while the floor below, which faced Lexington Avenue, would be converted into retail. The Grand Central Palace would have been renamed the Central Square Building because at the time, there was a \\"central square\\" to the west, which abutted the north end of Grand Central Terminal. He formally filed plans for the construction of the annex the next year, and the new 20-story office building was completed by 1923. However, in 1925, Catts dispelled rumors that the Grand Central Palace would be transformed into an office building. Catts's enterprises became insolvent and went into receivership in 1927, though Grand Central Palace continued to host events. August Heckscher secured control of the Palace's lease in 1923. In the same transaction, he bought other real estate on the same block. A syndicate purchased the Palace in January 1927 with plans to demolish the building and build a Spanish trade center in its place. Though the Count of Peracamps, a Philippine businessman, visited the Palace in March of that year in an effort to promote the proposed trade center, the deal did not go through. Control of the Palace as well as the adjacent Park-Lexington Building was transferred to the publisher Condé Nast in 1928. As part of Conde Nast's purchase of the Palace, the eight upper floors would be turned into sales offices, while the three lower floors would continue to be used as exhibition space. By 1932, the mortgage covering the Palace and the Park-Lexington Building was being foreclosed upon. In 1933, Heckscher offered to sell the Grand Central Palace to the federal government for $6 million, so it could be replaced with a post office facility. At the time, the Palace was located atop part of the Grand Central Terminal's storage yards, and there was a mail chute from the building to the tracks underneath. Because the New York Central Railroad still owned the land underneath the Palace, if the transaction were successful, only the air rights above the tracks would have been sold. The onset of World War II in the 1940s caused the suspension of several exhibitions. For instance, in 1941, the National Motor Boat Show was suspended for the first time since 1904. The next year, the International Flower Show was also suspended until the end of the war. In October 1942, the Grand Central Palace was turned into an induction center for the U.S. Army, replacing a center on Governors Island. After more than a half million soldiers had been inducted at the Palace, the last fourteen inductions occurred in September 1945. The induction center was closed soon afterward. After the war, it was announced that the New York Coliseum, a new exhibition hall being built across town in Columbus Circle, would replace Grand Central Palace as the city's main exhibition hall. By then, the dilapidated facilities at the Grand Central Palace were repelling potential exhibitors. In 1952, the federal government signed a letter of intent to lease the lowest four floors, at the time being used as exhibition space, and converted them into office space for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). After objections from several exhibition hosts, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau asked that exhibitions be allowed at the Grand Central Palace until the Coliseum opened in 1956. The federal government initially dropped plans for a lease in February 1953. However, the next month, the federal government signed a lease agreement to convert the four lower floors into of office space. As part of the agreement, shows would continue to be held at the Palace until November 1953, at which point renovations would begin. In the meantime, until the Coliseum opened, exhibitions would be held at the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx as well as other armories in Manhattan. The Grand Central Palace's demise started in 1955, when the entire area around the terminal was opened for development in an attempt to net more money for the struggling New York Central Railroad. By 1957, the du Pont estate proposed constructing five office buildings on a three-block site near Grand Central Terminal that included the Palace. In 1963, it was announced that the Grand Central Palace would be demolished to make way for a 47-story office building being designed by Uris Buildings Corporation, which had acquired the leasehold for both the Palace and a nearby building. Demolition started in June 1964. The site of the Palace is now occupied by 245 Park Avenue.  Design  The original Grand Central Palace was a six-story brick structure. Its footprint measured and it contained of floor space. The first floor, at ground level, had cafes that flanked the entrance to Lexington Avenue on the east, as well as a large exhibition area. There was a grand staircase to the second floor, which had a three-story-high glass-domed hall with of floor space; the entire level contained a total of . The third and fourth floors were devoted to galleries flanking either side of the second-floor hall, while the fifth and sixth floors formed a \\"hollow square\\"-shaped balcony above the glass dome. The interior was lit by more than 4,000 incandescent light bulbs, including seven chandeliers that collectively contained 700 bulbs. More than 50,000 people could be accommodated in the original building simultaneously. The structure had a roof with a seasonal roof garden and a stage. A bridge connected the Palace to the Grand Central Depot, across Depew Place to the west. The second Grand Central Palace followed the precedent set by the Beaux-Arts architecture of Grand Central Terminal. It contained over of floor area. The Lexington Avenue facade featured a portico supported by four classical columns. The lower three stories were occupied by exhibition spaces with the main exhibition hall on the second and third stories, and the ten upper floors were used for offices.  Events and tenants  The Grand Central Palace hosted auto, boat, flower and trade shows. The Palace was the main exhibition center for New York City during the first half of the 20th century. By 1927, it hosted two million guests annually. Office tenants in the Palace included the Selective Service and the Internal Revenue Service. The first exhibitions at the Grand Central Palace were trade shows held in 1893, before the structure was even completed. Upon the Palace's opening in May 1893, the first exhibition held there was the gathering of the New York Press Club. Other early tenants included the flower show, amateur boxing, and exhibits from Catholic school students. However, the structure stood empty for the rest of the year, when it held some exhibits from the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. One of the larger events hosted in the first Palace was a Democratic Party political rally in 1900, which was described at the time as \\"one of the largest ever held in the Grand Central Palace\\". The first auto show held in Grand Central Palace occurred in 1907 and was hosted by the Automobile Club of America. At the time, a separate auto show for foreign cars was hosted at the Madison Square Garden. In 1911, the First Industrial Aeroplane Show (now the Industrial Airplane Show), was held in conjunction with the North American International Auto Show at Grand Central Palace. The event ran from December 31, 1910 through mid-January 1911. It was a major event at the time, as many of the public had never seen an airplane. The two auto shows were combined starting in 1913, though the combined auto shows were still split between Madison Square Garden and the new Grand Central Palace. The Palace was also the site of the Women's Industrial Expositions from 1912 to 1915.\\"A Corner of an Exhibit at the Women's Industrial Exposition New York City, 1915\\" The School Arts Magazine, Vol. 15 No. 9 (May 1916), 678. The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was held at the Grand Central Palace, as well as the Exposition of Architecture and Allied Arts in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The 1927 exposition featured the installation of a Welte-Mignon theater organ in the hall. The Palace has also been used by the federal government during world wars. In September 1918, during World War I, the Grand Central Palace was leased as \\"Disembarkation Hospital no. 5\\" for American Expeditionary Forces returning from Europe.War Department Annual Reports (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1920), vol. 1, part 3: Report of the Surgeon General (continued), p. 2989. The Palace was used in this way until April 1919. Starting in October 1942, the Grand Central Palace was turned into an induction center for the U.S. Army,\\"Army opens biggest induction center in U.S.,\\" Life, 13 (20) : 51, 52, 54, 56, and 58 (November 16, 1942). being used as such until September 1945.

It was the first novel to be released by the newly established Heinemann publishing company. It was a phenomenal success and was later adapted into a successful play and two silent films. The plot revolves around two half brothers, the one, Jason, sworn to avenge the wrongs done by their father; the other, Michael, sworn to rectify these wrongs. They both fall in love with the same woman and their travels take from between the Isle of Man and Iceland, crossing personal upheavals, political revolutions and natural disasters. The novel ends with one half-brother giving his life so that the other may escape to a life with the one he loves. Background In his autobiography, Hall Caine claimed that he identified the key thematic base for the novel as early as 1883, when he first began to consider fiction writing.Caine, 1908, p. 28 However, it was not be until many years later and after a number of other novels that he would take up the story. Caine claimed that the novel was based on the Biblical story of Jacob and Esau, although this has been questioned by his modern biographer as a later attempt to deflect the charge of questionable moral bases to his novels.Allen, 1997, p. 202 Caine was greatly interested in Iceland because of its connections to the Isle of Man through a shared Norse heritage and because of the Norse sagas which he admired greatly. Caine was particularly impressed by his friend William Morris’ four-volume translation from the Icelandic of the Saga of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Nibelungs, published in 1876.Allen, p. 193 Caine began work on The Bondman in March 1889, at Aberleigh Lodge, Bexley Heath, Kent. He finished the novel in October of the same year at his new home of Castlerigg Cottage, Keswick.Kenyon, 1901, pp. 144–146 Plot =The Book of Stephen Orry= Maughold Head, where Stephen Orry suffers his fatal injury An Icelandic fisherman, Stephen Orry, bears two sons, one to the governor's daughter in Reykjavík, another to the lowest of women on the Isle of Man. The Iceland-born son, Jason \\"the Red\\", is brought up in poverty and is left with his mother's dying wish for him to seek vengeance on his father who had brought them to that position. The Manx-born son, Michael \\"Sunlocks\\", is brought up by the Deputy Governor of the Isle of Man, alongside his daughter, Greeba, as Stephen could not support him or keep him from bad influences. When Michael is 19, Stephen returns and sends him to Iceland to make good his wrong to his wife there. As Michael sets sail from the Isle of Man, Jason arrives on a boat from Iceland. After surviving shipwreck in Ramsey bay, Jason is called upon to save Stephen Orry from his own boating accident off Maughold Head. However, Stephen dies of his injuries, but not before Jason comes to recognise him as his father and achieves a reconciliation. =The Book of Michael Sunlocks= Jason remains on the island and falls in love with Greeba. After four years without word from Michael, Greeba consents to marry Jason. However, when she then receives a letter from Michael, she goes to marry him in Iceland, where he has risen to become governor of the country newly independent of Danish rule. Jason returns to Iceland, learns of Michael, his role in Greeba's departure and his being his half brother, and so resolves to kill him. However, Greeba learns of his plan and has him arrested. Upon learning this, Michael looks to make good his father's wrong and so sends to have Jason released. Michael is then thrown into doubt by lies told to him in a vain attempt at blackmail by Greeba's avaricious brothers. Believing that Greeba loved Jason and had only come to him for his wealth and position, he resigns from his post in government. However, before this can come into effect, Danish soldiers storm the meeting, arrest the ministers and claim Iceland again as under Danish rule. =The Book of Red Jason= Cliff tops on Grímsey Michael Sunlocks is sent to work in the sulphur mines penal colony. Here he grows into friendship with Red Jason, as each is unaware of the identity of the other. Jason comes to increasingly protect Michael from cruel treatment by the Danish authorities, until he is forced to carry out an escape to save Michael from certain death through the dangerous work assigned to them. However, although Jason gains his freedom, Michael is again imprisoned, this time on Grimsey, a small island off the north coast of Iceland. Although officially still a 'bondman' (a \\"prisoner-slave\\"), Michael is now blind from the exertion of the work at the mines, and so he is left in the care of a priest. Greeba joins the household as a maid, but remains unknown to Michael by keeping silent when in his presence. This she does to demonstrate that she cares little for her position but is fully devoted to him, thus proving the inverse of Michael's suspicions. After two and a half years, the Danish authorities grow nervous of Michael and so send to have him executed. Jason, however, who has returned to Iceland after some years away, hears of this plan and so races to Grimsey ahead of the Danish soldiers. Here he orchestrates Michael's escape with Greeba, by his stepping in as bondman in Michael's place. The next day Jason is shot by the Danish soldiers and he dies satisfied knowing that Michael is with Greeba safely sailing home to the Isle of Man. Publishing The original William Heinemann logo The book was serialised in the Isle of Man Times and other regional UK newspapers between June and November 1889.Allen, 1997, p. 202 In August 1889 Caine visited Iceland for the first time. In this, his first trip abroad with his wife, he set sail from Leith on the SS Magnetic via Bergen and the Faroe Islands. On the first leg of the trip he and his wife were overcome by seasickness but an onboard doctor curiously prescribed them opium, which successfully cured them.Allen, 1997, p. 194 They stayed for two weeks in Iceland, including a visit to the sitting at Þingvellir.Allen, 1997, p. 195 During his trip, Caine kept notes on things to add local colour to the Icelandic section of the book. These he generally kept in a disorderly manner, mostly on old envelopes and the backs of letters.Allen, 1997, p. 200 As was usual for Caine, he sent the first proofs of the novel to a friend for comment, this time to Robert Leighton, who he had met for the first time earlier that year. When Leighton returned the proofs on 7 November 1889, he congratulated Caine on the novel, commenting that it was \\"for all classes of readers. It is so grand that the highest intellect will be elevated by it. It is so simple that our shepherd boy out here might read it and be thrilled by every line of it.\\"Allen, 1997, pp. 201–202 However, he also suggested significant changes to the historical references of the novel, which were glaringly inaccurate at that stage and which Leighton thought exposed Caine to the charge of taking \\"improbable liberties with circumstance.\\"Allen, 1997, p. 200 Caine took the recommendations on board and made alterations to the text, as well as acknowledging in a preface some of the other compromises of history to fiction that he did not alter in the text. Caine's previous three novels had been published by Chatto & Windus, but after the success of The Deemster Caine was determined to have a different form of contract to receive royalties and retain the copyright. He discussed the contract with Chatto & Windus throughout November 1889 but on 6 December Andrew Chatto amicably wrote to refuse the terms, stating that the sales of The Deemster, although great, did not justify the contract and the substantial advance that Caine was asking for.Allen, 1997, p. 199 Caine then turned to Heinemann, which was seeking the novel to lead the launch of the new publishing company. Caine had been introduced to Wolcott Balestier, the business partner of William Heinemann, not long before by his friend, Bram Stoker. Because Heinemann were willing to outbid Chatto & Windus, and include Caine's retention of the copyright, Caine moved to Heinemann.Allen, 1997, pp. 199–200 The novel was published in a three-volume edition at the end of January 1890. The single- volume edition appeared in October of the same year.Allen, 1997, p. 202 Reception Upon the book's release, it was \\"an immediate and spectacular success, launching both the author and the new firm into orbit.\\"Allen, 1997, p. 202 It was translated into eleven languages and was continuously in print until the 1920s.Allen, 1997, p. 202 The novel was such a happy success for Heinemann that they honoured it by choosing 'Sunlocks, London' as their telegraph address, in reference to one of the novel's main characters. This remained the address for the company until telegrams were superseded by faxes.Allen, 1997, p. 202 The novel also proved to be very well received by the press and leading public figures of the day. Gladstone, then the Prime Minister, responded to the copy of the novel that Heinemann had sent on Caine's request, saying that, “The Bondman is a work of which I recognise the freshness, vigour and sustained interest no less than its integrity of aim.\\"Allen, 1997, p. 202 Leo Tolstoy read the book \\"with deep interest.\\"Quotation used in advertising at the front of Hall Caine, The Woman of Knockaloe, London: Cassell and Company, 1923 The Times reviewed the book saying that, \\"It is impossible to deny originality and rude power to this saga, impossible not to admire its forceful directness, and the colossal grandeur of its lead characters.\\"Allen, 1997, p. 202 Caine's biographer in 1901 wrote that the critics \\"proclaimed it as one of the masterpieces of the century\\", describing the book as: > “one of the most powerful novels ever written, great by reason of its > strength of thought and directness of utterance. And yet, here and there in > its pages, are passages of wonderful softness, tender pictures of the > consolation of childhood — little Sunlocks, little Greeba, and the little > child Michael. This is what we grow to look for in Hall Caine, the > tenderness and the tragedy of humanity. They form the strength of his > novels, and it is they that will make them live through the ages, based as > they are on truths and passions that are old as the world is old.” Although the Manx public would prove to be as doubtful of Caine's depiction of their island as they were of The Deemster, the Manx National Poet, T. E. Brown, was sufficiently impressed by the novel to write a review of it for The Scots Observer. In a personal letter to Hall Caine in February 1890 he wrote of the book: > “I am reading it again with fresh interest and admiration. Nor is it > otherwise than pleasant to me to find in your story some trail of what I > must suppose is old inveterate Manxness. [...] your book floats forth to > certain success, a magnificent craft, fit for deep waters and the large > horizon. Good luck to her!” The sensation of the book's success set in motion the media obsession with Caine and his work that would remain with him for the rest of his life. This included some amount of unauthorised, inaccurate or inauthentic pieces, such as the knowing publishing of images of Hall Caine's brother and son under the pretence that they were of Caine himself in his youth.Allen, 1997, p. 216 Today, however, the book has been out of print for decades, as has the rest of Caine's work. Against the backdrop of the rest of Caine's novels, his modern biographer has rated this novel as of questionable quality, saying that \\"The book is hopelessly sentimental and melodramatic and not his best work, despite its enormous success when published.\\"Allen, 1997, p. 204 Adaptations Mrs Patrick Campbell Following the success of his co-authored adaptation of The Deemster for the stage, under the title Ben-my-Chree, Caine set about adapting The Bondman into a play. However, his initial stage version of the story was intimidating for producers as it required a large cast and very difficult sets. Wilson Barrett had received permission to produce the play in 1890, but he could not raise the large funds that the production required.Allen, 1997, p. 199 The first performance of this version of the play was given in a copyright performance in Bolton one afternoon in November 1892, without scenery and with the cast reading their lines.Allen, 1997, p. 199 Barrett dramatized The Bondman for his 1893-94 American tour which premiered at the Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia on 28 December 1893. The official premier of the later and final version of the play, entitled The Bondman Play, came on Friday 21 September 1906, in Drury Lane in a production by Arthur Collins.‘The Bondman in London’ theatre review in The New York Times, 21 September 1906 The incidental music was composed and arranged by Jimmy Glover. By this time, investment in the production was easier to arrange because many other plays by Caine had been successfully produced and an audience was effectively guaranteed for anything written by him. Caine revised the play for Collins. Written in five acts it was played in four at Drury Lane. This version of the play had changed significantly from the story of novel, most notably through a shift of location from Iceland to Sicily and with an ending that avoided the death of Red Jason. The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and eruption of volcano Mount Stomboli. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip to Sicilly where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily's sulphur mines. In one mine which Caine and Collins visited there were 730 steps from the bottom of the mine to the surface. Testa recommended Caine took Collins to the sulfotara near Naples. While in Naples they witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupt. Testa visited London and after seeing the play he commented that \\"In combining the two for dramatic purpose, Mr Collins has attained a better scenic effect than could be got out of either alone. His scheme is justified by the result, which is the most gorgeous I have ever seen on the stage The opening effects of the scene, with the line of carusi, or sulphur burners, carrying the sulphur blocks, seem to me very effective. The blue, pulsating lights from the calcarone in which the sulphur is being burned are most realistic and wonderful.” The Manx farmyard scene included three cows which came from Lord Rothschild's farm at Tring. One of the prize Alderney cows was trained to be milked on stage by Marjorie Day, an experienced milkmaid. Upon its announcement The New York Times reported that some people were shocked and quoted a writer in The St James's Gazette : \\"the cow-milking business is a kind of shoddy realism that mocks at serious drama and belittles the players, the audience, and the poor defenceless cow.\\"\\"A Star in the Milky Way\\" The New York Times, 29 August 1906 The cast was led by Mrs Patrick Campbell in the role of Greeba, with other roles being taken by Henry Ainley, Henry Neville, Fred Grove and Lionel Brough. It was in this play that Hall Caine's son, Derwent Caine, made his stage debut. Although he was listed simply as \\"Mr Derwent\\" in the programme notes to avoid undue attention because of his father, the press eventually revealed his true identity, but by that time he had already left the cast to prepare for his role in another of Hall Caine's plays, The Christian.Allen, 1997, p. 315 In London The Bondman Play was poorly received by the critics, but it was highly successful with the public and it received a long West End run.Allen, 1997, p. 315 The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the Adelphi Theatre and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America. Like the novel, the play was translated into a number of languages. During their European tour Japanese playwright Matsui Shōyō and actor Ichikawa Sadanji II saw the Dury Lane production. They were greatly impressed. Shōyō translated the play into Japanese and learned how to re-create the plays special effects. Japanese actor and a founder of Japanese modern theatre Otojirō Kawakami staged the play in 1909 with Fujisawa Asajiro and Ii Yoho at Hongo-za theatre in Tokyo, The setting was changed to Japan and the Philippines. The production included the volcanic eruption. When Kawakami's new western style theatre Teikoku-za opened in Osaka in March 1910 the first production was The Bondman. Lu Jinguro, leader of the Chinese student group the Spring Willow Society accredited with bringing Western-style theatre from Japan to China brought Kawakami's production to Weichun Yuan Garden in Shanghai, changing the setting to China and a south-eastern island.Anderson, 2011, p. 546Liu, 2013, Chapter 3King, 2012, pp. 127–128 Actor Manager George Rignold retired in 1900 after a successful career which included twenty-four successive performances of Henry V, Shakespeare's first long run in Australia. After the death of his wife in 1902 he lived in partial seclusion at Middle Harbour. Rignold came out of retirement in 1907 to play Jason successfully in The Bondman, produced by Bland Holt. Sidney newspaper The Sunday Sun reported that at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne Rignold “was received on his flrst entrance with loud and continued applause, which was repeated throughout the progress of the drama. The piece was superbly mounted, and was unanimously voted one of the best things Mr. Holt has done. The curtain was raised repeatedly after each act.” Three silent film versions of the story have been made. The first was directed by Edgar Lewis in 1916 with William Farnum as Stephen Orry and Jason, and Dorothy Bernard as Greeba. The film is particularly notable because Max Steiner composed his first ever film score for the showing of the film in New York City.\\"The Bondman (1916)\\" on IMDb (accessed 16 June 2013) The second, The Red Samson () released in 1917 in Hungary, directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Gyula Csortos, Ica von Lenkeffy and Tivadar Uray. The third film version was released in 1929, directed by Herbert Wilcox and starring Norman Kerry as Jason and Donald Macardle as Michael.\\"The Bondman (1929)\\" on IMDb (accessed 16 June 2013) Locations Port e Vullen, in 1979 * The Carick: “the reef in Ramsey Bay” on which Red Jason's ship is wrecked upon his first arriving on the Isle of Man (Chapter IX). This is a rocky mound near Port Lewaigue and is more commonly spelt “Carrick”. * Governor's House: The home of Greeba and Adam fairbrother. This can be identified as Lorne House in Castletown, which was the residence of the Governor of the Isle of Man from 1834.‘Lorn(e) House, Castletown’, by Frances Coakley, available on www.isle- of-man.com/manxnotebook (accessed 12 June 2013) This house should not to be confused with the current Government House, based in Onchan, which has been used for this purpose only since 1904. * Port-y-Vullin: The location of the home of Stephen Orry and Liza Killey, described as “a hut built of peat and thatched with broom—dark, damp, boggy and ruinous, a ditch where the tenant is allowed to sit rent free.”Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter IV, p. 32 The bay is located halfway between Ramsey and Maughold village. Today it is more commonly spelt “Port e Vullen”. * Plough Inn: A pub in Ramsey where Stephen Orry hides to escape from the navy.Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter IV, p. 24 The Plough is located on Parliament Street, the main street of the town, and it is still in operation today. * The Lague: The family home and farmstead of Greeba and the Fairbrother family. This is almost certainly based on the farm at Lewaigue, a short distance from Port e Vullen, today converted into an outdoor recreation centre. * Parliament House, Reykjavik: The home of Michael Sunlocks and Greeba, wherein Jason is arrested in his attempt on Michael's life. * Krisuvik: The sulphur mines penal colony where Michael and Jason finally meet. * Thingvellir: The site of the dramatic confrontation between Jason, Michael, Greeba and the Governor of Iceland. * Grimsey: The location of Michael's period as bondman and of the novel's dramatic concluding scenes. Historical Background John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl * The \\"Icelandic sea-dog who bought [the Isle of Man] with blood in 1077\\",Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter IV, p. 22 who Caine refers to without name in Chapter IV, is Godred Crovan, better known as \\"King Orry\\" on the Isle of Man. The Battle of Skyhill, in which he gained the island, is actually recorded as having taken place in 1079.The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys, Douglas: The Manx Society, 1874 * The “Scottish nobleman who sold [the Isle of Man] for gold in 1765\\"Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter IV, p. 23 was James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl. He sold the island to the English crown for £70,000 in what has come to be known as the “Revestment”. * In contrast to Caine's novel, the fourth Duke of Athol, John Murray, is today considered to be a relatively positive steward of Manx concerns during his period as governor, from 1793 to 1828. * The visit of the Prince of Wales accompanied by the Duke of Atholl, Captain Murray and Captain Cook on the ship, The Royal George, which occurs in Chapter IV of the novel, is clearly based on the visit of the Duke of Atholl in 1793. The Duke sailed on The Royal George under Captain Crawford, along with two other ships, Prince Edward under Captain Cook and Prince of Wales under Captain Murray.The Manks Mercury, 5 March 1793, quoted in the Notes by R. J. Moore to the poem, To the Most Noble John Duke of Atholl, Lord Lieutenant and Governor of the Isle of Man by John Stowell The historical records of the celebrations in Ramsey are very close to that depicted in Caine's novel: “Bone fires, illuminations and fires from towns on the adjacent hills, which appeared in a blaze, testified the general joy.” * The man appointed in replacement of Adam Fairbrother as Deputy Governor or the Isle of Man is, unusually for Caine, named correctly to the actual historical character, Cornelius Smelt.Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XII, p. 133 As in Caine's novel, Smelt was the first Lieutenant Governor to be directly appointed by the British Crown, on 15 June 1805. * The Bishop who brought about the downfall of Adam Fairbrother, mentioned as \\"not a Manxman – a Murray, and a near kinsman of the Lord of the Island\\",Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XI, p. 125 can be identified as George Murray. He was nominated for the post by his cousin of John Murray, the Duke of Atholl, and served from 1813/14 until 1827. * The volcano eruption that ends Book II is based on the 1789 eruption of Laki. * The capture of the Danish fleet by the British during the Napoleonic Wars that was mentioned in Chapter XXX occurred effectively as described by Caine in 1807. Quotations * [...] she must live where she was, a prisoner chained to a cruel rock; but she would not repine, she could wait, for the time of her deliverance was near. Her liberator was coming. He was at her feet; he was her child, her boy, her darling; and when he slumbered she saw him wax and grow, and when he awoke she saw her fetters break. Thus on the bridge of hope's own rainbow she spanned her little world of shame and pain.Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter III, pp. 17–18 * He had once been a truth- teller, but living with a woman who assumed that he must be a liar, he had ended by becoming one.Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter V, p. 37 * [...] she looked up into his bronzed face and smiled proudly, and her long lashes blinked over her beautiful eyes. Her glance seemed to go through him. It seemed to go through all nature; and fill the whole world with a new, glad light.Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XI, p. 126 * He was old, his life was behind him, and, save herself, he had no ties. What did it matter to him how his struggle should end? But she was young, she was beautiful, she might form new friendships, the world was before her, the world might yet be at her feet, and life, so sweet and so sad, and yet so good a thing withal, was ready and waiting for her.Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XII, p. 143 * Why this haste? And why the message? Ah, these impetuous souls that rise so high and so fast sometimes go down headlong to the abyss!Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XXII, p. 260 * [...] faces that told of amused unbelief; calculating spirits that seemed to say that all this excitement was a bubble and would presently burst like one; sapient souls who, when the world is dead, will believe in no judgment until they hear the last trump.Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XXIII, p. 267 Trivia Maughold churchyard * Caine's original title for the story was The Maid of Mona.Allen, 1997, p. 204 * Greeba, the name of the lead female character, came to be the name of Hall Caine's eventual home on the Isle of Man, Greeba Castle. * Jason's home whilst courting Greeba was in Maughold Village. It was here, aged 17, that Caine worked first as an assistant and then as a replacement school teacher for his uncle in 1870–71. It is possible that Jason's house \\"at a little cottage by the Sundial that stood by the gates of the church\\"Caine, 1890, Book II, Chapter XIII, p. 146 could be identified with the one that Caine himself stayed at during his time there. * The ship that brings Jason to the Isle of Man is called 'The Peveril'. This is almost certainly a reference to Peveril of the Peak, Sir Walter Scott's 1823 novel partly set in the Isle of Man. * The three old net weavers who discovered Red Jason's shipwreck at Port Lewaigue (Chapter IX) are claimed to be based on real people. Caine describes them in his non-fictional 1891 book on the Isle of Man, The Little Manx Nation. Unlike Jemmy, Danny and Juan in the novel, the characters in reality were called Jemmy, Danny and Billy.‘Smuggling and Wrecking’ in Caine, 1891 * Davy Kerruish, the \\"grizzled old sea dog\\"Caine, 1890, Book I, Chapter IX, p. 81 and a Manxman on Red Jason's boat from Iceland to the Isle of Man, was partly based on a real historical character. His story of stolen goods buried in a grave in the Maughold churchyard is told by Caine in The Little Manx Nation in relation to a man named \\"Hommy-Billy-mooar\\". * In Book III of the novel, Caine has Adam fairbrother communicate with native Icelanders by means of the shared Old Norse words retained in Manx and Icelandic. Although a great deal of the Isle of Man's place names are of Norse origin, there is very little of this in Manx Gaelic.'Place-names and settlement' in The Vikings of the Isle of Man by David M. Wilson, Aarhus: Aarhus University Press, 2008, pp. 100–103 Therefore, although a Manx-speaker might recognise a number of individual words in Icelandic, very little meaningful communication could actually take place. * Adam Fairbrother's ship only reaches Iceland through extreme fog thanks to their following the direction in which a raven flies after being released by the ship's captain. Although clearly a reference to the Biblical story of Noah, that it is a raven is a clear reference to Odin, a figure that unites the Isle of Man and Iceland. In honour of Odin's ravens, the animal is today a part of the Manx coat of arms. * According to Caine, at least some people were prone to take the novel on literal terms:Caine, 1908, p. 320 > “After The Bondman, I chanced on an old Manxman in Kirk Maughold, who told > me that he had known the place all his life, and he remembered Adam > Fairbrother and the six big lazy brothers, and the girl Greeba, and the mill > at Port-e-Vullin (for it was “himself that felled it”), but he was “plagued > mortal” to fix Jason, the Icelander, and he couldn’t meet with anyone in the > parish who remembered anything about him.” Notes References * The Bondman by Hall Caine, London: Heinemann, 1890 (full text of the novel available from Project Gutenberg) * The Little Manx Nation by Hall Caine, London: Heinemann, 1891 * My Story by Hall Caine, London: Heinemann, 1908 * Hall Caine: The Man and the Novelist by C.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of 1987, when she won all four of her races including the Cherry Hinton Stakes and Fillies' Mile. In 1988 she was beaten in her first two races, but won her next four, taking the Musidora Stakes, Epsom Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. She finished second when favourite for the St. Leger Stakes and ended her racing career by finishing unplaced in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but was rated the best three-year-old filly of the season in Europe. She was then retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare. Background Diminuendo was a chestnut filly with a white star and three white socks, bred in Kentucky by Nancy Dillman. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Diesis, a British-bred stallion who was the top-rated two-year-old in Europe in 1982. Diesis went on to become a successful breeding stallion, and though based at Mill Ridge Stud in Kentucky, he had his greatest successes in Europe: his best winners included Love Divine, Ramruma, Elmaamul and Halling. Diminuendo's dam, the American-bred mare Cacti, also produced Pricket, a filly who finished second in the 1996 Epsom Oaks. Diminuendo was bought by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (always known as \\"Sheikh Mohammed\\" in racing circles) and was sent to be trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place Stables in Newmarket. The filly was ridden in all her major victories by the American jockey Steve Cauthen. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1987, Diminuendo was undefeated in four races, beginning with a maiden race at Leicester Racecourse in June, in which she was ridden by Willie Ryan and won by ten lengths despite starting slowly. In late June she won the six furlong Ewar Stud Farm Stakes on the July course at Newmarket Racecourse by 2½ lengths and in July she returned to the same course and distance for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes and won at odds of 6/4 from Magic of Life, a filly who went on to win the Mill Reef Stakes against colts and the Group One Coronation Stakes. In September, Diminuendo was moved up in distance and class for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse. Starting at odds of 2/1 she won from Haiati with the subsequent Prix Marcel Boussac winner Ashayer in third place. Despite her success, Cecil reportedly felt that the filly was past her best for the season. =1988: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Diminuendo started 7/4 favourite for the Nell Gwyn Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas, over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 12 April. She was restrained by Cauthen in the early stages and despite making progress in the closing stages she was beaten three quarters of a length by Ghariba, to whom she was conceding five pounds. Sudden Love and Ela Romara, the fillies in third and fourth place, went on to win the E. P. Taylor Stakes and the Nassau Stakes respectively. On 28 April, Diminuendo started the 6/1 second favourite for the 175th running of the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile. In a change of tactics, Cauthen sent the filly into the lead from the start, but in the final quarter mile she was overtaken and beaten into third place by Ravinella and Dabaweyaa. Twelve days after her defeat at Newmarket, Diminuendo was moved up in distance for the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York. Startin the 8/13 favourited, she took the lead three furlongs from the finish and accelerated clear of the field to win impressively by four lengths from Asl, with Princess Genista five lengths back in third. On 4 June, Diminuendo was one of eleven fillies to contest the 210th running of the Oaks Stakes (known for sponsorship reasons as the Gold Seal Oaks) over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She was made 7/4 favourite ahead of Dabaweyaa and the Prix Cléopâtre winner Indian Rose. Diminuendo turned into the straight before accelerating into the lead approaching the final quarter mile. She drew clear in the closing stages to win by four lengths from Sudden Love, with the French-trained Animatrice in third. Five weeks after her win at Epsom, Diminuendo started the 2/9 favourite for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. Diminuendo was held up by Cauthen in the early stages before moving up to join the leaders in the straight but soon came under pressure and it was only in the final strides that she caught the Michael Stoute-trained Melodist to force a dead heat. Melodist, the winner of the Oaks d'Italia was also owned by Sheikh Mohammed, whose Kildangan Stud sponsored the race. At York in August, only five fillies appeared to oppose Diminuendo in the Yorkshire Oaks. Starting the 30/100 favourite, she was never in danger of defeat and won impressively by five lengths from Sudden Love. At Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Diminuendo was matched against colts for the first time in the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs. Ridden by Walter Swinburn (Cauthen was injured), she was made odds-on favourite, but was beaten a length by the colt Minster Son. She was expected to be retired after the Leger, but Cecil allowed the filly to travel to Longchamp Racecourse for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, for which she was well-fancied despite an unfavourable draw. After reaching fourth place early in the straight she faded in the closing stages and finished tenth behind Tony Bin. Assessment and honours The independent Timeform organisation gave Diminuendo a rating of 126 in 1988, making her the highest-rated three-year-old filly. In the same year, she was also the top-rated filly of her generation in Europe on the official International Classification. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Diminuendo an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Stud record Diminuendo was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owners Darley Stud and died in 2010. She was not a great success but produced at least three winners, one of whom won at Group race level: * Carpathian (bay colt 1991, by Danzig), won five races * Calando (bay filly 1996, by Storm Cat), won May Hill Stakes * Knight's Victory (bay colt 2006, by Cape Cross), won one race Pedigree References Category:1985 racehorse births Category:2010 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Irish Classic Race winners Category:Thoroughbred family 1-d Category:Epsom Oaks winners ","title":"Diminuendo (horse)"},{"id":"39786363","text":"New York Leader may refer to: * New York Leader (19th century), a New York City weekly literary newspaper from about 1855 to 1871 * New York Call, a daily socialist newspaper briefly renamed the New York Leader before its demise in 1923 ","title":"New York Leader"},{"id":"39786365","text":"Harmonica Hinds (born Mervyn H.G.

Eleven of the attackers were also killed. This attack was one of the bloodiest attacks in Xinjiang since 2009. Aftermath Following the riots, domestic-security chief, Meng Jianzhu, and head of minority affairs, Yu Zhengsheng, were dispatched to the region. Security forces also conducted military parades in the region in a show of force.

The team currently fields a 1st XV in the Midlands 5 West (South) League, and a 2nd XV . The team is based at the Hampton Road Sports Ground, on Hampton Road, Warwick. __TOC__  History  Warwickian RUFC is a new rugby club established in 2004. It was formed by folding the two former clubs, Old Warwickian RFC and Warwick RFC, to produce one club for the playing and development of rugby in the town of Warwick and its environs. Old Warwickian RUFC was formed in 1929 by the old boys of Warwick School, the Old Warwickian Association. It has been based at Hampton Road Sports Ground with 2 pitches and a clubhouse since September 1980. Warwick RFC was formed in 1976 by a splinter group of disaffected Old Warwickian players. They leased a ground from Warwick District Council on St Mary's Lands, Hampton Road. The Council gave the rugby club notice to quit due to redevelopment work along Hampton Road following Council's sale of land for development. With neither Club hitting the rugby heights and Warwick RFC homeless, it was a logical decision to amalgamate the Clubs into one new entity. The benefits of combined resources on and off the field are immediately apparent. The 1st XV plays rugby in the Midland 5 West (South) League . The 2nd XV is a development side to bring new or young players through to the first team by playing alongside established players. 1 September 2007 saw the official opening of the new Warwickian Clubhouse jointly by the Mayor of Warwick and the President of Warwickshire RFU. This magnificent facility has been built to the highest standards and includes 4 large changing rooms, showers and separate referees changing and shower. The large, airy Club room houses a Bar, of course, with a professionally equipped kitchen off. Outside the Club boasts 2 pitches, with space for a third, and a floodlit training area.

Marked for development at the fly-half role for the club early in the season after some praised performances with the boot and backline organisation, however progress was halted due to the arrival of Fijian international and former Bath player Nicky Little halfway through the season, limiting the opportunities for game time. After parting ways with Esher to further his studies at Kingston University, Felston was invited for trials with the South East England Students Rugby league team. He was later called up to the Moldovan Sevens team in May 2013 and made his first international appearance in the FIRA-AER Sevens Circuit in Israel later that month, before going on to represent the side at further tournaments. The player was set to be included in the u20's squad for the u20 European Championship in late August 2013 in preparation for the upcoming 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifiers however was injured and missed this tournament. In November 2013 Felston made his debut for the Moldovan senior team against Sweden in the flyhalf position where he scored 10 points in the 50-20 win. He was then selected for their following game against Germany where Moldova were victorious again, beating their opponents 30-15 and Felston scoring 10 points. Craig Felston went on to score six points (three conversions) against Poland in a 21 - 12 victory on 5 April 2014, eight points (four conversions) during the 28 - 8 victory against Ukraine on 12 April 2014 and two points (one conversion) in the defeat against the Czech Republic, 19 - 37, on 26 April 2014. From July 2014 Craig Felston has joined Stade Domont, in Federale 2 (level 4 in the French leagues).

Putnam's Sons. It is, by Mailer's own admission, similar in structure and purpose to Advertisements for Myself, albeit with a relatively stronger focus on contemporary politics, although many other topics are touched upon. The book covers such topics as scatology, totalitarianism, aesthetics, fascism, the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Jean Genet's 1958 play The Blacks, juvenile delinquency, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Fidel Castro, masturbation, and others.  Reception  In 1964 Midge Decter published a review in Commentary which praised Mailer's earnest observation but criticised his \\"intellectual brashness.\\" Despite chastising Mailer for not being \\"sufficiently respectful toward the history of man's difficulties with the problems raised in [The Presidential Papers],\\" Decter nonetheless concluded her review by claiming \\"no one else is telling us more about the United States of America.\\" In reviewing Mailer's personal political stance of 'left-conservativism,' Cyrus Zirakzadeh concluded that The Presidential Papers's most significant insight was that the United States has remained formally democratic but nonetheless developed a 'totalitarian culture,' a discussion found in The Ninth Presidential Paper. The primary culprit for this totalitarian culture is a technology-centered 'corporate capitalism' where employees become 'sycophants' for their employers, representing a serious threat to individual freedom. What results is a managed, predictable economic order that threatens the United States' unique history of opportunity, risk and fluid social structure.

Iron Constitution won the 1977 Withers Stakes and placed second three weeks later in the $200,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes to undefeated Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.Iron Constitution's pedigree and partial racing stats  Racing career  Iron Constitution had a very short racing career that only lasted from late in his two-year-old season until the middle of his four-year-old season. After breaking his maiden at Aqueduct Racetrack in his third attempt and followed that up with a second-place finish in allowance company. In only his fifth lifetime start his connections decided to take a big step up class and race him in a graded stakes race. That race was the one turn one mile Withers Stakes which he won in 1:37.00 under jockey Jorge Velásquez at Aqueduct Racetrack. Three weeks later his trainer, Thomas F. Root Sr. decided to take a shot at the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In that race Iron Constitution was listed a 31-1 longshot in a field of ten stakes-winning colts. The prohibitive odds-on favorite was the undefeated Kentucky Derby winner Seattle Slew. Iron Constitution broke from near the outside and broke poorly in ninth in front of only Run Dusty Run. The fractions that day were blistering on the lead, with Cruguet trying to slow Slew down under a \\"pull\\", finishing the first quarter mile in :223/5 and the half in :453/5. Just prior to Pimlico's famous \\"Clubhouse Turn\\" Iron Constitution's jockey Jorge Velásquez angled him in and slid between horses to reach the rail. He moved from ninth up tho seventh as he saved ground on both turns on the inside. Down the back stretch he moved up well into third behind only runner-up Seattle Slew and the front running leader Cormorant. Velasquez then took him outside at the top of the lane and he willingly picked up the pace finishing the mile in 1:344/5. Jean Cruguet applied a slight hand ride to Slew, who went on to win by two lengths. Iron Constitution finished second, two lengths in front of Run Dusty Run, who finished third, and took the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000. After his strong Preakness placing performance in the Preakness Stakes he went on to place in three other races that year including the Grade 1 Jersey Derby. It was the last Jersey Derby ever held at Garden State Park Racetrack before a fire destroyed the property. He also placed second in the Woodlawn Stakes on the turf at Pimlico Race Course. He also showed in third place in two mile and one sixteenth races on the dirt in the Monmouth Invitational Handicap which is now called the Haskell Invitational Stakes at Monmouth Park Racetrack and the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park. At age four he placed second in his last stakes race, the Cinema Handicap. Iron Constitution was euthanized due to a fractured leg in June 1989 at Graywood, Livonia Center, New York, where he spent his stud career.

History The present aspect of the square is not the cozy one it had one time: one of the sides was destroyed during the demolitions for the building of the Vittoriano, begun in 1885, and later in the 1930s the whole area of the Capitoline Hill was isolated. The square was formerly called Market Square; it was divided into two part, the Mercato (Italian: Market), at the slopes of the Capitoline Hill, and the Mercatello (Italian: Little Market), at the opposite side northward. The two toponyms recurred in the dedication of two nearby churches: San Biagio del Mercato, later called Chiesa di Santa Rita da Cascia in Campitelli, still existing but relocated elsewhere, and San Giovanni in Mercatello, later Chiesa di San Venanzio, still remembered in the toponymy. In the surroundings of the square, probably where nowadays the Palazzo Muti Bussi and the Palazzo Astalli rise, two of the many towers of the town stood: the Torre del Mercato (Italian: Tower of the Market) and the Torre del Cancelliere (Italian: Tower of the Chancellor). The market served not just as a place for commerce, but as a stage for politic debates and religious homilies as well. In 1442 the words of St. Bernardino of Siena against gambling and usury resounded. In 1551 St. Ignatius of Loyola opened his first school of grammar and Christian doctrine, from which the Collegio Romano sourced, and held his first spiritual exercises. In 1713 Rosa Venerini opened the first Roman house of the Maestre Pie Venerini, the first women's public school in Italy. The buildings in the square include the Palazzo Muti-Bussi, the Palazzo Fani (now Pecci-Blunt ) and the Palazzo Massimo di Rignano, then Colonna, while the central feature is the fountain designed by Giacomo della Porta and realized in 1589 by Andrea Brasca, Pietro Gucci and Pace Naldini. The complicated demolitions Piazza d'Aracoeli has been subjected to, if on one hand have ruined the scenic design that Michelangelo used for the adjustment of the Capitoline Hill, on the other hand have opened a striking view on an outstanding urban landscape: from it is it possible to admire with a single glance the Quirinal Hill, the Trajan's Forum with its column and the Torre delle Milizie at the back, the two churches of Santa Maria di Loreto and of the Santissimo Nome di Maria, Palazzo Venezia and the buildings of the \\"Angelicum\\" cloister. The palaces Palazzo Muti-Bussi The palace – in possession of the family Muti-Bussi, lately become extinct with the dead of Marchioness Olimpia – was built by Giacomo della Porta about in 1585. It has a pentagonal structure but, because of the blunt tip, where the main entrance is, it has six façades. The big front door of the main entrance is decorated with a scroll bearing the saltire mauls of the Mutis coat of arms and lion heads. At the first floor, over the entrance door, is a balcony with a beautiful view over Piazza d'Aracoeli and the majestic staircase and relevant façade of the church with the same name. Recent archeological investigations located ancient Roman walls in the cellars of the palace. Palazzo Fani (now Pecci-Blunt) The three-floors palace overlooks Piazza d’Aracoeli. Simple and noble, it is decorated by a frieze with floral decoration running under the ledge. In the second half of 16th century Mario Fani, noble Roman citizen hailing from Tuscania, commissioned to Giacomo della Porta the renewal of the palace. At the end of 16th century the palace was rented out to primates (in 1601 Cardinal Federico Borromeo lived here). In the first half of 17th century the palace was bought by Filippo Spada and the sold to the Ruspoli family when they came to Rome from Siena. At the beginning of the 18th century the palace passed to the Malatesta family and finally to the Pecci Blunt counts. The building now houses residential buildings, but is also used by the present owners, the Valsecchi Nesbitts, as a location for high-society and cultural events. Palazzo Massimo di Rignano (then Colonna) the present aspect of the palace is due to the architect Carlo Fontana and shows a gate with vegetal decorations, four floors, a modern attic and a crenellated tower-observatory. The left corner of the palace was cut in 1939, during the opening of Via del Teatro di Marcello. The fountain The Fountain of Aracoeli The fountain, built in 1589 by Andrea Brasca, Pietreo Gucci and Pace Naldini on a design by Giacomo Della Porta, one time rose on two steps repeating the lines of the lower basin and was surrounded by a logline receiving the water. In 1800 the steps were removed and replaced by little columns. The fountain has two basins with different shapes; the smaller one sustains a group of putti pouring water from a vase.

He is notable mainly for landscapes of various parts of Russia, produced during his travels, but he also was active as portrait and genre painter. Biography Chernetsov was born in Lukh, currently part of Ivanovo Oblast, Russia. His father and older brother, Yevgraf, were icon painters. His brother, Nikanor Chernetsov, three years younger than Grigory, became a landscape painter as well, and often worked together with Grigory Chernetsov. In 1819, Grigory Chernetsov, encouraged by Pavel Svinyin, who was earlier travelled to Lukh, arrived in Saint Petersburg where he wanted to enroll in the Imperial Academy of Arts. He was not admitted. However, he got permission to work there two hours per day. He was not granted a fellowship and had to live with the support of his father, being constantly low on money. In 1822, he was granted the small Silver Medal for his drawings and accepted to the academy, where he studied under Alexander Varnek and Maxim Vorobiev. In 1823, Nikanor joined him at the Academy. The brothers graduated in 1827 with small Gold Medals. After graduation, Grigory Chernetsov was hired as a staff painter at the court. His duties included producing paintings of official events such as military parades or official receptions. In particular, his best known painting, The military parade on October 6, 1831 in Tsaritsyn Lug, Saint Petersburg incorporates portraits of a number of his famous contemporaries, including Alexander Pushkin, Vasily Zhukovsky, Ivan Krylov, and Nikolay Gnedich. The painting was created from 1832 to 1837 and was eventually bought by the state and given as a present to the future Tsar, Alexander II. From 1837 on, the Chernetsov brothers worked together. In 1838, they travelled down the Volga between Rybinsk and Astrakhan, making landscape sketches on their way, and later using these sketches to make paintings. They also produced a long panorama of the banks of the Volga which eventually was accepted as a gift by Nicholas I. In the 1840s, they travelled over Italy and the Middle East, but attempts to sell the resulting lithographs in Russia were highly unsuccessful. When Grigory Chernetsov died in 1865, his brother did not have enough money to bury him. In 1833, the Chernetsov brothers lobbied creation of the first high school in Lukh.

When they were in Hollywood shooting Born to Dance (1936) Porter ran into Bing Crosby. Bing had met him in Spokane in the Twenties where Porter and Ray Johnson were musicians playing a gig in a dance band. Crosby liked the Foursome's singing, but realized the ocarinas, and also Porter's clarinet, could add a fresh sound to old songs. He invited them to back him up on his radio show The Kraft Music Hall.Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams-the Early Years, 1903-1940 Paperback, Gary Giddins,Back Bay Books; Reprint edition (October 8, 2002) Bing also brought them into the recording studio to record songs for Decca such as Sweet Georgia Brown; Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider; My Honey's Loving Arms; Chinatown, My Chinatown and others in 1937.

Spike managed the band for ten bucks a week. After limited success, Spike suggested he would join the band. Eventually, the band evolved from the Feather Merchants to Spike Jones and His City Slickers. Porter was happy with being a creative force but not being the leader of a band. With the Slickers he could write songs, sing and play on records, and let Spike book the gigs.

It is an improvement over the older M14 Direct Connect (M14 DC) sound suppressor. History The M14 is an accurate and reliable rifle, but it has had less than optimum results from being used with a sound suppressor. There are a number of factors which contribute to this. The first pertains to the fine threads on the muzzle which were not intended for attaching and removing different muzzle devices. The second is the rifle's gas system and the diversion of gases from the suppressor toward the face of the shooter. In 2003 Ron Smith and Richard Smith of Smith Enterprise, Inc. and Dave Fisher of Fisher Enterprises developed and produced an M14 sound suppressor that quickly attached to and detached from the Smith Enterprise, Inc. Vortex flash hider for US troops in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prior attempts at suppressing the M14 included removing the rifle's existing flash suppressor with an attached sight and sometimes the gas lock which could result in losing parts for the rifle and rendering it ineffective. The initial version was called the M14 Direct Connect, or M14 DC, and was a factory supplied part of the M14SE/M21A5 and Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle systems.M14 to MK14. Evolution of a Battle Rifle. Retrieved on September 23, 2008. The M14 Direct Connect was unique in that it was the first sound suppressor expressly built for the M14 rifle that could be disassembled in the field for routine maintenance as opposed to returning it to the manufacturer. In 2006 the body of the suppressor was changed to titanium and this dropped the weight of the suppressor from over 2 lbs to 1.42 lbs. In 2009 Fisher designed an optional locking collar for use on the M1A SOOCOM rifle, which uses a different style of flash suppressor/muzzle brake. As the war effort began winding down in 2011, Fisher Enterprises and Smith Enterprise ceased their collaboration and Smith made some changes to the M14 DC and renamed the new model as the Wind Talker. These features included a new baffle design, a shortened locking collar made from nitrocarburized stainless steel and revolver cylinder cuts on the coupler which allowed propellant gas to exit just forward of the locking collar. Specifications The Wind Talker is constructed with a stainless steel tube and a lightweight version is offered with an aluminum tube. The decibel rating level is 25dB. The Wind Talker can be mounted to any rifle with either a 7.62 mm or 5.56mm bore diameter as long as it utilizes a Vortex flash hider. The Wind Talker sound suppressor is in the military inventory system as NATO Stock Number: NSN 1005-LLL-997965, utilizing the same NSN number as the M14DC which it replaced.

Produced by Martin Feveyear, who had worked with Lanegan on his previous covers album, I'll Take Care of You (1999), the album was preceded by the single, \\"I'm Not the Loving Kind\\". Background Commenting on the decision to record a covers album, Mark Lanegan said: \\"when I was a kid in the late sixties and early seventies, my parents and their friends would play the records of Andy Williams, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Perry Como, music with string arrangements and men singing songs that sounded sad whether they were or not. At home my folks were also listening to country music, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, George Jones and Vern Gosdin were some of our favorites. For a long time I've wanted to make a record that gave me the same feeling those old records did, using some of the same tunes I loved as a kid and some that I've loved as I have gotten older. This record is it.\\" Release Imitations was announced for release on June 26, 2013 through a press release on Lanegan's official website. It was subsequently released on September 17, 2013 on Vagrant Records, with whom he signed after the release of Blues Funeral (2012).

Isaac Aronovich Hourwich (April 26, 1860 – July 9, 1924) (Russian: Исаак Аронович Гурвич) was a Jewish-American economist, statistician, lawyer, and political activist. Hourwich is best remembered as a pioneer in the development of labor statistics for the American mining industry and as a prominent public intellectual among the Yiddish-language community in the United States. Biography =Early years= Isaac Aronovich Hourwich was born April 26, 1860 in Vilna, Lithuania, then part of the Russian empire. The Hourwich family was of the middle class, his father Aaron Hourwich was a well-educated employee in a bank who provided a quality secular education to his children.David Wolfson and Rachel S. Harrison (ed.), \\"Guide to the Papers of Isaac A. Hourwich (1860-1924), 1882-1924,\\" New York: YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 2011. Hourwich graduated from a classical gymnasium in the Belorussian city of Minsk in 1877. Upon graduation he first tried to study medicine at the St. Petersburg Academy of Medicine and Surgery but did not find that conducive.Robert A. Karlowich, We Fall and Rise: Russian-Language Newspaper in New York City, 1889-1914. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1991; pg. 110. Thereafter he attended the University of St. Petersburg, where he studied mathematics. It was during this interval that Hourwich first became involved in the Russian revolutionary movement, with his first arrest for revolutionary activity coming in 1879. Hourwich sat in jail in St. Petersburg for an extended period of time before being exiled without trial to Siberia in 1881. Subsequent events are unclear in the historical record, but it is known that by 1886 he was back in Minsk coordinating a Jewish Workers' Circle there. Hourwich then moved to Yaroslavl where in 1887 he passed the examination at the Demidov Law Institute and was admitted to the Russian bar. During this interlude Hourwich also studied the economy and social relations of the Siberian peasantry and wrote a book on the topic, The Peasant Immigration to Siberia, published in 1888. Hourwich remained active in the underground revolutionary movement even as a lawyer and was instrumental in establishing radical study circles among Jewish workers. =Emigration to America= In 1890 Hourwich was forced to flee Russia to avoid arrest, leaving behind his first wife and their four children. On 30 September 1890, he sailed from the Port of Goteborg, Sweden, and arrived at the Port of Hull, England, in the month of October; he next departed from the Port of Liverpool on a ship bound for New York. Hourwich settled in New York City, where he successfully made a return to academia when he was awarded an academic fellowship to attend Columbia College in New York City.William M. Feigenbaum, \\"Socialist Profiles: No. 10 — Isaac A. Hourwich,\\" The New Leader, vol. 15, no. 8 (Feb. 25, 1932), pp. 8-9. Hourwich earned his doctorate from Columbia after successfully defending a pioneering dissertation on the economics of the Russian village. This dissertation was published in book form in 1893 by Columbia College and in Russian translation in Moscow in 1896. Settling in Chicago, Hourwich was admitted to the Illinois state bar association in 1893. He also lectured at the University of Chicago for about a year. He contributed a number of articles to academic journals of the day, including the Yale Review, Journal of Political Economy, and Political Science Quarterly.Karlowich, We Fall and Rise, pg. 111. A committed socialist from his early years, in the United States Hourwich first joined the Socialist Labor Party of America, leaving it in 1897 to join the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) headed by Eugene V. Debs. In 1901 he declined to follow the SDP into the Socialist Party of America, however, despite the fact that the Chicago-based SDP was one of the main initiators of the new group. In 1900 Hourwich began a career working in the American government. He was initially employed as a translator at the Bureau of the Mint until 1902, before moving to the Bureau of the Census as a specialist on mining. Hourwich remained with the Census Bureau compiling statistical material relating to American mines and quarries until 1906. =Return to Russia= In 1905 revolution broke out in Russia. Hourwich made his return across the Atlantic in 1906 to attempt to win election to the Russian State Duma. Somewhat surprisingly, Hourwich did not run for Duma as a Social Democrat, but rather sought office as a member of the centrist Constitutional Democratic Party headed by Pavel Miliukov. Hourwich won the election, only to see the results annulled by the Tsarist government. =Second American period= Following the annulment of the election and the defeat of the revolution Hourwich returned to America, working once again for the Bureau of the Census in compiling a massive volume on mine statistics in association with the 1910 census. Back in America, Hourwich continued to stand outside the Socialist movement, supporting the Progressive Party (\\"Bull Moose\\") ticket of Theodore Roosevelt in the Presidential election of 1912. In 1913 Hourwich himself became a candidate of the Bull Moose Party, running for an open seat in Congress to fill a vacancy. Although personally respected for his independence, honesty, and intelligence in the Russian colony in America, this alignment with the capitalists proved a bridge too far for the Russian- language Marxists of New York, who accused him of \\"instability\\" and of having gone over to the capitalists in the pages of the weekly newspaper Novyi Mir (New World).Karlowich, We Fall and Rise, pg. 112. Moreover, as was the case in his earlier run for the Russian Duma, Hourwich was unsuccessful in his effort to win a seat in Congress. Hourwich learned to write in Yiddish only at the age of 35. Thereafter he became a prolific writer in that language, writing for a variety of publications under various pseudonyms, including \\"Isaac Halevy\\" and \\"Yitzchok Isaac.\\" Hourwich joined the Socialist Party of America for the first time during World War I. In his later years Hourwich became involved in the Zionist movement and in 1917 he was among those who helped to organize the American Jewish Congress. He remained active in the socialist movement as well, publishing a Yiddish translation of Das Kapital by Karl Marx in 1919 and publishing fragments of his uncompleted Yiddish autobiography, Memoirs of a Heretic, in the Socialist The Jewish Daily Forward and the anarchist Fraye Arbeter Shtimme (Free Worker's Voice). In 1919 Hourwich became involved with the semi-official mission of Soviet Russia in America, the Russian Soviet Government Bureau, as its legal advisor. Hourwich would visit briefly Soviet Russia in 1922 but he was thoroughly disillusioned by the experience, and he emerged as a critic of the tactics of the Bolshevik Party of V.I. Lenin. =Death and legacy= Isaac Hourwich died of pneumonia on July 9, 1924. He was 64 years old at the time of his death. Hourwich was remembered by his friend, journalist William M. Feigenbaum, as \\"a man of charm and genuine brilliance\\" with a tendency to intentionally hold contrarian opinions. \\"People disagreed with him but he made them think to justify their position,\\" Feigenbaum recalled. Hourwich's son, Nicholas Hourwich, was an important member of the Russian Federation of the Socialist Party and a leader of the Left Wing Section which emerged early in 1919. The younger Hourwich later became a founding member of the Communist Party of America and later emigrated to the Soviet Union.

These options are: * Identity Preserved * Segregated * Mass Balance * Book and Claim (GreenPalm) If the palm oil growers chose GreenPalm, then each tonne of certified palm oil & palm kernel oil they are certified to sell is transferred into a GreenPalm Palm & Palm Kernel Oil certificate. The certificates are offered for sale on the GreenPalm market. Manufacturers based around the globe that use palm oil, palm kernel oil or any derived product can then join GreenPalm. Once they are a member they can place bids for, buy and then redeem certificates equal to the amount of physical oil they wish to cover. All those manufacturers that have redeemed certificates can see their commitment on the GreenPalm redeemed certificate holder’s page. Once redeemed, the manufacturer can use the GreenPalm logo and make claims that they or their products support/advance the production of RSPO certified sustainable palm, palm kernel oil. The palm oil grower receives the full certificate premium, the physical RSPO certified oil that this relates to will be sold into the global market – someone, somewhere will consume sustainably produced palm / palm kernel oil. This process stimulates other palm oil growers to start the certification process for their plantation and mill.  Support  Dave McLaughlin, agriculture vice- president, World Wildlife Fund, is reported as stating that \\"GreenPalm is a transitional tool to give growers the right market signals\\" that it is worth their while to participate in the RSPO's sustainable palm oil auditing and certification programs.Watson, Elaine.

Instead of lifting the bed vertically, the hydraulic cylinder pushes a ram-face horizontally through the body to eject the hauled load. History Rear-eject dump vehicles were first introduced in the 1980s by LeRoy Hagenbuch, P.E. of Philippi-Hagenbuch, Inc. for a refuse hauling application in New York City. They were designed to work on Volvo BM truck chassis. While the functionality of the ejector bodies worked well, they were prone to maintenance issues and not replicated until the 1990s. The next documented ejector bodies were developed by DDT, a UK truck manufacturer.Woof, Mike. \\"ADT versatility makes trucks a popular choice\\". Aggregates. A variation using steel chains instead of a hydraulic ram was introduced by Bell, but did not become popular. Caterpillar Inc. began offering a rear-eject option using technology originally designed for its scrapers after one of its contractors successfully converted a few CAT D400 models. The new design, installed on the company's D400E model, was less likely to jam in cold weather. CAT later began manufacturing a standard R.E. body for its 730, 740, and 740B articulating haul-truck series. Philippi-Hagenbuch, a company specializing in truck body design, developed its own mechanism for its rear-eject bodies, and has patented its design in the US, Europe and Australia. The company customizes Rear-Eject bodies or trailers for several manufacturers' off-highway vehicles; including both rigid and articulating varieties.\\"Combination rear eject/end dump bodies for scrap \\". Recycling Product News As of 2014 Caterpillar Inc. and Philippi-Hagenbuch, Inc. are continuing to manufacture Rear-Eject bodies for off-highway applications, each using its own design of mechanism.  Rear- Eject vs. End-Dump Bodies  Because rear-eject bodies do not lift, or move externally in any way, they maintain a lower center of gravity. This means more stability on uneven terrain where the truck might tip over during the dump process. The truck can also be driven while dumping is in progress; this reduces subsequent time and effort spent on grading the dumped material.\\"Komatsu ADT with rear eject body - performs well at Namakwa Sands operation\\".

The organization works closely with the United States Forest Service from which the Trailbuilders volunteers get their safety oversight and general schedule for tasks and projects which are performed during the year.  Responsibilities  Hikers, bikers, climbers, fishers, backpackers, and other people who get their recreation within the Angeles National Forest often send Email to the Trailbuilders when there are significant problems on trails which have not yet been identified and repaired. Such problems include dead trees down across the trail, significant erosion and washouts, excessive plant growth along the trail, or sections of trail which have otherwise disappeared or are difficult to locate. Additionally the Trailbuilders are increasingly responsible for establishing and maintaining trail signs within the San Gabriel River Ranger District, identifying missing or damaged signs and replacing them as funds and schedule permits. The Trailbuilders are responsible for all of the hiking and nature trails within the Crystal Lake Recreation Area, Coldbrook Campgrounds,Coldbrook Campgrounds Accessed 2013-06-26 Bear Creek TrailBear Creek Trail Designated Wilderness (mile post 32.4 along California State Route 39), East Fork Trail, Heaton Flats Trail (at the end of East Fork Road), and numerous other hiking and nature trails within the San Gabriel River Ranger District. Additionally the organization is responsible for some of the trail maintenance within the Mount San Antonio (also known as Mount Baldy) area. The organization invites High Schools, Colleges, Youth Groups, and other organizations to send volunteers to assist with trail projects during the year. Community service projects for students, Boy Scouts of America volunteers, and Eagle Scout Service Project candidates may contact the Trailbuilders to acquire information on how to participate in the trail- working efforts. Inventory of trails maintained Some of the hiking and nature trails which the volunteer group is responsible for include the following, however there are numerous other trails which the group maintains that are accessed from the East Fork of the San Gabriel River that are not part of this list: * Half Knob Trail : —This is a short hike trail which begins and ends at points along the main paved roadway leading to the Visitor Center. The trailhead is located at North 34 degrees, 19.444 by West 117 degrees, 50.210 at . * Lake Trail : —The trail cuts across the camp grounds and joins the main road that heads up to the Visit Center to Lake Road. The start of the trail head from the main road end is located at North 34 degrees, 19.410 by West 117 degrees, 50.261 at . * Golden Cup Nature Trail : —This is a short hike with four or five information boards placed along the trail. The trail itself forms a loop such that the start and end of the hike is near a main paved road. The trail head is located at North 34 degrees, 19.630 by West 117 degrees, 50.108 at . * Big Cieneca Trail : —This trail is long and has its start at a paved road. * Windy Gap : —This trail is long and has its start at a paved road. The trailhead is located at North 34 degrees, 19.890 by West 117 degrees, 50.021 at . * Access to Pacific Crest Trail : —This trail is long and has its start at a paved road. * Little Jimmy Trail Camp : —This trail is long and has its start at a paved road. * Mount Hawkins Trail : —This trail is long and has its start at a paved road. The trail actually swings around the camp grounds and passes through a heliport (above the destroyed fire watch tower) and then ends at South Mt. Hawkins lookout (which burned to the ground in the 2002 Curve Fire.) * Pinyon Ridge : —This is a moderately long trail which forms a loop that takes hikers up the side of the mountain ridge, along the ridge, and then back down again, curving around to form the loop. There is water present at three places along the trail all year, and the start of the trail requires about an hour's worth of effort to remove new growth. The trail head location is the same as the start of Soldier Creek: North 34 degrees, 19.354 by West 117 degrees, 49.976 at . * Soldier Creek Trail : —Fire damage and flooding has effectively destroyed this trail and it is currently extremely dangerous to hike along. This is a long hiking trail and without a doubt the best hiking trail in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. It follows Soldier Creek which contains good, high-volume water, sporting rare vegetation such as Catalina Cherries. This trail may or may not be restored prior to the Crystal Lake Camp Grounds being opened. The trail head location is the same as the start of Pinyon Ridge trail: North 34 degrees, 19.354 by West 117 degrees, 49.976 at . * Lost Ridge Trail : (lower) : (upper)—This trail is a long one with one end of the trail head up near Deer Flats and the other end on Lake Road. To increase safety, the Trailbuilder crew installed steps in a number of places and the volunteers may decide to install more steps in moderately steep places in the future. The lake road trail head is located at North 34 degrees, 19.452 by West 117 degrees, 50.463 at . The other end of the trail is in the Deer Flats Campgrounds and it is located at North 34 degrees, 19.977 by West 117 degrees, 50.365 at . * Tototngna Nature Trail : —This trail was recently worked on (06/Jul/13) and is fully developed from end to end. This is a moderately long trail which forms a loop and can be accessed from a paved road. The trail head is located at North 34 degrees, 19.538 by West 117 degrees, 49.767 at . Tototngna is rather special in that the trail crosses moist meadow areas and in the Spring boasts flora that is not usually seen anywhere else within the Recreation Area. * Cedar Canyon Trail : —This trail has its start on the main road leading up to the Visitor Center. It's a moderately long trail that leads to a good volume of water. The trail actually meets up with Soldier Creek Trail which requires extensive repairs before the trail is safe and usable. The trail head for this end of the trail is located at North 34 degrees, 19.366 by West 117 degrees, 50.280 at . * Sunset Ridge Nature Trail : —This trail is located inside of the Deer Flats Campgrounds. It's a short trail which forms a loop that ends about from where it begins. The trail is currently being restored and about 20% of the trail has been completed. The location of this trail is at North 34 degrees, 20.002 by West 117 degrees, 50.249 at . * Islip Ridge Trail (a.k.a. Wawona Trail) : —This trail is located at the parking lot for the lake itself with a trailhead sign located approximately from the actual parking lot. The trail climbs an additional through approximately eventually reaching Angeles Crest Highway with access to Windy Gap, Little Jimmy, and other trails. Mile 1.65 is located approximately at North 34 degrees 19.292 by West 117 degrees, 51.066 at . * Mount Islip Trail : (Windy Gap Saddle) (Wawona Islip Junction) —This trail can be accessed either from Wawona Trail or from Windy Gap Saddle. The trail connects Mount Islip to the Recreation Area through Southbound hikes using wither Windy Gap Trail or Wawona / Islip Trail. * Hawkins Ridge Trail : (Pacific Crest Trail junction) (Mount Hawkins Road Junction) —This trail can be reached off of the Pacific Crest Trail East of Windy Gap Saddle, or it can be reached by taking Mount Hawkins Road (which is abandoned but usable on foot and mountain bike.) The trail was last maintained across its full length in May 2016. The trail signs at the Northern end along the Pacific Crest Trail is missing as of July 2018. * Trail from Windy Gap Saddle to Little Jimmy Trail Camp * Trail from Windy Gap Saddle to Baden-Powell summit  Major Accomplishments  * Along the East Fork of the San Gabriel River the Trailbuilders are responsible for maintaining the trail which leads to the famous Bridge to Nowhere (San Gabriel Mountains) which includes the John Seals BridgeJohn Seals Bridge Accessed 2013-06-26 which spans across Laurel Gulch. * Upper Bear Creek TrailBear Creek Trail Accessed 2013-06-26 required horses, mules, and 935 pounds of Tovex explosives to repairBear Creek Trail Repairs Accessed 2013-06-26 * Ice House CanyonIce House Canyon Accessed 2013-06-26 is one of the Trailbuilders most extensively-used trails which the organization maintains.Ice House Canyon Repairs Accessed 2013-0-26  Work Schedule And Joining  The Trailbuilders meet at the San Gabriel Canyon Gateway Center (located at 1960 N.

Type 984 was a 3D S band system used for both ground controlled interception (GCI) and as a secondary early warning system. It was the most sophisticated naval radar of its era.  Description  The Type 984 was different from most radars in a number of ways. For one, it used a lens made of metal tubes in place of the more traditional parabolic reflector, which made it look a circular plate rather than the open framework typical of the era. It was mounted on a fully stabilized platform, allowing it to produce a steady image in all but the highest sea states. It also used a unique system for vertical scanning, feeding the output of four cavity magnetrons into four moving feedhorns, each scanning about 5 degrees vertically. Other 3D radars of the era generally picked one solution or the other, using a network of separate feedhorns or a single vertically scanning feed. The use of four magnetrons gave it better range performance; against large high-flying aircraft it had a typical range of , although this fell to as short as against small low flying aircraft. A key part of the overall Type 984 installation was the Comprehensive Display System (CDS), an electromechanical computer that developed \\"tracks\\" for aircraft in a semi-automated fashion. This greatly reduced operator workload, allowing the overall system to track many dozens of formations of aircraft while continuing to scan for new contacts, what would today be known as track while scan (TWS). In several tests against US Navy aircraft during military exercises, the combination of the 984's high scanning rates and the CDS' tracking made the ships impossible to approach without being intercepted. CDS also allowed the 984 to be used both for interception control, as well as day- to-day air traffic control around the fleet aircraft carriers. The original design called for a maximum weight of , and a maximum turning circle while scanning of . Many Navy designs of the early 1950s intended to mount the 984, and some sported two installations, fore and aft. As the design matured its weight continued to grow, ultimately reaching , making it too heavy for most ships. At the same time, the Navy's inventory of large ships was shrinking. Ultimately it was mounted on only on the aircraft carriers , and .

History A traditional corn sheller A large corn shelling machine The modern corn sheller is commonly attributed to Lester E. Denison from Middlesex County, Connecticut. Denison was issued a patent on August 12, 1839, for a freestanding, hand-operated machine that removed individual kernels of corn by pulling the cob through a series of metal- toothed cylinders which stripped the kernels off the cob. Soon after, other patents were granted for similar machines, sometimes having improvements over Denison's original design. Operation The operation of a corn sheller is similar to a threshing machine, but with some differences to deal with larger grain size and other differences of corn compared to wheat and other crops. Corn shellers can be powered by a hand crank, a tractor, a stationary engine, or by an electric motor. Whole corn cobs are fed in. They are pulled between two toothed wheels, usually made of metal. Each wheel spins the opposite direction of the other. The teeth pull the kernels off the cob until there are no kernels left. The kernels fall out through a screen into a container (such as a bucket) placed underneath the machine. The cob is then ejected out, since it cannot pass through the screen. Some models have a \\"walker\\", similar to a threshing machine or combine, to take the cobs out.

JahrhundertsKindler H Malereilexikon Taschenbuch 1976Milton J Ellenbogen, History and the Artist: The Life and Death of Theo Fried New York Early Life (Budapest-Vienna) Fried was born in Budapest (or possibly Szeged) in 1902. His father - a watchmaker and jeweller- died when he was nine years old. In 1920 he entered the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts and studied under Gyula Rudnay for four years. His surviving early work includes charcoal drawings of scenes of life which reflect the hardship and poverty of the period after the First World War. To broaden his horizons he moved to Vienna in June 1924 taking with him seven oil paintings and sixty drawings. He was given a one-man exhibition at the Galerie Hugo Heller. This gallery was run by the Heller family. Hugo Heller, who had died the previous year, had been a bookseller and a central figure in Viennese cultural life, who was particularly noted for promoting the writings of Sigmund Freud. It was through the Galerie that he came to meet the younger generation of Austrian artists, who were connected with the Hagenbund and Art Critics and Art Historians such as Fritz Grossmann and Fritz Novotny. It was also through the Heller family connection that he is likely have met his first wife, Anna Politzer, the daughter of a Viennese goldsmith. He had a further exhibition at Galerie Hugo Heller in early 1925, but in June 1925 moved to Paris. Paris & Toulouse(1924-1941/2) On his move to Paris he established himself as a member of the Ecole de Paris. He set up a studio in Montmartre and through his acquaintance with the Belgian writer and avant garde painter, Ferdinand Berckelaers Michael Seuphor he was introduced to the Paris art scene. Seuphor was Hungarian speaking and this led to Fried meeting the Hungarian photographer André Kertész, with whom he established a lifelong friendship. Together with Kertész, Fried spent much of his time at Le Dôme Café, a popular meeting place for the many artists who had come to Paris at this time. Later that year Fried exhibited his first painting at the Salon d'Automne amongst the foreign grouping beaux-arts de la France d'outre-mer\\" which at that time included Picasso and Chagall. In 1926 he married Anna Politzer, who had just completed her Doctorate at Jena University. During these years Fried struggled to make a living. He appears to have undertaken dress design for a Paris Fashion house. Through his friendship with a sculptor who lived below him who ran a puppet theatre, he was employed as puppeteer, and this was recorded by a photograph taken by Kertész in 1930. He had when young ambitions to become a musician, and while in Paris he played the violin in a cinema orchestra. From 1931 onwards he painted White Russian refugee Cossack singers. Orchestras and musicians become an increasingly important theme in his work.Milton J Ellenbogen, History and the Artist: The Life and Death of Theo Fried New York. n.d. Fried kept up his connection with Viennese art scene and appears to have visited Vienna on a regular basis in the inter- War years.Kurt Blauensteiner \\"Graphische Blatter von Theodor Fried\\" in Forum:Die Graphischen Kunste, 1932 In 1927 he contributed to the exhibition Das Werden eines Kunstwerkes at the at Osterreichisches Museum fur Kunst und Industrie. Other contemporary Austrian artists who exhibited were Georg Ehrlich, Ferenczy, Hannak, Jungnickel, Kokoschka, Laske and Georg Merkel. The exhibition concentrated on studies which the artists had used to create a particular artwork. Fried submitted the studies for his Blinder Spielzeugmacher (Blind Toymaker).Anny Politzer Bilder von Théodore Fried, Individualität : Zweimonatsschift für Philosophie et Kunst (Heraus Storrer W et Reinhart H) 1927 Heft 3, Amalthea-Verlag, Zurich This painting was later acquired by the Kunstverein in Jena, and the painting was later to be included in Hitler's Degenerate Art Exhibitions or entartete Kunst in 1937/8. Also in 1930 he exhibited in Vienna in the exhibition organised by Hans Tietz Die Kunst in unsure Zeit, alongside artists such as Picasso, Nolde, Kokoschka, Franz Marc, Kandinsky and Munch. From 1929-31 he was a guest exhibitor at the Hagenbund exhibitions in Vienna and from 1932-38 he was a full member of the Hagenbund.Boeckl M. et al (2014), Hagenbund: A European Network of Modernism, 1900 to 1938, Hirmer on behalf of the Belvedere, Vienna., pg 431. . Later in 1935 a major exhibition of his art together with work of the Austrian artist Frieda Salvendy, was staged in Prague.Fritz Grossmann Ausstellung Frida Salvendy und Theodor Fried. Forum V February 1935 In 1930 the Fried's only child Christopher was born. Studies of children and his son in particular, now become a recurring theme in his paintings and drawings. During the 1930s became a more established figure on the Paris art scene and was given a major commission to decorate a pavilion at the 1937 Paris World Exhibition. =Escape from France and arrival in New York= With the increasing threat of war in Europe, as both Fried and his wife were of Jewish ancestry, they applied to emigrate to the USA. His wife had no problem with her visa because she was Austrian, and their son, born in Paris, met the criteria because he was a French citizen. Fried stayed behind to finish illustrations for a book, and several months later, when he applied for his visa, it was not granted because the quota for Hungarian emigrants was filled. With the German invasion and the establishment of the French Vichy Government, Fried together with the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz bought a cheap car and fled to Toulouse, where Fried worked as a portrait photographer and forger of passports and documents for those involved in the Resistance. At this time a large number artists and other Jewish intellectuals had gathered in this area. Through the efforts of the American journalist Varian Fry and the American vice-consul at Marseilles [Hiram Bingham], it was possible for some of them to gain visas to USA. In the case of Fried it appears this was arranged by the Quaker American Friends Service Committee. It is not clear how Fried escaped from France, but it was probably through Spain and the date of his escape is uncertain. What appears to be certain is that he got to Casablanca and was aboard the \\"Serpa Pinta\\" which was bound for New York. One account gives the date May 1942 when he was in Casablanca and June for his arrival in New York. Another account states that he travelled with the artist Marcel Duchamp and the Polish harpsichordist Wanda Landowska and that he arrived in New York, before the artist Marc Chagall, whom he was to met at the dock, and helped him to settle into the New York artistic community. While it seems certain that he knew Chagall in New York, Chagall had arrived in New York in June 1941, while Wanda Landowska arrived in December 1941.Milton J Ellenbogen, History and the Artist: The Life and Death of Theo Fried Later life After arriving at New York,Fried and his wife Anne drifted apart and their marriage broke up. Anne Fried became Director of the James Weldon Johnson Community, New York, but, in 1960, their son Christopher Risto Fried moved to Finland and became Professor of Psychology at the University of Jyväskylä. Anne Fried moved to Finland in 1969, having learnt Finish, and she became a leading Finnish novelist and writer. She died in 1999 and Risto Fried died in 2004. Fried became a very active member of the artists community in Greenwich village, many of whom were emigres from central Europe, and in particular he re-established his friendship with Kertész, who was now gaining widespread recognition as a photographer.Franklin Riehlman Theodore Fried & André Kertész: An Enduring Friendship, H V Allison Galleries, New York, Exhibition March 19th – April 17th 1987 Meanwhile, in 1947 Fried married Maria Englehardt, who was actively committed to social work, and they were to establish an art school within the Hudson Guild, a charitable organisation in West 25 Street. It was here that he was involved in organizing exhibitions. Fried specialized in teaching etching and the techniques of woodcuts and amongst his students was the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, with whom he had escaped from Paris to Toulouse in 1940. In 1969 his studio was largely destroyed by a serious fire, but shortly afterwards he was able to move to the newly created artists studios in the Westbeth Graphics Workshops which are in the nearby Bethune Street. This was a commune of artists and Fried continued teaching and was active in organizing exhibitions connected with the Westbeth Graphics Workshops. He was also particularly successful as a portrait painter, while at the same producing etchings, linocuts and woodcuts, which in some cases were used as book illustrations.These included the work of the poet Michael Blumenthal, whose Sympathetic Magic, published in 1980 was illustrated by Fried. In 1960 Fried was able to retrieve some 59 of the paintings he had completed before the War which he had left stored in Paris, but it was not until the year before his death in 1979, that he was able to regain possession of a further group of paintings that had been stored in Toulouse.Milton J Ellenbogen, History and the Artist: The Life and Death of Theo Fried In 1972 the Frieds moved to the Old Parsonage in Otis in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, where they spent the summer months, although he continued to work and live in Greenwich village where he died of a heart attack in July 1980. Following his death and to commemorate his close friendship with Kertész the H V Allinson Gallery in New York mounted an exhibition Theodore Fried & André Kertész: An Enduring Friendship,Franklin Riehlman Theodore Fried & André Kertész: An Enduring Friendship, H V Allison Galleries, New York, Exhibition March 19th – April 17th 1987 which was based largely on the paintings recovered from Toulouse. In the late 1980s the Theodore Fried Trust was established for the Fried's artwork and to commemorate the anniversary of his birth in 2002, an exhibition was held at the Madelyn Jordon Fine Art Gallery, Scarsdale, NY, Theodore Fried – A Centennial Retrospective. Following this, Fried's archive and paintings belonging to the trust were deposited with the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which mounted an exhibition of his works Theodore Fried: Survival of a Jewish Artist in 2006.

It was aired on June 24, 2013. The episode was written by Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer and it was directed by Todd Slavkin. The names of the first season episodes have all been names of songs, albums or films. This title is also the name of a novel and movie, The Bride Wore Black. Plot The episode starts with the bachelor party of Alak (Jesse Rath), where a dead body (skeleton) is discovered by accident but no one knows who it is. Tommy (Dewshane Williams) recognizes the body by the ring the dead man was wearing and identifies him as Hunter Bell (Brendan McCarthy), the previous owner of the Need/Want bar and abusive husband of Kenya (Mia Kirshner), who went missing seven years ago. Nolan's (Grant Bowler) first suspicions go to Amanda (Julie Benz) and Kenya and for that reason he wants to let the case go but Tommy, who was helped in the past by Hunter Bell, does not want that. He goes back to the place where the skeleton was found to search for any missing clues and Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) joins him in his research. The two of them discover hair of Liberata in the scene and they immediately suspect the barman of Need/Want, Jered (Jessica Nichols), who was working in the bar back then when Hunter Bell disappeared. Tommy and Irisa go to Jered's home to question him but they find him dead. From the way he was killed, they suspect that Datak (Tony Curran) is behind the murder who probably killed Jered because he knew something and did not want him to talk. Nolan arrests Datak but soon lets him free. Knowing Datak and how he acts, Nolan never believed he was the murderer and he only arrested him so he can lead them to the real killer. In the meantime, via flashbacks, we find out that Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan) is not a human but an Indogene disguised as a human. Hunter Bell had witnessed one of her meetings with Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) and Nicky, not wanting him to expose her, she killed him. Jered witnessed the murder and now that the dead body was found, Nicky killed him too so he will not talk. When Yewll finds out about Jered's murder, she realizes that Nicky is out of control and that she is not acting “for the greater good” anymore, as she was always saying. Yewll kills Nicky (by lethal injection) because it is the only way to stop her. Later, Nolan and Tommy find her body in her car—Yewll made it look like a suicide—with a note that Nicky supposedly wrote, confessing to both murders. Meanwhile, Rafe (Graham Greene) realizes why Datak gave his permission to Alak to marry Christie (Nicole Muñoz) and he lets him know that after his death the mines are not going to Christie but to the Iraths. Datak, after hearing that, wants to cut off the wedding. When he tells Alak, Alak goes to Christie's house to let her know about his dad changing his mind. After having a talk with Rafe, Alak decides not to cut off the wedding. The episode ends with the wedding and Nolan and Tommy solving the murder case by finding Nicky's body. Now that Nicki is dead, Yewll is the one who has the artifact and she hides it so no one can find it.

His death made international headlines when Aaron Hernandez, at the time a tight end for the New England Patriots of the National Football League, was investigated as a suspect in the case. Lloyd had been a linebacker for a New England Football League (NEFL) semi-professional football team, the Boston Bandits, since 2007. Hernandez was arrested on June 26, 2013, and charged with the murder. Ninety minutes after his arrest, Hernandez was released by the Patriots. Police also arrested two other men in connection with Lloyd's death: Carlos Ortiz on June 27, 2013, and Ernest Wallace on June 28, 2013. Prosecutors say both men were with Hernandez when they drove to the location of the murder. On August 22, 2013, Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Odin Lloyd. Nearly eight months later, Ortiz and Wallace were also indicted for the murder. On April 15, 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder, as well as five weapon charges, which required a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was tried for two separate murder charges for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, but was acquitted of these charges on April 14, 2017. On May 12, 2016, Wallace was acquitted of first-degree murder of Lloyd, but was convicted of being an accessory after the fact of the crime; he was sentenced to serve four and a half to seven years in prison. On June 27, 2016, Ortiz changed his 'not guilty' plea and pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against Ortiz. He was also sentenced to serve four and a half to seven years in prison. On April 19, 2017, at 3:05 am, Hernandez was found dead in his prison cell by correctional officers after apparently hanging himself with a bedsheet. By killing himself before the appeal of his case could be completed, Hernandez's murder conviction was vacated, technically returning him to a state of innocent until proven guilty. The court's decision to vacate was appealed by the prosecutors and the Lloyd family's attorneys. In March, 2019 the Mass. Supreme Court overturned the entire doctrine of abatement ab initio, thus reinstating his original murder conviction.  Background  Odin Leonardo John Lloyd was born in Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and spent a few years with his family in Antigua, before they moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts.N.F.L. Star and Murder Victim: Where Diverse Paths Crossed New York TimesOn Fayston Street, Odin Lloyd was their star Boston.com He was the first-born child and only son of Ursula Ward. Lloyd is survived by at least one sister, Olivia Thibou. He is survived by a maternal uncle, who said that he had last seen Lloyd on the Sunday before his death. A neighbor, who described himself as \\"a regular at a nearby park where Lloyd would go to work out — not hang out,\\" described Lloyd as usually keeping to himself. Citing Lloyd's physical condition, the neighbor said, \\"Of everybody on this street, he was the one who could take care of himself…So there had to be some shaky stuff if he was the guy killed.\\" Lloyd was a linebacker for the Boston Bandits, a semi-pro football team. He had played for the team since 2007. At the time of his death, Odin Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, sister of the fiancée of Aaron Hernandez.  Death and investigation  Aaron Hernandez was convicted of Lloyd's murder On June 17, 2013, Lloyd was shot and killed in an industrial park located one mile from Hernandez's house. On June 16, the night before Lloyd's death, Hernandez texted two friends from his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut asking them to come to Massachusetts, writing, \\"You can't trust anyone anymore.\\" In the early morning hours of June 17, Lloyd was riding as a passenger in Hernandez's car; he texted his sister, \\"Did you see who I am with?\\" and when his sister responded, he replied, \\"Nfl.\\" Lloyd's last text to his sister read, \\"Just so you know.\\" His sister later said that she had thought he was bragging. Based on an upheld defendant's attorney objection, the court dismissed the texts as testimony, saying there was insufficient evidence that Lloyd feared for his life. Prosecutors reportedly said that Lloyd and Hernandez were in contact just 10 hours before his death, concerning a bag of marijuana. Furthermore, keys to a car that had been rented by Hernandez were allegedly found in Lloyd's pocket. Prosecutors believe Lloyd recently said something to Hernandez that destroyed his trust, giving Hernandez a motive to kill. On June 18, 2013, police searched Hernandez's house in North Attleboro for several hours. The Massachusetts State Police obtained a search warrant after evidence surfaced that Hernandez had intentionally destroyed his home security system. A cell phone belonging to Hernandez was turned over to police \\"in pieces\\", and Hernandez allegedly hired a \\"team of house cleaners\\" the same day Lloyd's body was discovered, raising additional suspicion. In the wake of Lloyd's death, the Boston Bandits released a statement: \\"The Bandits would like to extend our deepest condolences to Odin's family and his loved ones. He will be deeply missed by his football family but we promise to persevere and play the game that Odin loved in his honor\\" and \\"the Boston Bandits are cooperating with local and state police in their efforts to identify the person responsible for Odin Lloyd's death\\".  Charges and trial  On June 26, 2013, Hernandez was arrested at his home and charged with first-degree murder, one count of carrying a firearm without a license, two counts of possessing a large- capacity firearm, and two counts of possessing a firearm without a firearm identification card. The first-degree murder charge required a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, as Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1984. Hernandez was held without bail at the Bristol County, Massachusetts, Jail and House of Correction. On June 27 and 28, 2013, respectively, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace were also arrested in connection with Lloyd's death. Ortiz told police that Hernandez had rented an apartment secretly in Franklin, Massachusetts. As reported by the Associated Press, a subsequent search of the apartment \\"turned up ammunition and clothing that police believe could be evidence in the murder case against him\\". Ortiz was held on $500,000 bail. On September 27, 2013, Ortiz was indicted on a single count of accessory to murder after the fact in the killing of Lloyd. In addition, Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and his cousin, Tanya Cummings Singleton, were charged as accessories to murder for their suspected involvement in assisting Hernandez after he killed Lloyd. On August 22, 2013, Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Odin Lloyd. On January 29, 2015, the trial began in Fall River, Massachusetts with opening statements by prosecuting attorney Patrick Bomberg and defense attorney Michael Fee. Judge E. Susan Garsh presided. The trial was expected to take about ten weeks. The trial was delayed on a few occasions as a result of the unprecedented snowfall in Greater Boston. In opening statements, prosecutors said Hernandez's DNA was found at the murder scene. On April 9, 2015, a photographer for NBC affiliate WHDH (TV) was banned from reporting and taking pictures at the trial as one of their news trucks had followed the jury van the previous day. In closing statements, in light of substantial physical evidence provided by the prosecution, the defense admitted to Hernandez being present during the murder, but downplayed his role. Defense said that he was an unwilling participant who \\"was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something. A shocking killing, committed by someone he knew. He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other.\\"Commonwealth vs Aaron Hernandez BRCR 2013-0983 On April 15, 2015, Aaron Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder and all weapons charges, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/15/us/aaron- hernandez-verdict/ Immediately following the conviction, Hernandez was temporarily transferred to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction, a maximum security intake facility to begin serving his sentence. (It is located 1.5 miles from Gillette Stadium, where he formerly played.) He was transferred to serve the remainder of his life sentence at the Souza- Baranowski Correctional Center, a maximum-security facility adjacent to the medium-security Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Shirley. Wallace was acquitted of charges of murder on May 12, 2016, but convicted of being an accessory after the fact. He was sentenced to four-and-one-half to seven years in prison. On April 19, 2017, at around 3:05 am, Hernandez was found hanging in his prison cell. His death was ruled a suicide. Hernandez's attorneys successfully requested that his murder conviction be vacated due to the legal principle of abatement ab initio: if a convicted criminal has not exhausted all legal appeals at the time of his death, a guilty verdict may be officially vacated. His conviction was reinstated in 2019 following an appeal from prosecutors and the Lloyd family. After being convicted in the Lloyd murder, Hernandez was accused of the 2012 shooting deaths of Boston residents Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado. Attorney Jose Baez represented Hernandez in the murder trial, which resulted in a not guilty verdict. Baez wrote in his 2018 book Unnecessary RoughnessBaez, Jose with Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez and George Willis (2018). Unnecessary Roughness: Inside the Trial and Final Days of Aaron Hernandez. Hachette, 1602866074 that he and Hernandez planned an appeal in the Lloyd case. Baez believed Hernandez made poor choices in associating with criminals, but was not a murderer. He noted that Hernandez did not flee the area after the Lloyd murder and was compliant with every police interview and warrant before his arrest. Baez contended an appeal had a strong chance of success, given what he characterized as weaknesses in the prosecution cases that were overlooked by the initial lawyers and Judge Garsh's comments during a bail hearing that Hernandez appeared to be guilty (a possible violation of presumption of innocence).  Timeline of events  * July 16, 2012 – Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado are killed by gunshots fired into their vehicle in Boston's South End after leaving Cure Nightclub.

As a follow-up to this renovation, in 2009, the Pope John II Family Academy opened at the church. The school is extremely successful, its enrollment is full, and it has a long waiting list. Currently, St. Barbara's Parish is one of the most vibrant churches in Brooklyn. According to Father Fulgencio Gutierrez, the current pastor and head chaplain, when the church bell peals on Sunday, every bilingual mass in St. Barbara's is now standing room only. In the wake of the devastation by Hurricane Maria, Nieves has spearheaded HITN’s relief efforts in Puerto Rico and has also, in keeping with HITN’s focus on education, community, and economic and cultural development, HITN launched its new series, Puerto Rico Contigo. The series’ thirteen thirty-minute episodes, airing both in Puerto Rico and in the continental United States, present Puerto Rico’s economic situation with diverse perspectives from small and larger businesses, nonprofit organizations, and civic and government agencies, with interviews of men and women whose creativity and resilience serve as models and inspiration for further rebuilding of the Puerto Rican economy. The series Puerto Rico Contigo has begun to air due to a new partnership between HITN and the Puerto Rico Public Broadcasting Corporation (WIPR). Government Career City Hall of New York For over 25 years, Nieves has helped build the political landscape in New York by serving as strategic and policy advisor and consultant to numerous elected officials and campaigns across New York City and New York State. Campaigns have included the elections of state and city representatives, borough presidents, members of Congress, and judicial candidates. Among those Nieves served are Assemblyman and former Bronx Democratic leader José Rivera, Majority Leader Joel Rivera, Assemblyman Nelson Denis, former Congressman Charles Rangel (D-NY), New York City Civil Court Judge Lisa Headley, and Transit Workers Union Local 100. In 2015, Mr. Nieves served as a key strategic advisor to the Jesus “Chuy” Garcia campaign in Chicago, which resulted in Chicago’s first-ever run-off election for the mayoralty. He has also served as an advisor on educational policy to the government of Puerto Rico. As deputy chief of staff to three successive New York City Council speakers, Nieves assisted Council Members with the development of thousands of new affordable housing units throughout New York City, and the creation of hundreds of job initiatives throughout the five boroughs. As Director of State and Federal Affairs, Nieves served as the liaison between the New York City Council and the Governor's Office of the State of New York, and the New York State Legislature. In this capacity, Nieves was also the principal lobbyist for the New York City Council concerning all home-rule legislation and all State-related matters. Before serving as Director of State and Federal Affairs, Nieves was the Deputy Director for Council Services, where he was responsible for overseeing the administrative functions and internal budget of the New York City Council and its 51 Council Members. As a long-time community school board member and co- founder of the New Beginnings Charter School, Nieves also advised the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the New York City Council, on a broad spectrum of educational issues. Nieves was also the long-term adviser to Assemblyman José Rivera, who was also the Democratic County Leader of the Bronx.New York Daily News, Bronx ex-Democratic party boss Jose Rivera in full court press Retrieved 06-26-2013.New York Daily News Retrieved 06-26-2013. New York City Council Campaign In 2013, Nieves announced his candidacy for the New York City Council for the 37th district of Brooklyn – encompassing Bushwick; Cypress Hills; and portions of East New York, Ocean-Hill, Brownsville and Wyckoff Heights. After raising approximately $23,000, Nieves announced he was dropping out of the race. When the required signatures for being placed on the ballot were challenged, he stated the money he raised had been exhausted due to lawyer fees associated with fighting the challenge. Political Consulting Among Latino elected officials, Mr. Nieves is renowned for his expertise in political strategy, public policy, and election law. From 1989 to 1999, prior to his government service, he was principal and owner of Nieves Associates, a consulting firm instrumental in advising and consulting to Latino and other candidates and elected officials. From 2010 to 2015, he was CEO of Michael Nieves Consulting, continuing to share his expertise with both candidates and elected officials. Mr. Nieves is hailed by many as one of the top Latino political operatives in the State of New York. He has also served as an advisor on educational policy to the government of Puerto Rico. Honors and Recognition His community involvements include the boards of the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture in Chicago, National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, SOMOS New York, New York City Public Schools Community School Board #32, and the New York Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. Nieves was listed as an honoree of City and State’s 50 over Fifty and was awarded “Hero of the Month” by Brooklyn Borough President Eric L.

It is measured by upside beta. An alternative measure of upside risk is the upper semi- deviation. Upside risk is calculated using data only from days when the benchmark (for example S&P; 500 Index) has gone up. Upside risk focuses on uncertain positive returns rather than negative returns. For this reason, upside risk, while a measure of unpredictability of the extent of gains, is not a “risk” in the sense of a possibility of adverse outcomes. Upside risk vs. Capital Asset Pricing Model Looking at upside risk and downside risk separately provides much more useful information to investors than does only looking at the single Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) beta. The comparison of upside to downside risk is necessary because “modern portfolio theory measures risk in terms of standard deviation of asset returns, which treats both positive and negative deviations from expected returns as risk.” In other words, regular beta measures both upside and downside risk. This is a major distinction that the CAPM fails to take into account, because the model assumes that upside beta and downside beta are the same. In reality, they are seldom the same, and making the distinction between upside and downside risk is necessary and important.

Licht was born in village Sokolovac, near Koprivnica to a Croatian Jewish family. As a child he moved with his family to Zagreb. Licht was educated in Zagreb where he finished elementary and high school. He graduated as a lawyer at the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. In 1909 he was promoted to a Doctor of law at the University of Zagreb. In 1913 he opened a law firm in Zagreb, but in 1914 he was drafted to an Austro- Hungarian Army. Upon completing military service, Licht returned to Zagreb where he practiced law at his firm. He was the founder and spiritual leader of Zionism in Croatia. As a young man he was elected chairman of the Jewish youth circle \\"Literarni Sastanci\\" (Literary Meetings), which soon became a Zionist society. He was also the editor of \\"Židovska smotra\\" (The Jewish review). In Vienna he was the chairman of \\"Bar Giora\\", a group of Zionist students from Yugoslavia. After its foundation, in 1909, he was the elected secretary of the \\"Zionist federation of South Slavic countries\\". In 1919 he was one of the leading Zionists, with Šime Spitzer, who founded the \\"Union of the Jewish confessional municipalities in the Kingdom of SHS\\" (Savez jevrejskih vjeroispovjednih općina u Kraljevini SHS) in Zagreb. In 1919 Licht also helped to found the \\"Zionist federation of Yugoslavia\\" (SCJ - Savez cionista Jugoslavije) in Zagreb, where Licht first served as a secretary and later as an elected president. He also befriend with Croatian politician Frano Supilo. Under Licht leadership Zagreb was the strongest Zionist center in the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was also the only Zionist from Yugoslavia lands who was a member of the action committee of the World Zionist Congress. Lich was the founder of the so-called \\"Zagreb school\\" of Zionism which represented uncompromised and radical Zionism. Under his leadership Croatian Zionists, through the years, raised over 50-60% of total funds collected in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia for the Jewish National Fund. Although he was not a wealthy person, Licht was great philanthropist who often aided various Zagreb, students, sport and charitable societies. Licht was among the financiers who funded the \\"Society for building a monument of Tomislav of Croatia\\". Licht believed that the major hate toward the Jews in Croatia was spread by the Serbian press in Croatia, and that some Serbs have antisemitism in a depth of their soul. During the 1930s riots in the Mandatory Palestine, Licht always advocated peaceful solution over armed conflict. Licht openly criticized the rising wave of antisemitism in Nazi Germany and Soviet Union during the 1930s. During World War II Licht was arrested by Gestapo with the other notable Zagreb Jews like; Hinko Gotlieb, Lavoslav Šik, Slavko Mayer, Robert Deutsch- Maceljski (of a notable Deutsch-Maceljski family), Branko Alexander (of a notable Alexander family) and others. All of them were taken to Graz, Austria where they were questioned about the Croatian Jewish community. They all were soon released except Mayer who was never seen again. Upon his return to Zagreb, Licht managed to get his identity document back and soon escaped to Slovenia. From Slovenia Licht emigrated to Switzerland through Italy in Autumn, 1943. In Switzerland, at first, he was placed in the refugee camp. With the Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović help, Licht soon found the permanent residence. While in Switzerland Licht actively collected the financial aid for the Zagreb Jewish community which was then transmitted to Zagreb by various channels. Licht died in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 June 1948 as one of the rare Croatian Jews who managed to survive the Holocaust. His body was moved from Switzerland to Land of Israel where he was buried in 1955.

Works =Junior Scientist Power Hour= Junior Scientist Power Hour was a weekly episodic webcomic by Howard, usually focusing on topics such as her daily life and parodies of pop culture. From the Facebook page, \\"it's about her incredibly interesting life with her cat, and sometimes it is also about other things.\\" The panels tend to be hand-drawn black and white; however, there is one notable exception. The band members in the strip “Tupper Ware Remix Party”http://www.jspowerhour.com/comics/10 are brightly colored and subsequent strips featuring them are in color as well. Abby's art style is influenced by that of Jhonen Vasquez. She was especially influenced by his comic Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. Howard describes herself primarily as a traditional artist, but she does use digital art for coloring panels. =Strip Search= Howard was selected as one of the twelve contestants for Penny Arcade's webcomic based reality competition show Strip Search. She was the only contestant who competed using traditional media. Howard built up a following, who called themselves “Team Tangent.” =The Last Halloween= After competing in Strip Search, Howard created a Kickstarter for her next project, The Last Halloween. It was pitched as an episodic horror-comedy comic, and was crowdfunded within 20 minutes. The Kickstarter raised $126,507 of the $9,000 goal. The Last Halloween began October 8, 2013 (September 18, 2013 for Kickstarter backers). While the art style is similar to Junior Scientist Power Hour, it features more detailed illustrations, locations, and a continuing story. The comic is influenced by horror films, which Howard is admittedly a fan of. The story follows a young girl named Mona who finds herself tasked with saving the world when billions of monsters suddenly spill into the human world one Halloween night. Howard first conceptualized the story in high school, and pitched it for the finale of Strip Search. Although she lost, she chose to launch a Kickstarter for it anyway, and was successful. She describes her comic as partly being a response to uninspiring horror media, such as bland male power fantasies with uncreative monsters and hollow plots. Howard has the entire story written out in advance; she prefers this method of story-telling, as she can insert Easter eggs and foreshadowing. =Other= Howard created the 2016 comic The Portrait of Sal Pullman with writer Lonnie Nadler. She wrote and illustrated the graphic novel Dinosaur Empire!, a volume in the Earth Before Us series from Abrams Books, published August 1st, 2017. Howard co-hosted horror podcast Scared Yet? with cartoonist Kris Straub in 2016 from July to December. Lasting 6 episodes, Straub and Howard discussed horror storytelling, writing advice, personal favorite horror stories, as well as personal experiences with writing horror.  Awards  Howard was nominated for the 2020 Cartoonist Studio Prize in the Best Web Comic category for her work Unhealthy.

Only 18 buses were completed before the series was cancelled. The last Zawrat bus remained in service in Warsaw until 1949. The bus was based on a license-built chassis of the Saurer 3CT1D bus designed by Swiss Saurer company and a six-cylinder Saurer BLD engine, also license-built in Poland. The license for the chassis was bought in 1932 and initially 70 Saurer 3CT1D buses were completed entirely of Swiss-made parts. Until 1934 additional 43 chassis were completed, partially of parts produced in Poland. Some of those were finished with bus bodies, others were converted to 5-tonne lorries for the Polish Army. In 1936 the PZInż designed a new all-metal body for the Saurer 3CT1D and named the new bus \\"Zawrat\\" after the pass in Tatra Mountains. The bus had two doors and seats for 50 passengers. In line with other buses of pre-war construction, the rear doors were used for entry to the vehicle. However, unlike all previous wooden-built buses used or tested in Warsaw (such as Büssing 650 TU, Somua SIX or Chevrolet EFD FS 183) the Zawrat had a completely closed passenger cabin, without an open platform at the rear. The first 12 buses were delivered to Warsaw in 1936 and on 13 July 1936 the first new \\"T\\" line started to operate them. By the end of the next year 6 additional buses were delivered, which allowed for creation or extension of five new bus lines. While spacious, the type proved cumbersome to operate. The chassis proved too rigid, making turning in the narrow streets of downtown Warsaw a difficult task. Also the diesel engine proved too loud. Because of that already in 1938 the Zawrat buses were relegated to suburban service, where their disadvantages were less of a problem. During World War II most of Warsaw's Zawrat buses were mobilised by the army and eventually destroyed. Some bodies of Zawrat still in Warsaw were converted in 1943 to makeshift tramway cars as the Germans stole much of the fleet of Warsaw Tramways. The last surviving Zawrat (body number 53) was returned to service after the war and served in the ruined city until 1949.

Like most of the officer ranks in the Royal Army, it was dominated by nobles. High-ranking nobles entering military service during their teenage years would serve in the rank at ages as young as 15 or 16 years old before rapidly being promoted. One such example was Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon, who joined the Régiment du Roi (King's Regiment) in 1734, aged 16, as a lieutenant en second before being promoted the following year to lieutenant en premier. Lesser nobles would stay in the rank for longer, while the few commoners who had been able to become officer of fortune might remain as lieutenants en second until they died or retired. The rank of Lieutenant en second was also used in the British army during the eighteenth century. The origin of the rank seems to have arisen from the need to support the responsibilities of those in higher ranks. Each of a regiment's field officers — its Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, and Major — originally commanded their own Companies, as well as carrying out their regimental duties. It became the practice for the Colonel's and Lieutenant Colonel's companies to include one or two additional officers with the rank of Lieutenant a pied and/or Lieutenant en second. Regiments' organisation varied, and was changed from time to time.O' Conor, M. Military history of the Irish nation. Dublin: Hodges and Smith. 1845.

His dates of birth and death are unknown. Kossior was born in Koło, then went to Poznań, where in 1575 he appeared before the City Council to complain against the local painter's guild. The City Council hosted a performance by the artist featuring an image of Madonna and Child. In the years 1579-1595 he was a senior member to several painters' guilds, the Department of Crafts, and bookbinders group. He was a well known and respected artist, and his art earned him a small property in the Poznan. At the end he also lived and worked in Kłecko, where the painter did an altarpiece for the church in Kłecko. Kossior was influenced by Dutch and Italian paintings. Patrons of the artist included the noble family Czarnkowscy. The artist had four children: Eve (wife of James Goldsmith Poznan Staniewski, then a goldsmith Thomas Pełka), Stanislaus, Barbara and Hedwig. Son Stanislaw Kossior (Kossiorowicz) (d. 1626) was also a painter, and in the years 1610 and 1617 he was a member of the painters' guild in Poznan, and painted the high altar in Szamotuły.

Males average 65–90 kg in weight, females 53–70 kg, while for other reindeer generally body mass is 159–182 kg for males and 80–120 kg for females.Caribou at the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. Adfg.state.ak.us. Retrieved on 16 September 2011. The subspecies is endemic to the islands of Svalbard, where it has lived for at least 5,000 years, and has become well adapted to the harsh climate, being found on nearly all non-glaciated areas of the archipelago. By 1925 they had almost gone extinct due to over-hunting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Over recent decades their population has increased. As of 2019 the total population across the archipelago is approximately 22,000. They are the only large grazing mammal in the European High Arctic, and this makes them exceptional for studies concerning the introduction of pollutants to changing ecosystems. During the short Arctic summer, Svalbard reindeer feed on a lush tundra vegetation of vascular plants, including grasses, herbs, sedges and deciduous shrubs in the lowland plains and valleys, to accumulate fat for the winter. The fur of Svalbard Reindeer contains elements and chemicals picked up from the vegetation they digest. They are relatively sedentary, and are thus highly vulnerable to changes in local conditions.Pacyna, A., Koziorowska, K., Chmiel, S., Mazerski, J., & Polkowska, Z. (2018). Svalbard reindeer as an indicator of ecosystem changes in the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem. Chemosphere, 203, 209-218. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.158 Compared to other reindeer, they are short-legged and have a small, rounded head. Their fur is also lighter in colour and thicker during winter. The thickness of the coat contributes to the short-legged appearance and makes even starved animals appear fat in the winter. The males develop large antlers during the period from April to July and shed the velvet during August–September. Males lose their antlers in early winter. Females develop antlers starting in June and they are usually retained for a whole year.

This leads to the following set of informal competency questions: :* Temporal projection - Given a set of actions that occur at different points in the future, what are the properties of resources and activities at arbitrary points in time? :* Planning and scheduling - what sequence of activities must be completed to achieve some goal? At what times must these activities be initiated and terminated? :* Execution monitoring and external events - What are the effects of the occurrence of external and unexpected events (such as machine breakdown or the unavailability of resources) on a plan or schedule? :* Time-based competition - we want to design an enterprise that minimizes the cycle time for a product. This is essentially the task of finding a minimum duration plan that minimizes action occurrences and maximizes concurrency of activities.Michael Grüninger and Mark S.

The series is executive produced by Howard Schultz, Brady Connell and Rob LaPlante. Jeff Spangler serves as the co- executive producer of the series. In each episode of 72 Hours, three new competing teams of strangers are dropped in the complete wilderness where they are given very few essential items to survive. The teams must travel through harsh environments, such as dangerous wildlife or insect infestations for 72 hours to find a hidden briefcase that contains $100,000. The team that finds the briefcase are the winners of the competition and they receive the $100,000 cash prize. Premise Each episode in the series introduces new groups of strangers who are dropped off in a remote location. Each episode has a different location. For example, one episode takes place in the American Southwest and another episode takes place in the island of Hawaii. Once the teams are dropped at a location, they are supplied with only a single bottle of water and a GPS tracking device. The goal of the competition is to survive and travel through harsh and dangerous environments, such as dangerous wildlife or insect infestations to find a hidden briefcase containing $100,000.

The mast was secured to the rear with a backstay that led to the foremast of the ship. The hoisting and hauling the spritsail top sail had to be done by a man standing on the spritsail platform without the security of any safety net. That the hauling of the sail usually had to be done specifically as the weather was turning bad meant that the task was particularly dangerous. When the implementation of the jib sail necessitated the removal of this topmast, few would mourn its passing. By the middle of the eighteenth century shipbuilders began using jibs to do the same job as the spritsail topmast with greater efficiency and less risk to human life. The stays for the jib sails made the spritsail top both irrelevant and inconvenient. By 1720 it ceased to be incorporated into new ship designs. Its place was taken by the jibboom, and its function and stay were replaced with the dolphin striker stay.

The Abbottabad Commission Report is a judicial inquiry paper authored and submitted by the Abbottabad Commission, led by Justice Javaid Iqbal, to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on 4 January 2013. The report investigates the circumstances surrounding the death of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. Upon submission, the report was immediately classified by the Prime Minister and its findings were not made public. Indicated by the media, the report compiled the 700 pages, which lists some 200 recommendations after interviewing over 300 witnesses and scrutinising more than 3,000 documents pertaining to the raid by US special operations forces to kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. In response to American unilateral actions, the government formed the commission which was to find out exactly what happened and who was responsible for failing to catch the high-profile target, who had taken refuge in Abbottabad. In 2013, parts of the reports published by the news channels in the country and most of the findings of the said report were leaked to the press and were strongly criticised by defence experts. The government then classified all of its publications despite American reservations and concerns, but the report was released by Al Jazeera on 8 July 2013. Background In 2011, the United States took unilateral actions to target and kill al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, who was reportedly in hiding in Abottabad, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. After much criticism, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani formed the commission under Senior Justice Javed Iqbal. Soon after conducting session interviews, Senior Justice Iqbal announced that Abbottabad Commission report will be made public in a few weeks. Despite Iqbal's claims, the commission did not release the report and its preparation period further prolonged to next years. In 2012, the Pakistani Ministry of Justice (MoJ) issued a notification to the commission on asking to complete its investigation and submit the report on 12 October 2012. Parts of the report duly recommended a trial against the medical doctor-turned spy, Dr. Shakil Afridi. Asked by a journalist for delaying of the report, Senior Justice Iqbal maintained that the presence of CIA in Pakistan is also being investigated, adding that it would be mentioned in the report. To another question by a journalist as to whether the person killed in the compound in Abbottabad was Osama bin Laden, Justice Javed Iqbal quoted: If we tell you that what's left.... You'll find out soon.\\" Contents Revealed by the British Daily Telegraph, the papers ultimately cleared the Government, armed forces, the establishment, and intelligence services of involvement in protection of the al-Qaeda chief. American literary political critics have accused Pakistan officials of knowing more about Bin Laden's presence than they were letting on. United States had been long demanding Pakistan to declassify the papers of the reports, maintaining that it is important for the Pakistani and American public to see the report of Abbottabad Commission. All request had been dismissed by the Government of Pakistan. =Classified status= Before the full submission of the papers in 2013, only a few parts of the papers were obtained by the World News channel of Pakistan and televised it all over the nation in 2012. Following the broadcast, the US State Department declined to comment on the report. In an official press briefing to media, the US State Department maintained that \\"U.S. shares with Pakistan a \\"profound\\" interest in learning about what kind of support network al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden might have had during his hiding but would only comment on the Abbottabad Commission's findings on the issue when it gets the actual report.\\" Sensing the impact on the military, the defence authors had had earlier hinted to media that the papers would be marked as classified expect little of substance to be revealed. Excerpts leaked to the press from the yet-to-be-made-public report differed with the American account of the incident. In January 2013, the final report was submitted to Prime Minister Pervez Ashraf to review the papers. After briefly reviewing the papers, Prime Minister Ashraf classified the publications of the report before leaving the office. =Al Jazeera report leak= The report of the Abbottabad Commission, formed in June 2011 to probe the circumstances around the killing of Osama bin Laden by American forces in a unilateral raid on the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, was leaked by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit on 8 July 2013, after being suppressed by the Pakistani government. The report drew on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, including members of Bin Laden's family, Pakistan's then spy chief Ahmad Shuja Pasha, senior ministers in the government and officials at every level of the military, bureaucracy and security services. The four-member Abbottabad Commission interviewed 201 people, including the country's intelligence leaders, in an effort to piece together the events around the American raid on 2 May 2011, that killed Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and embarrassed the Pakistani government. The commission was led by Justice Javed Iqbal of the Pakistani Supreme Court, a retired police officer, a diplomat and an army general. It first met in July 2011, two months after the American raid, and has held 52 hearings and conducted seven field visits. Osama bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for nine years due to the \\"collective failure\\" of state military and intelligence authorities and \\"routine\\" incompetence at every level of civil governance structure allowed the once world's most wanted man to move to six different locations within the country. The Commission's 336-page report is scathing, holding both the government and the military responsible for \\"gross incompetence\\" leading to \\"collective failures\\" that allowed both Bin Laden to escape detection, and the United States to perpetrate \\"an act of war\\". It found that Pakistan's intelligence establishment had \\"closed the book\\" on bin Laden by 2005, and was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture. The Abbottabad Commission report blasted the Pakistani government and military for a \\"national disaster\\" over its handling of bin Laden and calls on the leadership to apologise to the people of Pakistan for their \\"dereliction of duty.\\" The document repeatedly returned to what it describes as \\"government implosion syndrome\\" to explain the failure of any institution to investigate Bin Laden's unusual hideout. \\"It is a glaring testimony to the collective incompetence and negligence, at the very least, of the security and intelligence community in the Abbottabad area,\\" said the report. \\"How the entire neighbourhood, local officials, police and security and intelligence officials all missed the size, the strange shape, the barbed wire, the lack of cars and visitors ... over a period of nearly six years beggars belief,\\" it said. The report said that Bin Laden must have required a support network \\"that could not possibly have been confined to the two Pashtun brothers who worked as his couriers, security guards and general factotums\\". The report said: \\"Over a period of time an effective intelligence agency should have been able to contact, infiltrate or co-opt them and to develop a whole caseload of information. Apparently, this was not the case.\\" The commission didn't rule out the possibility of involvement by rogue Pakistani intelligence officers, who have been accused of deliberately shielding Bin Laden by some commentators. \\"Given the length of stay and the changes of residence of [Bin Laden] and his family in Pakistan ... the possibility of some such direct or indirect and \\"plausibly deniable\\" support cannot be ruled out, at least, at some level outside formal structures of the intelligence establishment.\\" \\"Connivance, collaboration and cooperation at some levels cannot be entirely discounted,\\" it said. The commission made several findings. Among these include: * Osama bin Laden entered Pakistan in mid-2002 after narrowly escaping capture in the battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan. Over nine years, he moved to various places inside the country, including South Waziristan and northern Swat Valley. * In Swat, the al-Qaeda leader reportedly met with Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, in early 2003. About a month later, KSM was captured in Rawalpindi in a joint US- Pakistani operation, and bin Laden fled the area. * Osama bin Laden, along with two of his wives and several children and grandchildren, moved into the custom-built compound in Abbottabad, a military garrison town, in 2005 and lived there until the US raid. * Osama bin Laden was very concerned about surveillance. The report says bin Laden wore a cowboy hat outside to avoid detection from above and considered buying and cutting down a row of poplar trees on the perimeter of the Abbottabad compound because he thought it might provide cover for observers. * The presence of a CIA support network to help track down bin Laden without the Pakistani establishment's knowledge was \\"a case of nothing less than a collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military and intelligence leadership of the country.\\" With respect to the death of bin Laden at the hands of US Navy SEALs, the report concluded: The Pakistani military's inability to prevent an American incursion into its airspace was described as the country's greatest \\"humiliation\\" since 1971, when Indian forces routed Pakistan in a war that led to the creation of the present-day state of Bangladesh, according to the report. Despite American assurances that US forces would enter Pakistan if they thought they could capture Osama bin Laden, Pakistani air defences were set to a \\"peace time mode\\" when American helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace, the report stated. The report didn't name the persons responsible for the failures in the hunt for bin Laden as well as the American intrusion into Pakistan and said that it may be politically unrealistic to suggest punishments for them, but \\"as honourable men, they ought to do the honourable thing, including submitting a formal apology to the nation for their dereliction of duty.\\" References Category:2013 documents *Report Category:Classified documents Category:Government of Pakistan secrecy Category:Reports of the Government of Pakistan Category:War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:2013 in Pakistan ","title":"Abbottabad Commission Report"},{"id":"39788844","text":"Domo del Mar is a 4,000-seat indoor arena located in Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche,[Ciudad de CarmenProyectos at skyscrapercity.com] used primarily for concerts, sporting events, lucha libre, graduation ceremonies and other special events.

Born in Sangesar, Semnan Province. Sabeti received a law degree from the University of Tehran and joined the SAVAK, Iran's intelligence agency in Shah's regime, in 1957, and quickly rose to become the acting director of the SAVAK's so-called third division—its political directorate—and later its director.  Biography  He has been called one of the most powerful men in the last two decades of the Pahlavi regime.Milani, Abbas. Eminent persians. Parviz Sabeti. Syracuse University Press, 2008. Historian Abbas Milani describes him as \\"like a character from a le Carré novel\\" and says that \\"As his fame and reputation grew, his name and face disappeared from the public domain.\\" Mr. Parviz Sabeti graduated from the Law School of the University of Tehran. He was initially hired as a Judge in the Ministry of Justice. Having shown a keen interest in public policy and politics he was recruited into the SAVAK, which was part of the Prime Minister's office, in 1959. This was a time when a new policy of introducing civilians into an organization staffed by primarily ex-military rank and file was introduced. Initially, he worked as a political analyst in the department of internal security and very soon became the head of political analysis where he was in charge of preparing and writing daily, periodical and special reports which went ultimately via the chain of command to the Shah of Iran.Ahmad Farasati Although Mr. Sabeti was philosophically against Marxism and radical Islam, he believed that arresting and prosecuting members of such groups should not be the only course of action. The cycle of actions and reactions of dissent, revolt, then crackdown would continue until the government, through substantial reforms, attempted to remove the roots of dissatisfactions and create more room for the participation of people in the political system. Impressions by the Shah towards Parviz Sabeti had changed by the late 1970s when Sabeti, as the de facto security advisor to the Prime Minister and spokesman for the government, provided a long and impressive TV interview exposing the plots by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein against Iran, with the collusion of internal enemies of the Shah. He continued to provide two more such interviews exposing the tactics of two major opposition groups, one Communist and one Islamic-Marxist. None of this undid however the fact that he was the only civilian leader to have reached a leadership position at SAVAK, with the inevitable friction with the more hard-line, one dimensional attitude of those with a military background. One example being his differences with General Nassiri who was chief of SAVAK and deputy Prime Minister for 14 years. Nassiri who was a loyal soldier for the Shah, very often had clashes with Sabeti. Sabeti and his family fled Iran after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.Muhammad Sahimi, Parviz Sabeti and the Murder of Political Prisoners under the Shah, PBS Frontline (May 4, 2012).

The collage includes some 1,600 photos taken by members of the public on the Day the Earth Smiled. The Day the Earth Smiled refers to July 19, 2013, the date on which the Cassini spacecraft turned to image Saturn, most of its visible ring system, and Earth, during an eclipse of the Sun. The spacecraft had done this twice before (in 2006 and 2012) in its previous nine years in orbit. The name is also used to refer to the activities associated with the event, as well as to the photographic mosaic created from it. Conceived by the planetary scientist Carolyn Porco, who was the imaging team leader for Cassini, the concept called for the people of the world to reflect on their place in the cosmos, to marvel at life on Earth, and, at the time the pictures were taken, to look up and smile in celebration. The final mosaic from July 19, processed at the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPS), was released to the public on November 12, 2013. The Day the Earth Smiled photograph includes Earth, Mars, Venus, and many Saturnian moons. A higher-resolution image, which depicts Earth and the Moon as distinct points of light, was taken with the Cassini narrow-angle camera and was released shortly afterwards. Events The Cassini probe took images of Earth from close to a billion miles away at 21:27 UTC, July 19, 2013. A number of activities were planned to celebrate the occasion: * A website was set up as a portal to activities associated with July 19. On it, Porco encouraged the world to celebrate life on planet Earth and humanity's accomplishments in the exploration of the Solar System. * Astronomers Without Borders coordinated events internationally. * NASA spearheaded a related event called 'Wave at Saturn' \\"to help acknowledge the historic interplanetary portrait as it is being taken\\". * A \\"Message to the Milky Way\\" contest was held by Porco's company, Diamond Sky Productions. People could submit a digital photo taken on July 19 and/or a musical composition. The winning entries were beamed as a message to extraterrestrials, \\"into the Milky Way from the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico\\". This follows the example set in 1974, when the first serious communication to alien civilizations, the Arecibo message, was broadcast from Arecibo. Results Raw images from Cassini were received on Earth shortly after the event, and a couple of processed images—a high- resolution image of the Earth and the Moon, and a small portion of the final wide-angle mosaic showing the Earth—were released to the public a few days following the July 19 imaging sequence. Processing of the full mosaic took place at CICLOPS under Porco's direction over the course of approximately two months. During the four hours it took Cassini to image the entire 404,880-mile-wide scene, the spacecraft captured a total of 323 images, 141 of which were used in the mosaic. NASA revealed that this imaging marked the first time four planets – Saturn, Earth, Mars, and Venus – had been captured at once in visible light by the Cassini craft. It was also the first time the people of Earth knew in advance that their picture would be taken from the outer Solar System. NASA's official release of the final The Day the Earth Smiled mosaic on November 12, 2013, was met with much fanfare in news media outlets around the world. The image graced the front page of The New York Times the following day. Public figures including media producer Seth MacFarlane lauded the image. The mosaic was also presented by Carolyn Porco, and dedicated to the late astronomer Carl Sagan, at a ceremony at the Library of Congress in honor of its acquisition of Sagan's papers. In addition, a collage of images submitted by 1,600 members of the public to NASA's Wave at Saturn campaign was released on November 12.

SB5 was heavily criticized by state Democrats, and passage during a special session in the Texas Senate was blocked by a filibuster by Senator Wendy Davis by the end of the legislative term at the end of June. Governor Rick Perry created a second special session, in which the failed SB5 was reintroduced within the Texas House of Representatives as HB2, and eventually passed both Houses and signed into law by Gov. Perry on July 18, 2013.

The bill would not apply to abortions necessary to save the mother's life or to prevent permanent bodily damage from a pregnancy. History =First Special Session= Texas Senator Wendy Davis, who filibustered to prevent passage of SB5 during the first special session During the 2012–2013 Eighty-third Texas Legislature, several bills were introduced related to abortion restrictions but which failed to pass. With several legislative matters left unresolved as the Texas Legislature ended its normal term in May 2013, including voting in new redistricting maps, Governor Rick Perry issued a 30-day special session started May 27, 2013, which under Texas law allows him to ask the legislature to produce legislation for other matters that he requests. Among issues that Perry sought was abortion. SB5 was introduced mid-June 2013, which combined elements of several of the failed bills from the term. It passed through the committee stage and proceeded to be passed by the Senate. In the House, an amended version of SB5 was passed on June 23, 2013; because of this amendment, the Senate could not act on the bill for 48 hours, on June 25, 2013, the last day of the special session. If the bill failed before the normal end of the session, the bill would be dead. Democrat lawmakers in the Senator sought ways to block the passage of the bill. Senator Wendy Davis along with other Senators made plans for her to launch into a filibuster on June 25 as to prevent a call for a vote before the end of the session, which would kill the bill. After ten hours, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst ruled that Davis had gone off topic after Davis began talking about a sonogram bill, forcing a vote on whether the filibuster could continue. Despite efforts to pass the bill, parliamentary enquiries from Leticia R. Van de Putte and other senators, as well as disruption from the gallery caused the session to go on through midnight, the official closure of the special session. Following the deadline, Republicans indicated that a vote had taken place and passed 19–11, while Democrats declared that the vote had taken place after midnight, making the vote void. Dewhurst later conceded that the bill was passed after the deadline and was considered dead. =Timestamp issue= After the bill was thought to have been passed, a record was added to the official web page on the history of the bill. According to the page, the timestamp of the bill's passage was listed as the 26th. Later, the page was taken down and altered to say that the bill was passed on the 25th. According to Texas Penal Code, Section 37.10, it is a crime to make an alteration that is false in a government document or record. According to the Legislative Reference Library of Texas the Texas Legislature Online system \\"... is not the official record of those actions, and [the Legislative Reference Library staff] enters actions on TLO as a public service independently of the officers of the house or senate.\\" The Public Integrity Unit began an investigation into the events after receiving complaints. =Second Special Session= The day after Davis' filibuster, Governor Perry ordered a second special session to start July 1, 2013, with demands for the legislation to look at three specific topics including abortion. Perry stated that it was due to the \\"[...] breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do.\\" During the second session, a large number of supporters and opponents of the bill showed up at the Texas Legislative building while wearing blue or orange shirts in support of their respective sides. SB5 was revived as the new House Bill 2 (HB2), and which passed by July 10, 2013 by a 96–49 margin and sent the measure to the Texas Senate.Tinsley, Anna.

Public response Billy Joe and Tuesday's controversial placard Organizations and people on both sides used websites like Twitter and the Texas Tribune to share their side and learn more, with several hashtags becoming popular on Twitter. Coverage and a livestream of the Texas Legislature by the Texas Tribune has been said to have been the reason that the bill became national, and later international, news. Psychedelic rock band The Bright Light Social Hour were in the gallery during Senator Davis's filibuster of the first special session. The following morning the band released the song \\"Wendy Davis,\\" based on the chants of the protesting crowd. The song was accompanied by a video made with protest footage taken from the band's phones, which was featured in MSNBC's coverage of the event. Images of the placard carried by pro-choice activists Billy Joe Cain, his daughter Tuesday, with the message \\"JESUS isn't a DICK; so keep him OUT of MY VAGINA!\\" went viral, the resultant controversy was reported nationally and internationally. =Debate= Many people who are against the bill have opposed the requirement that would force clinics to follow the same standards as surgical centers, since it could lead to the closure of the clinics and result in large areas of the state to not have access to a clinic.Manny Fernandez & Erik Eckholm, Texas House Restricts Abortions in a Move That Could Force Clinics to Shut The New York Times June 25, 2013 Many major medical groups such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists argue that this bill is damaging to women's health by closing clinics and adding undue obstacles and medical expenses that can push abortions into the second trimester.Nina Totenberg, Supreme Court Tests Texas' New Restrictions On Abortion, Npr.org, March 2, 2016Amicus Brief by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, December 19, 2013. Supporters of the legislation have stated that the purpose of the new law is to protect women's health and unborn children, citing precedents like the recent Kermit Gosnell case. Abortion access in the state of Texas has seen a serious decline since the passage of Senate Bill 5. There were 44 facilities that performed abortions in Texas in 2011, When the law is fully implemented in September, that number is expected to drop to six. Amy Hagstrom Miller, the chief executive of Whole Woman's Health, which has challenged provisions of the law in court. \\"I tried everything I can. I just can't keep the doors open.\\" Impact During the period where no injunction had been placed on enforcement of the law, the number of operating abortion clinics dropped in the state from 42 to 19. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper used the legislation to identify the effects of abortion access. The study found that \\"as the distance to the nearest abortion provider increases from less than 25 miles to 25-50 miles, there is little change in rates of legally induced abortions. But an increase to 50-100 miles reduces legal abortion rates by 16 percent, an increase to 100-200 miles reduces abortion rates by 32 percent, and an increase to 200 or more miles reduces abortion rates by 47 percent. We also introduce a proxy for congestion that predicts additional reductions in abortion rates as fewer clinics serve more women.\\" Another 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that \\"In-state abortions fell 20% and births rose 3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 miles. Births increased 1% and contraceptive purchases rose 8% in counties without a publicly-funded family planning clinic within 25 miles.\\" A 2016 study interviewed 23 women in Texas who had sought abortions at clinics that were no longer providing such services. It found that because of the clinic closures caused by the law, women became confused about where to obtain abortion services. The same study found that most of the women interviewed had to spend more money and time to obtain abortion services, and that their privacy was compromised by having to travel further than they previously had to. Another 2016 study by the same research team found that Texas women whose nearest clinic closed had to travel on average 85 miles to have abortions, while women whose nearest clinic did not close had to travel an average of 22 miles. Court challenge HB2 faced two legal challenges after its passage. The first, Planned Parenthood v. Abbott, started in 2013, challenging the admitting privileges and medical oversight of abortion-inducing drugs provisions of HB2. While the District Court had granted an injunction on enforcement of HB2, based on the \\"undue burden\\" standard established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court stayed the injunction, and the United States Supreme Court upheld it by November 2013, allowing the law to be enforced. A second set of abortion providers filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas seeking an injunction preventing enforcement of the admitting-privileges provision as applied to physicians at two abortion facilities, one operated by Whole Woman's Health in McAllen and the other operated by Nova Health Systems in El Paso. They also sought an injunction prohibiting enforcement of both the admitting privilege and surgical-center requirements. In August 2014, the District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and issued the sought injunction. In October, the Fifth Circuit stayed the injunction. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court vacated the stay, allowing the injunction to take effect during Texas's appeal of the district court's ruling. On June 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals unanimously overturned the lower court's ruling, finding that neither abortion restriction placed an undue burden on women as mandated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Later that month, the Supreme Court stayed the Fifth Circuit's ruling by a 5–4 vote, preventing the restrictions from being enforced once again. On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court ruled 5–3 that the Texas abortion restrictions are unconstitutional, striking down the two provisions of the law.

Dow, 82 A. 3d 336 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 2013) is a New Jersey Superior Court case that held on September 27, 2013, that the New Jersey's marriage laws violated the rights of same-sex couples to equal protection of the law under the New Jersey State Constitution. The trial court and a State Appellate Court refused the State's request for a stay of the trial court's decision, and the New Jersey Supreme Court refused to do so on a 7-0 vote. The ruling took effect on October 21, 2013; and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped the State's plans to appeal that same day, ending the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in New Jersey. Preliminary hearings On June 29, 2011, Lambda Legal filed suit in the Law Division of Superior Court in Mercer County on behalf Garden State Equality, seven same- sex couples, and several of their children, arguing that New Jersey's civil unions did not provide the same rights as marriage as required by the court's decision in Lewis v. Harris (2006). The named defendant was Paula Dow, in her official capacity at the time as the Attorney General of New Jersey. Superior Court Judge Linda Feinberg initially dismissed the plaintiffs' claim that their federal equal protection rights were violated when they were denied marriage licenses, but later reinstated it for consideration by the trial court. On July 3, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court's June 26 decision in United States v. Windsor meant that civil unions are not equivalent to marriage because same- sex couples in civil unions do not have access to the same federal benefits available to married couples. A hearing on the motion was held on August 15, 2013. Trial court ruling On September 27, 2013, Mary C. Jacobson, Assignment Judge of the Mercer Vicinage of the Superior Court, ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples to marry. The effective date of her order was October 21. In her ruling, Judge Jacobson wrote: \\"Since Windsor, the clear trend has been for Federal agencies to limit the extension of benefits to only those same-sex couples in legally recognized marriages.\\" She pointed out that many of these agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Department of Labor, that are extending benefits to same-sex couples in a marriage, do not recognize New Jersey civil unions for benefits purposes. She pointed out that the proper issue before the court is whether the New Jersey civil union scheme is unconstitutional because \\"of the manner it is applied and incorporated by the Federal government.\\" She reasoned that this disparate treatment of civil unions versus marriage raised an equal protection claim under both state and Federal constitutions if a state action led to this situation. Because New Jersey enacted a civil union statute that created a \\"parallel\\" structure to marriage and the N.J. Supreme Court deferred to the legislature on the actual name of the legal status granted to same-sex couples \\"as long as the classifications do not discriminate arbitrarily among persons similarly situated,\\" Windsor changed the significance of the state's civil unions scheme. She determined that \\"the parallel legal structures created by the New Jersey Legislature no longer provided same sex couples with equal access to the rights and benefits enjoyed by married heterosexual couples, violating the mandate of Lewis and the New Jersey Constitution's equal protection guarantee.\\" Appeal and application for stay Governor Chris Christie immediately stated that his administration would appeal the ruling, and the Acting Attorney General requested any appeal to be fast-tracked or taken directly to the high court. On September 30, the state defendants files a notice of appeal with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division. It said that on appeal the state would argue that Garden State Equality and the other plaintiffs had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that New Jersey's civil union law runs afoul of the Constitution; that the trial court did not exercise maximum caution in granting summary judgement in a far-reaching case in violation of precedent; that under Windsor, civil union spouses are indeed entitled to federal marriage benefits; and that the respondents' equal protection claims fail because the state has a rational basis for enforcing existing civil union law. The state asked for a stay pending appeal, arguing that the state would suffer irreparable injury if same-sex marriage were allowed, that plaintiff's claim raises unsettled questions of Constitutional law, that the state has a reasonable probability of success in its appeal. On October 10, 2013, Judge Jacobson denied the state defendants' motion for a stay. She reasoned that the state's irreparable harm argument was \\"largely abstract...which pales in comparison to the concrete harm caused to the [p]laintiffs,\\" who suffer from the denial of many federal benefits, and a massive litigation burden to challenge federal acceptance of New Jersey–specific civil unions in regards to these benefits. Later that day, the state defendants applied to the Appellate Division for permission to file an emergency motion. The application noted that developments so far \\"permits same-sex couples to marry in less than 3 weeks,\\" and that the issue has \\"far-reaching social implications, and alteration of the traditional definition of marriage would result in a profound change in the public consciousness of a social institution of ancient origin.\\" Appellate Judge Carmen H. Alvarez granted permission for the state to file its motion on short notice, with the motion itself to be filed by the defendants the next day. The state appealed the ruling and the state Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. The state also requested a stay of the ruling' implementation, which the state Supreme Court denied on October 18 in a 7–0 decision. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote that \\"the state has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: Same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today.\\" The ruling also denied the request for stay because the court could \\"find no public interest in depriving a group of New Jersey residents of their constitutional right to equal protection while the appeals process unfolds.\\" Weddings were performed just after midnight on October 21, 2013, and Governor Christie dropped his administration's appeal of the lower court ruling that morning.

Dozens of Yugoslav cities and towns were bombed, many repeatedly. These attacks included intensive air support for Yugoslav Partisan operations in May–June 1944, and a bombing campaign against transport infrastructure in September 1944 as the German Wehrmacht withdrew from Greece and Yugoslavia. This latter operation was known as Operation Ratweek. Some of the attacks caused significant civilian casualties.  First bombings  The bombings of Serbia and Montenegro lasted from 20 October 1943 to 18 September 1944. Especially hit was the industrial town of Niš in south Serbia. The bombing began on 20 October 1943, instantly killing 250 people. German forces in town were barely affected. Niš was bombed 15 times in total. The greatest devastation was in the most destitute parts of the town, along the railroad.  1944 Easter bombing  Map of 17 April 1944 bombing of Belgrade Belgrade was bombed by British and American air forces on 16–17 April 1944, which was Orthodox Easter Day. The most important unit that took part was the American 15th Air Force, based in Foggia in the south of Italy. This carpet bombing raid was executed by 600 aircraft flying at high altitude. Civilian casualties were as many as 1,160, while German military losses were 18, or some 1,200 killed in total. 5,000 people were wounded. Though officially only the military and industrial targets were picked - factories, bridges, airport, ammunition depots, German barracks and garrisons - the precision of bombing was notoriously bad. Features in downtown hit on 16 April included Palace Albanija, National Theater in Belgrade, Terazije, Bajloni Market, area around the Belgrade Main railway station, Krunski Venac (including the maternity hospital where several mothers who just gave births were killed with their babies), a large number of hospitals, schools and kindergartens. Bombed areas of a wider center of Belgrade included Dorćol, which was heavily destroyed, parts of Vračar and Pašino Brdo and Dušanovac, suburbs at the time, which had no factories or military targets. When the bombing was continued the next day, the remains of the King Alexander Bridge, partially destroyed in April 1941, were bombed. Hits were mostly concentrated on the bank areas of the city, including the Sajmište concentration camp, part of the Independent State of Croatia at the time. Some 100 prisoners were killed in the bombing. Some citizens were hiding in surviving shelters but others massively fled the city, hiding in the woods or surrounding villages. Some 1,500 tons of bombs were used in the bombing. Other targets included Kalenić market, Central hygienic institute, Hospital for infectious diseases, Home for the blind, Labor market, Orthopedic institute, both state orphanages, for boys and girls, two homes for the children of the refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia, Children's hospital, Children's dispensary, all bridges were damaged again, railway stations in Topčider and Rakovica, Post Office No. 2, Fabrics factory of Vlada Ilić in Karaburma, Faculty of technical engineering, Vajfert's brewery, University campus. The city was crippled, yet German military objects were almost unharmed and they made only 1.5% of the fatalities. One epitaph on the tombstone on Belgrade New Cemetery says: \\"They hoped to get freedom from the English, not knowing that hope leads them directly into death\\". Part of the Easter raid were also numerous towns in Montenegro and Herzegovina: Cetinje, Žabljak, Šavnik, Kolašin, Andrijevica, Gacko and Bileća.  Later bombings  From April to September 1944, Belgrade was bombed 11 times. In this period, a number of other Serbian towns including some quite small, were bombed: Kraljevo (6 times), Zemun (4 times), Alibunar (4 times), Novi Sad (3 times), Smederevo (2 times), Ćuprija (2 times), Popovac (2 times), Leskovac, Kragujevac, Kruševac, Smederevska Palanka, Gornji Milanovac, Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma, Veliki Bečkerek, Peć, Kovin, Pančevo, Velika Plana, Prijepolje, Kuršumlija, Prokuplje, Vučje, Lebane, Grdelica, Podujevo, Raška, Stalać, Kosovska Mitrovica, Priština. Belgrade was bombed again on 6 and 8 September 1944 with about 120 Flying Fortresses, also from the US 15th Air Force, which were accompanied by fighter planes. Niš was bombed again on 30 March 1944. It took six days to find all the wounded and killed and remove them from the rubble. Town was bombed again on 5 April. This time, the Allies used 248 bombs, killed 88 and wounded 184 people. Cathedral church was hit and the bombs destroyed the city cemetery, blowing up the collective tombs of the previous victims of the bombing. Leskovac was bombed on 6 September. Described as \\"day of hell\\", the post-attack situation was described as \\"if the entire Leskovac lifted up in the whirlwind of dust, smoke and rubble\\". Allied aircraft bombed Maribor, present day Slovenia on some 50 occasions. American 15th Air Force twice bombed German facilities in Maribor, where aircraft engines were manufactured. Those attacks were conducted on 7 January and 6 November 1944 In 1944, town of Nikšić in Montenegro was bombed. 500 people were killed in the first attack. Radio London reported: \\"During the attack on Nikšić, block bombs of 2 tons were used. Half of the town was demolished or damaged. Nikšić was bombed on the request of Marshall Tito.\\" On 5 May Podgorica was bombed again (in total, 4 times). One sixth of the population was killed while 4,500 were wounded. Other towns in Montenegro and surrounding areas of Serbia and Herzegovina which were bombed included Sjenica and Bijelo Polje.  Assessment  Official Yugoslav historiography did not explore the Allied bombings after 1945, but the official stand was that it had to happen, in order to destroy the remaining occupational forces. Modern historians tend to disagree, giving a number of reasons: in that particular period of the World War II, Yugoslav front wasn't a location of important military operations; number of German forces was not high and they mostly consisted of Third Call regiments; Italy was already switched to the Allied side; Yugoslav Partisans were still out of all major urban centers; Josip Broz Tito was declared a marshal in November 1943, Churchill and Stalin agreed on division of the zones of interest while Serbia was for the most part Partisan free, with sizeable presence of the Četniks. It is believed that the combined effect of all these reasons was behind the bombing. Tito and his General Staff were sending targets to the Allied command. Historian Smilja Avramov discovered documents in Berlin which showed that the targets, for which Tito asked to be bombed, included purely civilian objects, like hospitals, schools, faculties and graveyards. Some of the targets were in very small settlements. Request for bombing of Nikšić, for example, originally came from Peko Dapčević, on 30 March 1944. On 19 April, Dapčević and Mitar Bakić also asked Tito for the bombing of Sjenica, Bijelo Polje and Podgorica. Some claim that it is not known for sure who requested the bombings. The campaign was constantly prolonged, even though the results showed that German troops were almost unharmed, while the civilian fatalities numbered in thousands. On 5 February 1944 Tito sent a dispatch to his representatives in Serbia, which was discovered and made public over 50 years later. In it, Tito notifies them that he is sending British major John Henniker-Major on a special mission, and then instructs them that all wishes concerning the \\"help of the Allied airforce\\" will be sent to the Allied mission at the Partisan General Staff, but that the \\"General Staff will decide if the suggested target will be bombed\\". As a proof that the highest Communist leadership was aware of the minimal military benefit of the bombings, but also of the enormous civilian casualties, a letter from Tito's aide, Slovene Edvard Kardelj is often cited. He writes to the Central Committee of Slovenia, concerning the request from the General Staff of Slovenia for Ljubljana to be bombed: I don't understand what prompts you to this and who would have benefits from it. There is no doubt that there will be thousands of our dead people in Ljubljana, but the enemy wouldn't suffer almost any casualties. We have such experience from all over Yugoslavia.

It was accessible by trolley, carriage, and automobile, and a joint horse riding and automobile club was opened in association with the hotel. There were originally 128 rooms, expanded in 1920 to 228. Its amenities included a sunroom, an artesian well, and in later years an English grill and taproom. History Opened on May 1, 1907, the hotel catered primarily to long-term summer guests, among them John Franklin Fort, a governor of the state. On June 28, 2013, the dedication of Montclair's fourth Delaware and Lackawanna station was celebrated there. Paul Wilcox, a lawyer also instrumental in the founding of the nearby Montclair Golf Club, played a major role in its establishment and was its manager.

Warner was born in New Norfolk in Tasmania's Derwent Valley. He attended The Hutchins School, where he was school captain, before embarking on a career in journalism. He began working for the Mercury as a copy boy in the late 1930s before being shifted to Melbourne to work for the Herald. After his return from war service in the Middle East (1941–43), he came to the attention of Sir Keith Murdoch, who dispatched him to Asia with the directive to \\"tell us how it is\\". On 4 May 1945, Warner was on board the aircraft carrier HMS Formidable near the island of Okinawa when it was hit by a Japanese Kamikaze aircraft, the suicide plane striking the deck only 30 ft from where he stood. Later that year he married Herald reporter Peggy Hick. Following the war's end, he worked for Reuters and the Australian Associated Press as head of the Tokyo bureau, from whence he reported on Japan's post-war experience and interviewed General Douglas MacArthur. In 1949, Warner was instrumental in publicising the case of Lorenzo Gamboa, a Filipino man targeted by the White Australia policy, after a chance encounter in a Tokyo post office. In 1949 he was appointed Far Eastern Correspondent for the Herald and the London Daily Telegraph, becoming a freelancer in 1955. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1956 and an Associate Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1957. He wrote for a number of international news magazines, including the Reporter, Look and the Atlantic. He was a correspondent for the Telegraph on the Korean War, which he described as a \\"tragic accident\\". It was during Korea that he developed a bitter rivalry with Wilfred Burchett, whom he considered a traitor for his support of the Chinese. Warner was a significant correspondent from the Vietnam War, where he was critical of the American conduct of a war he nevertheless supported. He continued to write on Asian affairs until 1983, also serving as a member of the Victorian State Advisory Committee of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1979 to 1981. From 1981 to 1995 he was editor of the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter. His hawkish foreign policy views distinguished him from many of his more liberal contemporaries. Warner was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1971 and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1982. He was a foundation patron of the Australia Defence Association in 1981, remaining involved with the organisation until his death. He continued writing into his later life, until ill health and his wife's death in 2010 led to a decline. Warner died in Melbourne in 2012.

When it was built the eleven-story brick structure was by far the tallest building in Yakima, an otherwise low-lying town. It was built by entrepreneur Alfred E. Larson and designed by local architect John W. Maloney. Description The A.E. Larson Building is tall to the top of its flagpole, and is by in plan. It is eleven stories tall, with retail shops on the ground floor, together with the main lobby. The building is clad in salmon-colored brick and terra cotta. The ground level is faced with stone with Art Deco bronze accents. The building rises straight from this base to the tenth floor, where it steps back, with deeper setbacks on the eleventh floor. The lobby is richly detailed in stone and bronze.\\\\ with elaborate bronze surrounds at the three elevator entrances. The building's original windows are a unique vertically-hinged steel casement that allows cleaning from inside. History Alfred E. Larson was born in Minnesota, arriving in Washington in 1884, where he worked in lumber camps. He came to Yakima in 1891 to buy a lumberyard. A successful businessman, he bought real estate, involved himself in politics and promoted local business. Despite the Great Depression, Larson committed $600,000 of his own funds to build the A.E. Larson Building in 1931, benefiting from reduced construction costs. He hired John W. Maloney, a Yakima architect, to design his building, and the Hans Pederson Construction Company to build it. The new tower replaced a bank building on the site. Larson died in 1934, and Maloney moved to Seattle in 1946. The A.E.

Originally they performed as The Camp Act but soon changed to Cam-Pact (or CamPact). Although little known outside Melbourne at the time, the various lineups of the group featured a number of young Melbourne musicians who went on to become significant figures on the Australian music scene, including Ray Arnott, Keith Glass, Chris Löfvén, Russell Smith, Robert Lloyd, and Chris Stockley. Cam-Pact issued five singles and three extended plays on Festival Records before disbanding in March 1970. History Cam-Pact were formed in Melbourne in April 1967 with a line up of Mark Barnes on bass guitar (ex-Moppa Blues, Roadrunners, Delta Set); Keith Glass on vocals and guitar (Rising Sons, Eighteenth Century Quartet); John Pugh on guitar, vocals and autoharp (Roadrunners, Delta Set, Eighteenth Century Quartet); Chris Stockley on guitar (Roadrunners, Delta Set); and Bob Lloyd (aka Bob Tregilgus) on drums. Originally named The Camp Act but, as that was \\"too outrageous\\", they soon changed to Cam-Pact. Initially they performed soul music in the Stax Records and Tamla-Motown mould. By 1968 Greg Cook, on organ and guitar, had replaced Pugh; and Trevor Courtney had replaced Lloyd on drums. In March 1968 they issued their debut single, \\"Something Easy\\", on Festival Records followed by a four-track extended play of the same name. The track was written by Glass. Their second single, \\"Drawing Room\\", appeared in May and was also written by Glass. It was followed by a third single, \\"Good Good Feelin'\\", in September, which was co-written by Cook and Courtney. Late that year Barnes left and Glass took up bass guitar. The group issued a fourth single, \\"Potion of Love\\", in June 1969. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described these singles as \\"fine examples of late 1960s psychedelic pop\\". By mid-1969 Glass had left to join the cast of Hair and Stockley left to join Axiom, and they were replaced by Chris Löfvén on bass guitar and Russell Smith on guitar, respectively. The group issued a second EP, Cam-Pact / Pastoral Symphony, with two tracks by Cam-Pact and two by label mates, Pastoral Symphony, which were a studio ensemble. Soon after Cook was replaced in Cam-Pact by Bill Blissett on organ and vocals. In September that year they released another single, \\"Zoom Zoom Zoom\\", and an EP of that name. Early in 1970 Ray Arnott (ex-Chelsea Set, Browns) replaced Courtney on drums and Cliff Edwards replaced Löfvén on bass guitar. They toured to Sydney with Matt Taylor guesting on lead vocals (ex- Wild Cherries). A three-piece line up of Arnott, Edwards and Smith continued until March 1970 before the trio formed Company Caine with Gulliver Smith on lead vocals and Jeremy Noone on saxophone. =Afterwards= Ray Arnott played in a number of major Australian groups: he replaced founding drummer Mark Kennedy in Spectrum and played with them from 1971 until the group disbanded in 1973; this was followed by a brief stint in the short-lived \\"supergroup\\" Mighty Kong (which included former Cam-Pact/Co. Caine guitarist Russell Smith and former Daddy Cool members Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford. This was followed by stints with The Dingoes (1973–1976), various solo projects (1978–80), Cold Chisel (1983–84) and Jimmy Barnes Band (1984–85). In 1969, Glass scored the role of Berger in the original Australian stage production of Hair, and performed on the award-winning original cast recording. After leaving that production, in the early 1970s (with David Pepperell he founded the pioneering Melbourne import record store \\"Archie & Jughead\\". In 1977 Glass established a new store and record label, Missing Link, which re-issued Cam- Pact material including a compilation album, Psychedelic Pop 'n' Soul 1967-69 (October 2002) alongside many other notable releases, including the earliest recordings by The Go-Betweens and The Birthday Party. Chris Löfvén became a film maker, creating pioneering Australian \\"film clips\\" (music videos) for Daddy Cool and Spectrum; he also directed a feature film, Oz (1976), alongside his continuing music work (often with Keith Glass). Russell Smith co-founded progressive rockers Company Caine (1970–75) and was also (with Arnott) a member of the short-lived Mighty Kong. Stockley was a founding member of early Australian \\"supergroup\\" Axiom (1969–71) and The Dingoes (1973–1978, 2009–present). Robert Lloyd went on to study and teach music and become a successful composer, poet, songwriter and recording artist. After leaving Cam- Pact, Bob Lloyd (aka Tregilgus) was in Carnival, Extradition and then Forest, before establishing a successful career as a composer. John Pugh joined a number of different groups including James Taylor Move, The News, The Avengers, Healing Force, Baiyana, Silversun, Ray Burton Nightflyers and the Renée Geyer Band. In 1970 Barnes and Glass were both in country rockers, Sundown. Chris Stockley was a founding member of rock group, Axiom (1969–71) and country rockers, The Dingoes (1973–1978, 2009–present); as well as a range of other bands. After leaving Company Caine, Ray Arnott joined Spectrum (1971–73), then The Dingoes (1973–1976) with Stockley, various solo projects (1978–80) and eventually was in Cold Chisel (1983–84) and Jimmy Barnes Band (1984-85). Chris Löfvén was a film maker and in 1971 he generated music videos for Spectrum's \\"I'll Be Gone\\" and Daddy Cool's \\"Eagle Rock\\"; he also directed a feature film, Oz (1976).

The game's soundtrack was composed by Terry Scott Taylor, who composed the music for The Neverhood soundtrack. Reception Armikrog received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics appreciated the fun art style and catchy music, but were disappointed with the many bugs, poor gameplay and short story. Armikrog received many updates after its release date, the latest being 1.05, fixing various bugs and adding a graphical cursor that reacted to objects with which the player could interact.

Background  Born on the Whitfield family owned Pleasant Plains plantation (built by his grandfather William Whitfield II), to General Bryan Whitfield (1754-1817), he attended school at the age of nine under a tutor and entered the University at age 12. At 17, he completed coursework at the University. Two years later, he became the Counselor of State for the State of North Carolina and was a State Senator. He was later commissioned to Major General rank to succeed his father. In 1789 he was one of the founders of the University of North Carolina and one of its first Trustees.

Whitfield is known to have designed most of the house from pattern books by James Stuart, Minard Lafever, Nicholas Revett and others. Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled artisan slaves. Whitfield moved from North Carolina to Marengo County, Alabama in 1834. In 1842 Whitfield bought the property from George Strother Gaines, younger brother of Edmund P. Gaines. The grounds had been the site of a notable historic event while owned by George Gaines. When Gaines was serving as the US Indian Agent, he is said to have met with the famous chief Pushmataha, of the Choctaw Nation, under an old post oak tree on what would become the Gaineswood estate. They were negotiating the terms of the treaty that would lead to the Choctaw removal to Indian Territory. The tree became known as the Pushmataha Oak.Hammond, Ralph Ante-bellum Mansions of Alabama, pages 114-120. New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. Whitfield first named the estate Marlmont in 1843, he renamed it Gaineswood in 1856 in honor of Gaines.Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, page 18. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. The Whitfield family tradition maintained that Gaines' original log house was the nucleus around which Whitfield had the mansion built, and that it was located at the present site of the south entrance hall and office.\\" Gen. Whitfield sold the house to his son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, in 1861. The second generation of Whitfields maintained Gaineswood as a residence. Mary Foscue Whitfield inherited the nearby Foscue-Whitfield House in 1861 upon her father's death and used that as a residence as well.

He has produced, written and recorded under the name The Postmarks, releasing three CDs on Unfiltered Records/ILG/Warner Bros. Records. In 2014 he released an album as The Lovers Key. Career =Twenty-Three (23)= Upon relocation from New York City to Florida, Moll started his first band, Twenty-Three, which continued for three years with Moll (vocals/guitar), Alex Gimeno (drums) and Brian Hill (bass). Around the mid 1990s the trio decided to part musical ways yet still remain close friends. =See Venus= After Twenty-Three, Moll moved from Miami to West Palm Beach, Florida. At the end of the 1990s he met the principals of what would become See Venus. The group's first five songs were passed around as a homemade CD. A Swedish music dot-com interviewed Moll and thee songs received airtime on BBCradio. The band played a few local concerts, and obtained opening slots for national acts Trans Am and Rilo Kiley. They also performed in the fall of 2003 in Manhattan at the annual College Music Journal conference. Including tracks recorded at various times between 2000 and 2003, March Records released Hard Time for Dreamers in early 2004. =The Postmarks= The Postmarks formed in 2004 when Christopher Moll began working with instrumentalist Jonathan Phillip Wilkins and singer Tim Yehezkely. The group recorded tracks at Moll's home studio in early 2005 for an album. The resulting songs led to Moll being described by Jeff Stratton of Broward Palm Beach New Times as a \\"gifted producer, with a reputation for transforming humdrum recordings into sharply re-conceptualized, marketable musical offerings\\", and attracted the notice of Andy Chase, who signed them to his Unfiltered Records label. The self-titled album The Postmarks received airplay before its February release. It entered at number thirteen on the College Music Journal Top 200 charts, rising as high as number seven. The band spent the rest of the year touring, with appearances at CMJ, SXSW, and the Lollapalooza festival as well as receiving positive reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin, as well as Pitchfork Media. The group is also featured in the \\"Love\\" episode of the Nick Jr. show, Yo Gabba Gabba!. In 2008, Christopher decided to record and release a new song each month with each month represented by a cover version of a song with a number in it; January was \\"One Note Samba,\\" February was \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" and so on. In November the songs were collected on CD under the title ‘By-the-Numbers’. Spin Magazine gave it 3 1/2 stars. Pitchfork gave it a 7.4 and CMJ Magazine had this to say: \\"a hauntingly beautiful work of art...even when performing covers, The Postmarks are an instant classic.\\" Meanwhile the band had begun work on its next album, Memoirs at the End of the World. Featuring the same core lineup, the album was released in September 2009, and featured more indie pop based on '60s film music. Following the release of the album, the most extensive touring to date took place, including the band's first visit to Europe. The Lovers Key After The Postmarks European tour, Moll took an extended sabbatical from music. He occasionally worked on songwriting projects until meeting singer, Maco Monthervil in the summer of 2012. While traveling to visit his family near the Gulf Coast of Florida, Moll noticed a highway sign for Lovers Key State Park. Moll decided to name his new project \\"The Lovers Key\\" and began working toward self-releasing an album in Spring 2014. Completed instead in September, the album, titled Here Today, Gone Tomorrow, was praised by Zachary Houle of Pop Matters as \\"an enjoyable listening experience, bar none\\".Houle, Zachary. \\"The Lovers Key: Here Today Gone Tomorrow (Deluxe Edition)\\".

He is acknowledged for working for the cause of education of native women in the Bangalore Cantonment. The Goodwills Girls School located in Fraser Town, Bangalore Cantonment is named after him. He was a scholar of the Tamil Language, and was also fluent in Canarese (Kannada) and Telagu (Telugu). Fred is acknowledged as an authority on Tamil Shaiva Literature, with authors quoting from his research. As one of the founding members of the Mythic Society, his published papers on the history of the Mysore State form the basis of history of the State, as we know it now. Fred Goodwill was a keen photographer and documented life in British India, especially life around the Bangalore Cantonment, with hundreds of photos. His photos are not only of churches and schools, but of ordinary people in India, with subjects such as butchers, tradesmen, travelling minstrels, friars, cooks, dhobhis, worshippers, and temples, monuments, etc. His pictures have recently evoked lot of interest in social media groups interested in Bangalore and Indian history. They were part of a group of photos exhibited at the Rangoli Metro Art Centre, Bangalore, in November 2013, and have appeared in many news articles on old Bangalore, and were also exhibited at the INTACH exhibition at Ulsoor. Many of his photos have been published in books published in British India and have also been published as Tucks India Series Postcards. Fred was the youngest child of farmers Thomas and Elizabeth Goodwill. His birth was registered in the first quarter of 1874 (Volume 9, p. 85) at Great Ouseburn. The family owned 56 acres of land and lived in the Main Street of Helperby. Fred's siblings were James (born 1857), Hannah (born 1859), Thomas (born 1860), Elizabeth (born 1868) and Pollie (born 1872).  Early life  Fred seemed to have a good start with his early education at the local Helperby school where he also taught other students. His entire family then contributed for his later education as he studied at the Handsworth Theological College, Birmingham. The family was deeply religious, and Fred had a genuine interest in working as a missionary. In those days it was not uncommon for the youngest son to take up religious work as it was seen as being a respectable profession which provided a steady income, but there is no suggestion that this was the reason why Fred joined the ministry.  Marriage  Fred Goodwill met Alice Haynes, his future wife, presumably during his time at Handsworth. Alice lived at Old Hill and was a primitive Methodist while Fred was a Wesleyan. According to their daughter Bessie Goodwill, Fred had a posting in India and decided to go first to sort out things and then call Alice. The couple were married in Tumkur, Mysore State, British India in 1901. Extract from the India's Daily Post \\"The marriage of Miss Alice Haynes, of Old Hill, Staffordshire with the Rev F. Goodwill, Superintendent of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission, took place at the Wesleyan Church, Tumkur on 10 September 1901.  Life in India  India was a fascination for Fred, and he had a keen interest in its history, people, religions, scenery and native languages. Fred Goodwill was a gifted linguist, and was said to speak any language like a native after just six months practice. He could speak, read and write fluently in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. His research in Indian history was not merely for his own interest, but he also contributed papers for various societies on these subjects. He had a scholarly command over the languages. Fred loved the people and culture of India, and was actively involved in photography of Indian landscapes, buildings, common Indians, etc. Some of his pictures depict day-to-day life in British India, such as men working the land, women winnowing grains, wild haired fakirs, a child chained to a stone, mother bathing infants, goat about to be slaughtered, etc. It was as though he could not just get enough of India. Fred also authored articles and academic papers on South Indian History, Indian Religions (especially Shaivism) and Tamil Literature which were published in Journals. There is a mention of Fred Goodwill being appointed to the 'Committee on Temperance' of the South Indian Missionary Association in 1918–19, being appointed as General Secretary of the Bangalore Tract and Book Society and being part of the inaugural function of the Hudson Memorial Church, Bangalore on 23 September 1904. Fred seems to have been part of group of photography enthusiasts and could have traveled in groups taking pictures of life in India. Some of his pictures closely resemble the description of the photos in the Ellis Collection: Album depicting missionary life in South India, of the British Library. Many pictures of the Ellis Collection also mention Rev. Goodwill. The Ellis Collection was presented to the British Library by the British naturalist Arthur Erskine Ellis, son of Rev. Robert Arthur Ellis, who was also a Wesleyan minister posted at Bangalore, serving as pastor of the John's Hill Church (now Wesley English Church), Promenade Road, which is just next to the Goodwills Girls School Campus, around the same time as Fred. = Mythic Society = Fred Goodwill was one of the founding members of the Mythic Society, Bangalore and also served the council as Branch Secretary for the year 1917–18, (the council also included names such as the Maharaja of Mysore and the Maharaja of Baroda), with the society journal reporting that his talks attracted large audiences. Goodwill also researched for the Mystic Society and wrote for its quarterly journal, the early history of Kolar Gold Fields, Mysore, Bangalore and South India in general. His scholarly work on the 'Prison Song in Bangalore', based on the experiences of 'A Narrative of the Captivity and Sufferings of the Officers, Soldiers and Sepoys, who fell into the Hands of Hyder-Ali, after the Battle of Conjeveram (Kanchi), 10 September 1780', is acknowledged to be part of the history of Bangalore. In 2009, two of Fred Goodwill's articles – Nandidroog (1918); Hutridroog and Huliyurdroog (1924); previously published in the Quarterly journal of the Mythic Society [volumes 1–100] were among the 30 articles chosen to be re-published from the 100 volumes of the journal, as Gems of Scholarships: Archaeology & Antiquities Selected Articles from QJMS [1909–2009], in association with the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). = Girls Education at the Bangalore Cantonment = Education of the Indians, especially women's education was very close to his heart. In British India, education of the girl child was considered a taboo by Hindus as well as Indian Christians. Bangalore had had a Wesleyan Girls school since 1851, and Fred Goodwill built on its foundations and improved the school to a great extent. In 1906, Fred Goodwill began to assist the principal of the school Ms. Sisterson, eventually becoming its manager. His wife, Alice also got actively involved in educating the children and took time to teach needlework and crafts. Fred Goodwill was keen to stress to importance of education of girls irrespective of any caste barriers in the Bangalore Cantonment. He once wrote in \\"preparing girls for future work we remember that we are preparing workers to hasten the time when foreign missionaries will be a thing of the past\\". In respect for his work at the Wesleyan Tamil School was renamed as Goodwills Girls School. = Contribution to Tamil = In his 26 years in India, Rev. Fred Goodwill contributed immensely to the education and progress of Tamil literature in Bangalore Cantonment. His name is associated with books on Tamil Literature published around that period in British India, and Fred Goodwill authored many academic articles on Tamil Literature, which were published in Journals. Fred's articles on Tamil literature are mainly on the Shaivism philosophy, Tiruvacakam, the poetry of the Shavite Saints Tirunavukkarasar, Manikkavacakar, Sundarar and Sambandar. Research done by Fred Goodwill is quoted by works of later authors of Dravidian culture, Shaiva Siddhanta and Ancient Tamil literature, along with that of George Uglow Pope. About the Tamil poetry and literature on Saiva Siddhanta he remarked \\"'Those who have studied the system unanimously agree that this eulogy is not a whit too enthusiastic or free worded. That the system is eclectic is at once apparent\\". The Goodwills School still has a prize founded and named after Fred Goodwill for the student with the highest marks in Tamil in Year 10. His name carries respect and honour at the Wesley Tamil Church at Haines Road, Fraser Town Bangalore and at the Goodwills School. = Leaving India = Fred Goodwill left India in 1924. According to his daughter Fred did not want to leave India, but his wife wanted to return to England. On the one hand Fred was extremely sad to leave India after 25 years, but there was also happiness of the thought of seeing their children who were growing up in England. Before their departure, they received an address from the Wesley Tamil Church, Kolar Gold Fields, which read, \\"Many amongst us remember and recognise in you the slim young missionary who arrived in India. The Tamil churches on the Field are greatly indebted (to you) for the wise councils and valuable advice. We had in you, Sir, a spiritual leader, a guide and a sincere friend. Many of the poor children who were helped by you are now staunch pillars of the church\\". There was also an address by the teachers of the Wesleyan Elementary Schools in Bangalore. Acknowledgement was made for services rendered for the cause of education in Bangalore. The address also talks about Fred Goodwill being the District Commissioner for Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, further thanking him for his contribution for the cause of girl's education by providing for boarding and High School. There is also a plea for the provision of a pension and provident fund for the teachers. Signed by Wesleyan Mission Elementary School Teachers Bangalore as follows *Yellagowduna Palyam – P.T.

Life in England  Fred Goodwill returned to a very different England, with the social order having undergo many changes. The privileged lifestyle enjoyed in India, could not be replicated in England. Fred was offered work in Cornwall, which he refused in favour of working in the Black Country. During his time he was reminded a lot of life in India, and sadly did not take any photos on returning to England. Fred's interest in languages, helped him to speak the Black Country accent. Fred read Old English and Middle English fluently, and these skills were self-taught. He continued to keep reading the bible in Tamil and sing Tamil and Canarese hymns. Additionally he would read the Bible in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. When the first Commonwealth migrants started to come to England, he would stop and chat with them. Speaking in Tamil with those who knew it would be a pleasant surprise for them.  Retirement and Death  On retirement, Fred and Alice lived at 32, Honor Avenue, Goldthorn Park, Wolverhampton. Fred was a keen reader of books, and as he grew older he could no longer go to the library, and his daughter Bessie would bring the books for him. Fred also loved music and was an accomplished piano player. He listened to classical music and was also a good singer. He absolutely hated television. He continued to write articulate letters to friends and neighbours, which show his varied interests. Fred continued preaching even in his nineties and in one of his letters talks about a service he took at Darlington Street and further talks about Synod meeting, where he is the Precentor. He used to end his letters with Warmly yours. A 'Pilgrim'. In another letter he is critical of the increasing violent robberies, young people not respecting the law and of young people's obsession with the Beatles. He talks about a TV show of the Beatles in presence of the Queen Mother and comments that their performance was 'below proof'. His wife Alice died in 1955, and Fred had to engage a house keeper to look after the house. His son also named Fred became an Army Chaplin and then a Vicar, and sadly pre-deceased his father. His daughter Helen Margaret became a French teacher and his other daughter Bessie became a doctor. Even in his eighties, he would cycle to his daughter Bessie's house, six miles away in Codsall to trim the hedge, which was a tough job even for a young man. When he was 90 his house keeper retired, and Fred went on to live with his daughter Bessie and her husband John at their farm in Shropshire. He missed his independence, but kept himself busy walking around the farm. Fred Goodwill died in 1969, after breaking his arm in a fall.

The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT) was a labor organization for railroad employees founded in 1883. Originally called the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen, its purpose was to negotiate contracts with railroad management and to provide insurance for members. The BRT grew to become the largest brotherhood of operating railroad employees. In 1969, it merged with three other unions to form the United Transportation Union. Organization and membership The Brotherhood was organized into lodges. Its executive was elected every four years at the Grand Lodge Convention, including the president. There were four governing boards: the Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and Insurance, Board of Appeals, and Executive Board. Members in rail service included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. Member in yard service included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen, flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car operators. History =Early years (1883–1889)= An old caboose of the Delaware and Hudson Railway The Brotherhood was founded on 23 September 1883 in Oneonta, New York by eight brakemen in Delaware and Hudson Railway Caboose No. 10. The original name was the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen. At the time, wages were just over $1 a day. The work was dangerous, with 33% of brakemen being injured in the year of foundation. The Brotherhood offered death coverage of up to $300, and was the only way members could obtain insurance. The Brotherhood's insurance department was established in 1885 and maximum death benefits raised to $600. The union restricted membership to whites. In 1885 the first Canadian lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick. That year Stephen E. Wilkinson (1850-1901) became the first Grand Master of the Brotherhood, which now had 4,500 members. By 1886 there were 8,000 members in 244 local lodges. Maximum death benefits were raised again, to $800. By 1898 the railways employed over 800,000 workers, 5% of the total labor force in the United States. Brotherhoods organized by craft represented Locomotive Engineers, Conductors, Firemen, Trackmen, Switchmen, Carmen and Telegraphers. The brotherhoods provided social and educational benefits, insurance and relief, and helped resolve disputes between members and employees. Generally, they were very cautious about resorting to strikes. An 1887 publication by the BRT laid out its goals: =Expansion (1889–1945)= Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen Building, Cleveland The year 1889 was one of growth. The first Ladies' Auxiliary was organized in Fort Gratiot, Michigan. The Brotherhood changed its name to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and expanded its membership to over fourteen trade classifications. Working with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the BRT engaged Lorenzo S. Coffin, formerly a railroad commissioner of Iowa, to present its case for better working conditions in Washington. There was an economic downturn in the 1890s, causing many members of the BRT to lose their jobs. The problems were compounded by the 1894 Pullman Strike, when the Brotherhood expelled members for supporting the strikers. In all, the BRT lost 9,000 members. By the time of the 1895 convention there were less than 10,000 members remaining and the union had debts of $105,000. At the May 1895 BRT convention in Galesburg, Illinois, Wilkinson offered his resignation and it was accepted. Childhood home of Patrick Morrissey, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen leader in Bloomington, Illinois Patrick H. Morrissey (1862–1916) had been Vice-Grand Master of the BRT from 1889, helping establish new lodges across the country. He was elected to replace Wilkinson as Grandmaster and headed the Brotherhood from 1895 to 1909. Morrissey worked with the Order of Railway Conductors in 1902 to negotiate with the western railroads, where the two unions won contracts they used as a model elsewhere. By acting on a regional basis rather than dealing with each company separately, the BRT prevented the railroad companies from exploiting differences between workers on different lines. In 1902 Morrissey provided support when Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor called for help for striking coal miners in West Virginia. By the end of his tenure the Brotherhood had 120,000 members, $2 million in insurance funds and had a strike fund of $1.5 million. In January 1909 William Granville Lee was elected grand-master of the BRT, and relocated to the Brotherhood's headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. During the eastern railroad strike of 1913, Erie Railroad employees demanded a 20% increase in wages. Erie management had refused a wage increase but compromised by asking employees to wait until January 1915 for any advance. W.G. Lee said that the only way \\"to deal with the Erie is through J.P. Morgan & Company, or the banks\\". However, he and other Union leaders agreed to stay out of the dispute. In 1913 and 1914 Lee led successful strikes against the Southern Pacific Railroad, Delaware and Hudson Railway, and the Belt Railway of Chicago. Lee worked with the other railway brotherhoods for legislation to limit working hours on interstate railroads to eight-hour days, resulting in the 1916 Adamson Act. The railroads were seized by the Federal government during World War I (1914-1918). Labor made significant gains in contract conditions during the period of government control. Lee did not want to jeopardize these gains. During negotiations in 1919-20 on returning the lines to private ownership he helped to break a wildcat strike by the Switchmen's Union of North America. In 1921 the Railway Labor Board made a wage decision that fell short of union expectations, but Lee helped persuade the railway brotherhoods to accept the decision. The classical Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen Building in Cleveland was built in 1921, designed by Charles Sumner Schneider. Lee stepped down as president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen in 1928. Alexander F. Whitney was elected president of the Brotherhood on 1 July 1928. Whitney soon became an important public figure, representing the trainmen in many discussions with government and business. During his tenure the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen grew to 215,000 members. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, the president appointed a committee to draw up new legislation for the railroads. Their draft included various measures to improve efficiency. On 3 April 1933 Whitney said the plan could throw from 50,000 to 350,000 men out of work, and would violate contracts related to security of employment. He called for guarantees that the government would ensure absorptive employment, consult with the unions on any changes and prevent carriers from interfering with labor's right to organize. The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 16 June 1933 essentially met these conditions, and was seen by the union leaders as a great victory. In 1933 the Brotherhood organized employees of interstate bus operators for the first time. In New York, the City Board of Transportation ran the Independent Subway System (IND). In 1937 Mayor Fiorello La Guardia invited the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen to represent the motormen, but had to retreat when Roy Wilkins of the NAACP pointed out that this brotherhood did not allow African-American workers to join, while the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) did. Cover of The Railroad Trainman July 1941 showing the Dixie Flagler =1945-46 Strike= After World War II (1939-1945) ended, towards the end of 1945 Whitney and the leaders of the other main railroad unions demanded pay increases and a forty-hour work week from the railroad companies, in line with other industries. Negotiations stalled in January 1946. Three of the unions were willing to suspend their demands, but Whitney and Alvanley Johnston, leader of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, called a strike of their members to start on 16 March 1946. President Truman set up a board to hear the grievances and make recommendations. Negotiations broke down in April, and Whitney and Johnston set 18 May 1946 as the strike date. The BRT represented 211,000 trainmen and Johnston represented 78,000 engineers. They could halt all railway traffic nationwide. The day before the walkout was due Truman seized the railroads by executive order. Whitney and Johnston again agreed to postpone the strike for five days. However, after hearing Truman's compromise pay offer their members voted to go on strike on 23 May 1946. The strike stranded travelers, prevented movement of perishable goods and caused concern that many people in war- devastated Europe would starve if grain shipments were delayed. Truman broadcast an appeal to the strikers to return to work, saying \\"It is inconceivable that in our democracy any two men should be placed in a position where they can completely stifle our economy and ultimately destroy our country.\\" He threatened to call out the army to end the strike. On 25 May Truman was addressing Congress, calling for drastic legislation under which strikers could be drafted into the army, when word came that the strikers had accepted his terms and the strike had ended. =Later history= Alexander F. Whitney died of a heart attack on 16 July 1949 at the age of 76. William Parker Kennedy was president from 1949 to 1963. On 25 August 1950 President Truman issued an order for the federal government to take control of the 131 major railroads in the United States. The order came three days before the members of the BRT and the Order of Railway Conductors, were scheduled to halt work. Truman had just ordered U.S. troops to intervene in the Korean War, and could not afford to have the railways paralyzed. The strike continued until May 1952, when the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the Order of Railway Conductors and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen accepted the government's terms and returned to work. In the late 1950s, the union's Department of Legal Counsel (connecting injured members to prescreened attorneys) ran afoul of the Virginia State Bar. However, the union appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in 1964 found the prosecution violated the railroad workers' first amendment right to associate, citing NAACP v. Button and Gideon v. Wainwright.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/377/1 The Brotherhood reached its greatest size in 1956, with 217,176 members, after which railroad traffic and employment began to decline. In 1957 the BRT affiliated with the AFL-CIO and the Canadian Labour Congress. Charles Luna became president in 1963. On 1 January 1969 the BRT merged with three other unions to form the United Transportation Union. The others were the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen and the Switchmen’s Union of North America. Charles Luna became president of the combined union.

It became part of the United Transportation Union in 1969. Precursors The origins of the union can be traced to August 1870 when a local switchmen's mutual aid association was formed in Chicago. At that time, switchmen were paid $50 a week for twelve hour days, seven days a week. The association was formed to help them bargain for better conditions. The Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association of North America was organized in 1877 and held its first meeting in 1886. The national association suffered from a lockout by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad and the failed Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888 against the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1889 it was affiliated with the Supreme Council of United Orders of Railway Employees. Although blacks were widely employed by the railroads after the American Civil War, particularly in the south, they were generally excluded from the higher-paying jobs of engineers, switchmen and conductors. In 1887 white switchmen staged a walkout in protest against working with blacks in the Southern Pacific Railroad yard at Houston, and were supported by white switchmen from the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. In 1890 the white switchmen quit when the company refused to fire black workers at the yard. The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Brotherhood of Railroad Conductors, Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association and Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen formed a joint committee that submitted a protest: The company refused to accept this demand. They continued to employ blacks as they had in the past, in part because they accepted lower wages. As the Houston Daily Post noted, the railroad owned slaves before emancipation, and continued to employ negroes afterward. \\"Negro labor was and is the ordinary labor of the country.\\" The Buffalo switchmen's strike was a two-week strike in August 1892 by railroad workers employed by three railroads in Buffalo, New York. The strike collapsed after two weeks when 8,000 state militia entered the town and other unions refused to support the workers. The Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association was dissolved in 1894. Foundation On October 13, 1894, delegates from several lodges of the former association met in Kansas City, Missouri and formed the Switchmen's Union of North America. It was incorporated in Buffalo, New York on January 9, 1902, covering the United States and Canada, and representing yard workers: yardmasters, switchmen, switch tenders, towermen and interlocking men. The objectives were to promote the social, moral and intellectual interests of its members, to maintain harmonious relations between workers and employers and to protect its distressed or erring members, exercising its beneficial influence in the interests of right and justice. At this period, railway unions such as the Switchmen's Union avoided strikes wherever possible. The organization had a central Grand lodge headed by a president, six vice-presidents as organizers, a secretary-treasurer, an editor and an elected five-person board of directors. It held a triennial convention to enact legislation and elect general officers. It was open to any white male person of good character working in the railway yards in one of the defined occupations. It published the Journal of the Switchmen's Union. The head office was in Buffalo. The union offered life insurance and permanent disability benefits to its members. In 1901 more than two thirds of claims were related to work accidents. By 1914 the majority of benefits were paid to members who were sick or to the families of members who had died from natural clauses. Claims were forwarded by the local lodges to Buffalo for review by five-man beneficiary board. Typically it took two or three months before payment was made. History In 1906 the union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. SUNA was one of the founding unions of the Railway Labor Executives' Association in 1926. Discussions about a merger of train movement unions started in 1929 with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Order of Railway Conductors, but became bogged down. In 1935 SUNA affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress. In 1950 there were a series of disputes between the railroads and yard employees in connection with the 40-hour week. That year the government seized the railroads. The government's Railway Labor Act Emergency Board ruled on June 15, 1950, in favor of the 40-hour basic work week, overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours, and other improvements. When the railroad owners rejected this John R. Steelman, the President's representative, defined a proposed settlement that included wage increases and cost of living adjustments. The Railroad Yardmasters of America, Railroad Yardmasters of North America and the Switchmen's Union of America agreed to settle with some railroads based on the Steelman formula effective October 1, 1950, but other operating unions held out. By 1969 the Switchmen's Union of North America had 12,000 members in 275 lodges in the United States and Canada. That year it combined with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen to form the United Transportation Union.

It commenced on 27 June 2013 and ceased on 18 September 2013. Rudd had previously served a term as Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010 and been replaced by his deputy Julia Gillard, following an internal party spill. Rudd regained the Labor Party leadership by successfully re-challenging Gillard in a June 2013 party spill. On 5 August, Rudd called an election for 7 September 2013, which resulted in the defeat of his government by the Liberal/National Coalition led by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. Background =First Rudd government= Julia Gillard with then opposition leader Kevin Rudd in 2006. Gillard became prime minister by challenging Kevin Rudd's leadership of the Australian Labor Party in 2010. Rudd replaced Gillard in 2013 following another internal leadership ballot. Rudd, born rural Queensland in 1957, a former diplomat and senior advisor to Queensland Premier Wayne Goss, entered the Australian parliament in 1998 as Member for Griffith and was appointed Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister in 2001. Rudd teamed successfully with Julia Gillard to challenge Opposition Leader Kim Beazley and Deputy Leader Jenny Macklin respectively for leadership and deputy leadership of the Australian Labor Party and became Leader of the Opposition in 2006. Rudd went on to lead Labor to victory at the 2007 federal election, defeating the incumbent Coalition Government led by John Howard. Labor had been in opposition for eleven years, and despite an initial period of popularity, Rudd was to serve just two and a half years in office, and become the first in a line of Australian leaders to be removed by their own party during their first term as prime minister. In office, Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol, offered a Parliamentary apology to indigenous children removed from their parents by the state up to the mid-20th Century and organised the 2020 Summit. In economic policy, his government re- regulated the labour market by rescinding the Howard Government's Workchoices reforms and responded to the Global Financial Crisis with a large stimulus spending program. Rudd also dismantled the three pillars of the Howard Government's asylum seeker processing systemoffshore processing, temporary protection visas, and turning back unauthorised boats at seadubbing them \\"ineffectual and wasteful\\". By 2010, Rudd's premiership faced difficulties. Following the failure of the Government's insulation program and amidst controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its Carbon Trading Scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy, significant disaffection had arisen within Labor as to Rudd's leadership style and direction. A series of published and private opinion polls indicated that the Rudd Government's popularity had declined to a potentially election-losing position. Rudd was challenged by Deputy Prime Minister Gillard to a party leadership ballot, which was held on the morning of 24 June 2010. Rudd did not stand for re-election, and Gillard was elected unopposed as Labor leader and sought her commission to be appointed as Prime Minister, thus ending the first Rudd Government. The Gillard Government narrowly survived the 2010 federal election, forming a minority government with the support of four crossbench MPs after the election produced a hung parliament. =Gillard Government= Leadership rivalry remained between Rudd and Gillard. Rudd announced his resignation as foreign minister on 22 February, citing a lack of support from Gillard and character attacks launched by Simon Crean and \\"a number of other faceless men\\" as the catalyst for his resignation. Gillard called a leadership ballot for 27 February. She also expanded upon the reasons for her original challenge of Rudd's leadership, saying that his government had entered a period of \\"paralysis\\" and that Rudd was operating along \\"difficult and chaotic work patterns\\". senior ministers launched stinging attacks on Rudd's legacy as Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan lambasted Rudd as \\"dysfunctional\\". Gillard portrayed Rudd as a \\"chaotic\\" manager and would-be celebrity who led a \\"paralysed\\" government. Rudd portrayed Gillard as untrustworthy and unable to win an election. Rudd nominated Gillard's actions in relation to her promise not to implement a carbon tax; her East Timor and Malaysia Solution plans for asylum seekers; her written agreement with Andrew Wilkie on poker reforms and twelve months of low polling as key failings of Gillard's time in office. In an emotional address, Anthony Albanese announced that he had offered his resignation as Leader of the House of Representatives and would be supporting Rudd because he believed the manner in which he had been replaced in 2010 was wrong. Gillard refused to accept Albanese's resignation. Gillard won the ballot by 71 votes to 31. Albanese supported Rudd's bids to be re-elected as Labor leader. Albanese became Deputy Prime Minister in the second Rudd Government. In March 2013, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals – called \\"shambolic\\" by a key crossbencherChief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were \\"looking at the polls and expressing concerns\\". On 21 March, Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a leadership spill for 4.30 pm that afternoon. Just 10 minutes prior to the scheduled ballot, Rudd announced that he would not stand in the ballot, saying: =Return of Rudd to leadership= Amid ongoing poor polling results for Labor, and continuing leadership rivalry, ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy triggered renewed leadership speculation on 9 June 2013 by expressing on the Insiders television programme a belief that Gillard would not lead Labor into the election. On 10 June 2013, one Labor backbencher compared the Labor Party to the Titanic. ABC News reported that \\"some former staunch supporters\\" hold the view that Gillard cannot win the election and on 14 June Western Sydney Labor MP John Murphy called on Gillard to step down in favour of Rudd; On 22 June, The Age called upon Gillard to resign for the good of Labor, the nation and the democratic process, \\"so that vigorous, policy-driven democratic debate can flourish once again\\". On 26 June 2013, with polls predicting a landslide defeat for the Gillard Government in the upcoming federal election, Gillard announced another leadership spill to be held that evening, invited Rudd to challenge and proposed that the loser of the ballot resign from politics at the next election. Rudd agreed to this condition and contested the ballot, and was elected leader by 57 votes to 45. Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister by Governor-General Quentin Bryce on 27 June 2013. Seven senior ministers resigned their positions, refusing to serve under Rudd and Gillard announced her intention not to re-contest her seat at the forthcoming election. Albanese was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, and Chris Bowen was appointed Treasurer, replacing Wayne Swan. Labor initially enjoyed a brief resurgence in opinion polls following Rudd's return to the leadership. On 26 July, the Queensland Coroner brought down his report in relation to deaths brought about by the implementation of the first Rudd Government's insulation scheme economic stimulus package. The coroner found that the deaths of three men were the result of inadequate training for the installation of the roofing insulation, and criticised the Rudd Government for rushing through the pink batts program in a bid to stimulate the economy, noting \\"process failings\\" by federal agencies that led to \\"inadequate safeguards\\". The parents of a victim criticised Rudd for never apologising for his role in the scheme. Policy =Environment= Greg Combet, the Gillard Government's Minister for Climate Change, resigned following the return of Rudd to the leadership, saying that as he had been a strong Gillard supporter, \\"It is now important that Mr Rudd has a clear opportunity to argue Labor's case and to appoint his own team to take up the fight to Tony Abbott\\". Soon after, he announced an intention to quit politics. Mark Butler became the new Minister for Climate Change. Carbon pricing In July 2013, the Rudd Government announced its intention to bring forward, to July 2014, the replacement of the Gillard Government's controversial carbon tax with the proposed emissions trading scheme, if re-elected. Rudd told ABC News in August that the government under his predecessor had \\"got it wrong\\" on introducing carbon tax \\"without mandate\\", saying: \\"I don't think our actions on the carbon tax were right. That's why I changed it and moved towards a floating price.\\" Rudd pledged prior at the time to \\"terminate\\" the \\"Carbon Tax\\", stating it would save the average family approximately $380 annually. =Economy= Chris Bowen became Treasurer in the second Rudd Government. Wayne Swan had served as Treasurer in the first Rudd Government, but resigned the post in view of the acrimonious relationship which had developed between him and Rudd over the intervening period, as did Trade Minister Craig Emerson. Rudd appointed Chris Bowen to serve as Treasurer of Australia and retained Penny Wong as Minister for Finance. Wong also assumed the position of leader of the Government in the Senate, following the resignation of Gillard backer Stephen Conroy from that post. =Indigenous affairs= At the commencement of the 2007 election campaign and following John Howard's promise to call a referendum for recognition of indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution, Rudd and Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin offered \\"bipartisan support to a commitment for constitutional recognition, regardless of the outcomes of the federal election\\". Two days prior to the election, Rudd told The Australian that Labor would not be proceeding with the policy \\"...in the first term of a Rudd Labor government, if at all\\". In office, the Rudd Government did not pursue the issue further. The Gillard Government considered, and then shelved the plan. Following his return to the prime ministership, Rudd indicated that he had returned to supporting the initiative, in an address marking the 50th anniversary of the Yirrkala bark petitions, saying \\"I want this done in the next term of the Australian Parliament...\\" but said that the ball for this was in Opposition Leader Abbott's court, who had had to \\"get his act together\\". In response, Abbott said that Rudd was politicising the issue, as the opposition had already pledged to put forward a draft constitutional amendment for public consultation within the first 12 months, if elected. =Immigration= Asylum seekers Protesters outside ALP caucus meeting in July 2013 In his second term as Prime Minister, Rudd renounced his opposition to offshore processing of asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. The flow of asylum seeker boat arrivals to Australia had re-emerged following the first Rudd Government's relaxation of border controls. Following an extended period of increasing boat arrivals and deaths at sea, Gillard announced a resumption of offshore processing in August 2012. The restored Rudd shifted Labor's policy further, announcing that asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat are not allowed to be settled in Australia. Following talks with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O'Neill, Rudd announced in July 2013 that all asylum seekers arriving to Australia by boat would be sent to Papua New Guinea for processing, to tackle people smuggling and refugees that seek asylum without a visa. The announcement was made by the Prime Minister, alongside Tony Burke and O'Neill. A new Regional Resettlement Arrangement was also signed to implement the policy. Following the announcement, detainees at the processing centre at Nauru rioted. On 5 August, Rudd announced that asylum seekers would also be processed and \\"resettled\\" on Nauru. The leader of the Australian Greens, Christine Milne, called the announcement \\"absurd\\" on the basis that the island of only produced virtually no food, struggles to provide fresh water and could not absorb more people. =Social policy= Marriage Five weeks before his final challenge for the Labor leadership, Rudd reversed his previous opposition to extending the definition of marriage under Australian law to include same-sex relationships. Rudd used a blogpost on his website on 20 May 2013 to announce: \\"I have come to the conclusion that church and state can have different positions and practices on the question of same sex marriage. I believe the secular Australian state should be able to recognise same sex marriage.\\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/kevin-rudd-supports- same-sex-marriage/story-fndo1uez-1226647194403 As Prime Minister during the 2013 Election Campaign, Rudd pledged to put a conscience vote on the issue to the Parliament within his first 100 days of office, if re-elected. He was the first serving Australian Prime Minister to indicate support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Asked by a New Hope Church pastor on the ABC TV program Q&A; why, \\"as a Christian\\", he didn't accept the Biblical notion of marriage, Rudd replied that \\"Well mate if I was going to have that view, the Bible also says that slavery is a natural condition\\", and that his change of position on marriage was based on a good, informed Christian conscience. Rudd said that \\"people don't choose their sexuality\\" and implied that if the Bible were taken literally, slavery would still be legal. The remarks were criticised by the Glenn Davies, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, who said that Rudd had \\"misquoted the Bible and attributed to the Bible something that Aristotle said... The Bible sees slavery as the result of fallen and broken relationships in society and it is crystal clear in its condemnation of the slave trade...\\". =Education= Former education minister and Gillard supporter Peter Garrett resigned from Cabinet following the return of Rudd to the prime ministership, having promised prior to successive ballots that he could not serve under Rudd. Bill Shorten switched his support from Gillard to Rudd in the 2013 leadership spill and was appointed as the new Education Minister, while retaining his Workplace Relations portfolio. In July 2013 the Rudd Government enacted the $15.2 billion Better Schools Plan, devised by the Gillard Government in response to the Gonski Report. 2013 federal election On 4 August 2013, Rudd announced that he had asked the Governor-General to dissolve parliament and that an election would take place on 7 September. Kevin Rudd and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott met for three debates during the campaign: appearing at the National Press Club in Canberra on 11 August, and addressing people's forums at the Broncos Leagues Club in Brisbane on 21 August, and the Rooty Hill RSL Club in Western Sydney on 28 August. The Government criticised the Liberal Opposition's costings of policies. On 30 August, Treasury Secretary Martin Parkinson and Finance Department Secretary David Tune issued a rare public statement challenging the Government's claim that Treasury had found a $10 billion hole in the Opposition's policy costings, saying that any modelling used for costing policies submitted by the government before the election could not credibly be applied to opposition policies. On 15 August, Rudd announced a plan to give consideration to creating a special company tax regime and economic zone in the Northern Territory, if re-elected. On 27 August, Rudd pledged $52 million towards a High Speed Rail Authority and other steps towards planning the construction of a $114 billion high speed rail project linking Brisbane to Melbourne by 2035. On 28 August, Rudd announced a plan to give consideration to possibly relocating the Garden Island Naval Base from Sydney to Queensland. The proposal was met with a lukewarm reception, and defence officials did not support the plan. On the evening of the election, Rudd conceded defeat by means of a triumphal speech with a \\"beaming smile\\". Rudd spoke to a jubilant crowd for over 20 minutes, said \\"Bill Glasson eat your heart out\\" (in reference to his local opponent in the seat of Griffith) and declared \\"I'm proud that despite all the prophets of doom, that we have preserved our federal parliamentary Labor Party as a viable fighting force for the future\\". Abbott's Liberals and their coalition partner, the Nationals, led by Warren Truss, achieved a 3.65 percent two-party swing, winning 90 of the seats in the House of Representatives to Labor's 55. Aftermath On the night of the election, Rudd announced that he would remain in Parliament as the Member for Griffith, but not seek to be elected Labor's next leader. Outgoing ministers Craig Emerson and Nicola Roxon called on Rudd to resign from Parliament for the good of the Labor Party, predicting that his ongoing presence would be destabilising. Emerson predicted that Rudd would stand for the leadership again, and said that he had sabotaged Labor's 2010 election campaign with leaks and that \\"Anyone who does that, who is so hellbent on revenge, who is so destructive as to depress the Labor vote in the 2010 election shouldn't be rewarded for that sort of behaviour\\". In a scathing address in Parliament on 16 October, Roxon said that Rudd's replacement in 2010 had been an \\"act of political bastardry\\", but one which was justified because Rudd had been \\"a bastard himself to so many people\\". Under new leadership election rules instigated during the Second Rudd government, Labor allowed its parliamentary caucus, andin a new initiativeits general membership to share a 50/50 split of the vote for parliamentary leader. On 13 October Bill Shorten was elected to lead the opposition, with 64% of the caucus vote, defeating Anthony Albanese who obtained 60% of the general membership vote. On 22 November Rudd formally tendered his resignation to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

November 1789 in Landau in der Pfalz as Carl- Friederich Söhne; died 1. May 1878 in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais in Paris) was a French painter. He was the fourth child of merchant Jacques Frédéric Soehnée and Caroline Wilhelmine (née Krueger). In 1797 his family founded the company \\"Soehnée l'aîné & Cie\\". Their factories were located in the cities of Mulhouse, Colmar and Munster in Alsace. Their headquarters were in Paris where Soehnée eventually moved with his family. In Paris Soehnée studied under the neoclassical painter Anne Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson. His classmate and friend Pierre Louis de Laval (1790-1842) painted a portrait of him in 1812. In 1818, he executed more a group of than one hundred drawings, watercolors, and at least one lithograph, most of which depict grotesque scenes of imaginary beasts and travelers against the backdrop of desert landscapes.Mauries, Patrick Charles Frédéric Soehnée. Gallimard / Galerie J-M Le Fell 2006. Soehnée researched and studied the techniques of the old masters , culminating in a technical treatise published in 1822 where he disputed the commonly held belief that Jan van Eyck invented oil painting. In it, he argued that the a mixture of encaustic and varnish could be the only explanation for the existence of much older paintings. Soehnée went on to make a varnish and co- found the company Soehnée Frères in 1829 with one of his brothers , and became wealthy as a result. As far as is known, he never painted again after 1818. Soehnée possessed a collection of drawings from Baroque painter Joseph Parrocel (1646–1704), which are now owned by the Louvre. Bibliography Mauries, Patrick Charles Frédéric Soehnée.

After gaining notice in Broadway theatre at the age of four, she was cast in films the same year. Her most famous appearance was in the 1920 film Humoresque in which she played a little girl on crutches. As an adult, Battista acted in Italian-language films in the 1930s, and she appeared in Broadway productions. She wrote, sang, composed music, and co-hosted a television talk show with her second husband. Early life and career Miriam Caramella Josephine Battista was born in 1912 in New York City to Raphael Battista and Cleonice \\"Clara\\" Rufolo, both Italian immigrants. She began performing in 1916 at the age of four in A Kiss for Cinderella, a Broadway play starring Maude Adams, in which Battista had an uncredited role as the youngest of a group of war orphans. Other Broadway appearances followed, including small roles in Daddy Long Legs with Henry Miller in 1917, A Doll's House with Alla Nazimova in 1918, and Daddies with Jeanne Eagels in 1919. Battista in 1916 At the same time that Battista appeared on the stage, she began also to get work in silent films. She had an uncredited role in the Virginia Pearson vamp vehicle Blazing Love (1916), which resulted in Battista being featured, with a photo and brief biography, in an article entitled \\"Little Stars\\" in the film magazine Moving Picture Stories. Her first credited film role came in 1918 in Nazimova's Eye for Eye, playing an Arab sheik's daughter, the little sister of Nazimova's sultry character, which led to Battista being cast by director Frank Borzage as the physically disabled Minnie Ginsberg in Humoresque (1920). Excerpted from Charles Donald Fox's 1925 book Famous Film Folk, pg. 164. Author Elinor Glyn was so impressed by Battista's performance that she wrote an ultimately unproduced screenplay for this child star whom she called \\"the greatest actress of the screen.\\" Reporters began to describe Battista as two years younger than she really was, saying that she was born in 1914. Motion Picture Magazine dedicated an article to Battista in December 1922, called \\"Woman of the World\\". In it, reporter Gladys Hall noted Battista's precocious maturity, a preference for jade jewelry over dolls, and characteristics of a vamp-in- the-making. In 1924, her photo appeared on the cover of Picture Show, a UK publication, showing her astride a tipped-over barrel with the story title \\"They really play in Pictures\\" and the caption \\"Miriam Battista enjoys a romp\\". After her success in Humoresque, Battista appeared in nine more silent films, often in roles that called for her to cry on camera, a skill for which she became noted. She made public appearances to promote her films and also toured the vaudeville circuit, playing Juliet in the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet with child actor Charles Eaton. Subscription required. After her mother's death in 1924, her career stalled. Adult career Miriam Battista in 1932, photo by Murray Korman In 1931, Battista took leading roles in several Italian-language films made in New York, including Santa Lucia Luntana and Così è la vita. She also returned to the Broadway stage, appearing in The Honor Code in 1931.https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/miriam- battista-31280 Among other Broadway appearances during the next decade, she had a singing role in the Ziegfeld musical Hot-Cha! with Bert Lahr, a part playing opposite Humphrey Bogart in Our Wife, and she enjoyed an unusually long run in the comedy No More Ladies. She was generally unlucky in the Broadway productions she chose, which usually ran for only a few performances. However, she found frequent work in summer stock and in the road companies of successful Broadway productions such as The Women. In 1934, Battista married dancer Paul Pierce. They divorced slightly over a year later in 1935. In 1938, she eloped with writer Russell Maloney. Subscription required. Battista's writing talent was recognized when The New Yorker published her short story \\"No Sugar Please\\" in the April 20, 1940 issue. She and Maloney had a daughter, Amelia, in 1945. Battista helped Maloney translate Die Fledermaus into English for the Philadelphia Opera Company (1943), and they collaborated on a television talk show, The Maloneys, on the DuMont Television Network (1947–1948). The two wrote the scenario and lyrics for a musical, Sleepy Hollow (with the scenery of Washington Irving's \\"Legend\\"), which cost $230,000 to produce but ran for only 12 performances (June 3, 1948 – June 12, 1948). Death Battista's second husband died in September 1948. Three months later she married Lloyd Rosamond, a radio producer and long-time friend. Her daughter and she moved with him to Los Angeles, California, in 1960, where he died in 1964. Miriam Battista returned to her native New York City, where she died at Jewish Memorial Hospital in Manhattan from complications of emphysema on December 22, 1980, aged 68.

For the 2018–19 academic year, Anderson was the Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser chair of Australian Studies at Harvard University. As a historian of science and medicine, Anderson focuses on the biomedical dimensions of racial thought, especially in colonial settings, and the globalisation of medicine and science. He has introduced anthropological insights and themes to the history of medicine and science; developed innovative frameworks for the analysis of science and globalisation; and conducted historical research into the material cultures of scientific exchange. His influential formulation of the postcolonial studies of science and medicine has generated a new style of inquiry within science and technology studies.Seth S. Putting knowledge in its place: science, colonialism, and the postcolonial, Postcolonial Studies Special Issue: Science, Colonialism, Postcolonialism 12(4): 373–83 Early life and education Anderson was born and educated in Melbourne, Australia, where he attended the University High School. His father, Hugh McDonald Anderson (1927–2017), was a leading folklorist and historian of Australian popular and literary culture, with more than forty books to his credit; his mother, Dawn Anderson, has written books on drama education and creativity. Anderson graduated from the University of Melbourne Medical School with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1983. During the medical course he conducted neurophysiology research, supervised by Ian Darian-Smith, which earned him a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (1980). He was an intern at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and had paediatric training at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. In the 1986 season he was the assistant doctor for the Footscray Football Club (now the AFL Bulldogs). From 1987, he worked in general practice in the inner west of Melbourne, which he continued intermittently until 1999. Anderson (\\"Dr. Androgen\\") was a co-presenter on the award-winning radio program \\"Spoonful of Medicine\\" (3RRR) from 1987–88. Poetry As a medical student, Anderson began writing and publishing poetry. More than forty poems have appeared in a range of leading journals in Australia and the US.

Plot On Friday at 11am, 55 hours before the wedding, the gang all set out on their separate trips to the wedding that will change their lives, as well as the life of the woman who will become Ted's wife. Robin and Barney are being driven to Farhampton by Ranjit. They worry about which of their relatives will be the \\"Wild Card\\" (the person most likely to ruin the wedding). As they go through their family members, they find they share a \\"Crazy Cousin Mitch\\" and become horrified at the idea that they could be related. Though they try to make light of the situation, both are too repulsed by the notion to be affectionate with each other. After a bout of awkwardness, Robin finally speaks to her grandmother who confirms that Mitch is only related to them through marriage (for Barney) and adoption (for Robin). The awkwardness instantly lifts and Barney isn't worried about a Wild Card anymore, promising it will be a \\"legendary\\" wedding. When Robin notes that he didn't insert his usual \\"Wait for it\\" catchphrase into the middle, Barney tells Robin that thanks to her, he doesn't have to wait. In Minnesota, Marshall is waiting on the plane for New York with Marvin while worrying about how to tell Lily about his job offer and irritating his seat neighbor, Daphne (Sherri Shepherd). When he discovers that his mother Judy (Suzie Plakson) has posted a photo on the internet of Marvin that reveals how Marshall will become a judge, Marshall realizes that the photo will also be forwarded to Lily. Marshall phones Judy to teach her how to remove the image, which delays the plane from taking off. A fight between Marshall and Daphne ensues, which results in both of them being removed from the plane. At the airport terminal, Marshall accesses his mother's account to delete the photo himself, but also finds himself stumped as to how to do it. However, the photo is successfully deleted when Marvin hits a random key on the keyboard. When Marshall and Daphne learn there's another flight to New York soon but there's only one seat available, the two race each other across the airport. Meanwhile, Ted and Lily start their drive towards the Farhampton Inn. However Lily is soon irritated by Ted's behavior (which includes wearing driving gloves and taking her on long detours to see tourist stops). Lily eventually can't take any more and has Ted drop her off at a train station. She gets on the train to Farhampton and ends up sitting just a few seats away from Ted's future wife. When she gets a notification on her phone about Marvin's photo, she decides to ignore it because all Judy's photos so far have been emotional blackmail to prevent her and Marshall from moving to Italy. When she starts to feel guilty about not looking at a photo of her son, the Mother notices and offers Lily a cookie, which Future Ted describes to his kids as \\"How Aunt Lily met your Mother\\". The two sit together and Lily sounds off about Ted's driving habits (which the Mother secretly thinks are cool) as the Mother tries to stop Lily from looking at Judy's picture of Marvin. The Mother notes that it seems like Ted wanted Lily to leave and Lily suddenly remembers the locket that Robin had been looking for that Ted thought he had. She recalls how Ted discovered he did not have the locket, but considered the idea that when he lived briefly with his former girlfriend Stella, she might have ended up with the locket and taken it with her to Los Angeles. Though Ted promises not to fly to Los Angeles to retrieve the locket, Lily worries that Ted has done just that, and is heading to the wedding with the locket now. Lily panics that Ted is going to ruin the wedding by using the locket as a last-ditch effort to win Robin back, but realizes that her bad mood can be partly attributed to not seeing Marvin for a week. The Mother allows her to look at the photo Judy posted, but it is deleted just before it can be opened. Lily begins to get upset, and the Mother hugs her in support. Arriving at the Farhampton Inn, Ted is about to give Robin the gift when Lily tackles him (which Future Ted reveals wasn't the only time she tackled someone that weekend). Robin opens it, and finds not the locket, but a picture of the gang together taken soon after they started hanging out together. Ted tells Robin all her friends want is happiness for her and Barney. Lily apologizes for thinking the worst as Ted promises that he won't do anything insane and Future Ted claims that at that moment in time he meant it. However, Future Ted admits that he was a possible \\"Wild Card\\" at the wedding; unknown to Lily, Ted had actually flown to Los Angeles four days prior to look for the locket. Critical reception Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the double-episode premiere of \\"The Locket\\" and \\"Coming Back\\" a B+ rating. Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx also rated the double- episode saying that there was many \\"annoying little things, and a few big ones\\" but one big thing they got absolutely right: That was the Mother. Bill Kuchman of Popculturology said the episode paled in comparison to the previous season's premiere, saying, \\"You want a legendary HIMYM season premiere?

The film then cuts to a few days prior where the same girl, an artist named Kyra (Amy Weber), has agreed to take part in an experimental film. The film will have several different people living together for three months while the cameras record their interactions.

Also hunting the group is the entity from Kyra's dreams, which prompts some suspicion from some of the survivors. Eventually all but Kyra die and she is then shown cutting herself with a blade she finds in her bathroom. She's then shown making a phone call to place an ad for a group of people to come and tape an experimental film, identical to the one the initial group responded to when they came to the house. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not the events in the film happened, what Kyra's part in it was, and whether or not the faceless entity exists.

He is the eldest child of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and third in the line of succession to the British throne behind his grandfather Prince Charles and his father. As he is expected to become king one day, his birth was widely celebrated across the Commonwealth realms. George occasionally accompanies his parents on royal tours, and has affected business and popular culture. Birth and baptism The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leaving the hospital with their son The Duke of Cambridge is the elder son of the Prince of Wales, who is the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, meaning that his first child would be third in the line of succession to the British throne. Speculation ensued during the pregnancy of the Duchess of Cambridge that the birth would boost the British national economy and provide a focus for national pride. Commemorative coins were issued by the Royal Mint, Royal Canadian Mint, and Royal Australian Mint; the first time a royal birth had been marked that way. Prince George was born in Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, at 16:24 BST (15:24 UTC) on 22 July 2013. The customary formal bulletin announcing the royal birth was displayed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, although in a break with tradition the news was first conveyed in a press release from palace officials. The newborn was widely hailed as a future king. 21-gun salutes signalled the birth in the capitals of Bermuda, the UK, New Zealand, and Canada; the bells of Westminster Abbey and many other churches were rung; and iconic landmarks in the Commonwealth realms were illuminated in various colours, mostly blue to signify the birth of a boy. On 24 July, his name was announced as George Alexander Louis. Prince George was baptised by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on 23 October 2013, with Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the Hon. Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall serving as godparents. The font used at the ceremony was made for Queen Victoria's first child and the water was taken from the River Jordan. The Royal Mint issued a set of commemorative coins to celebrate the christening, the first coins to mark a royal christening in Britain. Prince George's birth marked the second time that three generations in direct line of succession to the throne have been alive at the same time, a situation that last occurred between 1894 and 1901, in the last seven years of the reign of Queen Victoria.  Official appearances Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove during a visit to Australia in April 2014 Prince George embarked on his first royal tour with his parents in April 2014, during which the Cambridges spent three weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Although he only appeared twice, the BBC described the \\"nine-month-old future king\\" as \\"the star of the show\\". Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott predicted in Parliament House, Canberra, that George would one day be welcomed there as King of Australia. In June 2015, Prince George made his first public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour parade marking the Queen's Official Birthday. George's parents are adamant that he should grow up as privately as possible. He is consequently rarely seen in public, including royal tours. In August 2015, Kensington Palace stated that they wanted all global media to stop taking unauthorised photographs of George, as they believed \\"a line has been crossed\\" in paparazzi methods of locating and photographing him. George meets U.S. President Barack Obama, April 2016 On 22 April 2016, Prince George met Barack Obama, President of the United States. He was photographed with a rocking horse that Obama had given him when he was born. The encounter later prompted Obama to joke that \\"Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe... a clear breach of protocol.\\" Prince George and Princess Charlotte accompanied their parents on a tour of Canada in September 2016, and on a diplomatic visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.  Education  In January 2016, George started his education at the Westacre Montessori School Nursery, near his family home at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. He attended his first day of primary school on 7 September 2017 at the private Thomas's School in Battersea. At school he is known as George Cambridge. Royal baby effect The \\"Prince George effect\\", also known as the \\"royal baby effect\\", is that clothing and products identified as used by George tend to sell better than before. The effect was noted during his April 2014 tour of New Zealand and Australia and many businesses have attempted to use this effect to their advantage. He was ranked No. 49 on GQs \\"50 Best Dressed Men in Britain\\" list in 2015. In 2016, the dressing gown he wore while meeting President Obama sold out after he was seen wearing it. In September 2017 the news that the Prince's school had served a Le Puy green lentil dish resulted in a spike in the legume's sales. In 2018, George became the youngest person to appear on Tatlers best-dressed list. Title and style Prince George's official title and style is \\"His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge\\". As with other princes and princesses who are born to royal dukes, George's territorial designation is taken from his father's title, in this case \\"Cambridge\\", from the Dukedom of Cambridge.

For decades they have been essential for lettering a drawing nameplate so text and other designs could be made quickly and uniformly. Although they have been superseded by the use of computers, during the greater part of the last century they were used to relatively ease the lettering process in the creation of technical drawings. They were an indispensable tool for architects and technical illustrators in general, for labeling their drawings and plans but also for the description of projects, in which it was good practice to use a lettering template to achieve uniform and well-written text. A lettering template could also be used by people illiterate or semi-illiterate to learn to type, or improve their handwriting. In the course of political history some politicians, such as Bettino Craxi, have used them to help people with writing difficulties. They distributed cardboard templates with the sequence of characters of their last name, so they could be easily written during the voting process.

Heizer (February 7, 1868 – August 1, 1956) was an American diplomat who served in various posts as Consul General in the Ottoman Empire. Heizer, who was the Consul General in Trebizond during World War I, witnessed the Armenian Genocide and often risked his own life to save the lives of Armenians. Armenian Genocide Heizer standing second from the right at a wedding Oscar S. Heizer was one of the first individuals to report the mass murder of Armenians.Pryce-Jones, D. (2003). Remembering Genocide. National Review, 55(23), 47–48. During the Armenian Genocide, Heizer was the Consul General of Trabzon, a city on the coast of the Black Sea. During the Genocide, Heizer's initial reporting to the American consulate stationed in Constantinople states that it was authorized \\"whenever the parents so desire\\" to leave children – girls up to the age of 15 and boys up to the age of ten – in the \\"orphanages by the Turks.\\"Letter from the Consul Heizer to Morgenthau, July 12, 1915: Sarafian (ed.), United States Official Records, pp. 126–7 Heizer also describes how some children were assimilated into Muslim Turks in a matter of weeks. Heizer also uncovered the direct link between the central government in Constantinople and a local Committee of Union and Progress functionary Nail Bey. In a letter to the American ambassador in Constantinople, Heizer writes: \\"The real authority here seems to be in the hands of a committee of which Nail Bey is the head and apparently receives his orders from Constantinople and not from the vali (governor).\\"Letter from the Consul Heizer to Morgenthau, July 12, 1915: Sarafian (ed.), United States Official Records, p. 146 Heizer also reveals that Nail Bey insisted that Armenian children be deported rather than being cared for. American Consul Heizer and wife beside auto (This is NOT Oscar Heizer OR his wife. CJ Heizer his Great Grandson) Heizer reported how Armenians were being thrown overboard in boats: \\"This plan did not suit Nail Bey ... Many of the children were loaded into boats and taken out to sea and thrown overboard. I myself saw where 16 bodies were washed ashore and buried by a Greek woman near the Italian monastery.\\"April 11, 1919 report. U.S. National Archives. R.G. 59. 867. 4016/411. Heizer also states that a group of members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were placed on a boat and drowned. According to the report of Oscar Heizer written to ambassador Henry Morgenthau, the first convoy of deportees was put on the road on July 1, 1915. On that day, troops surrounded certain Armenian neighborhoods of Trabzon and proceed to expel 2,000 inhabitants of the city, who then were taken in small groups to a place known as Deyirmen Dere, located ten minutes outside the city, and from there led off in the direction of Gumushane. A total of 6,000 people left the city between July 1 and July 3; approximately 4,000 more left the surrounding villages.Letter from the Consul Heizer to Morgenthau, 28 July 1915: Sarafian (ed.), United States Official Records, op. cit., pp. 178-9 Initially, the authorities had declared that Catholics and Protestants, as well as incapacitated old people, children, and pregnant women, would be \\"maintained\\". However, no exceptions were made, and the exempted individuals were dispatched with the last convoy that set out on July 5. Heizer stated that most of the deportees were murdered shortly after they were told to leave. He described the situation of the Armenians when the deportations began: The deportations measures throughout the province of Trabzon were also applied to 16 localities located south and west of the center, with an Armenian population of around 7,000, 3,517 of which lived in the province of Akcabat. Heizer reported that the men in these localities were apparently killed in their villages by members of the Special Organization. Heizer also described the circumstances of life insurance policies of the deportees. Heizer describes in a letter to Morgenthau about the life insurance policies left behind by the deportees at Reverend Robert Stapleton's residence (member of the American Mission in Erzurum). Stapleton invited Heizer to discuss what to do with the insurance policies of the deportees. Heizer describes the visit as follows: Oscar S.

Heizer describes what he witnessed as follows: Later life In May 1920, Heizer became Consul General in Jerusalem. After leaving his post as Consul General in Jerusalem, Heizer returned to the United States and was placed in charge of a governmental fund for the refugees of the Catastrophe of Smyrna. Heizer was in contact with many agencies throughout Greece and managed to collect $200,000 for the fund. Heizer was married three times.

Originally published in 1956 when Moore was eighteen years old, the novel gained notoriety from readers and critics for its frank depiction of teenage sexuality, and its discussion of the taboo topics of homosexuality and gender roles. The plot focuses on fifteen-year-old Courtney Farrell and her destructive upbringing between her father, a wealthy Manhattan publisher, and her mother, a faltering Hollywood actress. Upon its release in 1956, the novel became an international sensation and was published in multiple languages, with many critics drawing comparisons to the 1954 French novel Bonjour Tristesse by Françoise Sagan. Chocolates for Breakfast went out of print in 1967, and was not reprinted in the United States until Harper Perennial re- released the novel in June 2013. This marks its first re-printing in North America in over forty-five years. Plot The book opens with Courtney Farrell and her best friend Janet Parker at a New England boarding school, arguing over Courtney's attachment to her English teacher, Miss Rosen, whom Janet derides as \\"queer.\\" Later the school pressures Miss Rosen to not talk to Courtney outside of class, and Courtney falls into a depression. She leaves school and joins her single mother, Sondra, in Hollywood. As Sondra struggles to find work as an actress, Courtney often has to take care of her and manage their situation. She also takes up with Sondra's friends, including Barry Cabot, a bisexual actor with whom she has an affair, though he breaks it off to return to his male lover. Courtney often expresses a wish that she were born a man, as in this conversation with her teacher Miss Rosen: > \\"Don’t you think of yourself as a woman?” Miss Rosen said, amused. \\"No, not > really,\\" Courtney said thoughtfully. \\"I don’t think the way they do. Men > always tell me that I think like a man. It would be a lot simpler if I were > a man. I guess. But maybe it wouldn’t be. .../... Since I can remember I’ve > dreamt that I am a man. I hardly even notice now that in all my dreams I’m > myself, but a man. I wonder why that is,\\" she mused. Courtney and Sondra move to New York, where Sondra hopes to work in television and where Courtney's father Robbie might be able to give them more support. There she reunites with her friend Janet and they go from cocktail parties at the Stork to all-night debutante balls on Long Island. Courtney becomes fascinated by Janet's friend Anthony Neville, an aristocratic esthete who lives out of the Pierre hotel and has homes in the Riviera and the Caribbean. She and Anthony become lovers but hide it from Janet, who was involved with him in the past. Most of the characters in the book are heavy drinkers, with the exception of Courtney and a young man named Charles Cunningham who gradually emerges as a love interest, although Courtney initially finds him too \\"straight arrow.\\" Janet's father stands out as an alcoholic who \\"no longer cared for the niceties of companionship or ice in his bourbon.\\" He often beats down the door behind which his wife and daughter hide from his rages. Janet leaves home to live first with Courtney and then with a lover. When she returns, her mother has fled to a sanitarium and her father is alone and drunk, and blames his daughter for ruining their lives. > Coldly, with the full force of his body, he slapped her...He fell upon her > and forced her onto the couch and lay above her as a lover might, and she > was terrified . . . As her body went limp in his arms he rose and walked > over to the window. Thank God, she thought. Thank God he got up.\\" Soon after, Janet jumps from the window to her death. In the aftermath, Courtney ends her affair with Anthony. The novel ends with Courtney on her way to see Charles Cunningham and her parents for dinner, while Anthony contemplates returning to his island in the fall. The last line notes \\"how quickly the summer had gone.\\" Critical and scholarly response Chocolates for Breakfast is sometimes included in lists of early lesbian fiction, for the depiction of the relationship of two schoolgirls at an East Coast boarding school, Courtney's attachment to her teacher Miss Rosen, and the backlash against them from the other teachers and students. A detailed exploration of this genre, with a footnote linking Moore to the French tradition, appears in Contingent loves: Simone de Beauvoir and Sexuality by Melanie Hawthorne. Marion Zimmer Bradley, author of The Mists of Avalon, examined Chocolates for Breakfast in a 1965 article, \\"Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Fiction,\\" where she pronounced it \\"less melodramatic [than Faviell's Thalia] but perhaps more realistic and telling,\\" and advanced the hypothesis that Courtney's 'sexual promiscuity and dissipation' could be traced to her rejection by Miss Rosen at the beginning of the book. In The Catalog Of Cool, filmmaker Richard Blackburn includes Chocolates for Breakfast which he describes as \\"the ultimate teen sophisticate fantasy.\\" Writer Rachel Shukert selected a passage from Chocolates for Breakfast as her inclusion in an anthology of erotic writing, calling it \\"a product of an all-too-brief vogue for novels about sexually precocious poor little rich girls.\\" In popular culture Alternative rock musician Courtney Love has stated that her mother, Linda Carroll, named her after the protagonist of the novel. As Robert Nedelkoff points out in his retrospective on the literary and social significance of Moore's work, the name Courtney became common as a girl's name only in the years after the novel's publication. In the series Feud, Joan Crawford is portrayed rejecting the book as a possible movie source.

The story follows a teenage girl called Shelley, who must accompany her mother to work in the summer holidays as her mother has no other way of minding her. Her mother works at a hostel for people with disabilities, and Shelley meets a boy called Ben, who really likes her, but is afraid of water. Shelley helps teach Ben to overcome his fear of the water. Book The book was published in 1986. It addresses topics of disabilities and literacy and is discussed in numerous works about those topics. Kirkus gave it a starred review: \\"This is an extraordinary book in honestly depicting the fear and cruel taunts that are common and perhaps natural in children who confront people who are different before they understand their humanity.\\" Another reviewer puts it among contemporary junior novels comparable to Beverly Cleary's classic Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby books, as involving conflict in the youthful protagonist who, like the reader, is struggling to establish their own autonomy. Susanne Gervay cites the book as an example of \\"children's and youth literature becoming more confronting and realistic\\", addressing a range of conditions \\"either as a primary or more frequently as a secondary theme\\", along with Two Weeks with The Queen (1989) by Morris Gleitzman, which addresses AIDS and cancer. She notes Boss of the Pool (1986) \\"sensitively\\" tackles \\"intellectual disabilitites and learning difficulties\\". By contrast, the reviewer for the School Library Journal noted that Shelley was an unsympathetic character, and described the book as \\"just too dreary to be enjoyable\\".DiGianni J. Boss of the Pool (Book Review). School Library Journal [serial online]. June 1988;34(10):105. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 14, 2015. By contrast, the reviewer for the Canberra Times felt that Shelley's emotional growth was depicted well, although they described the novel as \\"slightly didactic\\".Attractive titles for younger readers, Laurie Copping (2 August 1986) The Canberra Times (p. B2) Jenny Kendrick describes it as one of a number of \\"books in which the character with learning difficulties is not allowed to evolve at all, and is merely a vehicle for the development of the other child or children\\". Some of these are books in which \\"the young characters with learning difficulties...are not only the sketchiest of stereotypes, but demonised as well\\", but Boss of the Pool, as well as Elizabeth Laird's Red Sky is \\"a 'caring' narrative\\": Boss of the Pool is a book \\"in which the focaliser becomes a better person because of his or her circumstances, although the catalyst could indeed have been any crisis, since the character with learning difficulties is only superficially presented.\\" At least two teaching guides for using the book have been published. (under Teaching Resources section) =Honors= The National Library of New Zealand includes it in their list of \\"classics\\" of \\"young fiction\\". The book is listed in the KOALA (Kids Own Australian Literature Awards) Hall of Fame. Play Boss of the Pool is also a play by Scottish-Australian playwright Mary Morris. It was adapted from the novel of the same name, by Robin Klein. =Plot= Shelley is embarrassed when her mother starts working at the ‘retard farm’. Why can’t she get a decent job? At the pool, Ben is afraid of the water, but persists in hanging around the edge, and Tania in the wheelchair is organising a disco. =Productions= Boss of the Pool, the play, was first performed by Acting Out on 7 July 1990 at the Playhouse Theatre, Perth, and has been performed and reviewed a number of times since. =Other= Material from the play has also been used in a study of information literacy in Australian youth.

By establishing an encrypted connection with the Hotspot Shield servers, the service protects its users' Internet traffic from eavesdropping. Hotspot Shield was used to bypass government censorship during the Arab Spring protests in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya.  Overview  Hotspot Shield is developed and operated by Pango (former AnchorFree Inc.), a company in Silicon Valley with offices in the Ukraine and Russia. The first Hotspot Shield client app was released in April 2008 for Windows and macOS operating systems. It was expanded to include support for iOS and Android in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The Hotspot Shield client establishes an encrypted VPN connection with one of its supported public VPN servers, through which the user can connect to the Internet. The connection protects the traffic between the user and the server from eavesdropping, and the IP address of the client is not exposed. While the service cannot make users completely anonymous on the Internet, it can greatly increase privacy and security. Users can bypass censorship using Hotspot Shield by connecting to a VPN server located outside their country. Both the client software and the service are freemium: the main features of the client app, as well as a number of public servers are available free of charge, but users have to pay to get additional features, which include the elimination of advertisements, antivirus protection, connecting to more servers and choosing the geographic location of the service to which they connect.  International use  Hotspot Shield has been used to bypass Internet censorship in countries with strict Internet censorship programs. During the Arab Spring protests in 2010, protesters used Hotspot Shield to access social networking tools to communicate and upload videos. Hotspot Shield was also widely used during the Egyptian protests and revolution in 2011, when the Mubarak regime cracked down heavily on access to social media sites. In 2013, usage of Hotspot Shield increased in Turkey, in response to the suspected efforts of the Turkish government to censor social media and citizen access to international websites. In 2014, usage of Hotspot Shield increased in Hong Kong after the outbreak of the 2014 Hong Kong protests. In 2012, Hotspot Shield usage increased among Mac users in the United States and Europe, as 500,000 Mac users were infected by the Flashback virus. Hotspot Shield was used as a protection against the virus.  Critical reception  Hotspot Shield has generally received positive reviews by industry publications and websites. PC Magazine rated the software \\"excellent\\" and praised its status indicator, traffic encryption, connection speed at times and payment flexibility, but criticized the software's ad platform, website code injection, slowdown of overall response time and browser setting modifications. In August 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology issued an open complaint to the Federal Trade Commission which they state \\"concerns undisclosed and unclear data sharing and traffic redirection occurring in Hotspot Shield Free VPN that should be considered unfair and deceptive trade practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act.\\" CDT \\"partnered with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to analyze the app and the service and found 'undisclosed data sharing practices' with advertising networks.\\" In February 2018, a security researcher discovered an information disclosure bug in the app that results in a leak of user data, such as in which country the user is located, and the user's Wi-Fi network name, if connected.

In the postwar period it was enveloped by the city of Daejeon and is now a commercial and residential area. History =Korean War= Lt Gen Walker and Maj Gen William Dean at Taejon Airfield, July 1950 On 9 July 1950, Lieutenants James A. Bryant and Frank G. Mitchell flew the first FAC missions of the Korean War from Taejon. They flew into Taejon with two L-5G Sentinels modified with VHF radios but were unable to get the radio to work, borrowing two 24th Infantry Division L-17s, the lieutenants called down about 10 flights of F-80s on the advancing Korean People's Army (KPA) forces. The L-17s were soon replaced with T-6s equipped with AN/ARC-3 radio sets which demonstrated their value over the following days before being withdrawn to operate from Taegu. Following their defeats at Osan, Pyongtaek and Chonan, the depleted US 24th Infantry Division established a defensive line on the Kum River, north of Taejon. On 14 July 1950, the KPA attacked the Kum River line, by 16 July had broken through the U.S. defenses and the remnants of the U.S units fell back on Taejon.

The KPAF was able to make only limited use of the airfield as the UN forces had achieved air supremacy by early August 1950.

The Bus della Genziana. Cansiglio (Canséi or Canséjo in Venetian language) is a plateau in the northern-Italian Prealps, included in the provinces of Belluno, Treviso and Pordenone. Cansiglio is home to a very small Language island of Cimbrian. Geography The plateau rises immediately above the plain below, at more than above the sea level. It is in fact formed by a basin surrounded by rocky peaks, such as Monte Costa, the Cima Valsotta, Monte Millifret, Pizzoc and the Monte Cavallo; these mountains separate the Cansiglio from the short Val Lapisina valley and from Piancavallo. The plateau features several examples of Karst topography, including several sinkholes and ponors. The main ones are the Bus de la Lum, Bus della Genziana and Abisso del Col della Rizza, with a deepness of, respectively, -180, -585 and -794 meters. Most of the territory of Cansiglio is covered by woods, mostly composed of local beeches, although there are also non-autochthonous coniferous trees such as the European spruce. Due to the climatic characteristics of the plateau, the vegetation follows a more inverted distribution than usual: species typical of colder environments occupy the lower altitudes, and those typical of milder ones are at higher altitudes. Anemones grow in large number under the beeches in summer. Large open spaces are used as pastures for sheep and bovines. History Pre- historic remains showed that the area was inhabited since as early as the 8th millennium BC. However, the area is mentioned officially for the first time in a 923 document, a diplom by which emperor Berengar I of Italy donated it to the bishop of Belluno. An 1185 papal bull issued by Lucius III called it Campum silium. In 1404, together with Belluno, it became part of the Republic of Venice. After the latter's collapse and the period of Austrian dominance, it became a statal property under the Kingdom of Italy (late 19th century). During World War II Cansiglio was the seat of partisan resistance against the German occupation. After a mop-up operation in late August-early September 1944, which ended with a German-RSI victory, the Bus de la Lum was used as an improvised cemetery for casualties from both sides, as well as of local civilians killed by the Germans after the partisans had escaped.

The film premiered at the inaugural Los Angeles Fear and Fantasy Film Festival in 2012, where its lead actress Jacinta John won the best actress award for her portrayal of Scout Taylor. Synopsis Isolate is the story of Scout Taylor, a young woman who returns to the family’s remote cattle station after the sudden death of her mother. As an only child and with Brian her father suffering from a progressive and debilitating illness, she commits to leaving behind her coffee shop in the city and staying on at the farm to look after him and the property. On the day of her mother’s funeral, when all the mourners have left and she and her father are alone, Brian confesses he and her mother had made a pact. He tells Scout that her mother had promised to assist him in taking his own life before his illness would render his body useless, and eventually, painfully steal his last breath. But now, with her mother’s tragic death making that impossible, he turns to Scout to help him with his desire to commit suicide. Enraged by his admission, on this day of all days, Scout reveals that her mother had already tearfully confided the details of his plan some months earlier, a plan that she wasn’t as complicit with as he would have liked to believe. Rather than assist his suicide, Scout vows to help her father continue running the property while nursing him to a peaceful and natural death. One morning after feeding the horses, Scout returns home to cook her father breakfast only to discover he has disappeared. At first she is not overly concerned, but as the day wears on she begins to fear that in his now fragile state he may have had an accident, or worse. Alone and cut off from all communication, she sets about doing whatever she can to find him. As night falls, the darkness intensifies her fears, and after exhausting all possible solutions in finding him, she retreats back to the isolation of the house. It is back at the house, alone with her thoughts and conscience, that the reality and horror of this film unfolds, revealing a dramatic and twisting climax. Cast * Jacinta John as Scout * Terry Serio as Dad * Stephen Anderton as Richard * Ray Park as Mason Production Originally set in the Australian desert (the Red Center), the film had to be re-written to reduce the cost of filming so far out from their base in central Sydney. After scouring the Australian countryside, a 400-acre property situated sixty kilometers from Lithgow, New South Wales, was eventually found. It served as both the on screen Taylor residence, with all the requirements of a small cattle station, as well as the accommodation and production space to house the director and the cast for two weeks, where, with the exception of one scene, the film was entirely shot. Isolate is the third feature by filmmaker Martyn Park where he has worked entirely on his own, both during production and then later in post-production. It is also the first feature where he composed the score. Release Isolate premiered in the United States on 18 May 2012 at the Los Angeles Fear and Fantasy Film Festival. It was released in Australia on 22 August 2013. Awards Jacinta John, both the film's producer and lead actress won best actress awards at the 2012 Los Angeles Fear and Fantasy Film Festival, and the Indie Gems Film Festival.http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=18880&s;=Ne References External links * * Category:2012 films Category:Australian films Category:Australian drama films Category:Australian horror films Category:Australian thriller films Category:Films shot in Sydney Category:English-language films Category:Ghost films ","title":"Isolate (film)"},{"id":"39790960","text":"The Transit Hotel, also known as The Transit, was a hotel and tavern in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The city said the breakdown between the groups began after U.S. cricket director Darren Beazley stepped down in March. Despite losing the national cricket tournament, city officials completed the project, scaling back the number of fields from five to three and eliminating plans for a concession pavilion, maintenance building, and additional parking, which helped the project come in about $1 million under budget. With the changes, one of the three fields was not built to \\"international standards for professional play\\", according to the Indianapolis Business Journal. At the complex's first major cricket tournament, only one field was approved for international play, as it had a natural-turf oval; the secondary field is synthetic. Unlike larger U.S. facilities such as Central Broward Regional Park, the facility lacks floodlights, a pavilion, a clubhouse or changing rooms for players, a media area, concession stands, and bleachers for fans. The project was controversial in Indianapolis. The facility's funding came from the city's \\"RebuildIndy\\" initiative, which was intended to fund infrastructure improvements. Indianapolis City-County Council members criticized the mayor and the project, saying the money would be better spent on roadwork and sidewalks. Also, the project was seen as an extravagant expense for a city which at the time was facing a $40 million budget deficit and a crime wave with an understaffed police department. The complex is located in a residential area on the east side of the city with several houses on the north boundary within a batsman's striking range. During construction, irrigation pumping at the park was alleged to have depleted several nearby water wells. The city lowered some residential pumps and replaced at least one well, costing about $15,000. Events The first event held at the park was a local Gaelic games tournament in August 2014, with local and regional cricket matches also held that year. In May 2015, the park hosted its first international cricket event, the 2015 ICC Americas Twenty20 Division One tournament. The U.S. cricket team and national teams from Bermuda, Canada, and Suriname participated. Canada and USA advanced to the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier, a feeder tournament for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Bermuda was relegated to ICC Americas Twenty20 Division Two. Total attendance for the 24-match tournament was fewer than 1,000 people, with 60 spectators reported at one game. The main cricket field was hailed as being of Test-match quality, according to the groundsman who worked at the facility during the event. \\"It's a full sand carpet outfield which is pretty much the world's best standard practice for building outfields. The drainage is phenomenal,\\" he said. Cricketers David Hemp and Nicholas Standford respectively praised the outfield as \\"magnificent\\" and the facility as \\"excellent\\". Despite the praise, writer Peter Della Penna noted that \\"most other aspects outside the ropes were makeshift accommodations that would only be suitable at amateur level\\", citing the lack of standard amenities for players, fans, and media. Indianapolis hosted the inaugural ICC Americas Combine in September 2015. After the International Cricket Council approved six Caribbean Premier League matches to be played in the U.S. in 2016, the venue was mentioned as a possible host. However, the games were slated for Central Broward Regional Park in Florida, the only American venue approved for one day international matches by the International Cricket Council. When the ICC Americas cricket office was relocated from Toronto in 2016, Indianapolis was reported to be \\"a particularly strong contender\\", though Colorado Springs, Colorado was ultimately selected.

The company was created by the sale of the two German shipyards in Wismar and Warnemünde and the shipyard in Mykolaiv in Ukraine by the Norwegian company STX Europe (formerly Aker Yards) to the Russian-controlled investment company FLC West.  History  In March 2008, Aker Yards sold the majority of the two German shipyards and the Ukrainian shipyard to the Russian-controlled investment company FLC West, which is controlled by the entrepreneurs Andrei Burlakov (), Sergey Morozov (Russian: Сергей Морозов) and Evgeniy Zaritsky (). (The three shipyards were renamed Wadan Yards MTW Wismar, Wadan Yards Warnow GmbH and Wadan Yards Okean OJSC.) The three shipyards became part of the new company Aker Yards Ukraine Holding, of which FLC West held 70 percent and Aker Yards held 30 percent. The transaction was effective retrospectively from 1 January 2008, and since 22 September the shipyards have gone by the name of Wadan Yards.NDR: Aker-Werften heißen jetzt Wadan Yards, of 22 September 2008 (archived link, 22 September 2009) The purchase price was 248.9 million euros.Finanznachrichten: Aker Yards completes FLC West deal, of 29 July 2008 The agreements between STX Europe and FLC West included contracts for four container ships, to be delivered in 2010. The agreements also included an option for Wadan Yards on a 21.3-percent holding in the Finnish technology company Aker Arctic, in which STX Europe previously (as of 2008) held 71.4%.STX Europe: Annual Report 2008, accessed 5 October 2009 The holding company, Wadan Yards Group AS, was based in Oslo. =German subsidiaries file for bankruptcy= On 5 June 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy.NDR: Wadan Werften melden Insolvenz an (archived link, 1 September 2009) In the course of the insolvency proceedings, the shipyards in Wismar and Warnemünde were acquired by Nordic Yards. On 5 June 2009, the German parts of the company (Wadan Yards MTW GmbH, Wadan Yards Warnow GmbH, Wadan Yards Warnow Real Estate GmbH, Wadan Yards LNG Technology GmbH, Wadan Yards MTW Real Estate GmbH) filed for bankruptcy at the court in Schwerin. The Schwerin lawyer Marc Odebrecht, a member of the law firm of Brinkmann & Partner was appointed as administrator. In mid- August 2009, the administrator succeeded in finding a buyer for the shipyards and their assets. The head of the Moscow Nordstream office, Witali Jussufow (), the son of the former Russian Minister of Energy and Gazprom board chairman Igor Jussufow () acquired the shipyards for approx. 40.5 million euros via the Nordic Yards vehicle created by him. The creditors' committee approved the purchase retrospectively from 17 August 2009. Yusufov announced that he would retain half the 2500 workforce. He issued a job guarantee for 1200 employees. Following the sale of all assets, the insolvent companies of the German Wadan Yards are now a legal shell without content, via which Wadan creditors' claims are to be settled.cf. Landesregierung stimmt Werft-Verkauf zu at focus.de, 17 August 2009 =Legal challenges to the transfer of the Ukrainian shipyard = The Ukrainian shipyard was transferred to different companies in the weeks before konkursåpning (bankruptcy proceedings, in March 2010), and eventually was transferred to a company in the British Virgin Isles—Dartwell. (Templestowe Trading Corp hired the lawyers that transferred the Ukrainian shipyard.) Johan Ratvik was appointed administrator, and he asked Økokrim and the Oslo Police District to investigate for bounndragelse (withholding assets from the estate). The estate of the bankrupted Norwegian company (konkursboet) made a deal with Kostjantin Zjevago: Zjevago acquired claims of 50 million euro that the bankrupted company has against the Ukrainian shipyard, in addition to Zjevago receiving the shares in Okean—the company that owned 98.7% of the Ukrainian shipyard. If Zjevago is successful in recouping the assets, then the bankrupted estate will get a share of that. In a spring of 2012 press release Tom Einertsen announced Zjevago's lawsuit, saying \\"The transfer of shares and loans were part of an operation to withhold (unndra) great assets from creditors. The transfers were illegal. Our goal is to get the shipyard back.\\" Zjevago has sued, in Amsterdam, five companies and a Swiss lawyer. In New York, Zjevago initiated a discovery court process, to demand access to the documentation of a U.S. law firm that assisted in transferring the ownership of the shipyard, to companies—first in the British Virgin Isles, then Panama, then Netherlands, and then back again to the British Virgin Isles. Court hearings in New York are scheduled to proceed in July 2013. =Allegations of money laundering= On 29 September 2011 the former owner of the company, Andrey Burlakov was murdered in a restaurant in Moscow.Criminal case initiated in Wadan Yards ex- owner's murder A 2013 article in Dagens Næringsliv reported what Aleks Bezborodov (one of Russia's best known shipping analysts) has said to InfraNews: \\"Andrej Burlakov was the first Russian to buy a shipbuilding company abroad. Only a crazy man would have bought a shipbuilding company without the consent of the [Russian] government. It looked more like an attempt at laundering money, rather than a reell investment.

That is odd. Then when things went wrong, everyone started looking for scapegoats\\".

Artist Gertrude K. Lathrop designed the piece; she was chosen after work by Lorrilard Wise was rejected by the federal Commission of Fine Arts (CFA). The coin depicts a fatted calf on one side, being led by John Pell, who sold the land on which New Rochelle now stands; the other shows a fleur de lis, an element of the city seal of New Rochelle and of France's La Rochelle, its eponym. The piece is dated 1938 but was minted the previous year. The New Rochelle piece was the last new-design commemorative struck by the Mint until 1946. Aware of the many commemorative issues being authorized by the U.S. Congress in the mid-1930s, members of the Westchester County Coin Club sought a half dollar for the New Rochelle anniversary. They gained the support of members of Congress, who secured the passage of legislation for the half dollar during 1936. After Wise's work was rejected, Lathrop was hired based on her work on the Albany Charter half dollar (1936). She decided to depict the \\"fatte calfe\\" which was to be presented annually to Pell if he asked for it, lest New Rochelle's land be forfeited back to him. The CFA approved her work, and the coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1937. New Rochelle's coin committee sold the half dollar for $2 locally, and by mail order to all 48 states and internationally, during late 1937 and early 1938. When sales slowed, 9,749 pieces were returned to the mint for redemption and melting. They have risen in price and now sell in the low hundreds of dollars. Lathrop's work has been both praised and criticized by numismatic commentators.  Background  The city of New Rochelle, New York, in Westchester County, was founded by Huguenots from La Rochelle in France in 1688. The following year, Jacob Leisler, their agent, purchased from John Pell a tract of some on which the city now stands. One of the conditions was that Leisler would give to Pell and his heirs \\"one fatte calfe\\" on June 24 of every year thereafter, if demanded. British-American political theorist Thomas Paine later owned land in New Rochelle, which was incorporated as a village in 1858 and as a city in 1899. It is a suburb of New York City. Sparked by new issues with low mintages for which the demand was greater than the supply, the market for United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Congress authorized an explosion of commemoratives in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. One coin authorized and issued in 1936 was the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, controlled and profited from by Thomas G. Melish and issued to celebrate a nonexistent anniversary. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several half dollars minted in previous years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926. By April 1936, Congress had reacted to these practices, adding protections to commemorative coinage bills. These included a requirement that all coins be struck at a single mint, rather than all three then operating as with earlier issues (the use of mint marks would force coin collectors to buy three near-identical coins to have a complete set). Such provisions were in the New Rochelle half dollar bill; they could only be coined at one mint and all pieces were required to bear the date 1938, though the authorization took place in 1936 and the striking of the coins in 1937. They would be issued at face value to a committee of not less than three members appointed by the mayor of New Rochelle. The moving force behind the New Rochelle issue was the Westchester County Coin Club, including collectors Julius Guttag (of Guttag Brothers, a prominent New York City coin dealer) and Pitt M. Skipton, who planned the issue to avoid the abuses of earlier commemoratives. The issue originated in discussions between club members, who were aware of the many commemoratives being issued in the mid-1930s. The idea was attractive as the piece would help fund the 250th anniversary celebrations in New Rochelle, rather than draw on taxpayers strained by the Depression. The coin club, at its November 1935 meeting, appointed Skipton as a one-man committee to make the necessary contacts to gain authorization for the issue.  Legislation  Statue of Jacob Leisler, New Rochelle, New York Bills for a New Rochelle half dollar were introduced in both houses of Congress in January 1936; in the Senate by Royal S. Copeland and in the House by Charles D. Millard, both of New York. Skipton had contacted both legislators, who had agreed to help, though Senator Copeland had warned, \\"The President is pretty hard-boiled on this subject.\\" The House bill reported back favorably from the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures on February 17, 1936, proposed amendments increasing the authorized mintage from 20,000 to 25,000 and requiring there to be a committee of not less than three people to order the coins on behalf of New Rochelle. The House adopted the amendments and passed the bill without debate on March 16.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 3800 (March 16, 1936) The Senate bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency; it was one of several commemorative half dollar bills to be considered on March 11, 1936, by a subcommittee led by Colorado's Alva B. Adams. Senator Adams had heard of the commemorative coin abuses of the mid-1930s, when issuers increased the number of pieces needed for a complete set by having them issued with different dates and mint marks; authorizing legislation placed no prohibition on this. Lyman W. Hoffecker, a Texas coin dealer and official of the American Numismatic Association, testified and told the subcommittee that some issues, like the Oregon Trail pieces, had been issued over the course of years with different dates and mint marks. Other issues had been entirely bought up by single dealers, and some low-mintage varieties of commemoratives were selling at high prices. The many varieties and inflated prices for some issues that resulted from these practices angered collectors trying to keep their collections current. The Senate took no further action on Copeland's bill, but on March 26, Senator Adams reported back the House bill to the Senate, entirely rewriting it to incorporate protections such as requiring all of the New Rochelle coins to have the same date and mint mark, and to be issued to the sponsoring organization in lots of not less than 5,000. He recommended that future commemorative coin bills have similar protections. The Senate considered the bill on March 27, the fifth in a series of six commemorative coin bills being considered by that body, and like the others, the New Rochelle bill was amended and passed without debate or dissent.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, pp. 4489–90 (March 27, 1936 ) As the two houses had passed different versions, the bill returned to the House of Representatives. On April 17, John J. Cochran of Missouri moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment, though with one change: that instead of no less than 5,000 being issued at one time, no less than 25,000 could be issued at one time. Cochran explained to Marion A. Zioncheck of Washington state that this was for the protection of the collector. The House agreed without further debate,1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 5653 (April 17, 1936) and on April 27, on the motion of Adams, so did the Senate.1936 Congressional Record, Vol. 80, Page 6275 (April 27, 1936) President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill into law on May 5, 1936. According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, \\"Having visited New Rochelle on two or three occasions, I don't quite comprehend why this town rates a commemorative coin ... But apparently it must have, and it does have, some active collectors who apparently knew the art of string-pulling and got the bill for the coin through Congress for an issue of 25,000 coins which will be distributed at $2 per.\\"  Preparation  The New Rochelle Commemorative Coin Committee was formed by Mayor Harry Scott of New Rochelle with the membership being Pitt Skipton as chair, Ernest H. Watson as treasurer and Jere Milleman as secretary. Assisting was Amy Skipton, spouse of Pitt Skipton, who served as executive secretary. The Committee initially hired Lorrilard Wise to design the half dollar. He depicted a Native American sitting among vegetation watching the settlers' ship sail in before a rising sun for the obverse, with a representation of New Rochelle's coat of arms for the reverse. On July 17, 1936, the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins, considered the design and raised several concerns, including whether the man depicted was based on a member of a local tribe. In a letter dated July 20 to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary M. O'Reilly, the Commission suggested the obverse be entirely redone. Wise submitted new models on August 17, and these were approved by the CFA on September 6. In the meantime, the Coin Committee was receiving many orders, and some would-be purchasers were becoming impatient. Members of the CFA almost immediately reconsidered, Sculptor-member Lee Lawrie believed the design about the best that Wise could do, and given the few sculptors he believed capable of the work, was inclined to let the issue go ahead. Eugene Savage and Gilmore Clarke, also members, did not agree and after rejecting a design revision on October 23, the CFA asked that the New Rochelle Committee hire a new sculptor. By mid-November, the Skiptons had seen an example of the Albany Charter half dollar, designed by Gertrude K. Lathrop, who was hired to replace Wise and who spent many hours in New Rochelle, studying local views. Lathrop's appearance in New Rochelle came as something of a surprise to Pitt and Amy Skipton, who knew of her as G.K. Lathrop, and had assumed she was a man. After several meetings between Lathrop and Pitt Skipton, both decided on the fatted calf for the obverse and a fleur-de-lis, an element of the shield of New Rochelle, for the reverse. The CFA took some time to decide, apparently under the impression the old coat of arms reverse was still to be used. Lathrop knew President Roosevelt from his days as Governor of New York and went to Washington to lobby for her designs; on her return she stated the CFA would approve the calf obverse and that both reverses were acceptable. After discussion, the Coin Committee affirmed its support of the fleur-de-lis design. On February 18, 1937, the CFA approved both of her designs with the concurrence of the new sculptor-member, Paul Manship. It conveyed its approval to Director of the Mint Nellie Tayloe Ross the following day. On March 12, the Treasury Department received $300 to pay for the coinage dies for the issue (by law the sponsoring committee's responsibility) and in early April it received $12,500 to pay in advance for the half dollars. Design The obverse shows a fatted calf, roped and held by a man in elegant dress who is meant to be John Pell. Lathrop studied paintings in the possession of Pell's descendants to achieve the likeness. The model for the calf lived on Kenwood Farm of Albany, New York, owned by Parker Corning, congressman from New York, and was a thoroughbred Guernsey calf lent to the sculptor. Lathrop stated that the calf was a bit unruly at first, but grew so accustomed to her presence that it would kiss her on the nose when it was allowed. The sculptor intended, with the calf design, to inject a touch of humor while maintaining dignity and beauty. Arranged in arcs around the periphery of the obverse are the legends \\"NEW•ROCHELLE•NEW•YORK\\" and \\"SETTLED•1688•INCORPORATED•1899\\". The artist’s initials \\"GKL\\" appear to the right of the calf’s forelegs. The half dollar's reverse depicts a Fleur de lis, an element found within the city’s coat of arms and borrowed from the arms of La Rochelle, France. Arranged in arcs around the periphery are the statutory inscriptions \\"UNITED•STATES•OF•AMERICA, E•PLURIBUS•UNUM, LIBERTY\\" and \\"IN• GOD•WE•TRUST\\". The date 1938 and value \\"HALF•DOLLAR\\" appear at the bottom in two lines. The New Rochelle half dollar is the last U.S. coin to have denticles along the rim, a feature that had been previously eliminated on the circulating coinage. It was also the last new- design commemorative to be struck by the U.S. until 1946. Frank Duffield, editor of The Numismatist, wrote at the time of issue that \\"Again Miss Gertrude K. Lathrop, of Albany, has scored with her designs for the New Rochelle half dollar. The Albany coin, also designed by her, is regarded by many collectors as one of the most attractive in the entire commemorative series.\\" Numismatist Stuart Mosher, in his 1940 work on commemorative coins, praised the New Rochelle piece, stating that Lathrop \\"has produced in this one a most pleasing effect. The calf was modeled from life, and the colonial costume on the figure of Lord Pell has been accurately reproduced according to the style of that period. One of the handicaps belaboring every artist who attempts to design a coin for the United States government is the multiplicity of legends that must be used so as to comply with our coinage laws. In this instance the artist has arranged them in an orderly manner on the reverse, thus avoiding the cramped effect so often found on our coins when the designer attempts to crowd too many ideas into a small space.\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on American coins and medals, called the New Rochelle half dollar \\"a simple, bold, and absolutely tasteless coin\\". He wrote that \\"aestheticians demanding bovine fidelity can take comfort in the fact\\" that the calf's model came from Congressman Corning's farm. Vermeule stated, \\"it is small wonder that, on seeing a coin such as this, President Franklin Roosevelt urged a moratorium on their issue. More distressing is the fact that the accumulated prejudice against commemorative half-dollars\\" meant that none were issued, twenty-five years later, for the Civil War Centennial, despite the \\"clever fare in the artistry of American coinage\\" provided by \\"fatted calves\\".  Distribution and collecting  In April 1937, a total of 25,015 New Rochelle half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint, 15 pieces being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1938 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. As the Bureau of the Mint deemed it undesirable to turn the coins over to the Westchester County Coin Club, they were instead sent to the First National Bank of New Rochelle, where they arrived on April 16, 1937. Lathrop visited and stated she was pleased with the new half dollars. At the bank, the many mail orders were processed by the Skiptons and others; the bank also had a window for locals wanting to buy a few coins. They were sold through local banks and through mail order at $2 each plus postage and insurance for coins sent through the mails. The first coin struck was presented to Mayor Scott; the second to the president of the Westchester County Coin Club. The Coin Committee filled orders from all 48 states, Puerto Rico, Hawaii Territory, the Canal Zone, Canada, New Zealand and the Dutch East Indies. By 1937, the market for commemoratives had crashed due to too many different issues, and sales ground to a halt after just over half the coins sold. Members of the Coin Club bought several hundred specimens at face value, and 9,749 half dollars were returned to the Philadelphia Mint in mid-1938 for redemption and melting. This left a total of 15,266 coins extant, counting the assay pieces. The profits generated by the sale were used to help fund the city's 250th anniversary celebrations in June 1938. Fifty pieces were struck in proof condition on polished planchets, each placed in a box along with a silver medal and presented to dignitaries, members of the Coin Committee, and selected members of the Westchester County Coin Club. At least one piece was struck in matte proof for Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock. By 1940, the New Rochelle half dollar sold for $1.75, and reached $6 by 1950. By 1970, the market price was $67 and by 1985, $500. The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2018, lists the piece for between $310 and $425, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold for $3,593 in 2006. The requirement that Pell's family be presented with a fatted calf became void after the American Revolution; with title to the land no longer subject to forfeiture, the presentation has been made from time to time since, for example on the 250th anniversary of settlement in 1938 and the 300th in 1988. On the latter occasion, those representing the Pell family included Claiborne Pell, U.S. senator from Rhode Island. The calf refused to cooperate with events and it took four men to drag it onto the stage before it was allowed to return to its abode on a farm in Granite Springs; the roast beef served at the luncheon that followed came from a less fortunate source. Had a calf been purchased, rather than borrowed, for the ceremony, it would have cost about $1,000 for the gift to William Rodman Pell 2d, '\\"sixteenth claimant to the Lordship and Manor of Pelham\\", who would have been unable to take it home, as local ordinances forbade the keeping of livestock.

Its public health driven business model aims to lower the prices of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C medicines and facilitate the development of better-adapted HIV treatments through voluntary licensing and patent pooling. Its goal is to improve access to affordable and appropriate HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis medicines in low- and middle- income countries. Creation The Medicines Patent Pool Foundation was established as an independent legal entity in July 2010 with the support of Unitaid and has been fully operational since November 2010. It is based on the idea that patents are intended to reward innovation, and that unless licensed, a patent can also prevent the production or sale of affordable, quality- assured generic medicines and the development of novel formulations. The Medicines Patent Pool negotiates with patent holders for licences on HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis medicines. These licences permit lower-cost manufacturers to distribute patented medicines in developing countries. Licences also provide the freedom to develop new treatments better suited for resource-limited settings, such as paediatric formulations and fixed-dose combinations. Competition among many manufacturers should bring prices down supporting treatment scale-up. Financing The Medicines Patent Pool was founded and is funded by Unitaid, a global health initiative that is working with partners to end HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and hepatitis C and works to allow more affordable generic medicines to enter the marketplace in low- and middle-income countries. In its first grant phase 2010-2015, the MPP worked exclusively in the HIV field and in December 2014, Unitaid approved another funding package for MPP to continue its HIV work through 2020. In November 2015, the MPP mandate was expanded to hepatitis C and tuberculosis treatment. The Medicines Patent Pool was the first and is now the only independent patent pool that aims to tackle the issue of access to HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and tuberculosis drugs in low- and middle-income countries. Structure The MPP has two governing bodies: a Governance board (i.e.Executive Board) composed of 9 members and an Expert Advisory Group comprising 12 members, it also works with ad hoc experts. The current Chair of the Governance Board is World Health Organization (WHO)’s former Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation Marie-Paule Kieny, who succeeded Sigrun Møgedal, chair since March 2016 and Charles Clift, the MPP’s founding chairman. Executive Directors: Charles Gore (2018), Greg Perry (2013-2017), Ellen 't Hoen (2010-2012). Activities The Medicines Patent Pool negotiates public-health driven licences with patent holders, and sub- licenses to generic manufacturers to encourage the sale of lower-cost generic versions of medicines in over a hundred developing countries. In October 2012, the MPP, Gilead Sciences and the UN National Institutes of Health/University of Illinois were honoured by the Licensing Executives Society (United States and Canada) (LES) for licence agreements that expand access to affordable HIV medicines in developing countries. The LES’s annual \\"Deals of Distinction\\" Awards are presented to notable intellectual property agreements in five industry sectors and the three parties were recognised for precedence-setting licensing agreements dedicated to improving public health under the Industry- University-Government Interface category. As of 2018, the Medicines Patent Pool holds licences for 13 HIV antiretrovirals, an HIV technology platform, 2 hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals and 1 investigational treatment for tuberculosis from patent holders AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, MSD, ViiV Healthcare, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Liverpool, the US National Institutes of Health and Pharco Pharmaceuticals. The MPP also worked with Janssen and Boehringer Ingelheim to extend their non- assert policies for paediatric darunavir formulations and nevirapine, ensuring that the companies will not assert their patent rights in many more developing countries. The organisation signed an agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche to increase access to valganciclovir, an important treatment for an HIV opportunistic infection. In 2018, the foundation announced a new five-year strategy to improve access to medicines in low- and middle-income countries, which supports international public health goals for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C.

It is maintained at key locations across state and active only on orders from the deputy inspector general and higher-level authorities. It is usually assigned to VIP duty or to maintain law and order during fairs, festivals, athletic events, elections, and natural disasters. They are also deployed to quell outbreaks of student or labor unrest, organized crime, and communal riots; to maintain key guard posts; and to participate in antiterrorist operations. The Provincial Armed Constabulary is equipped with INSAS semi automatic guns and usually carries only lathis while controlling the mob during unrests. UP-PAC consists of a total of 20,000 personnel as of 2005, composed of 36 battalions located in different cities across the state as a wing of Uttar Pradesh Police. Each battalion is commanded by an IPS officer of Senior Superintendent rank, and has seven to eight companies consisting of 120 to 150 Jawans, each company headed by a State Police officer of Inspector rank, who is usually referred to as Company Commander in the PAC. The PAC is headed by the Director General Provincial Armed Constabulary (DG PAC).Official website Uttar Pradesh Police Awards Mohammad Isa Company Commander of IV Battalion of the UP-PAC stationed at Allahabad was awarded Police Medal for Gallantry on 14 January 1957 for his successful encounter with armed dacoits in a forest near the Kurat village. History Following is the summary of events related to UP- PAC: *1937-1941: In 1937, a decision was taken to organise a Police force of sanctioned strength of 7,000 personnel to be organised along Military lines. The PAC Act stated the aim as an Act to raise an armed force for Law and Order duties, to be organised and drilled on Military lines. The first 2 Companies were accordingly raised by Colonel Thompson of the 1st Brahmans with the help of Landlords of Deoria and Ballia and from landlord's militias and retired sepoys. The first two companies were raised in 1937 and were paid for entirely by subscription of the landlords and businessmen. 15 battalions of United Provinces Military Police were raised from fresh recruits and retired military jawans between 1937 and 1942, the majority (6 battalions) from Bhumihars and Rajputs from the Eastern part of the State (Poorvanchal), and 5 battalions with Jats and Tyagis from Meerut, Baghpat, Kairana, and Muzaffarnagar mixed with Poorvias; 3 battalions with Lodh and Jats from Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Hathras and Bulandshahr mixed with Poorvias and Tyagis/Jats both ; and 1 battalion raised from Jats, Rajputs and Ahirs of Moradabad, Bareilly, Aonla, Pilibhit, Badaun and Shahjahanpur, mixed with Poorvias. So from the beginning, the martial races and specifically the Bhumihars and Rajputs of Poorvanchal constituted a majority of the composition of the force. Each Battalion had 4 companies and each company was to be headed by a DySP. *1948: United Provinces Military Police and United Provinces State Armed Constabulary were amalgamated into the United Provinces Provincial Armed Constabulary by enactment of The U.P. Pradeshik Armed Constabulary Act, 1948 - Uttar Pradesh *1950: Renamed to Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary due change of name of state *1956: Renamed to Uttar Pradesh Pradeshik Armed Constabulary by encatment of U.P.

A unit called Special Police Force (SPF) previously existed to operate in cooperation with Indian Army. In the 1990s the SPF was merged into the 9th battalion of the PAC, which is situated in Moradabad. The 46 Battalion called Task Force existed till 1998 (Jawans use to wear insignia of Tiger on their Uniform's Arms), with the special task to fight Dacoits and Insurgents on achieving its goal was again converted to normal PAC Battalion (Presently located at Rudrapur, under Uttarakhand Provincial Armed Constabulary). In May 1973, 12 battalions of the UP-PAC revolted and the Army was called in to control. About 30 policemen were killed and hundreds were arrested and dismissed from service. In 1982 two petitions to disband UP-PAC were filed in Supreme Court.

History In late 1921, the VFA granted the Geelong & District Junior Football Association permission to establish a new senior club to be admitted to the Association. The new club was called the Geelong Football Club; it was typically referred to as Geelong (Association) or Geelong (A.) when required to distinguish it from the Geelong Football Club of the same name which was affiliated with the Victorian Football League. The Association was keen to operate a club in Geelong, as it saw an opportunity to take some of the market share in the town which had been dominated by the League since 1897. At the time there were two high quality football venues in Geelong: Corio Oval, which was used by Geelong (L.), and the newly upgraded Kardinia Park, into which the new Geelong club moved. The club wore purple and gold in its first season, before switching to the same navy blue and white colours worn by Geelong (L.). The club spent six years in the competition, but with a playing list composed primarily of junior players, it never achieved much on-field success. Its best result was a win-loss record of 4–14 (achieved twice), and it won three wooden spoons. By 1925, the club was struggling off-field as well as on-field. It nearly folded at the administrative level during the 1925 season – under which a new and independent committee would have taken over the playing list left behind – but the existing administration remained, and in 1926, the club moved from Kardinia Park to the Western Oval in West Geelong. By 1927, Geelong had become a financial burden to the rest of the Association. The team was not well supported, so its crowd numbers were the lowest in the Association, with an average gate of only £18 per game in its final year; after venue expenses were deducted, there was little left for the visiting clubs, who were then forced to cover the cost of travel to Geelong. As such, the Association excluded Geelong from its senior ranks after the 1927 season, opting to admit Yarraville in its place.

At the end of the event, in just 16 hours, one (PlayMySong) of the four startups presented by Invesdor successfully closed its round with 25,000 euros (125% of the minimum target) raised from 35 investors. In January 2014 Invesdor and Privanet, a Finnish company focusing on trading of unlisted shares, set up a partnership to offer a secondary market for crowdfunded offerings. The trading of the shares will start in spring 2014 and the partnership will allow both Finnish and international investors to sell and buy crowdfunded shares in a secondary market, in order to have an easy exit from their investments. In March 2014, Invesdor and other Nordic companies in the crowdfunding field (Booomerang, Mesenaatti, Karolina Fund and bidra.no) launched the Nordic Crowdfunding Alliance in cooperation with the School of Business and Law of the University of Agder. The aim of the alliance is to help young entrepreneurs in the Nordic region to raise money for their ideas, matching them with possible investors. In April 2014 Invesdor was chosen by Red Herring (magazine) as one of the 100 most promising companies and entrepreneurs in Europe for the year 2014. Invesdor is the only crowdfunding platform listed by Red Herring for the year 2014. In June 2014, Invesdor successfully closed a crowdfunding round through its own platform raising a total of 290,871 euros from 135 investors from 13 different countries. This round was opened in hidden mode, only allowing the people who have already invested through the platform to invest in it. Invesdor received 121 new shareholders as a result of the round. In April 2015 Invesdor became the first fully licensed (MiFID) equity crowdfunding platform in Europe. Invesdor's license is fully passportable across the EEA. Operation model  Invesdor focuses on equity crowdfunding for startups and growth companies. Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and UK companies can raise up to 2.5 million euros through Invesdor, while investments can come from anywhere in the world. The minimum for each investment is 20 euros. The service follows the “All-or-Nothing” model, in which pledged funds are only collected from the investors if the minimum goal set by the company being funded is reached by the end of the crowdfunding campaign. The company seeks to position their service as a low-threshold option by having a low minimum investment and a general scarcity of paperwork during the process. =Regulation= The Finnish legislation surrounding donations- and reward-based crowdfunding differs from that of most of Europe, which makes donation-based crowdfunding impossible and complicates reward-based crowdfunding in Finland. However, these issues don’t apply to equity-based crowdfunding, as the legislation around it is more similar to that of the rest of Europe. Invesdor is reported to be the first equity crowdfunding platform in Europe to have secured a fully passportable MiFID Investment Firm license. Successful projects Invesdor counts 115 successful rounds with 54 million euros raised: *NetOutlet, in August 2012, was Invesdor's first successful project.

He was born in Nøtterøy as a son of Elias Petterøe (1844–1887) and Amalie Elisabeth Hansen (1849–1933). In 1902 he married treasurer Karen Abel Helene Elise Falchenberg (1874–1945). His daughter Aase (1904–59) followed him as CEO on his death. She was married to chief physician Knut Aas, and another daughter Eva (1908–94) was married to architect Christian Astrup. He moved to Kristiania in 1892, took commercial training and was hired in Tiedemanns Tobakksfabrikk. In 1900 he established his own company, an import and trade company for tobacco, and in 1905 he founded the tobacco factory H. Petterøe Tobakkfabrikk. Within ten years he led the third largest tobacco company in Norway, and one of the few newer tobacco establishments that managed to thrive. He aligned with the Liberal Party, chairing the party chapter in Kristiania city from 1910 to 1913 and serving as a deputy city councilman from 1911 to 1916. Petterøe also chaired the municipal provisioning council in Kristiania from 1916 to 1922. After this he was selected by the government as chair of Vinmonopolet, serving from 1922 to 1926, and was a shareowner and board member of the Liberal newspaper Dagbladet from 1912 to 1935. He served as chair from 1921 to 1923 and since 1929. He withdrew from Dagbladet after a row with editor-in-chief Einar Skavlan, who he deemed too critical to the Liberal government. From 1920 to 1923 and in 1931 Petterøe chaired the interest organization Tobakksfabrikantenes landsforening. He was also a board member of Centralbanken from 1922 to 1926 and of Kristiania Port Authority. He died in September 1939 in Oslo.

The order was founded in Italy and first arrived in England during the reign of King Henry III; opening their first friary in London in 1257. Pope Gregory X suppressed the order in 1274 leading to the closure of the European friaries of the order. Those in England, however, continued to operate without Papal legitimacy; some until the final dissolution of the monasteries under King Henry VIII.F.A. Gasquet, English Monastic Life, pp. 234-242. The Brothers of Penitence lived a severe life. They wore rough sackcloth and walked either barefoot or with simple wooden sandals. The friars of the order never ate meat and were only allowed to drink water. The Leicester Friary was founded before 1283. The friary is thought to have been located just beyond the Western Gate of Leicester's old town walls.Thomas Moule, The English Counties Delineated, Volume 2, p.87. The friary was closed before 1295, when Oliver Sutton, Bishop of Lincoln, forbade the former site from being converted for secular use.

It is available on all iPhone models beginning with iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1 or later. According to Apple's website, all major vehicle manufacturers are licensing CarPlay. Vehicles without CarPlay can have vehicle audio products from automotive aftermarket suppliers fitted. Software Apple's own CarPlay-enabled apps include: * Phone * Apple Music * Apple Maps * Calendar (introduced in iOS 13) * Messages * Audiobooks (part of Apple Books) * Podcasts * Settings (introduced in iOS 13, CarPlay-specific settings only) * News (introduced in iOS 13) * Google Maps Support Developers must request permission from Apple to develop CarPlay- enabled apps. Such apps fall into four categories: * Audio: primarily provide audio content, such as music or podcasts. Examples: Amazon Music, Audible, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, QQ Music, Spotify, and Overcast. * Navigation: turn-by-turn guidance, including searching for points of interests and navigating to a destination, functions that were introduced in iOS 12. Examples: AutoNavi, Baidu Maps, Google Maps, and Waze. * Automaker: Introduced in iOS 9, these automakers-made apps allow a user to control vehicle-specific features such as climate controls, gas levels, or radio via CarPlay. * Messaging/Voice over IP (VoIP): listen to new messages and reply using dictation in an audio-only interface, and was introduced in iOS 10. Messaging apps on CarPlay integrate with third-party Siri support (known as SiriKit), while VoIP apps integrate with the iOS calling interface using CallKit. Examples: Telegram, WhatsApp, and Zoom. * iOS 14 adds the ability to run food ordering and parking services apps. To discourage distracted driving, Siri is used extensively, providing voice turn-by-turn navigation guidance and voice- input for text messages. Newscast-style weather and stock results are announced instead of displayed visually. Requests that bring up visual information may be blocked when CarPlay is in use; most native CarPlay Apps deliver audio content with minimal interaction. CarPlay-enabled apps installed on the device also appear on the CarPlay home screen. =Dashboard= iOS 13 adds Dashboard, an alternative to the app home screen, that presents a split layout of maps, media information, calendar, or Siri Suggestions. It also adds Calendar to the home screen, allowing suggested events to link towards map directions to the event location. A new Settings app enables users to configure certain CarPlay specific settings, such as switching between light and dark modes, adjusting album art in CarPlay’s Now Playing screen, or enabling Do Not Disturb While Driving while in a CarPlay session. Third party maps may also be displayed on the dashboard. Hardware While most of the CarPlay software runs on the connected iPhone, the CarPlay interface provides the audio and display connection to the car's infotainment system. CarPlay adapts to various display sizes and control interfaces for each vehicle: touch screen, rotary dials, buttons, steering wheel controls, and hands free microphones. Aftermarket head units may support CarPlay and/or Android Auto. Aftermarket head units can be purchased from Alpine, Clarion, Kenwood, Pioneer, Sony, and JVC. A non-official way to enable Apple CarPlay is to install a CarPlay API on a headunit running an Android based operating system.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygP2XuuYkcE&list;=PLf12ntiGVFKnWLzE3lDBy17piteWLmfXm&index;=6 =Wireless CarPlay= iOS 9 adds support for wireless connectivity. The iPhone exchanges network credentials with a supporting CarPlay receiver over Bluetooth, and then establishes a two-way Wi-Fi connection between the devices. Additionally, there are dongle adapters that enable a wireless connection to the system's USB port. Manufacturers Most major automakers offer vehicles with CarPlay. Manufacturers with no CarPlay models include Lada and Tesla Motors. Honda offers CarPlay on the Gold Wing motorcycle, and will in 2020 offer it on the Africa Twin. History =Predecessor= The concept of CarPlay was based on the little-known (and -used) Apple iOS 4 feature called \\"iPod Out\\" that was produced through several years of joint development by Apple and the BMW Group's Technology Office USA. iPod Out enabled vehicles with the necessary infrastructure to \\"host\\" the analog video and audio from a supporting iOS device while receiving inputs, such as button presses and knob rotations, from a car's infotainment system, to drive the \\"hosted\\" user interface in the vehicle's built-in display. It was announced during WWDC in 2010 and first shipped in BMW Group vehicles in early 2011. The BMW and Mini option was called \\"PlugIn\\" and paved the way for the first cross-OEM platforms, introducing the concept of requiring a car-specific interface for apps (as opposed to MirrorLink's simple and insufficient mirroring of what was shown on the smartphone's screen). =Development= CarPlay's codename was Stark. Apple's Eddy Cue announced it as iOS in the Car at the 2013 WWDC. In January 2014 it was reported that Apple's hardware-oriented corporate culture had led to release delays. CarPlay was launched as \\"CarPlay\\" at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2014 with Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo among the first car manufacturers. =Adoption= June 2013: BMW officials announced that their cars would not support CarPlay; they later changed their minds. November 2013: Siri Eyes Free mode was offered as a dealer-installed accessory in the US to some Honda Accord and Acura RDX & ILX models. In December, Honda offered additional integration, featuring new HondaLink services, on some US and Canada models of the Civic and the Fit. September 2014: A Ferrari FF was the first car with a full version of CarPlay. November 2014: Hyundai announced the Sonata sedan will be available with CarPlay by the end of the first quarter of 2015. December 2015: Volvo implemented CarPlay in the 2016 XC90. January 2016: Apple released a list detailing the car models which support CarPlay. April 2017: The new generation Scania range became the first heavy duty truck in Europe to support CarPlay. July 2017: The new Volvo VNL became the first heavy duty truck in the United States to support CarPlay. October 2017: The 2018 Honda Gold Wing became the first motorcycle to support CarPlay. January 2018: The 2019 Toyota Avalon became the first Toyota model with Apple CarPlay. July 2018: Mazda added CarPlay support to vehicles newer than 2013 and equipped with the MZD-Connect system. August 2018: Harley-Davidson CarPlay support was added to 2019 Touring models equipped with Boom! Box GTS radio.https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/owners/audio-navigation/boom-box- gts.html December 2019: BMW no longer requires a subscription to use CarPlay. Competition The Open Automotive Alliance's Android Auto is a similar implementation used for Android devices. Some vehicle manufacturers have their own systems for syncing the car with smartphones, for example: BMW ConnectedDrive, Hyundai Blue Link, iLane, MyFord Touch, Ford SYNC, OnStar, and Toyota Entune. General Motors has released an API to allow the development of apps that interact with vehicle software systems. MirrorLink is a standard for car-smartphone connectivity, currently implemented in vehicles by Honda, Volkswagen, SEAT, Buick, Skoda, Mercedes-Benz, Citroën, and Smart with phones by multiple manufacturers including Apple, HTC, Sony, and Samsung.

History The priory was established in 1882. By 1929, the church had proved too small and Friar Vincent McNabb O.P. began to raise money for a new church. The choir and transepts of the church was completed by 1931, and the High Altar was consecrated. The church was finally completed and formally consecrated in 1958. The priory has had two church organs. The first were built by J Porritt & Son of Leicester in 1861. It was moved to the south side of the choir when the first part of the new church opened in 1931. The organ was, however, too small and difficult to play, and so a new organ was brought. The replacement came from St Mary's Church in Preston, Lancashire, and was built by William Ebenezer Richardson in 1880. The friars preach in the village of Woodhouse, at the University of Leicester, De Montfort University and Leicester Royal Infirmary and teach at Blackfriars, Oxford.

The Wescape development, proposed by urban development company communiTgrow, is 3,100 hectares (31 square kilometres) and once completed will reportedly include 200,000 houses, 400 education facilities (schools, crèches and colleges), 370 public service facilities (such as libraries and clinics) and 15 sports complexes. The companies behind the Wescape development state that it will be worth R140 billion and create 300 000 jobs over 20 years. The developer, communiTgrow, describes the Wescape community development model as incorporating industry, technology, food security, infrastructure, waste processing, energy reduction and production in a holistic manner, minimising environmental impact from urban growth. ‘Green lung’ public spaces will be integrated into residential nodes and community areas.  Location  Wescape is located to the north-west of Cape Town, 25 kilometres from the central business district (CBD). The site is north of the R304 route and west of the N7 national highway, north-east of the seaside town of Melkbosstrand.  History  Planning for Wescape began in 2006 as a joint venture between developers, project managers and urban designers. Companies behind the development include Bellandia (property developers), ARG Design (town planners and urban designers responsible for The MyCiTi Bus stations, and Cape Town Station ); Ariya and Target Projects (project management companies behind Cape Town Stadium, the Cape Town International Convention Centre and the Cape Town International Airport upgrade) and Pact Developers. communiTgrow put forward the plan for Wescape to deal with the demand for houses in Cape Town. Cape Town’s population is growing yearly. In 2001 it was 2,9 million, and by 2011 it had reached 3,7 million. There is already a backlog of homes and it is estimated that between 277,000 and 400,000 people are awaiting subsidised housing. One of the plan’s supporters is reportedly City of Cape Town's former mayor Patricia De Lille, with the Cape Times newspaper quoting De Lille as being “excited” about the R140 billion development. The City of Cape Town approved the application to extend the urban edge to accommodate Wescape in December 2012.  Project Details  Wescape plans to have 200,000 homes, housing around 800,000 people and aims integrate all necessary public amenities. Wescape developers have said that the project will provide all the bulk infrastructure required, including water, energy and waste services, and all internal roads. The city will feature around 400 education facilities, 30 health facilities, and 15 sports complexes. There will be shops, factories, parks and public open spaces. = Approach = Wescape’s plan is based on communiTgrow’s approach to urban development, which identifies six pillars as the foundation of a community, namely Economy, Homes, Education, Governance, Health and Regenerative Ecology. The Pillars co-operate to provide solutions which address multiple challenges in the various sectors of a community, allowing people and the environment to benefit. = Timeline = According to the proposal, the development would involve 10 phases over the next 20 years with building beginning in 2015 and completed around 2035. = Homes = The developers of Wescape state that it will consist of different types of homes and a range of unit types. Half of all the homes developed will be affordable for those households who fall into the GAP market (the gap housing market consists of households who typically earn too much to qualify for government subsidised housing, but too little to participate in the current private property market). The other half will be placed on the open market, aimed at households with income levels above the subsidy eligibility bands. = Infrastructure = Developers have stated Wescape has built provision of bulk services into its economic model and that the private urban development company, communiTgrow, will develop all the bulk services required, including infrastructure for water, energy, waste and all internal roads. = Transport = The plan for Wescape includes the promotion of walkable neighbourhoods, pedestrian-oriented pathways, non-motorised transport routes, and an internal public transport system. The Integrated Rapid Transit Bus Service which will link Cape Town to Atlantis will also run through the site proposed for Wescape. Wescape developers have also put forward that the railway line that runs through Cape Town’s Western Growth Corridor to Atlantis will service Wescape once it is converted to a commuter service, although this is yet to be confirmed.Cape Times 27-03-2013 \\"Row over plan to house 1m people on city edge\\" The proposed road networks that will service Wescape include the R27 to Saldhana, along which the IRT runs to Atlantis, the M12 connecting Milnerton to Atlantis and the N7 connecting internationally up the west coast of Africa. In an east-west direction, the northern arm of the R300 will pass over the centre of the Wescape site bringing in traffic from the N1 and Metro-South- East. It will connect with the M12 in a diamond intersection. The R304 from Philadelphia cuts through the northern part of the site and will eventually link all the way across to the R27. = Environmental Impact = The Wescape developers state that the development is being designed to be responsive to climate change by maximising the re-use of water, utilising solar power and reducing energy consumption through conscious Urban Design and through the use of cutting-edge technologies. Wescape plans also state that it aims to reduce waste to landfill by up to 90%. The Wescape plans claim that over 20% of the total land area in the development will be given to greening in the form of the central Metropolitan Open Space System (MOSS) which links the biodiversity corridors of the city and runs through the valley system of the site and consists of urban agriculture, forests, civic landscape or bioswales.  Criticism  Wescape has faced criticism from residents of the nearby town of Melkbosstrand as well as some prominent academics. = Residents of Melkbosstrand = Residents of Melkbosstrand have objected to the impact Wescape might have on the suburb near to the proposed site. David and Cathy Butler, who live on a smallholding adjacent to where Wescape is to be built, said in a submission to the City of Cape Town that “This development will degenerate into nothing more than a low-cost housing, informal settlement slum, which will impact heavily on the value of property”. communiTgrow developers have argued against this characterisation of the development, and stated in reply to the Butler’s complaint that they were “speculating on the essence of what Wescape will be”. = Urban Edge = Wescape has faced criticism due to its location outside of the Urban Edge of the City of Cape Town. Wescape has applied for the urban edge to be shifted to include the proposed development site. Wescape developers have argued that there isn’t enough land closer to the inner city to accommodate the proposed development and that where sufficient vacant land does exist, it is owned by private development companies like Milnerton Estates, who have already earmarked it for developments which will not provide suitable homes for lower income households. Critics put forward that one of the purposes of this hypothetical border is to protect agricultural land beyond it. Professor Vanessa Watson, of the University of Cape Town’s School of Architecture, Planning and Geomatics, stated that “Given the long-term loss of agricultural land and growing issues of food insecurity, we should be doing everything we can to protect productive agricultural land”. Watson stated that “A 2010 City of Cape Town study showed that even at current low densities there is enough land within the urban edge to accommodate growth until 2021”. Wescape developers have stated that the land on which the development is located has an arid and exhausted soil system, and that it is no longer productive as farmland. Nancy Odendaal, senior lecturer in city and regional planning at the University of Cape Town stated that the idea of a clearly delineated urban edge for Cape Town is important because it is the most sustainable option and will be better served by transport infrastructure. Because of this, it makes more sense to house people in existing urban areas by filling up vacant land before developing the city outwards. = Distance from Cape Town = The location of Wescape has also been questioned. The site is located 25 kilometres from the Central Business District (CBD) of the City of Cape Town, and critics put forward that this distance will locate people away from jobs in the city, and residents will be faced with high transport costs. Wescape developers claim that, much like the towns of Bellville, Somerset West and Muizenberg, the Wescape development will not depend on the CBD to satisfy the needs of residents. Other commentators have argued that integration of the city is not only about distance, and that Wescape would support a more efficient public transport system.Cape Times, 20 June 2013, \\"City Limits Needn't Stifle Ideas\\" = Koeberg Nuclear Power Station = As is already the case with parts of Melkbosstrand, Blouberg and Atlantis, the Wescape development would be within the 5 km to 16 km Urgent Protective Action Planning Zone of Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and concerns have been raised about the speed at which an evacuation could take place in case of an emergency. ComminiTgrow has said it is “fully aware” that a nuclear regulatory evacuation model and assessment would be required before development rights could be granted and that it would provide a suitable evacuation plan and that the relevant plans and guidelines are being factored into the spatial and movement design of Wescape.Cape Times, 5 June 2013  External links  * Wescape * communiTgrow  References   * Category:Cape Town Category:Urban development ","title":"Wescape"},{"id":"39791431","text":"James Seth (1860–1925) was a Scottish philosopher.

A former United States citizen, he renounced that citizenship in June 2013 to naturalize in Taiwan so that he could play for the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team in international competition. He currently plays for Pure-Youth Construction Basketball Team. Childhood and education Davis was born in Los Angeles, California in an African American family. He graduated from McGill-Toolen Catholic High School in Mobile, Alabama in 2002 before going on to Tulane University, where he played for Tulane Green Wave men's basketball. As a freshman, in a game against the University of Southern Mississippi he matched the school record for single- game field goal percentage. In his four-year career there until 2006, he scored a total of 1,106 points, including 56 games with more than 10 points and 12 with more than 20. He collected 559 rebounds, including 226 offensive rebounds, making him one of just fourteen players in school history to achieve both a thousand points and five hundred rebounds. He also set the school record with a .577 career field goal percentage. Early career Davis first went overseas to play for ETHA Engomis in Cyprus in 2006. The next season, he played in Portugal. In February 2008 he signed with , a Liga Profesional de Baloncesto team in Venezuela. There, he appeared in eight games, averaging 5.5 points per game. The following year, he moved to mainland China to play in the National Basketball League. After his next season in Turkey, he came to Taiwan to join Pure-Youth Construction in the Super Basketball League. In March 2012, he won SBL's Player of the Month award for leading his team to a 6–1 record that month with an average of 20.1 points, 14 rebounds, 1.9 blocks, two assists, and 1.4 steals per game. Davis also became a partner in Coast To Coast Basketball, a basketball instruction institute founded in 2007 by fellow expatriate player Edward Hardy II. Naturalization in Taiwan The suggestion that Davis might join the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team was first floated in January 2013 at the SBL 2012 MVP award ceremony. At the time, Davis stated that he was open to the idea of naturalizing as a Republic of China citizen so he could represent Taiwan in international competition. He said that of all the places in which he had played basketball, he felt happiest in Taiwan. However, naturalization would require him to renounce his United States citizenship, as Taiwan allows multiple nationality only for its own citizens who have emigrated, and not for immigrants applying to become new citizens. Furthermore, as Davis did not meet the ordinary residence requirements for naturalization and his case would thus be processed by special dispensation, Taiwan sports officials also had to lobby for the support of the Ministry of the Interior. Contract length and salary negotiations introduced further delays, until in May 2013 it was announced that Davis had agreed to a US$20,000/month, two-year contract and had officially applied for naturalization. On 25 June 2013, Davis went to the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. embassy, to renounce his citizenship. The AIT processed his case much more quickly than would have been done under normal procedures, and he received his Certificate of Loss of Nationality three days later, temporarily making him a stateless person. There remained doubts whether the Ministry of the Interior could complete all the procedures relating to his naturalization by the 12 July deadline for him to register for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship, but in the end he was officially naturalized as a citizen of the Republic of China on 9 July. Taiwanese American players such as Richard Chang had previously joined the Chinese Taipei team, but Davis was the first American of another ethnic background to follow in their footsteps. Unlike most male citizens both naturalized and native-born Davis will not be required to serve in the Republic of China Armed Forces because men over tall are exempt from conscription in Taiwan. Later career Davis played with the Chinese Taipei team in an exhibition game against visiting National Basketball Association players from his former country on 29 June, scoring 25 points. He then represented the Chinese Taipei team in the 2013 William Jones Cup and in the FIBA Championship 2013, where he scored an average of 14.7 points per game. Davis led the team to second place in the 2014 FIBA Asia Cup, scoring 19 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the final game against Iran. Davis was barred from participating in the 2014 Asian Games because he had not fulfilled the residency requirements to represent Taiwan as a naturalized citizen. Uncle Q Uncle Q is a vegan restaurant in Taipei opened by Davis at the end of 2019. The restaurant primarily serves American style food. Personal life He is married to a Taiwanese national.

Valognes Abbey () is a 17th-century Benedictine abbey located in Valognes, France. Establishment In 1623, Jean de Raval, Lord Tourlaville, and his wife Madeleine de la Vigne offered de la Vigne's cousin enough money to establish a monastery on the proviso that de la Vigne's would become the first abbess or \\"superior\\". The following year, the Bishop of Séez gave permission for a group of nuns to join the new abbey. Plague prevented the nuns from taking up their new posts and construction did not begin until 1631. Later that year, enough construction had been completed so as to offer the nuns basic shelter and some took up residence. Finally King Louis XIII awarded a charter to Charlotte de la Vigne but she was not officially appointed until 1647. Construction was finally completed in October of that year. Later history Like other abbeys of France, Valognes suffered during the French Revolution and the persecution of religious orders. During World War II, the abbey and its surroundings were heavily bombed. In a single fortnight in June 1944, 84 bombs fell in the monastery. The nuns returned to a heavily damaged abbey. In 1953, a nun who had taken refuge in the abbey during World War I returned, was elected superior and led efforts to rebuild the monastery. Though the abbey remains active, with resident nuns, most of the buildings have now been converted into the modern Hôpital de Valognes.

Sometimes known as \\"Good Earl John\\", he has been described as \\"the most prominent British Catholic of his day\\", although he was the last Earl of Shrewsbury to follow the Catholic faith. John was also Lord High Steward of Ireland, an office the Earls of Shrewsbury have held since 1446. Biography John was born on 18 March 1791;TowersTimes.co.uk : Alton Towers : Earls of Shrewsbury Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page son of John Joseph Talbot (9 June 1765 – 8 August 1815) and Catherine Talbot (Nee Clifton).The Peerage: John Joseph Talbot. He inherited his titles in 1827 from his paternal uncle, Charles Talbot, 15th Earl of Shrewsbury. Alton Towers from across the ornamental lake Among the estates he inherited from his uncle was the Talbot family's main home, Heythrop Park, which burned down in 1831. After the fire, John moved the family to another of his inherited estates, in Staffordshire. The house had originally been known as Alverton Lodge, and had been enlarged by the 15th Earl, who enclosed the park and started creating the formal valley gardens to create \\"Alton Abbey\\" (the name \\"Abbey\\" was chosen because it was fashionable -the site had no religious connections). John continued his uncle's work at Alton, developing and expanding the house and estate further; he renamed it Alton Towers. John was a \\"patron of the Gothic revival\\"National Portrait Gallery, John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury and commissioned noted Gothic revival architect Augustus Pugin to work at the towers. Alton Castle from across the Churnet Valley In addition to the building work at Alton Towers, John set about rebuilding nearby Alton Castle. The castle occupies a rocky precipice above the River Churnet on the outskirts of the village of Alton, Staffordshire. On a site fortified since Saxon times, the 12th-century castle had fallen into ruins by the 19th century. John had most of the ruins demolished, engaging Pugin again to design a new gothic-revival castle, which was built to resemble a French or German medieval castle. It is unclear why the 16th Earl had the castle rebuilt. It may have been intended for his cousin and eventual successor, Bertram Talbot (17th Earl of Shrewsbury); or it may have been intended as a Dower House for the Earl's wife, if he should predecease her. Towards the end of the castle's construction, the earl suggested the castle could be a home for priests, but Pugin was \\"vehemently against the idea\\".Alton Towers Heritage: The 16th Earl and Castle Hill John is remembered as \\"Good Earl John\\" for his charity, having supported local schools and churches, and financed the construction of new Catholic chapels around the Midlands. Among the buildings he helped finance is St Chad's Cathedral in Birmingham. Adjacent to Alton Castle, John had a new church constructed alongside a \\"replica of a medieval hospital, a guildhall and presbytery\\"; this was again to the designs of Augustus Pugin. The Earl's friend, Ambrose Philips, convinced him to construct a monastery: this idea developed into the hospital complex that was built, as John felt it \\"could do more good for the community\\" than a monastery. The \\"hospital\\" served as a \\"humanitarian almshouse\\", providing for the poor and elderly of the parish. The buildings also provided lodgings for poor and elderly priests, with an attached library and dining room. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was also used as a school for local poor children. John died on 9 November 1852, aged 61. His funeral was held in the Chapel of St Peter, Alton Towers, on 14 December 1852 'The Pugins and The Catholic Midlands', by Roderick O'Donnell, where an illustration is also included. John and his wife are buried in St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church, the church John built adjacent to Alton Castle. Family John married Maria Theresa Talbot (died 8 June 1856The Peerage: Maria Theresa Talbot), daughter of William Talbot of Castle Talbot, County Wexford, Ireland. They had 3 children: *The Hon. John Talbot; their only son, died in infancy. *Lady Mary Alathea Beatrix Talbot; married Prince Filippo Andrea Doria (died 19 March 1876The Peerage: Prince Philip Andrew Doria-Pamphilj-Landi) in Rome in 1832. Mary and Prince Filippo had met at Queen Victoria's Coronation. Victoria suggested her as one of the eight coronal train-bearers as a gesture towards her father being \\"the oldest earl in the kingdom and a Roman Catholic\\" (the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 had been passed less than a decade earlier). Mary was created \\"Prinzessin von Bayern\\" (a Princess of Bavaria) by King Ludwig I of Bavaria. *Lady Gwendoline Catherine Talbot; born 3 December 1817 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Lady Gwendoline was described by King William IV as the \\"greatest beauty in the realm\\". She also married an Italian Prince: Prince Marcantonio Borghese, 8th Prince of Sulmona. The pair married 11 May 1835The Peerage: Mark Antony Borghese, Prince Borghese in Rome. Gwendoline died of Scarlet fever in Rome, 27 October 1840, aged only 22. Gwendoline and Marcantonio had 4 children. Their 3 sons all died of measles shortly after Gwendoline's death. Their daughter, Agnese, married to become Duchess of Sora.

The Market House was completed in 1838, originally to house a market in the western half of the building and the guildhall in the east. The basement below the guildhall originally contained cells for prisoners, while the first floor was used as a grammar school from 1867 to 1898. The upper storey of the western end housed the Corn Exchange which also served a dual purpose as a theatre. It was officially opened on 28 June 1838. The western part of the building is now occupied by Lloyds Bank while the rest of the building is unused and in need of repair. Construction The Corporation of Penzance organised an architectural competition for the building of a new market house on the site of the original. Originally H J Whiting of London was awarded the contract to build the new market house but sued for damages when the Corporation decided to use plans by the Bristol architect William Harris instead. Local councils were subject to increasing Government control by the passing of the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act and it was decided to use a cheaper scheme — Whiting won compensation worth £300. Samuel Teulon was one of the unsuccessful architects. The foundation stone was laid on 11 July 1836 and the building was opened on the day of Queen Victoria's Coronation, 28 June 1838. Built from granite ashlar, the building is crowned by a lead-covered dome and octagonal lanternRetrieved 25 June 2013 which is visible from much of the town, and from neighbouring villages. The eastern end consists of four ionic columns with a portico known as tetrastyle and overlooks a main thoroughfare (once the A30) of Penzance and a statue of Humphry Davy. The Market Building was designed to > direct its users attention away from the vulgarity of the streets and the > uninspired and often depressingly ugly uniformity of the town. Tenants and current owners The eastern part of the building remained as the guildhall until a new public building (200m to the west) was built on glebe land in Alverton and opened on 11 September 1867. The Penzance Grammar School (1789–1898) took over the council rooms and remained there until 1898 when it closed. Lloyds Bank took over the western half of the building in 1925 when they shortened it by some 15 feet and modified the entrance. The bank bought the building from the Borough of Penzance in 1965 for £35,000. The western half of the building is still occupied by Lloyds TSB bank and the shop units in the eastern half are vacant.

The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

He is known also for a contentious book on Lord Byron. Life Robert Charles Dallas was born in Kingston, Jamaica, where his father, Robert Dallas, M.D., of Dallas Castle, Jamaica, was a physician; his mother was a daughter of Colonel Cormack or Cammack. =Family background= Dr. Robert Dallas came to Jamaica from Scotland around 1730. His first wife was Mary Frances Main, daughter of Samuel Themer Main, a merchant of Kingston. Robert Charles Dallas was born 14 July 1754, the son of Robert Dallas and Sarah Hewitt née Cammack, who had married John Hewitt in 1751; Robert Charles was therefore illegitimate, and his parents married in 1769, in England, after John Hewitt's death. One of his brothers was Alexander James Dallas; there were at least two other brothers (one possibly a half-brother) and two sisters in the family. His father died in 1769. His will left his estate to his wife Sarah. Dr. Dallas bought the Boar Castle estate on the Cane River, Jamaica in 1758, changing its name to Dallas Castle. He left the island in 1764, having mortgaged the estate and put it in a trust. =Early life= Dallas was educated at Musselburgh, in Scotland, and under James Elphinston at Kensington, London. He entered the Inner Temple, but on coming of age went to Jamaica to take possession of the estates which he had inherited, and became an official there. After three years he visited England and married. He returned with his wife to Jamaica. He subsequently resigned his post and left Jamaica, for the sake of his wife's health. =Later life= Dallas lived on the continent of Europe, moving to the United States of America when the French Revolution occurred. He was disappointed in America, and returned to England. He sold the Dallas Castle estate on Jamaica, by 1810. He died in autumn 1824, at Sainte-Adresse in Normandy, France, and was buried at Le Havre. Works Dallas wrote a great deal: he said himself that he aimed to oppose the Jacobins and \\"confusion\\". =The History of the Maroons (1803)= \\"Old Cudjoe making peace\\", engraving from The History of the Maroons (1803) In 1803 Dallas contributed to the documentation of Jamaican history with The History of the Maroons from their Origin to the Establishment of their Chief Tribe at Sierra Leone, (2 vols). In part a general history of Jamaica, which was written by John Browne Cutting, the book concentrated on the Second Maroon War and the subsequent deportations, to Sierra Leone and Nova Scotia. Dallas had accounts from William Dawes Quarrell, who accompanied Maroons to Nova Scotia, and may be the plantation owner of Hanover Parish of that name; and William Robertson, who had served in the war. James Robertson the surveyor and cartographer made a map of the Cockpit Country for the book. This work was published in a period when much public attention had been given over to the revolutionary events in Europe. The matter had previously been treated by Bryan Edwards in an account first published in 1796. Dallas expressed disapproval of slavery, but defended some government positions. Dallas has been identified as also the author of the anonymous travel book A Short Journey in the West Indies (1790), mainly about Jamaica, which makes anti- slavery and anti-planter remarks. The Monthly Review commented that the author was cashing in on public interest in the slavery question, and had exaggerated the hardships. James Stephen, who was aware of Dallas's authorship of A Short Journey, regarded The History of the Maroons as a defence of slavery against his own book The Crisis of the Sugar Colonies (1802). =Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron= Dallas is best known for a connection with Lord Byron, and his Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron from the year 1808 to the end of 1814 appeared posthumously, by a tortuous route. His sister Henrietta Charlotte was married to the Hon. George Anson Byron, an uncle of Byron. Dallas introduced himself to Byron by letter on the publication of Hours of Idleness (1807). Dallas saw something of Byron after the poet's return from the Near East, gave him literary advice, and communicated for him with publishers; Byron in recognition gave him copyright for some of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and for The Corsair. But Dallas's didactic line palled, and Byron, after corresponding with Dallas in 1808–11, dropped him. Some letters addressed by Byron to his mother during his eastern travels were given to Dallas by Byron. Dallas, on the strength of these and other communications, prepared an account of Byron's life from 1808 to 1814. He notified Byron in 1819 that the Recollections were finished, and would be published only after his own death. When Byron died in April 1824, Dallas proposed to publish the Recollections. On the grapevine (via Byron's aunt Julia Heath) Augusta Leigh, Byron's half-sister who was dealing with a number of would-be biographers, heard of the plan and objected strongly. Dallas won over George Anson Byron, his brother-in-law. John Cam Hobhouse and John Hanson, Byron's executors, obtained an injunction from Lord Eldon against the publication of the letters. Extracts from the Recollections appeared in The Courier, in November 1824, but about a month behind Thomas Medwin's Conversations of Lord Byron. By the time of the Courier publication, Dallas had returned to France and died. There was a French version, and his son Alexander Dallas had the book published in 1825, in Paris, beyond the English court's jurisdiction, if also much changed. =Other works= Dallas's other works included: * Miscellaneous Writings, consisting of Poems; Lucretia, a Tragedy; and Moral Essays, with a Vocabulary of the Passions, 1797. * Percival, or Nature Vindicated, 4 vols. 1801, novel. * Elements of Self-Knowledge (compiled and partly written by Dallas), 1802. * Aubrey, 4 vols. 1804, novel. * The Marlands, Tales illustrative of the Simple and Surprising, 4 vols. 1805. * The Knights, Tales illustrative of the Marvellous, 3 vols. 1808. * Not at Home, a Dramatic Entertainment, 1809. * The New Conspiracy against the Jesuits detected, 1815 (in French, 1816). * Letter to C. Butler relative to the New Conspiracy, 1817. * Sir Francis Darrell, or the Vortex, 4 vols. 1820, novel. * Adrastus, a Tragedy; Amabel, or the Cornish Lovers; and other Poems, 1823. His Miscellaneous Works and Novels, in 7 vols., were published in 1813. Family Dallas married Sarah, daughter of Benjamin Harding of Hacton House, Essex; Rev. Alexander Robert Charles Dallas was their son. Harding was a slave-owner in Jamaica, whose will had been proved in 1766.

He has hosted So You Think You Can Dance Finland in 2010, The Voice of Finland 2011–2016 and The Voice Kids Finland 2012–2014. He was also the Finnish voice of Kristoff in the animated film Frozen. His career as a presenter ended after it came public that he had been secretly filming his sexual partners and sharing a picture and a video of his friend that contained sexually describable material in a WhatsApp group. Smith was born to an Iranian father and a Finnish mother.Axl Smith City His surname comes from his American stepfather, whom his mother married when Smith was young.KULISSIEN TAKANA: Muusikko ja MTV:n juontajatähti AXL SMITH Metropoli His maternal grandparents are Swedish. Controversy In February 2017, Axl “Cas” Smith was sentenced of having an undeclared video surveillance system following a criminal investigation, which found that he had set up one hidden camera in his one bedroom apartment, which filmed his sexual encounters without the consent of his victims being filmed - he was sentenced to 14 months of probation for secretly filming 29 women having sex. As of August 2018, Smith had paid over 100 000 euros but not the full court ordered retributions to his victims. On 1 March 2016, Smith was taken by police for questioning regarding allegations on having an undeclared video surveillance system in his one bedroom apartment. It was later revealed that the police are suspecting Smith of filming dozens of women without their consent during sexual intercourse. Due to the media attention, Smith resigned from The Voice of Finland and from his duties as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. On 2 February 2017 he received a suspended sentence of 1 year and 2 months and was ordered to pay 150,000 euros compensation to his victims. Smith had posted a picture and a video containing sexual material to a WhatsApp group called \\"Haippirinki\\" (\\"Hype ring\\"). Other members in the group were Finnish singer Thomas Kirjonen aka Kasmir and producer Henri Salonen aka Hank Solo. Before the trial Smith had sent defiant messages to Kasmir stating that if the filming would ever go to the court \\"the trial would be made public\\" and \\"the bitches would have to come there too and all the material would be revealed\\". During the trial Smith was trying to defend himself by using a story about a friend called \\"Peter\\" who allegedly had been framed for rape that destroyed his life. According to Smith this was the reason for his home video surveillance but it came clear during the trial that \\"Peter\\" was a fictitious character.

It is situated at 3° 39' 0\\" South and 37° 39' 0\\" East in the Pare Mountains. The people who live in Ugweno are known as Wagweno and their common language is Kigweno. View at the top of the North Pare Mountains of Ugweno  History  The original inhabitants of this area are the Shana clan. Even the name Ugweno (or \\"Vughonu\\" to its inhabitants) is derived from a notably popular Shana ruler, Mghonu, who ruled somewhere between the 13th and 15th century. A precise date is hard to establish given 'the great Shana disruption' when they were deposed of their rule. During his rule, the area was known as the \\"Mountains of Mghonu\\" as far afield as the Taita region in Kenya. Local church known as 'Kuvave na Eli\\" When the Suya people migrated to the region; ambushed and wiped out almost all of the Shana clan, the origins of the name Ugweno was either less known or played down by the new rulers. This led to various theories that claimed origins of this name. Some say it was derived from Taita and Voi tribes from Kenya during the migration to the Pare mountains due to tribal wars in their homelands in Kenya. Before they had established the settlement in the Pare mountains, they first sent explorers. When the explorers returned to give feedback, they said 'Mringa ua khona', meaning the rivers produce thunder when flowing, and the name Ugweno was allegedly born. The Suya people were responsible for the expansion of the state of Ugweno. In the 18th century, this state stretched as far south as Lembeni. The present day Gweno people are a mixture of all those who came to make the beautiful mountains of Ugweno their home. Historically, their ancestors came from Taita, Voi, Chaga, as well as Southern Pare tribes. This is why you can find many Gweno families today who trace their roots from elsewhere, such as the Suya, Sangi and Wanzava families. A good example are the Odongo (and others) who were called by the Suya from Nguru mountain region of Tanzania to prevent conflicts.  Tradition food  Kirembwe is their main dish made by a mixture of banana and beans. The mixture is cooked using a clay port. It can be crushed to create a hard porridge that looks like a cake when it cools; this (Kirembwe) is normally used for breakfast. Sometimes the mixture is ground and water then added to it, making it porridge-like, this is what is commonly eaten as Kiumbo.  Economic  The area's chief produce is coffee and banana. The area also produces maize and rice which is grown in the swampy plains.  Tourism attraction  Cloud cover in the morning Ugweno is situated in the Pare mountains with a clear picture of the beautiful Lake Jipe. This lake is an inter-territorial lake straddling the borders of Tanzania and Kenya. On the Tanzanian side, it is situated within Ugweno while on the Kenyan side, it is located south of the village of Nghonji. The lake receives water from North Pare mountain streams as well as Lumi, which descends from Mount Kilimanjaro. The lake's outlet forms the Ruvu river and the lake is protected by the Mkomazi Game Reserve which is nearby. The lake is known for its endemic fish, as well as water birds, mammals, wetland plants and lake-edge swamps, which can extend for about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from Lake Jipe's shore.

Generation Zero \\"was founded with the central purpose of providing solutions for New Zealand to cut carbon pollution through smarter transport, liveable cities & independence from fossil fuels.\\" The group believes that young people must be at the forefront of tackling climate change, and that \\"young people are the inheritors of humanity’s response\\".  Campaigns  = Power Shift conference = In December 2012, the first New Zealand Power Shift conference was held at Auckland University, attracting over 700 people. Modelled off an international phenomenon, over 40 workshops, speakers, and participants combined to produce a festive atmosphere for the three days of learning and upskilling about climate change. The flash mob dancing at the end of the conference attracted media attention. = 50/50 campaign = Generation Zero’s 50/50 campaign is calling for the Government to allocate a greater share of its transport spending to \\"smart transport\\" options such as public transport and cycleways. In 2012, 40 young people stripped down to their underwear on city trains to \\"expose the Government’s unbalanced transport budget\\". The group say they 'exposed' themselves in order to 'expose' the Government’s lack of interest in public transport. In June 2013, John Key confirmed the Government will back Auckland's rail link, but will delay the start of construction by five years to 2020. Generation Zero welcomed the move but expressed concern at the impact of the delay. Generation Zero developed an online form to help collect feedback on the Auckland city plan. = 100% Possible campaign = The 100% Possible campaign was a joint effort with 350.org Aotearoa and the WWF, and involved a week of awareness in late February and early March centred on possible ways to move towards cleaner energy and transport. In February 2013, 500 commuters in Wellington donned ribbons in support. In June 2013, Generation Zero called on the Government to \\"show it takes climate change seriously and stop subsidising fossil fuels\\", following the release of a report from WWF-New Zealand revealing oil and gas subsidies to the tune of $46 million per year. The report showed that the National Government’s support for the oil and gas industry through tax breaks and gifting of free exploration data and research had risen from $6 million in 2009 to $46 million. Consumption subsidies for off-road fuel use added a further $39 million.New report exposes Government hypocrisy on fossil fuel subsidies, WWF NZ, 4 June 2013 Spokesperson Paul Young said: \\"John Key’s Government has ramped up its financial and political support for fossil fuel industries in spite of the growing urgency to transition to clean energy.\\" = Elect Who?= Generation Zero launched a website to assist New Zealanders to find out what their politicians and parties think about various issues. The website also indexed what local candidates' positions via an electoral map and a list. = Lignite mining = Generation Zero has expressed concern that converting lignite to diesel produces almost double the emissions produced by burning diesel refined from oil. The group has argued that if New Zealand goes ahead with its planned lignite mining the country risks overshooting its Kyoto Protocol commitment to reduce emissions by 20% by 2020. \\"If we want to go to a zero carbon emission plan, and we have no more coming out than is going back into the system, then we can’t be burning coal. It is also not very necessary in terms of power, 70% of NZ’s power is renewable already.\\" = Other campaigns = In April 2013, Generation Zero welcomed the focus on the electricity industry by the Green Party and Labour Party, and called for a National Party policy response. In May 2013, the group expressed concern that the Government was acting undemocratically by rushing through legislation that would undermine local council control over housing. In July 2014, in the run up to the 2014 general election, the group released their report titled \\"The Big Ask\\". The report called on political parties after the election to set up an independent climate change commission and introduce carbon budgets. The organisation's young membership uses a diversity of social media. It has made news headlines with innovative ways of creating public awareness. For instance, a 2011 funeral march in Dunedin was held for old ways of running an economy that don't take climate change into account. Protest chalking around Nelson was received positively and supported by the mayor of Nelson.

Although neither side sustained significant losses (according to general descriptions, it consisted in distant and ineffectual cannonade between the two fleets), the Ottomans withdrew after three failed attempts to break through the Greek fleet, and the battle is considered a Greek victory. The Ottoman fleet of ninety-four vessels under the command of Mohammed Ali was sent to destroy Greek forces at Hydra and Spetses and to relieve the besieged Ottoman garrison at Nauplia (Nafplio). The Greek fleet was commanded by Admiral Andreas Vokos Miaoulis. Miaoulis based his strategy on that of an ancient Greek admiral Themistocles in the Battle of Salamis, hoping to lure the superior Ottoman fleet into a narrow strait in order to deprive it of its freedom of manoeuvre. He divided his forces (sixteen fireships and fifty-six vessels) into three squadrons, one of which was to lure the Ottomans into the straits, another to engage them if they fell into the trap, and the final one was to defend the Greek coast between Spetses and the Peloponnesus in case the Ottomans would want to land ground troops. The first engagement took place on 8 September. Calm winds prevented the Greeks from carrying out their planned withdrawal, and two fireships were lost during a six-hour engagement; however the Ottomans withdrew to regroup rather than continue to attack \\\\- according to Greek historian Anastasios Orlandos the retreat of the Ottoman fleet occurred thanks to the conduct of Kosmas Barbatsis (1792–1887) who directed his fireship against the Ottoman flagship, which fled to avoid it, followed by the other Ottoman ships. On 10 September the Ottomans attempted another breakthrough, but once again retreated before the Greek trap was sprung. Finally a third attack took place on 13 September; according to Varfis a fireship sank an Ottoman brig: this single loss broke the Ottoman spirits, and they chose to retreat. After the battle, the Ottoman vice admiral was beheaded for his loss. The battle is considered a major victory for Miaoulis, who is said to have received \\"a hero's welcome\\" upon his return. Soon after the battle, the siege of Nauplia ended as the Ottoman garrison at Nauplia capitulated and surrendered the fortresses of Nafplion in December.

Freemasonry defines itself as “a regular system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” In particular masonic meetings are characterized by initiations and rituals. As such masonry has been viewed historically by churches and governments as secret societies. Its historical origins date as far back to 1717 in England, during the Enlightenment period. During that time, an intellectual movement arose throughout Europe based on rationalism, which held that only eternal truths could be attained by reason alone. Members are organized into lodges, the basic organizational structure, which operates under the jurisdiction of a grand lodge. Rise of Freemasonry in the Philippines “Primera Luz Filipina”, the first masonic lodge in the Philippines was established in 1856 by Jose Malcampo Monje, a naval captain who became the Governor General of the Philippines from June 18, 1874 to February 28, 1877. It was placed under the jurisdiction of “Gran Oriente Luisitano” and admitted only Spaniards. Other lodges for foreign-born residents soon followed. Sometime in 1869, Jacobo Zobel y Zangroniz joined the Scottish Lodge based in Nagtahan, which had been founded by the British Consul-General. It was placed under the jurisdiction of the grand lodge of Hong Kong. Zobel was made secretary of the organization. Historian Teodoro M. Kalaw wrote that Zobel was the first Filipino mason and added considerable prestige, considering that Zobel was a highly educated man who was a member of the Spanish Academy of History. Zobel himself wrote: “Bajo estas circumstancias mis pensamientos se dirigieron—y no solamente los míos—á la única organización que podía reunir todos los elementos liberales españoles del Archipiélago y del gobierno en Manila para conseguir la conservación y el desarrollo sano de esta colonia tan importante para España. Esta organización es la masoneria bastanda propagada en España y sus colonia y enemiga del clero católico.” Spread of Masonry among the Intelligentsia It was a group of young Filipino students studying in Spain who helped spread the movement rapidly in Philippine circles: Marcelo H. del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Jose Alejandrino, Ariston Bautista, Julio Llorente, Galicano Apacible, Antonio Luna, and his brother Juan Luna, and Jose Rizal. Some of these joined Solidaridad Lodge 53 in Barcelona, Spain, and others joined Revolucion Lodge. Upon their return to the colony, many formed lodges. On January 6, 1891, Nilad Lodge was formed in Manila. Soon others followed throughout the archipelago, even as far as Zamboanga. In 1893 these different lodges were organized under the Grand Regional Council led by Ambrocio Flores. Such was the influence of Freemasonry in the public that even the organization Katipunan adapted masonic secret ritual and codes. Toward independence After the invasion of the Philippines by Americans, American soldiers formed their own lodges. Among the first were volunteers from North Dakota who organized the Knights Templar. A group of black soldiers from Missouri organized the Prince Hall Grand Lodge. The Filipinos reorganized under Grand Master Ambrocio Flores to establish the Filipino Grand Orient in 1899. During this time the Americans did not honor the existence of the First Philippine Republic. Despite continued protests and appeals by Filipino Masons to both American and European Freemasonry to end hostilities and recognize the First Philippine Republic, the European and American Freemasons ignored the appeals and even worked against Philippine nationalism. For the remainder of this period, Philippine Freemasonry was subservient to the Grand Lodge of the United States of America. On December 19, 1912 the Grand Lodge of the Philippine Islands was formed by three American lodges: Manila 342, Cavite 350, and Corregidor 386, with Manila becoming Manila Lodge No 1. At first, Grand Lodge remained a Regional Grand Lodge, convoking its own Grand Assembly in 1915. Throughout 1915 and 1916 it was engaged with correspondence with the Grande Oriente Español in Spain, with aims toward its own independence. The long process of establishing the proper agreements finished in February 1917. The American Grand Lodge Constitution was used as a basis, keeping in mind issues such as equality of all races and working languages for ceremonies. In the same month a group of 27 lodges still under the Grande Oriente Español elected to affiliate under the Philippine Grand Lodge and Grand Officers were elected. Second World War The first Filipino Grand Master was Manuel Quezon (later the 2nd president of the Philippines) in 1918. Masonry, along with much of life in the Philippines, was disrupted by foreign occupation during the second World War in particular from 1942 to 1945. For a time before and after the war, the Philippine Grand Lodge also held jurisdiction over some lodges in other countries such as China and Japan before those places established their own grand lodges. Their constitutions were often based on the Philippine one, as well as others such as that of the Grand Lodge of California. The Philippine version of the Scottish Rite Supreme Council 33°, the Supremo Consejo del Grado 33° para Filipinas, was founded in 1924 by Timoteo Paez.

Career =Political staff member= Garvey's career began as a personal assistant for the Labour Party under leader Neil Kinnock. From there, she moved to become diary secretary for Tony Blair. In 1994 during Blair's leadership bid, Garvey suggested that Peter Mandelson, who was at the time being derided by the trade unions and other Labour factions, should adopt a \\"nom de guerre\\" to conceal his considerable role within the campaign team. Mandelson agreed to be called \\"Bobby\\" for the duration. In his victory speech, Blair referred to Mandelson by the false name. From 1997 until 2005, except for campaign seasons, Garvey worked in the Prime Minister's Private Office. She was responsible for presentation and planning of domestic and foreign events and visits. By 2005, Garvey's role had progressed to scheduling. Aide Katie Kay, who had worked for Blair's advisor John Birt, had taken over the diary secretary job. On the campaign circuit, Garvey worked on Blair's behalf in the general election of 1997 and of 2001. A 2001 story in The Daily Telegraph, \\"Babes on the Bus who keep the campaign journalists at bay\\", described Garvey as one of a band of women led by Anji Hunter who kept discipline on the political tour with their superior-to-male attention to detail. In Blair's 2005 election, Garvey ran his election tour. In his memoir A Journey, Blair reflected on Garvey's importance: > \\"[She] was the gatekeeper, the custodian of the diary. There is a whole PhD > thesis to be written by some smart political student about the importance of > scheduling to a modern prime minister or president...She ran the diary with > a grip of iron and was quite prepared to squeeze the balls very hard indeed > of anyone who interfered, but with a winning smile of course.\\" =Public relations= After leaving government in 2005, Garvey worked on Bob Geldof's charity campaign, Make Poverty History, which produced the Live 8 concerts. That same year, she was hired by PR firm Freud Communications as the head of public and social affairs. Garvey was selected by the World Economic Forum in 2007 as a \\"Young Global Leader\\", a designation awarded to persons under 40 who have shown leadership qualities. Garvey is mentioned in a 2008 Telegraph profile on Matthew Freud as 'reportedly managing the Freud-Blair relationship'. The article describes an ongoing connection of Blair and Freud in terms of socialising (Freud throwing celebrity-attended parties) as well as Freud advising Tony and Cherie Blair on how to best exploit events such as the World Economic Forum's Davos retreat ('what parties to go to'). A 2010 article by PRWeek mentioned Garvey's clients as including the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, both held in London. Other clients included the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, Live Earth, the Maternal Mortality campaign and Jordan's Queen Rania. An earlier biography mentioned Garvey as having served the musician Bono. Garvey is the co-founder of Project Everyone, a campaign group dedicated to promoting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Personal life Garvey is married to Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia. It is Wales' third marriage and Garvey's first. The couple met in Monaco in 2009 and then began dating in 2010 after meeting again at Davos. They had both been Young Global Leaders in 2007. In 2011, Wales moved to Britain. They married in October 2012 at Wesley's Chapel in London. The guests included Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair, David Miliband, Lily Cole, and musician Mick Hucknall. Garvey and Wales live in London with their two daughters.

It was aired on May 6, 2013. The episode was written by Craig Gore & Tim Walsh and it was directed by Michael Nankin. Plot Nolan (Grant Bowler) intercepts a shipment of weapons being transferred by two men working for Datak (Tony Curran). Nolan is unaware that after the town lost its shield generator, the town council - without Amanda's (Julie Benz)) knowledge - made an agreement between Datak to provide weapons for the town as a means of self defence. Meanwhile, the relationship between Nolan and Kenya (Mia Kirshner) continues; Kenya wants their relationship to move from customer/prostitute to friends with benefits. Amanda is displeased with Kenya's relationship with Nolan, which leads Kenya to accuse Amanda of trying to replace their mother. Kenya and Tirra (Brittany Allen), one of the girls who work at the Need/Want bar, are kidnapped by Ulysses (Rob Archer), a bioman working for Datak as a prizefighter. Ulysses is kidnapping people who are living in the street and taking them to Meeko (Robin Dunne), a human lab technician who is harvesting their adrenochrome to use as an illegal drug. Nolan and Amanda confront Datak, who refuses to help because they never show him any respect. Stahma (Jaime Murray) suggests to Amanda that the best way to show Datak respect is by making him member of the town council, which Amanda accepts in order to find her sister. With Datak's help, Nolan and Amanda locate the lab where Kenya is being held. Kenya escapes and kills Meeko, and Nolan and Amanda arrive in time to save her from Ulysses. Meanwhile, Rafe (Graham Greene) argues with his son Quentin (Justin Rain) following Rafe's decision to seal the shaft in the mines where Luke was working. Quentin believes Rafe sealed the shaft because he doesn't trust Quentin; however, the real reason is the strange object Rafe found in Luke's room. Rafe believes Luke found it in the sealed shaft and that it is the reason for Luke's death. Rafe and Quentin descend into the sealed shaft and discover a set of cave paintings featuring the object. Flashbacks in the episode tell the story of Amanda, Kenya, and their mother (Severn Thompson) during the Pale War. Amanda and her mother were out scavenging away from town. When the area was attacked, their mother was prepared to abandon Kenya and flee with Amanda alone; Amanda refused to leave her sister, so their mother abandoned both. To spare her feeling, Amanda lied to Kenya, telling her that their mother died heroically. She gave Kenya a necklace they found while scavenging, saying their mother sent it as a gift for Kenya. As the young Amanda did not recognize the necklace as a St. Christopher's medal, she told Kenya it was \\"St. Finnegan, patron saint of lost children.\\" Kenya attempts to give Tirra the \\"St. Finnegan\\" necklace as a gift after their rescue from Meeko and Ulysses, but Tirra correctly identifies the medal as St. Christopher. Kenya then confronts Amanda about the real meaning of her necklace and Amanda finally reveals the truth. The episode ends with Datak taking his place on town's council, and Nolan realizing that Stahma is the more dangerous of the two. The last scene contains an allusion to the character of Madame Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities: as Stahma sits knitting outside the door to the council chamber, Nolan comments \\"I had my eye on the wrong snake.

His professional career was mostly associated with Compostela, as both a player and manager. During 11 seasons, he played 361 competitive matches for the club and scored 46 goals. In 2006, Fabiano started working as a coach. Playing career =Celta= Born in Rio de Janeiro, Fabiano represented Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and São José Esporte Clube. In 1989, immediately after having finished runner-up in the Campeonato Paulista with the latter club and suffered the loss of his father, he moved to Spain where he would remain for the following 15 years, starting off at RC Celta de Vigo. Fabiano made his La Liga debut on 17 September 1989, coming on as a late substitute in a 0–2 away loss against Athletic Bilbao. He scored his first goal in the Spanish top flight on 14 January 1990, contributing to a 5–1 home win over Cádiz CF as the season ended in relegation. =Compostela= In 1992, after two additional campaigns in Segunda División, Fabiano signed with neighbouring SD Compostela also in that level. He helped to a first-ever promotion for the Galicians in 1994 and, over the course of the following four seasons, was a midfield mainstay, notably netting in consecutive home draws against Real Madrid (1–1 on 2 April 1995, and 3–3 on 25 February 1996) and contributing with one goal in a 6–2 away routing of Deportivo de La Coruña for the local derby in May 1998. At the end of 2002–03, Compos was relegated to Segunda División B for financial irregularities. Fabiano subsequently left and joined another team in that region, Racing de Ferrol, retiring at the end of the season at the age of 38. Coaching career Fabiano started working as a coach in 2006, with former club Compostela in the regional leagues. From 2008 to 2011 he was in charge of amateurs Bergantiños FC, Compostela again – taking the reins of the team at the end of the ninth round, he eventually failed to prevent relegation from division three, as dead last– and CD Estradense. In summer 2011, Fabiano was appointed assistant coach at G.D. Estoril Praia from Portugal, going on to work under several managers including compatriot Vinícius Eutrópio and Marco Silva. In March 2015, following José Couceiro's departure, both he and former club player Hugo Leal took the reins until the end of the season, eventually leading the team to the 12th position in the Primeira Liga; in July, he was appointed the sole head coach. On 11 December 2016, after only 15 points in 13 matches during the campaign, Fabiano was relieved of his duties. The following 11 July, he returned to his home country after being named Clube Atlético Paranaense manager; he was sacked on 4 December, with his side having finished in 11th position. In January 2019, Fabiano was hired at K League 2 title favourites Jeonnam Dragons. He was dismissed in July, with the team third from bottom.

It is a hookworm both of humans and of other mammals such as dogs, cats, and golden hamsters. It is the only zoonotic hookworm species that is able to produce symptomatic infections in humans, with the majority of cases being in Southeast Asia. Discovery and history Since the description of Ancylostoma ceylanicum by Arthur Looss in 1911, and A. braziliense by Gomes de Faria in 1910, the two species were considered synonymous because of their apparent similarities in almost all respects. In 1913, comparison of specimens from human, dog, cat and lion infections in India led to the conclusion that they were definitely identical. In 1915 Gomes de Faria described the anatomical structures and concluded that the two were distinct species. Until 1921 A. ceylanicum was accepted as a valid species. However, in 1922 Gordon made an exhaustive comparison from specimens collected in Brazil, South Africa and India, and he failed to identify any distinction. Other parasitologists also became convinced that the two names were synonymous. In 1951 Biocca made an elaborate study of different hookworms in the collection of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and personal collections. He finally identified the defining characters between the two for classifying them as distinct species, which eventually gained general acceptance. Structure The adult hookworms are white and about 6–10 mm long. They are generally stouter than A. braziliense. The anterior end is bent dorsally, which gives the body a characteristic \\"hooked\\" or J-shaped appearance, hence the common name hookworm. Females have a tapered narrow posterior end, while males have a feathery posterior end owing to their copulatory bursa. Hookworm species are not easily distinguished from the gross appearance. The key diagnostic feature is the appearance of their mouths. Unlike other hookworms, A. ceylanicum has a mouth with cutting plate with a sharp dorsal end that looks like a tooth and a less distinct sharp ventral end. Life cycle The Infective larvae quickly undergo moulting to shed their sheath either upon ingestion by the host or upon burrowing into the host's skin. If ingested, they pass through the stomach into the intestine and attach themselves to the mucosa. If they have burrowed through the skin, they invade the subcutaneous blood vessels, are carried to the lungs, and then move to the intestine via trachea, oesophagus and stomach. In either case, the larvae develop into the final 3rd stage in the intestinal wall. The 4th stage larvae appear in 47 hours after oral infection. The 5th stage immature worms appear 6 days after infection. They reach sexual maturity on and after 2 weeks after infection. Unlike the hookworms Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale, A. ceylanicum can competently infect and thrive within not only human hosts but other mammalian hosts as well (such as dogs, cats, or golden hamsters). Because it may primarily infect non-human mammals, and infect humans only opportunistically when its mammalian hosts are in close contact with people, A. ceylanicum is termed a zoonotic hookworm. This same trait makes A. ceylanicum a uniquely useful hookworm, since it can be studied in the laboratory while infecting golden hamsters, unlike most or all strains of N. americanus or A. duodenale, and thus can also be used as a test organism for possible drugs or vaccines aimed at preventing human infections. Pathogenicity Ancylostoma ceylanicum attaches itself to capillary beds in the small intestine of a host where it feeds on blood and causes anaemia. In hamsters anaemia is most severe between the 13th and 60th days of infection, and is accompanied by significant loss in body weight. Experimental infection of hamsters shows increased antibodies, peripheral cellular immune suppression, which is characterized by a reduction in the total white blood cell count, neutropenia and lymphopenia. The most serious effects are manifested in children and women of childbearing age displaying chronic intestinal blood loss which may result in iron deficiency, anaemia and hypoalbuminemia. The long-term effects include impaired physical, intellectual and cognitive development of children, increased mortality in pregnant women and their infants and reduced physical capacity. Epidemiology Ancylostoma ceylanicum infection is found in Cambodia, Malaysia, The Solomon Islands, Australia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Madagascar, Indonesia, Fiji Islands and Taiwan. Diagnosis Infection is detectable from a stool sample of the host. Eggs can be microscopically analysed. However, there is no clear-cut distinction between different hookworms due to their physical similarity, and species are often mistaken for one another. The Kato-Katz method and molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to distinguish hookworm species, but are not always effective at doing so. Sequencing of ribosomal RNA gene is often reliable but time consuming. A PCR coupled with high resolution melting-curve (HRM) was found to be highly sensitive in discriminating A. ceylanicum from other hookworms. Treatment Ivermectin is highly effective even at the low dose of 100 μg per kg, and pyrantel is also effective at 25–50 mg per kg. Benzimidazoles such as mebendazole, parbendazole and thiabendazole are also highly effective. Genome A draft assembly of the genome of Ancylostoma ceylanicum has been sequenced and analyzed. It comprises 313 Mb, estimated to be 95% of the full genome, with transcriptomic data throughout infection showing expression of 30,738 predicted protein-coding genes. These include genes encoding three gene families upregulated during successive stages of infection: Activation- associated Secreted Protein Related (ASPRs), Secreted L4 Proteins (SL4Ps), and Secreted Clade V proteins (SCVPs). The genes of A. ceylanicum also include predicted targets for drugs and vaccines.

According to 2007 figures reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, there are 39 million sheep in the country (a count of about 10 per individual). The country has the highest density of sheep per unit area in the world. For 130 years, sheep farming was the country's most important agricultural industry, but it was overtaken by dairy farming in 1987. Sheep numbers peaked in New Zealand in 1982 to 70 million and then dropped to about 27.6 million. There are 16,000 sheep and beef farms in the country which has made the country the world's largest exporter of lambs, with 24 million finished lambs recorded every year. History George Henry Moore, which served to demonstrate its owner's extreme wealth Sheep were introduced into New Zealand between 1773 and 1777 with credit to James Cook, the British explorer. Samuel Marsden, a missionary, introduced some flocks of sheep to the Bay of Islands, and then also farmed in Mana Island close to Wellington for the purpose of feeding the whalers. The period between 1856 and 1987 was a bonanza period for sheep farming, resulting in economic prosperity of the country. ;19th century Johnny Jones was an early settler in Otago. When the whaling boom ended, he switched to farming in 1840. He was the first Pākehā who settled large numbers of immigrants on the east coast of the South Island, and he imported sheep amongst other stock for this purpose. One of the first to bring substantial numbers of sheep to Canterbury was John Deans in 1843. As was usual at the time, the sheep were bought in Australia. John Cracroft Wilson's endeavours of setting up as a sheep farmer in 1854 demonstrate the hardship that early settlers and stock often faced. He had a disastrous journey from Sydney where much of his stock died and 1,200 sheep had to be jettisoned. After landing in Lyttelton, his stock was transferred to the nearby Gollans Bay (the bay in Lyttelton Harbour beneath Evans Pass), where he lost more stock to tutu poisoning and southerlies. Whilst John Acland and Charles George Tripp arrived in Canterbury in 1855, only four years after organised settlement of Canterbury began, all the suitable land on the Canterbury Plains had already been taken up. They were the first to take up land in the Canterbury high country for sheep farming. George Henry Moore established himself in North Canterbury. His Glenmark Station was for a time New Zealand's largest sheep run, and his daughter established the Christchurch tourist attraction Mona Vale with her inheritance. His biography says of him: > Moore stands out in New Zealand pastoral history as a supremely successful > runholder in terms of personal wealth. His skill, judgement and sense of > timing were of a very high order. Yet without strong financial backing from > partners and bank, the full achievement of Glenmark would have been > impossible. His 1873 purchase was a bold decision, based on a mortgage of > exceptional size to the Union Bank of Australia, which advanced Moore > £90,000. The link between banking and large runholding in Canterbury was > never more clearly demonstrated. ;Early 20th century New Zealand flocks rarely numbered less than 400 head. The total area of occupied land was under 45 million acres. Of this, 5 million acres supported from 1 to 8 sheep per acre for the year, while over 9 million acres averaged from one-half to 2 sheep per acre. Grass was the principal crop. With a growing season of 10 months and well-distributed rainfall, it was profitable to keep grass for stock. Nearly half of the occupied land was in holdings of over 5,000 acres, mainly used for sheep. There were 90 holdings of over 50,000 acres each while 18,694 holdings were from 50 to 200 acres. The number of sheep kept increased from about 19 million in 1896 to 24,595,405 in 1914. The average flock size increased from 1,081 in 1896 to 1,124 in 1913. About half the sheep were in flocks which numbered less than 2,500 while seven-eights of them were in flocks numbering over 500 head each. Wethers, rams, and ewes under breeding age comprised about one-half the sheep. The most successful breed raised in the early 19th century was the Spanish breed of Merino. It was bred on the South Island for many years. The Merino ewe furnished the foundation of a cross-bred stock. In the early days of the Canterbury Region meat trade, the English Leicester breed was the favourite ram for breeding with the Merino ewe. Later, the Lincoln breed was used to cross with the Merino, and black-faced rams were put to the cross-bred ewes. In the North Island, the Romney sheep was better suited with the moist climate and became the most popular sheep; it also increased in numbers in the South Island. The Lincoln and Border-Leicester were favoured in both islands, while the Southdown displaced other breeds for fat-lamb production throughout New Zealand. The Leicesters, mainly the English variety, were the most popular British breed in the South Island. ;Later 20th century The sheep population reached a peak of 70 million in 1982 but soon there was a sharp decline as the dairy industry overshadowed it. In 1987, the sheep population was only about 39 million; this fall is also attributed to withdrawal of government subsidy to this sector. In spite of a decline in the population of sheep in New Zealand, the hilly areas of the country have seen a proliferation of sheep farming in the decades since the late 1960s. This growth is on account of introduction of better species of pasture vegetation, use of pesticides and weed control, regulated and systematic paddock management of farms, and introduction of better and disease resistant breeds of sheep. Under a wide mosaic of varying climatic and soil conditions, and the large extent of farms have resulted in development of a wide range of industries. ;Current statistics As of 2007, New Zealand had approximately 39 million sheep, nearly 10 sheep for every person in the country (the 2006 population was 4,027,947), placed in sixth position among the most populous sheep farming countries of the world. In June 2015, sheep numbers were at 29.1 million. A year later, numbers had fallen by 1.5 million to 27.6 million. Breeds The New Zealand Sheepbreeders Association is responsible for managing sheep breeding in the country and also stud breeding in sheep industry. It ensures the purity of created breeds, with a good pedigree and a notable record of performance. The developed breeds reported by the associations are: Border Leicester, Borderdale, Corriedale, Dorper, Dorset Down, East Friesian, English Leicester, Finnsheep, Hampshire, Lincoln, Oxford, Poll Dorset & Dorset Horn, Polwarth, Ryeland, Shropshire, South Suffolk, Suffolk, and Texel. Breeding variety included the Corriedale, a cross breed of the Merino and English breeds; New Zealand Romney, which accounts for nearly 66% of all sheep in the country now, and its wool is suitable for making carpets; Perendale, which is adaptable to all types of weather and provides good meat and wool; and Coopworth, in a well tended farmland, this breed has good meat and wool value. An annual event of the New Zealand Ewe Hogget Competition was initiated by George Fletcher to encourage and appreciate quality breeding of sheep. The event was held in May 2013 and awards were presented for Technology & Innovation, Best Woolled Flock, Large Flock and Flock Performance. Farming development In the initial years the large farms which came into existence were for sheep brought from Australia to Wairarapa, farms in the Canterbury Plains, and Otago farm, and land leased from the ethnic Māori. In later years, land was leased from the government in the eastern part of South Island, a dry area found suitable to establish large farms for Merinos for increased production of wool. In the northern Island, sheep farms in lands owned by Māori were under a much lower growth trajectory as the vegetative cover of bushes and wet weather conditions were not conducive for the Merinos to survive. Trade The first trading of sheep meat was with Britain when frozen meat was exported in 1882. Subsequently, with large expansion of sheep farms, this export trade has sustained the economy of the country substantially. New Zealand's major agricultural export commodity was wool during the late 19th century. Even in the late 1960s it accounted for over a third of all export revenues. but as its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities wool is no longer profitable for many farmers.

Topatopa Mountains, California. A giant shale rip-up clast at the base of a high- density turbidite, Cozy Dell Fm. Topatopa Mountains, California. Rip-up clasts are gravel-size pieces of clay or mud created when an erosive current flows over a bed of clay or mud and removes pieces of clayey sediment, and transports them some distance. Because clayey sediments can be quite cohesive, even when freshly deposited, large clasts of clayey sediment can be ripped up, transported and subsequently preserved when the eroding current finally deposits its sediment. After deposition and deep burial by the accumulation of additional sediments, diagenesis transforms the gravel-size pieces of clayey sediment into shale or mudstone rip-up clasts. Shale rip-up clasts are often found at the base of sandy turbidites, in lag deposits at the base of channelized sandstones, and associated with subaqueous dunes and bars.Ricci Lucchi, Franco (1995), Sedimentographica: Photographic Atlas of Sedimentary Structures, Columbia University Press, p. 114-115.Jackson, J.A., Mehl, J.P.

There are three types of fifth intervals, namely * perfect fifths (7 semitones), * diminished fifth (6 semitones), and * augmented fifth (8 semitones). After the unison and octave intervals, the perfect fifth is the most important interval in tonal harmony. It is highly consonant. Its implementation in equal temperament tuning is highly accurate, unlike the major third interval, for example. As explained below, it is used to generate the chromatic circle and the cycle of fifths, and it is used for tuning string-instruments. It is a constituent interval for the fundamental chords of tonal harmony. Tonal harmony The fundamental chords of tonal music—major and minor triads and also seventh chords—all contain fifth intervals. *Perfect fifths are contained in major and minor triads and in particular seventh chords (especially major-minor sevenths with dominant function, major sevenths, and minor sevenths). *Diminished fifths are contained in diminished triads and in half-diminished sevenths and fully diminished seventh chords. Fifths are stacked to form chords in quintal harmony. =Cycle of fifths= The circle of fifths drawn within the chromatic circle as a regular star dodecagon: Concatenating the perfect fifths ((F,C), (C,G), (G,D), (D,A), (A,E), (E,B),...) generates the sequence of fifths (F, C, G, D, A, E, B, F, ...); this sequence of fifths displays all twelve notes of the chromatic circle.This sequence of fifths features the diminished fifth (b, f), which replaces the perfect fifth (b, f) containing the chromatic note f, which is not a member of the C major key. The note f (of the C major scale) is replaced by the note f in the Lydian chromatic scale . =Harmonization of scales in fifths= Major scale on C All but one of the intervals are perfect fifths. The (b,f) interval is a diminished fifth. =Tuning of instruments= All-fifths tuning All-fifths tuning refers to the set of tunings for string instruments in which each interval between consecutive open strings is a perfect fifth. All-fifths tuning is the standard tuning for mandolin and violin and it is an alternative tuning for guitars. All-fifths tuning is also called fifths, perfect fifths, or mandoguitar tuning.

History Escapade Music Festival made its debut in 2010 as a one day event in the Byward Market with Deadmau5 headlining it and a few hundred attendees. In 2011, Escapade Music Festival grew in size to accommodate the growth of the festival, taking place in a large market parking space and featuring 3 Major headlining DJs, Tiesto, Laidback Luke and Calvin Harris (Estimated 5000 in attendance). In 2012, Escapade grew exponentially in size and scale to accommodate an estimated 15,000 people over 2 days (June 30 – July 1) at the Ottawa Baseball Stadium in East Ottawa, with 40+ DJs performing over 3 stages. Headliners included: Avicii, Afrojack, Excision, Aly & Fila, Project 46, OVERWERK, Alesso, Tommy Trash, Dada Life, Marcus Schossow, Kill The Noise, Dillon Francis and Zeds Dead (Note: Chuckie could not make his flight on time to perform his set and ended up not performing). After the 2012 event was complete, Nicholas Guindon-Vachon, one of the founders of the festival, absconded with approximately $600,000 in ticket sales revenue. Guindon-Vachon paid $40,000 for a private charter to fly him to Aruba, where he was tracked down by authorities. Guindon-Vachon was sentenced to 1 year probation, and must pay back former partners $300,000. In 2013, Escapade moved to the RA Centre Grounds in Central Ottawa and expanded to host an estimated 20,000+ attendees over 3 days in 2 locations (June 29 – June 30, RA Centre Grounds, July 1, Downtown in the Byward Market). This new location allowed for bigger production (Fireworks being the most notable as the RA Centre borders the Rideau River, thereby providing a safer place to launch them and expanded facilities across the festival grounds). 40+ DJs performed over 2 stages at the main event, plus several more on the 3rd, Canada Day stage in the market. Headliners included: Ferry Corsten, Steve Angello, Mark Knight, Krewella, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Ben Gold, 3LAU, Wolfgang Gartner, Benny Benassi, Candyland and Seven Lions (Notes: Bingo Players was to perform but because of Paul's bout with cancer, Project 46 was brought in as a last minute replacement. Hard Rock Sofa also didn't show due to Visa complications and Rusko failed to show due to illness, thereby allowing Krewella to play an extended set. Umek also arrived late for his set on the Tech Stage, thereby allowing Mark Knight to play later into his already extended set). Tiesto headlined the Canada stage downtown on July 1, along with Quintino and Alvaro. In 2014, Escapade celebrated its 5th year anniversary at the Rideau Carleton Raceway in Southeast Ottawa. The festival expanded in size and attendance with 30,000+ attendees and expansion to a 4-day format (June 28 - June 29, Main Festival at R.C.R, June 30, Club Series, Multiple Downtown venues, July 1, Downtown in the Byward Market). This years rendition featured 40+ DJs performing over 3 stages at the main event, plus several more on the 4th, Canada Day stage in the market. Headliners included: Main Stage: Eric Prydz, Kaskade, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Fedde Le Grand, Nervo (Note: Chuckie failed to show for the 2nd time) On Day 1: \\"#Goldrush\\" stage (Trance): Andrew Rayel, Orjan Nilsen, Ben Gold, \\"The Deep End\\" stage (Deep House/Chill House): Lee Foss with Anabel Englund, The Martinez Brothers. On Day 2: \\"Tech Fusion Tent\\" stage (Tech House): Danny Tenaglia, Nicole Moudaber, \\"Temple of Bass\\" stage (Bass Music): Zeds Dead, Noisia, Zomboy (Note: Grandtheft also failed to show). Dada Life headlined the Canada stage downtown July 1, alongside Project 46 and GTA (Surprise guests Stafford Brothers showed up alongside Joe Ghost during his Canada stage set). This year hosted a 4th extra day called the \\"Escapade Club Series\\" between the Main Festival and the Canada Day event at various Downtown Ottawa Nightclubs. Artists included Borgeous, The Stafford Brothers, Victor Calderone, Alvin Risk, Figure, and Simon Patterson. The festival has been supported by such sponsors as: Hot 89.9 FM, Heineken, Jägermeister, Smirnoff, Smart Set, TD Bank, Casino Lac Leamy and Courtyard Marriott.

The Cao Cao Mausoleum, also known as the Gaoling Mausoleum of Wei and the Xigaoxue Tomb No. 2, is a tomb in Xigaoxue Village, Anfeng Township, Anyang County, Anyang City, Henan Province, China. It is purported to be the burial site of Cao Cao (155–220 CE), a prominent warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. The discovery of the tomb was reported on 27 December 2009 by the Henan Provincial Cultural Heritage Bureau. In 2013, the tomb became part of the seventh batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level in China. Historical background Cao Cao (155–220 CE) was a warlord and politician who rose to prominence towards the end of the Han dynasty ( 184–220 CE) and became the de facto head of government in China during that period. In 216 CE, he received the title of a vassal king – King of Wei () – from Emperor Xian, the figurehead Han emperor whom he controlled. Through his military conquests, he laid the foundation for what was to become the state of Cao Wei (220–266 CE), which was established by his son and successor, Cao Pi. Cao Cao died in 220 CE in Luoyang at the age of 65 and was posthumously honoured as \\"King Wu\\" (武王; literally \\"martial king\\") by Emperor Xian.(庚子，王崩于洛陽，年六十六。 ... 謚曰武王。) Sanguozhi vol. 1. The location of Cao Cao's tomb has been a mystery over the centuries. According to his official biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), he was interred in the Gaoling (高陵; literally \\"high mausoleum\\") about one month after his death.(二月丁卯，葬高陵。) Sanguozhi vol. 1. However, he was also believed to be buried elsewhere. Other purported burial sites of Cao Cao include: Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), the capital of the Han dynasty at the time; beneath the Zhang River; below the Bronze Sparrow Platform (), a terrace in Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei), the capital of Cao Cao's vassal kingdom. Another legend, which originated in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) and was popularised by the works of Luo Guanzhong, Pu Songling and others in later periods, says that Cao Cao had 72 tombs constructed to serve as decoys and protection against grave robbers. The Northern Dynasty Tombs in Ci County, Handan, Hebei were initially believed to be the 72 tombs, but archaeologists later confirmed that they belonged to the imperial families of the Eastern Wei and Northern Qi dynasties and have nothing to do with Cao Cao. Discovery The tomb was discovered in December 2008 when workers at a nearby kiln were digging for mud to make bricks. Its discovery was initially not reported. The local authorities found out only after they seized a stone tablet bearing the inscription 'King Wu of Wei' – Cao Cao's posthumous title – from grave robbers who claimed to have stolen it from the tomb. Over the following year, archaeologists recovered more than 250 relics from the tomb, including stone paintings depicting social life in Cao Cao's time, stone tablets bearing inscriptions of sacrificial objects, and several items labelled as \\"personal belongings\\" frequently used by Cao Cao, including weapons and stone pillows. The bones of three persons were also unearthed and identified to be those of a man in his 60s, a woman in her 50s and another woman in her 20s. The tomb, made of bricks, faced east and formed a shape resembling the Chinese character jia () when viewed from above. It covered an area of roughly 740 square metres and its deepest point was about 15 metres below the ground. The underground tomb has two main chambers (front and back), four side chambers and connecting passages. An inclined passage 39.5 metres long and 9.8 metres wide leads to the underground chambers. The discovery of the tomb was confirmed by archaeological officials on 27 December 2009. Controversy Since the tomb was discovered, many sceptics and experts have pointed out problems with it and raised doubts about its authenticity. Yuan Jixi, a vice dean of the Renmin University of China's School of Chinese Classics, suggested that the items in the tomb cannot be guaranteed as authentic because the tomb had been greatly disturbed by grave robbers. Yuan also noted that the most important pieces of evidence – namely the artefacts bearing the inscription 'King Wu of Wei' – may have been deliberately placed in the tomb for deceptive purposes. =31 December 2009 seminar= On 31 December 2009, the Henan Provincial Institute of Archaeology invited experts from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences's Institute of Archaeology, Zhengzhou University, and Henan University to join its researchers in a seminar to discuss the findings from the tomb and respond to queries from the press. The most popular topics discussed at the seminar include: * Whether the tomb was a decoy (one of the 72 tombs mentioned in legend): The experts said that the legend of the 72 tombs is not reliable as compared to information from historical sources, and that the legend should not be regarded seriously. They cited the case of the Northern Dynasty Tombs in Ci County, Handan, Hebei, which were previously mistakenly believed to be the 72 tombs. * Whether to believe the tomb robbers or archaeologists: One of the eight stone tablets bearing the inscription 'King Wu of Wei' was retrieved by the authorities from tomb robbers, while the other seven were unearthed directly from the tomb by professionals. The authenticity of the tablets remain in question. * Whether DNA testing can confirm the identity of the male: According to the experts, the use of ancient DNA technology in archaeological research has yet to be fully developed so there may be technical difficulties. Besides, the male skeleton was not well preserved so the DNA extraction procedure may be very complicated. Even if the technology is fully functional, scientists still require DNA samples from a verified living descendant of Cao Cao to confirm the results. It is very difficult to find a living descendant of Cao Cao and verify that he/she is really a descendant of Cao Cao. * The identities of the two females: Researchers believe that the older female is Lady Bian, who, according to her historical biography in the Sanguozhi, was buried in the Gaoling (高陵; literally \\"high mausoleum\\") – the same place as Cao Cao.([太和四年] ... 其年五月，后崩。七月，合葬高陵。) Sanguozhi vol. 5. The younger one is believed to be a servant. * Whether the adjacent tomb, called the \\"Xigaoxue Tomb No. 1\\", was Cao Cao's tomb: The experts said that the first tomb is unlikely to be Cao Cao's tomb because its dimensions are smaller than the second tomb. =Endorsement by the SACH= In early January 2010, in light of the controversy over the authenticity of the tomb, Han Fuzheng, a lawyer from Cangzhou, made a freedom of information (FOI) request to the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) for the disclosure of the information and assessment standards used in confirming the tomb. On 28 January, the SACH stated that the procedures associated with the excavation process, archaeological research and verification, publishing of results, etc., were all in accordance with the rules of archaeological work. This statement by the SACH effectively served as a legal endorsement of the results from the research conducted throughout 2009 which suggest that the tomb was Cao Cao's. =August 2010 forum= In August 2010, 23 experts and scholars presented evidence at the National High-Level Forum on Culture of the Three Kingdoms Period held in Suzhou, Jiangsu to argue that the findings and the artefacts of the tomb are fake. During the forum, Lin Kuicheng, a historian and member of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out that Cao Cao should not be referred to as \\"King Wu of Wei\\" before 220 CE. After Cao Cao died in March 220 CE, his vassal king title – \\"King of Wei\\" – was inherited by his son, Cao Pi, who continued to hold the title until around December when he forced Emperor Xian, the last emperor of the Han dynasty, to abdicate in his favour. Since Cao Cao was buried about one month after his death and his funeral was most likely presided over by Cao Pi, it would be taboo to refer to Cao Cao as \\"King Wu of Wei\\" because the \\"King of Wei\\" (Cao Pi) was still living then. Furthermore, when Emperor Xian relinquished his throne to Cao Pi, he referred to Cao Pi and Cao Cao as \\"King of Wei\\" and \\"King Wu\\" respectively in his official abdication edict; Cao Cao was never referred to as \\"King Wu of Wei\\" in the edict.(咨爾魏王：昔者帝堯禪位于虞舜，舜亦以命禹，天命不于常，惟歸有德。漢道陵遲，世失其序，降及朕躬，大亂茲昏，羣兇肆逆，宇內顛覆。賴武王神武，拯茲難于四方，惟清區夏，以保綏我宗廟，豈予一人獲乂，俾九服實受其賜。今王欽承前緒，光于乃德，恢文武之大業，昭爾考之弘烈。皇靈降瑞，人神告徵，誕惟亮采，師錫朕命，僉曰爾度克恊于虞舜，用率我唐典，敬遜爾位。於戲！天之歷數在爾躬，允執其中，天祿永終；君其祗順大禮，饗茲萬國，以肅承天命。) Sanguozhi vol. 2. =Cao Huan and Cao Yu= On 12 September 2010, the Henan Provincial Institute of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage and the Anyang County Cultural Centre published an article in the journal Kaogu (Archaeology) about the tomb. In the article, they claimed that the tomb and the adjacent one (the Xigaoxue Tomb No. 1) actually belonged to Cao Huan (the fifth and last Wei emperor) and his father Cao Yu (a son of Cao Cao) respectively. The defining piece of evidence was a seal that was initially thought to be a simple official seal, but was later discovered to be actually a seal bearing the tomb owner's name. When the seal was first revealed after it was excavated from the tomb, it was presented upside-down so the Chinese character inscribed on it in seal script did not make any sense. After the error was corrected, archaeologists recognised that the Chinese character on the seal is huan (), hence they deduced that the tomb was Cao Huan's. When compared with the Chinese characters inscribed on a bronze seal belonging to Cao Xiu (whose tomb's discovery was announced and confirmed in May 2010), archaeologists noticed that the Chinese character on the seal from the Xigaoxue tomb bore some slight resemblance to the Chinese character cao (). According to the Wei Shipu (魏世譜; Genealogy of Wei), Cao Huan died at the age of 57, which was rather close to the age at which the man in the tomb died.(魏世譜曰：封帝為陳留王。年五十八，大安元年崩，謚曰元皇帝。) Wei Shipu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 4. Fang Beichen, a Sichuan University history professor who specialises in the Three Kingdoms period, published an essay on his personal blog about the findings from the Xigaoxue tomb and the pieces of evidence which point out that the tombs are actually the mausoleums of Cao Huan and Cao Yu. Current status In 2010, the tomb became part of the fifth batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level in China. The excavation of the two tombs was completed by the end of 2010, with over 400 artefacts unearthed and 100 damaged relics restored by the provincial archaeologist team. To enhance the protection of the tomb, the local government in Anyang has established a special committee to oversee and manage the tomb. , the tomb is not open to the public yet even though preparatory works for its opening are underway. The government has also built a temporary exhibition hall and a supporting ring corridor. , it has been announced that the government is constructing a museum on the original site of the tomb which will be named 'Cao Cao Mausoleum Museum' (). On 12 November 2012, a private museum in Zhengzhou donated a stele to the Cao Cao Mausoleum. Media reports from 2018 describe the tomb complex as having an outer rammed earth foundation, a spirit way, and structures on the east and south sides. Archaeologists have also noted that the tomb's exterior and perimeter appear to be deliberately left unmarked; there are neither structures above the ground around the tomb nor massive piles of debris in the vicinity. This indirectly confirms historical records that Cao Pi had ordered the monuments on the surface to be systematically dismantled to honour his father's wishes to be buried in a simple manner in a concealed location, as well as to prevent tomb robbers from finding and looting the tomb. Archaeologists also found another tomb next to Cao Cao's that was built around the same time. The other tomb, however, contains only clothes and no human remains were found inside. Experts believe that this tomb belongs to Cao Cao's eldest son, Cao Ang, who was killed at the Battle of Wancheng and his body was never found. References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Two of the family made illustrations for books and magazines.\\"Art As A Family Affair\\". Charles Lane. Article for Country Life magazine, UK, publ. June 1979. Six of the group were the sons of an army surgeon, Major Robert Winchester Fraser (1819-1892) and his wife Mary Ann Anderson (1820-1898), who married in 1842 and produced a total of nine children. There was one son, Michie, who worked for the Consular Service and remained a bachelor. One of his sisters, Catherine, was his housekeeper. There is a suggestion that she and the other sister Margaret may also have painted.The Dictionary of British Watercolour Artists Up To 1920. H. L. Mallalieu. Publ. Antique Collectors' Club, 1976. p. 135.  The artists  The first Fraser to paint was Francis Arthur (1846-1924), generally known as ‘Frank’. He was a prolific illustrator; notable publications with his drawings include Great Expectations (Chapman and Hall, 1871), King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table by Henry Frith (George Routledge, 1884), Mark Twain's Roughing It and The Innocents At Home (Chatto & Windus, 1897),Roughing It and The Innocents At Home. Mark Twain, illustrated by F. A. Fraser. Publ. Chatto & Windus, Piccadilly, 1885. A Hero. Philip’s Book by Dinah Maria Mulock Craik (George Routledge, 1889) and a number of books by Maria Edgeworth, published by George Routledge. Example of the illustrative work of Francis Arthur Fraser, 1846-1924, from the 1884 publication 'King Arthur & His Knights of the Round Table' (Author: Henry Frith) Next was Robert Winchester Fraser (1848-1906), who received a degree of recognition in his own lifetime, generally signing his work 'R. W. Fraser'. His pictures were regularly exhibited, including at the Royal Academy and Royal Scottish Academy. He was more widely travelled than his artistic siblings, at one point receiving a commission to go and paint in Jamaica. He died while staying at the Bristol Hotel, Gibraltar. Both his sons were also painters. The elder, Robert James Winchester Fraser (1872-1930) signed his pictures 'R. Winter' or 'Robert Winter', to distinguish them from those by his father. Though less commercially successful than his father, Winter’s paintings have come to be well regarded and these days tend to sell at higher prices in auction. The Dictionary of British Watercolour Artists calls him “the best known, and perhaps the best, of the family”. The younger son, Francis Gordon Fraser (1879-1931) “was probably the most prolific, yet least recorded member of the famous Huntingdonshire family of landscape painters” (Jeremy Wood, ‘Hidden Talents’). “The quality of his work is variable and this has affected its value.” Perhaps realising that he was in danger of flooding the market single-handedly, he signed his work in a variety of ways. Besides F.G. Fraser, he is known to have also used F. Gordon, Alex Gordon and quite possibly several other names. His huge output was driven by penury and it would seem that many of his paintings were hurriedly completed, though there are a few in circulation of a higher standard and with greater attention to detail. It is not known how much time he spent in or around The Fens region where his brother and uncles lived. His pictures of the area may possibly have been depicted from memory, imagination or his recollection of his father’s work, given that he mostly lived in south-west London. Two of his pictures were shown at the Devon and Exeter Annual Exhibition in 1907.Hidden Talents. Dictionary of Neglected Artists Working 1880 - 1950. Jeremy Wood. Publ. Jeremy Wood Fine Art, 1994.p55Watercolour painting by Francis Gordon Fraser (1879-1931) Example of watercolour painting by W.F. Garden (Garden William Fraser) 1856-1921 Like his nephew, Garden William Fraser (1856-1921) struggled with his finances and saw little return on his now very collectable paintings. Declared bankrupt in 1899, his money difficulties almost certainly contributed to the marital problems he endured with his wife Ethel. Together they produced 6 children but by 1906, Ethel had lost patience with the struggling artist and removed herself and the children to Birmingham. Garden William lived the rest of his life in a room at the Old Ferry Boat Inn in Holywell, Cambridgeshire.Victorian Landscape Watercolours. Yale Center for British Art, Editor Paul Anbinder. Publ. Hudson Hills Press, Inc. 1992.p172 His distinctive work, which often has an almost photographic quality, is usually signed W.F. Garden - the suggestion being that he may have adopted this version of his name not only to distinguish it from the rest of his family, but also to confuse creditors. Perhaps his most famous work is The Wood At Dusk, which is available in reproduction. George Gordon Fraser (1859-1895), like his eldest brother Frank, showed great promise as an illustrator. His drawings and cartoons appeared in Fun magazine and he provided \\"upwards of one hundred and twenty illustrations\\" for an 1891 edition of Jerome K. Jerome's The Diary of a Pilgrimage.The Diary of a Pilgrimage. Jerome K. Jerome, illustrated by G.G. Fraser. Publ. J. W. Arrowsmith 1891. A reprinted version of this is still available though fails to credit G.G. Fraser as the artist. He also painted, in watercolours and occasionally in oils, signing 'G. Gordon Fraser' or using his initials. William Andrew Baird Grove, in his booklet ‘The Frasers - A Local Family of Artists’ (1980) describes George Gordon’s work as - “a wide variety of Fen scenes of painstaking detail and accuracy, no longer fashionable in today’s art. His brushwork was very fine and it appears that every single twig and every leaf is given individual attention.” There are noticeably fewer examples of his work in circulation as he died young, at the age of 35, having fallen through the ice while skating on the River Ouse. He was buried with his father in a secluded spot in the graveyard of St. James’s Church, Hemingford Grey, a village between Huntingdon and St. Ives, Cambridgeshire. Example of the illustrative work of George Gordon Fraser, 1859-1895, from the 1891 publication 'The Diary of a Pilgrimage' Besides following his older brothers into the uncertain life of an artist, Arthur Anderson Fraser (1861-1904) was also an enthusiastic participant in the Neo- Jacobite Revival, founding a ‘White Cockade’ club at the Ferry Boat Inn at Holywell. He married Margaret Lawson in 1885 and the couple had two sons, the elder of whom - Francis McGreigor - may also have dabbled in painting. As an artist, Arthur Anderson was particularly successful in capturing the distinctive morning and evening skies of the Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire landscape. His work is either signed by name or by the use of a small monogram joining the letters ‘A’ and ‘F’.The Fraser Family. Charles Lane. Publ. Chris Beetles Gallery, London, 2010. Gilbert Baird Fraser (1865-1947) was the youngest and longest surviving member of the artistic family, outliving all his brothers and Robert Winchester’s sons. Like Arthur, he was involved with the Neo-Jacobites, standing for Parliament on a Jacobite platform in 1891. He lived with his wife May Heseltine at Reed Cottage in Holywell, Cambridgeshire, creating a considerable body of work, much of it with a somewhat warmer palette of colour than other family members. He is buried beside his brother Arthur Anderson and nephew Robert James Winchester in the churchyard at Holywell.

United States, 570 U.S. 99 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case that decided that, in line with Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000), all facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to and found true by a jury (not merely determined to be true by a judge's discretion). The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.. Summary of findings In the original trial, the defendant (Alleyne) was convicted of using or carrying a firearm in a violent crime, which carried a mandatory minimum penalty of five years' imprisonment. However, the mandatory minimum would rise to seven years if the accused were found to have \\"brandished\\" the firearm during the crime, and to ten years if he had fired it. In the original trial, the judge (not the jury) determined that Alleyne had probably brandished the firearm during the robbery, which caused the mandatory minimum sentence to rise to seven years (which was the sentence imposed). The Supreme Court found that the question of whether or not the accused had brandished his weapon during the robbery was not merely a \\"sentencing factor,\\" which the judge could unilaterally decide, but an \\"ingredient of the offense,\\" which must be assessed and decided upon by the jury. The Court also expressly overruled Harris v. United States (2002), which had reached a contrary ruling. See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 570 *Southern Union Co. v.

He continued in cricket after his playing days were over by standing as an umpire in first-class, List A and one-day international matches between 1972 and 2001. He was born at Cosby, Leicestershire. Playing career Julian was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a wicketkeeper. He made his first- class debut for Leicestershire as a 16-year-old in a single match against Gloucestershire in May 1953. There were a few more games, plus a period of National Service, over the next few years, but he did not displace Jack Firth as Leicestershire's first choice wicketkeeper until Firth retired at the end of the 1958 season. From 1959 to 1965, Julian was Leicestershire's main wicketkeeper, though his indifferent batting and Leicestershire's perennially long tail in this period meant that other wicketkeepers such as John Mitten and Geoffrey Burch were tried, though not usually for long. His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage (cricketer) and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw. By the mid-1960s, recruits from other countries brought in by the Leicestershire secretary, later manager, Mike Turner, such as Stanley Jayasinghe and Clive Inman and from other counties such as John Cotton and Peter Marner, helped make Leicestershire a more competitive side. Julian played regularly through to the end of the 1965 season, but for 1966 the 20-year-old Roger Tolchard, a Devonian via Malvern College, was preferred and Julian then became his deputy, appearing in only three further first-class matches to the end of the 1971 season, when he left the county staff. He had appeared in Leicestershire's first three List A matches, one each in the Gillette Cup competitions of 1963, 1964 and 1965, but all three games were lost. Umpiring career Julian was appointed to the first-class umpires' list for England and Wales in 1972, the first season after he formally retired as a player, and remained on the list for 30 seasons until he retired at the end of the 2001 season at the compulsory retirement age of 65. He did not umpire on the field in any Test matches but was the television umpire in six Tests between 1996 and 2001 and in the same period he also stood as umpire in six one-day international matches.

It travels through portions of Morton, Stevens, and Seward counties. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails. The eastern terminus (US-83) was part of the Atlantic and Pacific Highway. K-51 was first designated as a state highway in 1927, and at that time ran from K-12 north of Rolla to K-27 in Richfield. Between 1930 and 1931, K-51 was replaced with an extension of K-12. Then on January 1, 1937, K-51 was re-established from the Colorado border east to K-27. Then by 1937, K-51 was extended further east to US-83, its modern day routing. K-51 originally overlapped US-270, then in a May 18, 1981 resolution, the US-270 designation was removed.

Between February 1937 and January 1938, US-270 was extended into Kansas, and overlapped K-51 from the eastern end of the overlap with K-25 to US-83. In a January 4, 1939 resolution, K-51 was to be realigned where it crosses the Cimarron River to eliminate two sharp curves. Until 1981, the portion of K-51 between Hugoton and US-83 was shared with a previous alignment of US-270. Then in a May 18, 1981 resolution, the US-270 designation was removed.

In 1726, it was sold by auction to Chamberlain Christian Carl Gabel together with the Fuglsang and Priorskov estates. The Toreby market was moved to Sakskøbing in 1550.Kirsten Weber- Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, \\"Tingsted Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 1001-1024.

The nave and part of the chancel remain from the original Romanesque building. Traces of the old apse, removed in the Gothic period, can still be seen. The tower was constructed in late Gothic times, shortly after the church was built. The sacristy to the north of the chancel was built at the beginning of the 14th century.

Six-ribbed vaults were also added to the nave and the northern aisle. A fresco of a bassoon- playing angel was found on the chancel arch, probably part of a painting of the Last Judgment. The altarpiece consists of a painting of the Entombment of Christ, copied from Pietro Perugino's original by Albert Küchler in 1849. The former altarpiece now stands at the west end of the church. The pulpit (1645) in the auricular style is the work of woodcarver Jørgen Ringnis. The north aisle contains a crucifix from c. 1250. Frescos The frescos on the sacristy vault were discovered in 1904 and restored in 1920. Probably dating from the early 14th century, they depict the Enthroned Christ, two angels, John the Baptist with the lamb, and the prophets Zechariah and Jeremiah. Traces of other figures can also be seen including Michael fighting the dragon, the Judgment of Solomon and the Sacrifice of Isaac.

Seaborn, 282 U.S. 101 (1930), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a married person's income may be divided with his spouse in a community property state for purposes of U.S. federal income taxation.. The Seaborns were residents of the State of Washington, a community property state, and each reported one-half of Mr. Seaborn's salary and other sources of income on their separate income tax returns.Seaborn, 282 U.S. at 108-09. The Collector of Internal Revenue determined that the entire income should have been reported in Mr. Seaborn's return. The district court ruled in favor of Mr. Seaborn, and the Supreme Court affirmed. In doing so, the Court distinguished Lucas v. Earl, in which the Court disallowed income splitting by entering into a contract with one's wife, by noting that the earnings in Mr. Seaborn's case are property of the community by state law.Seaborn, 282 U.S. at 117. In 1948, the United States Congress responded to the different treatment of married taxpayers in community property states and non-community property states by allowing all married couples to take advantage of the \\"income splitting\\" joint return.Boris I. Bittker, Martin J. McMahon, Jr., and Lawrence A. Zelenak, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals § 44.02 (3d. ed. 2018).  Facts and Procedural History  H. G. Seaborn and his wife were residents of the State of Washington, a community property state. In their separate 1927 income tax returns, the Seaborns each reported one-half of Mr. Seaborn's salary, as well as income from interest on bank deposits, bonds, dividends, and profits on real and personal property in his name.Seaborn, 282 U.S. at 109. It was undisputed that the entirety of the Seaborns' income, which amounted to more than $38,000, constituted community property. Each spouse's reporting one-half of the community income allowed the Seaborns to reduce their income tax under the progressive rate structure of federal income taxation. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a surtax, determining that the entire income should have been reported in Mr. Seaborn's return. Mr. Seaborn paid under protest and brought this suit in federal district court to recover the amount. The district court rendered judgment for Mr. Seaborn.Seaborn, 32 F.2d at 920. The Collector of Internal Revenue appealed, and the Circuit Court of Appeals certified the question to the Supreme Court.  Holding  The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the district court. Justice Owen Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, while Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Stone did not partake in the consideration or decision of the case. The Court held that in a community property state such as Washington, the Seaborns were entitled to file separate income tax returns, with each spouse reporting one-half of the community income as his or her income. The Court explained that by operation of Washington state law, Mrs. Seaborn has a vested property right in the community property that is equal with Mr. Seaborn's, and therefore, in the community income.Seaborn, 282 U.S. at 111. In doing so, the Court rejected the Collector's argument that the husband is \\"essentially\\" the owner of the community property since he has \\"broad powers of control and alienation\\" over the community income, and thus should be taxed accordingly. The Supreme Court distinguished Lucas v. Earl, decided by the Court approximately eight months before Seaborn. In Earl, the Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and ruled against the taxpayer, who had entered into a contract with his wife providing that all subsequent earnings would be held by them as joint tenants.Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111 (1930). Justice Roberts explained that Earl presented \\"quite a different question from this, because here, by law, the earnings are _never_ the property of the husband, but that of the community.\\"Seaborn, 282 U.S. at 117 (emphasis added).  Subsequent Developments  The Supreme Court's decision in Poe v. Seaborn conferred significant tax advantages upon married couples residing in community property states. It also meant, however, that spouses in non-community property states were disadvantaged by their inability to shift income. The effects of this disparity became even more significant as marginal tax rates rose around World War II.Jennifer E.

Relationship anarchy (sometimes abbreviated RA) is the application of anarchist principles to intimate relationships. Some especially important values include autonomy, anti-hierarchical practices, lack of state control, anti-normativity, and community interdependence. RA can be considered a type of non-monogamy, but moreso is explicitly anti-mononormativity. This is distinct from polyamory, solo poly, and other forms of “dating”, which may include structures such as amatonormativity, de facto hierarchy of intimate relationships, and autonomy- limiting rules. History Andie Nordgren coined the term relationship anarchyNordgren, Andie. \\"The short instructional manifesto for relationship anarchy\\", Andie's Log, July 6, 2012. in her 2006 essay \\"The short instructional manifesto for relationship anarchy\\" that she translated from the original Swedish \\"Relationsanarki i 8 punkter\\". Swedish masters and bachelor theses by Jacob Strandell and Ida Midnattssol explored related themes. Other relevant writings exploring this topic within a similar time frame include A Green Anarchist Project on Freedom and Love and Against the Couple Form.

In March 2020, the first book dedicated monographically to RA was published, so far only in Spanish: \\"Anarquía Relacional. La revolución desde los vínculos\\".  Methods for Discussing Relationship Anarchy  *Open discussion groups: Pick a topic, especially a challenging one, relevant to your practice of RA and discuss your thoughts and/or relevant content with others *Community values discussions: Practice vulnerable conversations outside the form of isolated dyads, and instead share intimacy with a group you trust and care about *Queer desire party: A (largely) sober space for Queer folks to play, flirt, scene, snuggle, chat, and not be the only one in the room. Create a temporary autonomous zone to prioritize Queer experiences and reduce the influence of heteronormativity, cis-normativity, Patriarchy, and other systems seen to condition us towards performing normativity *Divorce/Break-up parties: A celebration of divorce as a means to free oneself from monogamy * Conflict fishbowl: Communicate about (and potentially resolve) conflict in a group setting, instead of privately and shamefully in dyads *Co-Housing visioning and execution: Make housing more accessible to folks operating outside the traditional nuclear family model, and create possibilities for new models and uses of domestic spaces *Create!: Make zines, write essays, make custom shirts/clothes/art/posters, and share what you learn from practicing RA in your life/community See also * Anarcha-feminism * Anarchism and issues related to love and sex * Free love within Anarchism * Queer anarchism References External links  Category:Anarchist culture Category:Anarchist theory Category:Interpersonal relationships Category:Intimate relationships Category:Love Category:Polyamory Category:Sexual fidelity Category:Sexuality and society ","title":"Relationship anarchy"},{"id":"39793859","text":"The Pall Mall Budget was a weekly magazine published in London from 1868 until 1920.

It was first named by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1851 and the type species is Tholodus schmidi. It is known from many disarticulated and fragmentary remains, mainly teeth and jaw fragments. Most specimens were collected from various localities across the Ladinian-aged Muschelkalk, Germany, mainly from the Jena Formation of the upper Lower Muschelkalk, where the holotype was found. Dalla Vecchia (2004) recently described two additional specimens, a mandibular ramus and a maxilla, both bearing teeth and nearly uncrushed, and some postcranial remains, from a single late Anisian outcrop, from the southern Alps of Italy. The humerus resembled that of immature individuals of the Asian genus Chaohusaurus, suggesting possible affinities to Grippidia. Tooth Jiang et al. (2008) described and named Xinminosaurus from the mid-late Anisian Guanling Formation of Guizhou, China. Maisch (2010) suggested that Xinminosaurus might be a subjective junior synonym of Tholodus. Although Jiang et al. (2008) regarded Tholodus to be a possible nomen dubium, Maisch (2010) rejected this opinion, stating that Tholodus is easily recognized and characterized by unequivocal dental autapomorphies, so that even jaw and tooth fragments are diagnostic, and it is thus a valid taxon. Furthermore, he noted that Tholodus is clearly distinguishable from all other known marine reptiles except Xinminosaurus. The only difference between the taxa, according to Maisch (2010), is that Tholodus specimens are at average twice as large as Xinminosaurus holotype.

Media outlets In addition to its own official website, HRAI maintains a number of news agencies and news websites dedicated specifically to the mission of reporting on human rights violations within Iran. HRAI's news agency, HRANA, was the first news agency in Iran dedicated solely to reporting on human rights issues. HRAI also operates a committee known as the Fourth Pillar whose mission is to facilitate the free dissemination of information and to fight censorship and internet filtering within Iran. Finally, HRAI publishes a print journal called Peace Line. Published erratically at first, it has been released on a regularly monthly schedule since 2012, and features articles, interviews, editorials, and reports pertaining to current affairs and news. Resources HRAI makes several resources available to the public to research human rights issues within Iran. Among these are the HRANA Library and Information Center, containing an electronically index collection of books and works produced by the organization as well as from outside sources; and the Center for Statistics and Records, a digital archive of human rights data and analysis.  History  HRAI was founded in 2006 by a small group of Iranian activists who gathered to organize their protests against Iranian human rights violations. Beginning with a focus on defending political prisoners, and with no resources other than those freely available within Iranian society, the group grew and attracted more members and financial support. By 2009, they had grown large enough to attract the attention of the government, which began arresting organizers and members. Later, during a period of relaxed government attitudes toward activism, the organization was able to officially register as a legal entity. The group coalesced into a defined structure with committees with specific responsibilities and specializations. During this time, HRAI achieved their most ambitious goals: cultural events, publications, outreach to political prisoners and human rights victims, and news and information networks. However, on March 2, 2010, the government of Iran moved to break up HRAI. During the subsequent reconstruction of the organization, the organization registered as a United States non-profit organization and was invited to attend the annual NGO Conference sponsored by the United Nations. HRAI has also been invited to join the World Movement for Democracy and to participate in the human rights events sponsored by the governments of Canada, the United States and the European Union. Their publications and news gathering activities have continued and expanded with the addition of the Peace Line and Fourth Pillar outlets.

(Eds.)(2003) Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon, Schorndorf. As a discipline, sport pedagogy is concerned with learning, teaching and instruction in sport, physical education and related areas of physical activity.Armour, K. (Ed.)(2011). Sport Pedagogy: An introduction for coaching and teaching. London: Pearson. Whilst sport pedagogy is mostly regarded as a sub-discipline of sport science (in North America frequently referred to as kinesiology), its theoretical grounding is also underpinned by the general education sciences. As a scientific subdiscipline sport pedagogy is therefore allied to both fields, sport science and education.Tinning, R. (2008) Pedagogy, Sport Pedagogy, and the Field of Kinesiology, Quest, 60 (3), 405-424.  Etymology and Context  In its original meaning the word pedagogy, and therefore also sport pedagogy, relates to the purposeful development of children and young people. The word pedagogy derives from the Greek (pais=’child’; agogein=’to lead’; ‘to instruct’) and implies the purposeful art of leading, educating or teaching young people.Roethig, P. and Prohl, R. (Eds.)(2003) Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon, Schorndorf, p.527. In recognition of the fact that humans are lifelong learners and also potentially engaged in lifelong physical activity, current definitions of sport pedagogy favour a broader view of the context in which sport pedagogy is located. To reflect this, the term sport pedagogy is used more holistically to include pedagogies that relate to adult learning and participation in sport and physical activity across all age ranges.  Historical Background  Historically, the roots of sport pedagogy as an academic subdiscipline of sport science can be traced back to the systematic study of physical education as a subject.Haag, H. (1989). Research in ‘sport pedagogy’: One field of theoretical study in the science of sport. International Review of Education, 35(1), 5–16 As an academic discipline sport pedagogy was first explicitly recognised during the late 1960s in continental Europe, where the discipline was seen to provide a theoretical framework for the planning and teaching of physical education in schools. In Germany for instance, the publication of Ommo Grupe’sGrupe, O. (1969)Grundlagen der Sportpädagogik, München : J. A. Barth. influential book ‘Grundlagen der Sportpädagogik’ (Foundations of Sport Pedagogy) provided a key moment in defining the concepts and content of sport pedagogy as an academic subject. It also provided the impetus for further research in this field and by the end of the 1970s, professorships in sport pedagogy were well established in sport and exercise science departments throughout Germany Universities.Roethig, P. and Prohl, R. (Eds.)(2003) Sportwissenschaftliches Lexikon, Schorndorf In the English speaking world, the recognition of sport pedagogy as a discipline is more recent. In 1989, the notable German researcher Herbert Haag observed that the meaning of the term 'sport pedagogy' was not as yet fully established in the English speaking sport science literature. Nevertheless, Haag confirmed the ascendence and usefulness of the term 'sport pedagogy' to communicate about research in learning and teaching in physical education and sport to international academic audiences in this field. The relatively late adoption of the term 'sport pedagogy' in the English speaking academic literature is also observed by the distinguished Australian researcher Richard Tinning (2008, p. 405) who notes that ‘notwithstanding the fact that our European colleagues had been using the terms pedagogy and sport pedagogy for many years, the English-speaking world of kinesiology has only relatively recently embraced the terms.’ Nonetheless, Tinning observes that sport pedagogy is now ‘firmly established as a credible academic subdiscipline’.  Sport pedagogy as a discipline and as a field of study  While research in sport pedagogy and research in the field of physical education continue to overlap,Silverman, D. (2007). Mingling with our friends: The kinesiology student and pedagogy knowledge. Quest, 59(1), 92–99 sport pedagogy is now seen to be the overarching academic discipline, informing learning, teaching and instruction in a wide range of sport, physical activity and exercise contexts.Kirk, D., Macdonald, D., and O’Sullivan, M. (Eds.)(2006). The handbook of physical education. London: Sage. At the centre of the inquiry is the pedagogical encounter between the teacher/coach/instructor and the learner/participant. In this, it is the purpose of sport pedagogy 'to support the needs of learners in sport, and other forms of physical activity, wherever and whenever they seek to learn through the life-course'.Association Internationale des Ecoles Superieures d’Education Physique (International Association for Physical Education in Higher Education) (AIESEP) AIESEP-Bham 2012 Position Statement: Sport (and Exercise) Pedagogy, Specialist Research Seminar, ‘Sport (& Exercise) Pedagogy’: (Re)Defining the Field’, p.2., Thursday 29 March – Saturday 31 March 2012, University of Birmingham, UK. http://www.aiesep.ulg.ac.be/Document/aiesep_position_statement_sport_pedagogy_2012.pdf, retrieved 27/06/13. To achieve this end, sport pedagogy researchers should be encouraged to engage in inter-disciplinary work, in order to transcend the respective academic silos that sometimes exist between the distinct sub- disciplines in sport science.

She was a friend of other leading reformers, including Bishops John Hooper and Hugh Latimer. During the reign of Mary I, she became a religious exile, and died at Frankfurt in 1556. Family Jane North's brother, Edward North, 1st Baron North Joan North was the daughter of Roger North (d.1509) and Christian Warcop, the daughter of Richard Warcop of Sinnington, Yorkshire. She had a brother, Edward North, 1st Baron North. Little is known of their relationship beyond the fact that she forgave him a debt in her will, and it may be that the relationship was strained by their differing religious beliefs. After the death of Roger North, Joan's mother, Christiana Warcop married, as his first wife, Sir Ralph Warren (c.1483–1553), Lord Mayor of London in 1536 and 1544, but had no issue by him. After Christiana's death, Sir Ralph Warren married, as his second wife, Joan Trelake (d. 8 February 1573), the daughter of John Trelake of Cornwall. According to Sutton, Joan enjoyed 'excellent relations' with her stepfather, Sir Ralph Warren, and his second wife, Joan Trelake, and was a beneficiary under Sir Ralph Warren's will.North, Jane, A Who’s Who of Tudor Women: N, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 27 June 2013. Career Monumental brass of Lady Lisle, to whom Joan Wilkinson supplied bonnets and frontlets Joan North married William Wilkinson, a wealthy London Sheriff and alderman who served on three occasions as Warden of the Mercers' Company. Between the years 1533 and 1535 Joan Wilkinson was silkwoman in the household of Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn, where according to Litzenberger, 'she would have been exposed to the evangelical beliefs espoused by Anne and her chaplains', among them Hugh Latimer. The suggestion that Joan's religious convictions were formed early is supported by the bequest to her of a ring in the will of the London mercer, Robert Pakington (d. 13 November 1536), who also held radical Protestant beliefs, and by her involvement in the importing of evangelical books in the 1530s. According to Hare, Joan Wilkinson was 'already operating on her own account' as a silkwoman in 1538. On 6 February 1538, John Husee wrote to Lady Lisle that he would send 'the bonnets and frontlets'...I had them of Mrs Wylkenson, with much ado, because Mrs Hutton hath not paid her for the last. William Wilkinson died in 1543. Peter Symonds had briefly been Wilkinson's apprentice, and continued in his widow's service. Joan Wilkinson, referring to Symonds as 'my servant at London', left him £6 13s 4d in her will. After her husband's death, and perhaps before, Joan Wilkinson resided in a house leased from the Mercers in Soper Lane in London. She had purchased the lease from Katherine Hall, mother of the chronicler, Edward Hall, and still owed Mistress Hall £250 at her death. She also held an estate in her own right at King's Stanley in Gloucestershire comprising 'a capital messuage and 60 acres' granted to her in 1552 by Edward Twissell.'King's Stanley: Manors and other estates', A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 10: Westbury and Whitstone Hundreds (1972), pp. 245–250 Retrieved 27 June 2013. In 1551 the Protestant radical John Hooper became Bishop of Gloucester. Joan Wilkinson developed a friendship with him, and with other Protestant reformers including John Bradford, Nicholas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, and Thomas Cranmer. When the reformers were imprisoned for their beliefs during the early years of the reign of Queen Mary, Joan Wilkinson acted as their advocate and supplied them with necessities. Her efforts on behalf of Bishop Latimer were recognised in a brief letter he wrote her expressing his gratitude: > If the gift of a pot of water shall not be in oblivion with God, how can God > forget your manifold and bountiful gifts when he shall say unto you, “I was > in prison, and you visited me”? Letters to her from John Bradford and Archbishop Cranmer have also survived. According to Litzenberger, Bradford was of the view that Joan Wilkinson should become a martyr to the Protestant cause, but other reformers, including Archbishop Cranmer advised her to leave England and promote Protestantism from the safety of the continent. After Bishops Ridley and Latimer were executed, Joan became a religious exile in Frankfurt, where she died in December 1556 at the house of her cousin, Cuthbert Warcop, a London mercer, and his wife, Anne. Her place of burial is unknown. Joan Wilkinson's will opens with a declaration that she was'in voluntarie exile for the true religion of Christ', and her bequests reflect her religious convictions. She left £100 for the relief of the various congregations of Protestant exiles on the continent, as well as funds for the education of Bishop Hooper's son, Daniel, and also bequeathed her Protestant books, which Bishop Hooper 'hadde the use of during his lif', to the exile congregations. She entrusted the marriage of her only surviving daughter, Jane, to her cousins, William Holland and Cuthbert Warcop, and Warcop's wife, Anne, stipulating that Jane would lose part of her inheritance if she failed to marry a husband 'utterly abhorring papistry'. She bequeathed the remaining years of the lease of her house in Soper Lane to Warcop. The will was not proved in England until 23 June 1559. Cuthbert Warcop did not long survive Joan, and in 1561 there was an arbitration between Anne Warcop, widow, William Holland and Michael Lok. Subsequently, in March 1565, Lok wrote requesting permission to keep at the Mercers’ Hall a chest containing books and writings of Joan Wilkinson and Cuthbert Warcop, both deceased. Unfortunately neither the books and writings nor the records of the arbitration have survived. Joan was praised both during her lifetime and after her death by the martyrologist, John Foxe, and John Bradford's letters to her were printed in Foxe's Actes and Monuments. Marriage and issue Joan North married William Wilkinson (d.1543), mercer and Sheriff of London, by whom she had three daughters: *Christian Wilkinson, who married William Bury of Culham, Oxfordshire, by whom she had four children. *Frances Wilkinson, who married a London mercer, Leonard Hetherington (d.1556), by whom she had several children. *Jane Wilkinson (d.1571), who was the first wife of Michael Lok, by whom she had several children.

Wall (02/19/1825https://ma- vitalrecords.org/MA/Worcester/Leicester/Images/Leicester_B097.shtml–06/13/1907) was a prominent leader in the woman's suffrage movement in the United States. She lived in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she led a successful anti-tax protest that defended a woman's right not to pay taxation without representation. Advocacy for women's suffrage A member of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, Wall was an active proponent of a woman's right to vote for over three decades in the late 19th century. Wall is perhaps most widely recognized for initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were granted the right to vote. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863. In \\"Wheeler v. Wall,\\" the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes. In 1884, Susan B. Anthony cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, \\"for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes.\\" Wall zealously argued that women were as capable as men of making appropriate voting choices. She cited the feats of renowned women in history such as Zenobia, ruler of Egypt, and Joan of Arc, submitting that these women's accomplishments are no less impressive because of their gender. Intriguingly, Wall thus argued that the \\"political nonentity of women was of modern origin,\\" holding that women of the past used to be judged based on their rank, not solely on their gender.

Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training Centre (more commonly the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, or simply the Pearson Centre) was an independent, not- for-profit organization with its office based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Its mandate was to support Canada's contribution to international peace and security. Operations ceased and the Centre closed on November 28, 2013. The Pearson Centre conducted education, training and research on all aspects of peace operations throughout the world, with the majority of its projects under way in Africa and Latin America. Services ranged from the training of police officers in Rwanda and Nigeria to serve as peacekeepers in Darfur; through delivery of pre-deployment training for Latin American peace keepers in Brasília; to the design and delivery of complex training exercises for use in Europe and Africa. It also raised revenue through its specialized training and management courses, which it ran for individuals, governments and organizations around the world. While in operation, the Pearson Centre worked with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana. The Centre provided facilitation support to the International Network to Promote the Rule of Law, which is a project of the USIP. The International Association of Peacekeeping Training Centres was founded on July 2, 1995, at the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre.http://www.iaptc.org/ International Association of Peacekeeping Training Centres The Pearson Centre also worked closely with the Canadian extractive sector to implement the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and provide training strategies to ensure that their security providers adhere to these international standards. History Lester B. Pearson committed Canada to peacekeeping on November 2, 1956 - from on the Ottawa Peacekeeping Monument The Lester B. Pearson Canadian International Peacekeeping Training Centre was created as an offshoot of the now-defunct Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies and became an independent organisation in its own right in 2001. Named in honour of Lester Bowles Pearson, the former Prime Minister of Canada and recipient of the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the inception of peacekeeping, the Centre was established initially to train Canadian and foreign soldiers in the art of peacekeeping and conflict resolution for postings with United Nations Peacekeeping missions. Alex Morrison was the first president of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, which was established in 1994 by the Government of Canada. He was followed by Sandra Dunsmore, and later Suzanne Monaghan. In 2012, the presidency of the Centre was assumed by Kevin McGarr, previously head of CATSA. In 1994, Jean-Jacques Blais was appointed chair of the centre, holding that position until he retired in 2002. Chairs have included several notable Canadians. The centre was established at Cornwallis Park, in southern Nova Scotia, using facilities made available by the closure of CFB Cornwallis. Offices were later opened in Montréal, Ottawa and Halifax. Headquarters of the Centre were moved to the Ottawa office in 2008 while most of the operations remained in Cornwallis Park. The Montréal office was closed in 2008 and Halifax wound down by 2010. As financial support to the centre was progressively withdrawn by the Federal government, operations were reduced and transferred to the Ottawa office. The Centre's Cornwallis park facilities formally closed in 2011. On September 26, 2013, the Pearson Centre announced it would be winding down its operations and closing its doors. The name was formally changed to the \\"Pearson Centre\\" in 2012. Operations ceased with the final closure of the office November 28, 2013. Senior management =William Morrison, founder= William Alexander Morrison, MSC, CD, (1941– ) was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, he is a graduate of Xavier Junior College and a historian. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1968 from Mount Allison University. He joined the Canadian Forces in 1959 and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1990. From 1980 to 1982, he was an instructor at the Royal Military College of Canada where he taught an undergraduate course in Canadian Military History. He was awarded his MSC in 1989. He was the 2002 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace, which is awarded for an individual's \\"contribution to international service.\\" From 1983 to 1989, Morrison was the military advisor to the Canadian permanent representative to the UN. He was vice-chairman of UN Peacekeeping Committee. From 1989 to 1997, he was the executive director of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies; and in 1994, he became the founding president of the Pearson Centre. =At closure= Philip Murray was chairman and Kevin McGarr president at the time of the centre's closure in 2013. The Pearson Papers The Pearson Papers were a Canadian peacekeeping press publications compiled by the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre for over 15 years. They were: *Pearson Paper 1: Public Information Campaigns in Peacekeeping: The UN Experience in Haiti; by Ingrid Lehmann In this, the first of The Pearson Papers, Ingrid Lehmann explores \\"the development of Public Information Campaigns [in Haiti], both civil and military, from 1994 to 1996. The main innovation of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was the introduction of the Military Information Support Teams (MIST).\\" MIST operations over three different phases of the peacekeeping mission in Haiti are examined: the initial deployments to Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy; UNMIH under United States leadership; and, UNMIH under Canadian leadership. *Pearson Paper 2: The Level Killing Fields of Yugoslavia: An Observer Returns; by James V. Arbuckle In the second of The Pearson Papers, James Arbuckle provides a lucid and personal account of the post-conflict situation in the former Yugoslavia. The author comments on the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords and analyzes the prospects for future peace in the region, through the prism of his considerable experience in military peacekeeping. *Pearson Paper 3: African Peacekeepers: Partners or Proxies?; by Eric G. Berman and Katie Sams In this book, the third of The Pearson Papers, Eric G. Berman and Katie E. Sams examine current efforts to develop African peacekeeping and peace enforcement capabilities. They describe various Western and African capacity-building initiatives and attempts to resolve conflicts in Africa. Drawing on numerous interviews with policy makers and practitioners, they reveal the incongruities between Western “largesse” and African needs. Berman and Sams conclude that despite current Western and African efforts, the factors resulting in inaction four years ago in Rwanda still persist. *Pearson Paper 4: Intelligence In Peacekeeping: The Cloak and the Blue Beret: The Limits of Intelligence- Gathering in UN Peacekeeping; by Walter Dorn and Out of the Closet: Intelligence Support for Post-Modern Peacekeeping; by David Charters This Pearson Paper contains two distinct chapters by two separate authors both dealing with the topic of Intelligence in Peacekeeping. Dorn looks at the United Nations’ view of “intelligence,” its reluctance to utilize and that exact terminology. Dorn explores how intelligence is an essential part of UN peacekeeping. Charters’ central argument is that post-Cold War conflicts have changed dramatically the character of peacekeeping operations, and that the change will now require peacekeepers to apply the full range of intelligence capabilities in order to bring such conflicts under control. *Pearson Paper 5: The Laws of War and The Rules of Peace: Why Traditional Legal Models Do Not Work; by Thomas B. Baines In this the fifth of The Pearson Papers, Thomas Baines presents some operational, moral and ethical challenges that arise in the context of non-traditional military operations. As well, he proposes some institutional formalisms to help limit the potential negative consequences of dealing with these challenges. His analysis and recommendations are framed for military policy makers and field commanders, rather than policy makers and executives of the other parties that may be involved in the types of missions discussed. *Pearson Paper 6: Confronting Rwandan Genocide: The Military Options What Could and Should the International Community Have Done?; by Douglas Anglin In this the sixth of The Pearson Papers, this essay explores promising courses of action that, given the necessary political will, would have been militarily feasible and morally justifiable. It assesses realistically their prospects of success in checking the haemorrhage in Rwandan lives and identifies the circumstances and significance of the opportunities missed. Particular attention is paid to the time frame as, with each day's delay, thousands of additional lives were lost. As the scale of the ethnic killing became evident, demands mounted that “something must be done”. Yet, little serious thought was paid to what that “something” realistically might be. Meaningful military intervention would have proved problematic. The operational constraints on intervening rapidly and effectively in the middle of Africa in a country with limited infrastructure could not be dismissed as insignificant — or insurmountable. *Pearson Paper 7: The 1999 United Nations and 2000 Organizations of African Unity Formal Inquiries: A Retrospective Examination of Peacekeeping and the Rwandan Crisis of 1994; by Terry M. Mays This the seventh Pearson Paper, takes a different approach in analyzing the peacekeeping related failures within Rwanda and the United Nations headquarters. In 1999, the United Nations initiated the Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the United Nations During the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. The following year the Organization of African Unity (OAU) opted to conduct its own independent investigation and established the International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events. This essay utilizes these independent investigations as the foundation for a review of the peacekeeping failure in Rwanda. Several factors for failure can be identified from the UN and OAU investigations and each is explored in this study. The essay also examines whether the 2,000-member UN peacekeeping operation on the ground in Rwanda could have halted the genocide if the political will existed to accomplish the task. Five options for the future are reviewed and a postscript includes a brief discussion on the relationship of state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention as seen through the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. *Pearson Paper 8: Lessons Learned on UNMIK Judiciary; by Mark Baskin This study was designed to review the experience of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) with judiciary capacity building. UNMIK is significant both because Kosovo is a linchpin of Balkan politics and diplomacy, and because it provides a laboratory for deriving lessons for future efforts at post-conflict governance and administration. The goal of the study was to enable policy makers to “learn the lessons of capacity building for a judiciary as a part of the mandate of a peace support cooperation if similar work in the future is to be more effective”. A direct result of this study, Pearson Paper 8, Lessons Learned on UNMIK Judiciary describes problems at each stage of judiciary building, how they were addressed, how they could have been addressed more effectively, and what changes would facilitate such improvements. After outlining the broader context in which the development of Kosovo's judicial system takes place, this assessment will describe chronological developments in the judiciary. It then turns to broader themes and patterns in the establishment of the judiciary by focusing on the specific challenges that most characterized the development of the judiciary at each stage and to some underlying patterns in the development of Kosovo's judiciary and concludes with some suggestions – both for the future of Kosovo's judiciary and in other post-conflict administrations, as well. *Pearson Paper 9: On Issues and Initiatives: The International Red Cross in Times of Duress and Ambiguity This volume focuses on issues specific to the International Red Cross. *Pearson Paper 10: Measures of Effectiveness: Peace Operations and Beyond; Ann Livingstone, PhD, Editor, Aleisha Arnusch, MA, Managing Editor This volume contains diverse approaches to measurement and even differing conceptualizations of what peace operations today consist of, including those that go ‘beyond’ the traditional notion of peacekeeping. *Pearson Paper 11 (spring): Challenges of Effective Cooperation and Coordination in Peace Operations; Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St- Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor This volume considers the challenges of coordinating military, police and humanitarian actors, sometimes sharing but more often, co-habiting a common space in complex peace operations. Faced with diverse perspectives, lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities, and the need to identify lessons learned, they are finding new and innovative ways to collaborate and synchronize their actions. *Pearson Paper 11 (fall): Opportunities for Enhancing Cooperation and Coordination in Peace Operations; Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St-Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor This volume builds on the integration described in the previous volume. It presents four ways of thinking about integration in the context of peace operations specifically and peace and security generally. Beyond simply acknowledging the need for greater cooperation and coordination in peace and security, the articles present different rationales and approaches for enhancing cooperation and coordination using examples from Africa, Asia and Latin America. *Pearson Paper 12: Environmental Considerations for Building Peace; Ann Livingstone, Ph.D., Editor, Kristine St-Pierre, M.A., Managing Editor This study considers not only the logistical nature of geography in disputes, but also environmental health impacts. For example, when water contains metals, such as lead, consumers are less rational in their deliberations and more violent. As of 2013 the papers are no longer published.

Early military conflicts were a result of the Tang interventions in the rivalry between the Western and Eastern Turks in order to weaken both. Under Emperor Taizong, campaigns were dispatched in the Western Regions against Gaochang in 640, Karasahr in 644 and 648, and Kucha in 648. The wars against the Western Turks continued under Emperor Gaozong, and the khaganate was annexed after General Su Dingfang's defeat of Qaghan Ashina Helu in 657. The Western Turks attempted to capture the Tarim Basin in 670 and 677, but were repelled by the Tang. The Second Turkic Empire defeated the fragmented Western Turks in 712, and absorbed the tribes into the new empire. The areas controlled by Tang China came under the dynasty's cultural influences and the Turkic influence of the ethnically Turkic Tang soldiers stationed in the region. Indo-European prevalence in Central Asia declined as the expeditions accelerated Turkic migration into what is now Xinjiang. By the end of the 657 campaign, the Tang had reached its largest extent. The Turks, Tibetans, Muslim Arabs and the Tang competed for control over Central Asia until the collapse of the Tang in the 10th century. Background The Gokturks split into the Western and Eastern Turkic Khaganates after a civil war. Allied with the Byzantine Empire, the Western Turks were mired in wars against the Sassanid Persians. The Western Turks expanded as the khaganate of the Eastern Turks declined. Early military conflicts Emperor Gaozu, Taizong's predecessor, allowed the assassination of a Western Turk qan by Eastern Turkic rivals on November 2, 619. Eastern Turk was the suzerain of Tang from 618 to 620. Throughout the reign of Tong Yabghu Qaghan (618–628), Western Turks and Tang had a very close relation.Golden, Introduction 135. According to Chinese historical sources, the marriage was never carried out because of interference by the Eastern Göktürk Illig Qaghan, whose territory sat between his territory and Tang territory and who felt threatened by the proposed marriage. Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 192. Emperor Taizong, in his war against the Western and Eastern Turks, employed the Chinese strategy of \\"using barbarians to control barbarians\\". In 641, he instigated a civil war between the eastern and western confederations of the Western Turks by supporting Isbara Yabghu Qaghan. The qaghan in the east, Tu-lu Qaghan, invaded the oasis states controlled by Isbara Yabghu in the west. He assassinated his rival and unified the Western Turkic Khaganate. Following the reunification, Tu-lu Qaghan began orchestrating raids against Chinese cities. In 642, Emperor Taizong once again intervened by assisting a revolt against Tu-lu's reign. Disaffected Western Turkic tribes had requested the support of Taizong in Chang'an, who enthroned a new qaghan Irbis Seguy. Irbis Seguy was able to exert control over the Turkic tribes and the former qaghan fled in exile. The Tang court and the Western Turks began negotiating over the control of five oasis states in the Tarim Basin. Irbis Seguy wanted to strengthen his ties with the Tang through a royal marriage with a Tang princess. Although the oasis states were vassals of the Turks, Irbis Seguy did not have the power to simply cede them to the Tang. The possibility of further diplomatic exchanges ended when Taizong began his invasion of the Tarim Basin. Campaigns against the Tarim Basin oasis states =Campaign against Karakhoja= Karakhoja had been ruled by the Qu family since 498. The most Sinicized of the oasis states, Karakhoja had adopted Chinese script as its official script, the Chinese classics as a subject for study, and an imperial bureaucracy. As the oasis state nearest to Tang China, the Chinese constituted a large portion of Karakhoja's population. Karakhoja also served as China's main Silk Road trade route into Central Asia. The route was severed when the Western Turk Tu-lu Qaghan, enthroned in 638, promised Karakhoja military support. =Campaigns against Karasahr= In 632, Karasahr submitted to the Tang as a tributary state, as did the nearby kingdoms of Kashgar and Khotan. Tensions between Tang and Karasahr grew as the Chinese expanded further into Central Asia, and peaked when the Tang defeated and annexed Gaochang. The Chinese forces stationed in Gaochang, a short distance away from Karasahr, posed a direct threat to the oasis state. Karasahr allied with the Western Turkic Khaganate and ceased sending tributes to the Tang court. A military campaign was dispatched by the Tang emperor against Karasahr. Led by Commander Guoxiao Ke, protectorate-general of the Anxi Protectorate, the army marched towards Karasahr from Yulduz. The Tang forces mounted a surprise attack at dawn, resulting in the annexation of Karasahr and the capture of its king. The Western Turk army to retake Karashar was defeated by the Tang. Karasahr was controlled by proxy through a Tang loyalist, Long Lipozhun, brother of the captured ruler. He was deposed in 644 by his cousin, with the support of the kingdom of Kucha, nominally a Tang vassal, and the Western Turks. In 648, the Tang conducted a second military campaign against Karasahr, commanded by Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family. Karasahr fell, the usurper was beheaded, and Tang rule was re-established under another Tang loyalist. A Chinese military garrison was established in the kingdom, the first of the Four Garrisons of Anxi. =Campaign against Kucha= After the fall of Karasahr, Ashina Sh'er's army marched towards the neighboring kingdom of Kucha. She'er's decoy horsemen led the defending Kucha forces, numbering 50,000 soldiers, into an ambush. The Kucha soldiers retreated to the nearby city of Aksu after their defeat. The Tang army besieged the city for forty days. Kucha surrendered on 19 January 649 and She'er captured the king. By employing diplomacy, the surrounding tribes loyal to Kucha submitted to the Tang. Campaign against the Western Turks Ashina Helu, a former Tang general in Gansu, fled west and declared himself qaghan of the Western Turks, unifying the Turkic tribes under a single khaganate. Helu invaded the kingdoms of the Tarim Basin and led frequent raids against bordering Tang cities. Emperor Gaozong sent an army led by Su Dingfang to defeat the Western Turks. The Turkic commanders Ashina Misha and Ashina Buzhen, rivals of Helu, led the side divisions. Ten thousand Uyghur horsemen participated in the campaign as allies of the Tang. Porun, an Uyghur leader enthroned by Emperor Taizong, oversaw the Uyghur cavalry as a vice commander. He served under the leadership of the Yanran Protector-General and Vice Protector-General, administrators of the Yanran Protectorate. The army departed from Ordos in march and traversed through 3,000 miles of steppes and desert, without stopping by the oasis kingdoms for supplies. Along the way, tribes like the Chumkun and Su offered additional reinforcements. The troops reached the Kyrgyzstan by November, enduring the harsh conditions of the winter. Su Dingfang defeated Helu's army of 100,000 cavalry at the battle of Irtysh River, fought along the Irtysh River in the Altai Mountains region. Helu had been caught off guard by Su's ambush and suffered a large number of casualties. The qaghan attempted to flee to Tashkent, but was caught the next day and sent to the Tang capital as a prisoner. The remaining tribes of the Western Turks surrendered. Gaozong pardoned Helu, but the qaghan died the following year. Further campaigns The dissolution of the khaganate fragmented the Western Turkic tribes. In 670, a Western Turkic tribe allied with the Tibetan Empire and invaded the Tarim Basin. The Anxi protectorate was abandoned and the Tang withdrew back to Turfan. Control of the oasis states returned to the Tang between 673 and 675, and the protectorate was re-established. In 677, the Western Turks conducted a second military expedition with the Tibetans against the Tang in the Tarim Basin. The Turks were repelled by the Tang and defeated in 679. Tang forces captured the leader of the Western Turks and annexed Tokmak, which was transformed into a military base. Ilterish Qaghan founded the Second Turkic Empire after a successful revolt in 682. The expansion of the khaganate continued under Ilterish's brother, Qapaghan Qaghan. In 712, Kul Tigin, son of Ilterish, defeated the remnants of the Western Turks, members of the Turgis confederation. Now defeated, the Western Turks were absorbed into the new empire. Historical significance The Tang campaigns marked the end of Indo- European Xinjiang, as Turkic linguistic and cultural influences spread into Central Asia. Tang China was responsible for the influx of Turkic migrants, because of the number of Turks that served in the Tang military as soldiers and generals during the dynasty's military expeditions. Tang influence in the Central Asia encompassed art, trade, and politics. Chinese coinage remained in use in Xinjiang after the Tang withdrew from the region. Central Asian art adopted many Tang Chinese stylistic elements, like the sancai three color glaze used for ceramics. According to Chinese sources, Turkic states and polities still valued ties with the courts of dynasties in northern China as a form of prestige. The Qarakhan and Qarakhitay khans held titles that identified them as Tabghach or Khitay, named after kingdoms in northern China. Tang architectural influences are apparent in the Buddhist architecture in Dunhuang.

Etymology The generic name is derived from Xinmin, the district where the fossil was found, and Greek sauros, \\"lizard\\". The specific name is derived from Greek kataktes, \\"crusher\\", in reference to one of the taxon's autapomorphies - the presence of bulbous and laterally compressed crushing teeth in maxilla and posterior dentary. Discovery Xinminosaurus is known only from the holotype GMPKU-P-1071, a nearly complete skeleton deposited in Geological Museum, Peking University. It was collected from the conodont Nicoraella kockeli biozone (Pelsonian of the Anisian stage), from the upper member of the Guanling Formation. It was found near Yangjuan Village of the Xinmin District, Panxian County. Maisch suggested that Xinminosaurus might be a subjective junior synonym of Tholodus. Although Jiang et al. regarded Tholodus to be a possible nomen dubium, Maisch rejected this opinion, stating that Tholodus is easily recognized and characterized by unequivocal dental autapomorphies, so that even jaw and tooth fragments are diagnostic, and it is thus a valid taxon. Furthermore, he noted that Tholodus is clearly distinguishable from all other known marine reptiles, except Xinminosaurus. The only difference between the taxa, according to Maisch, is that Tholodus specimens are on average twice as large as the holotype of Xinminosaurus. Mulder and Jagt (2019) demonstrated that the putative mosasaur \\"\\"Globidens\\" timorensis is not a mosasaur and instead represents a Xinminosaurus-like ichthyosaur.Eric W.A. Mulder and John W.M.

It was founded during the 1930s, nestled in a small valley in the Andes mountains close to other ski areas such as Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado. Location Located in the commune of Lo Barnechea, 36 km from Santiago at an altitude of 2,340 meters above sea level (7,874 feet), Farellones has a health centre, a school and about 200 houses. The houses and cabins are made of wood, giving the village its characteristic look. Ski resort Skiers began visiting the Farellones area in the 1930s and in 1937, landowner Von Kiesling decided to sell the land off as plots to form a village. Not long after this, Antonio Padrós opened one of Farellones’ first hotels, the Posada de Farellones. Farellones currently has only a few ski runs but its cable car system provides access to El Colorado, located only five kilometres up the hill of the same name. They are often considered as one joint ski area with a total of 62 runs including 11 for beginners, 6 for intermediates, 33 for advanced skiers and 12 for experts. They have a maximum altitude of 3,333 meters above sea level, a vertical descent of 906 metres and an average of 5 meters snowfall in an average year.El Colorado, Chile Powderhounds.com.

The village grew up around the new sport and in 1937, the Hotel Posada de Farellones was constructed. Some years later the hotel received a royal visit from the English Duchess of Kent and served a formal luncheon. The first ski lift was built in the 1950s in La Gran Bajada (the great descent) in the area that will become later El Colorado, where the boldest skiers could leap over the roof of the Hotel Posada de Farellones at the end of the run.Ski en Farellones http://www.farellones.com retrieved June 13, 2013 The developments continued up the mountain with La ParvaLa Parva Ski centre Retrieved July 15, 2013 and finally Valle Nevado.Valle Nevado ski centre retrieved July 15, 2013  Archaeology  Long time before the birth of Farellones village, the place was visited by arrieros (wranglers) with their livestock and adventurers searching for old Inca treasure, as it was common to find Pucarás (fortifications) and other remains of Inca settlements. On February 1, 1954 the arrieros Luis Ríos Barrueto, Guillermo Chacón Carrasco and Jaime Ríos Abarca found the Plomo Mummy (also known as the Boy of El Plomo or La Momia del Cerro El Plomo in Spanish) on Cerro El Plomo. The mummy is a well preserved Inca girl and was the first discovery of a frozen, high-altitude human sacrifice made by the Incas. =Casa de Piedra= At one side of the road to Valle Nevado is the Casa de Piedra de Farellones (Farellones Stone House), a stone structure that is believed to have been built by the Aconcagua people (late neolithic). It is thought to have been used as a temporary refugeCultura Aconcagua in expeditions to gather the special kind of stone needed for making tools hunting Guanacos. =Inca roads= Corral Quemado, 28.75 km east of Santiago and 14.5 miles from Lo Barnechea, formed part of the Inca road system. It was the road from the copper mines, today known as \\"Disputada de las Condes\\", to the Mapocho River. The Inca road system was the spine of the Inca state, essential to administrate and control their vast territory. The Spanish chronicles say that the Inca Road ran from the other side of the Andes, in Cuyo Province, Argentina, through Chilean valleys of Huechuraba and Colina and continued to the valley of what is now Santiago. The hotel The Hotel Posada de Farellones is made from a mix of wood and stone in the Swiss style and was built in the late 1930s by Antonio Padrós. Its location allowed easy access to the three main ski resorts in Chile, which together form the biggest ski area of South America and the southern hemisphere: La Parva, El Colorado-Farellones and Valle Nevado. Access There is only one road giving access to the village through the winding canyons of the Mapocho River, Molina River and Estero Yerba Loca river. From Corral Quemado onwards, the road has more than 40 hairpin turns and requires a vehicle equipped with snow chains in snowy conditions. The road only permits ascent between the hours of 8:30 and 13:30 and descent from 15:30 to 20:00 during peak ski season days. Farellones =New road= A new road was scheduled to be built in 2014.

It specializes in gears, limited- slip differentials and transmission systems for racing cars. History 1958-1979 Valerio Colotti, who is famous as the chassis designer/engineer of Maserati 250F, started his own company called Tec-Mec in 1958. One of the first achievements was the design and manufacture of differential gear set/housing for Rob Walker, which solidified his reputation in the Grand Prix circles. After building a GP car for Jean Behra, which became known as Behra- Porsche, Colotti built his own Grand Prix car named Tec-Mec F415, based on Maserati 250F in 1959, with Fritz d'Orey as the driver who finished 10th at 1959 French Grand Prix. At about the same time, Alf Francis, the Chief Engineer at Rob Walker Racing, started working with Colotti, changing the Tec- Mec name to Colotti-Francis. Colotti-Francis was responsible for a Formula Junior car named T.C.A.(Trips Colotti Automobili) built for Graf von Trips, but this project ended with Trips' death at 1961 Italian Grand Prix held at Monza, where his Ferrari 156 collided with Jim Clark's Lotus 21, when a 3rd- place finish would have secured Count Trips the first ever Grand Prix World Championship title for a German, which did not materialize until 1994. Rob Walker asked Colotti to analyse and modify the front suspension of two Lotus racing cars belonging to Rob Walker Racing, and the plausible result prompted Rob Walker to let Colotti review the design of his own Grand Prix car, Walker Special, which was being built at the time. With the new 1.5 Liter Formula One regulation going into effect for the 1960 season, Colotti designed and built T.32 5 speed and T.34 6 speed transaxles, which weighed less than 35 kg, suitable for lower-torque high-rev 1.5 Liter engines mounted behind the driver. Outside of racing field, Colotti worked under the name G.S.D. (Gear Speed Developments), such as on a transmission of a Hovercraft for Britten- Norman of Isle of Wight, and a power take-off/transfer system for the mixer drum on Cement mixer trucks, which replaced the long chain drives previously used. Lotus 18/21 with body removed Francis and Colotti knew the shortage of limited slip differential manufacturers was a big hardship experienced by Grand Prix constructors then. For example, Colin Chapman had his in-house engineers, Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, develop the sequentially shifting transaxles for Lotus 16 and Lotus 18, which he had originally asked Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy to design for Lotus 12. But despite these transaxles being unique and innovative, they still incorporated limited slip differentials made by ZF of Germany, which was about the only source, and the technology used was an old slip-limiting principle invented by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s for Auto Union GP cars. Colotti, whose company name had become Colotti Trasmissioni (Colotti Transmission) by this time, researched the issue, developed and patented a unique mechanism called Coppia-Frenata to limit the slip on the differential gears. This limited-slip differential became popular among the Formula 1 and other racing teams, being one of the few viable alternatives to the ZF product. Lotus 29 In 1962, Colin Chapman asked Colotti to design and build a transaxle for a car designed for Indianapolis 500. This high torque specification 4 speed T.37 transaxle was designed for Small Block Ford-based engines. On Lotus 29, which had a Ford 256 CID all-aluminium OHV pushrod V-8, based on their iron Fairlane 260 CID V-8, the T.37 was used with 2 speeds blanked off. And the car went on to score the 2nd and 7th-place finishes at 1963 Indy 500 in the hands of Jim Clark and Dan Gurney, respectively. Lola Mk6 4th prototype Ford GT40 T.37 was, with all four drive/driven gear sets, then used by Eric Broadley on Lola Mk6, and by Ford for the Ford GT40 in the joint project with Broadley. History 1980-Present Gianpaolo Dallara asked Colotti Trasmissioni to develop and manufacture a racing version of the transaxle for Lancia Montecarlo, which was to be Fiat Group's FIA Group 5 weapon. Equipped with a new quick-response limited-slip differential called Duo-Block, this transaxle was very successful by winning the World Endurance Championship in 1980 and 1981, and Duo-Block was patented. Lancia Beta Montecarlo Group 5 Colotti Trasmissioni was also active in the Rally sector, by developing a new kind of limited-slip center differential for four wheel drive competition cars. This torque splitting/proportioning device is patented as Split-Diff. Ferrari 125 Valerio Colotti having worked for Ferrari in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and having engineered the chassis and transmission of their first GP car of its own design under Enzo Ferrari, Aurelio Lampredi and Gioacchino Colombo, Piero Ferrari asked Colotti Trasmissioni to build an exact replica of Ferrari 125, with the original engine and drawings provided by the Maranello factory. This first-ever Ferrari-built Grand Prix car had been lost, and the completed replica currently resides in Museo Ferrari in Maranello, alongside newer Ferrari F1 machines.

Biography =Early life= Julian A. McPhee was born in San Francisco in 1896 to Charles and Ellen MacDonald McPhee, Canadian immigrants of Scottish descent. He grew up in San Francisco, California, before earning his B.A. in agriculture from University of California, Berkeley in 1917. During his senior year, McPhee began teaching agricultural education at Pomona High School in Los Angeles County. He continued pursuing education as a career before enlisting in the United States Navy as an ensign during the final months of World War I. He briefly worked as an instructor at the Naval Port Guard and an aide in Naval Intelligence before receiving an honorable discharge when the war ended in 1918. Julian returned to San Francisco and married Alma Doyle, with whom he would have six daughters: Helen, Bernadette, Jean, Claire, Carol, and Jule Ann. =Career= Agricultural Education After the war, McPhee resumed his pursuit of education, becoming a high school agriculture teacher at Gilroy High School in Gilroy, California, where he was soon promoted to vice principal. During his years as a high school educator, McPhee strongly emphasizing agricultural education by forming agricultural and mechanical clubs in each of Gilroy's public schools, as well as encouraging \\"learn by doing,\\" a philosophy which he later adapted to the Cal Polys, which still employ it to this day. In 1928, McPhee completed his master's degree in Agricultural Education through the University of California, Los Angeles. From 1926 to 1944, McPhee worked as Chief of the State Bureau of Agricultural Education, forming the California state headquarters of Future Farmers of America in Sacramento, California, which were transferred to San Luis Obispo, California in 1931. Tenure at Cal Poly Due to his influence in agricultural education, McPhee was appointed president of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1933, replacing Benjamin Crandall, who resigned due to his frustration with the college's dilapidated facilities and the lack of funding caused by the Great Depression. By increasing profitable agricultural programs at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, McPhee not only saved the college from being closed by the state, but developed Cal Poly San Luis Obispo from a two-year technical school to a four-year college in the California State University (CSU) system. Prior to McPhee's appointment, in 1930 due to crushing budget constraints, Cal Poly transitioned to an all-male institution as a cost savings measure, a policy which continued until 1956. During World War II, McPhee served as director of California's War Food Production Training Program. He later served as acting chief of the Bureau of Readjustment Education, assistant executive officer of the State Board of Vocational Education, and director of Vocational Education for the State of California. He also oversaw the establishment of a second Cal Poly campus in Pomona, California which he acquired from cereal magnate Will Keith Kellogg in 1949 and which became a separate CSU college, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, in 1966. That same year, after thirty-three years as president of the Cal Polys, Julian A. McPhee retired due to failing health. He died of colon cancer on November 10, 1967 at the age of 71. Two current landmarks of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's campus are named for McPhee: the Julian A. McPhee University Union and Julian's Patisserie, a small coffee shop located within the Robert E. Kennedy Library, itself named for Robert E. Kennedy, McPhee's successor as university president. References External links *Cal Poly: Biography of Julian A.

According to the hypothesis, vitamin D deficiency may predispose to infection. Evidence supporting the hypothesis derives from some scientific studies and the observation that outbreaks of respiratory infections occur predominantly during months associated with lower exposure to the sun. Evidence against the hypothesis has also been reported. The Institute of Medicine concluded in a 2011 report that the existing data were \\"not consistently supportive of a causal role\\" for the vitamin in reducing the risk of infection. However, more recent studies show that Vitamin D provides a protective role in reducing the incidence of respiratory infection. Ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D An inverse association between exposure to the sun and upper respiratory tract infections was first proposed in 1926 by Smiley, who theorized that seasonality of infection was caused by “disordered vitamine metabolism in the human...directly due to a lack of solar radiation during the dark months of winter.”Smiley DF.

However, the seasonality of infections such as influenza may also be explicable by other factors. For example, low absolute humidity favours the survival of the influenza virus. A review by authors from the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy suggested that while low-dose vitamin D supplementation was unlikely to be harmful, \\"sensible sun exposure\\" was \\"an inexpensive and enjoyable way\\" to ensure healthy levels of vitamin D.  Evidence  Evidence both for and against an association of vitamin D and respiratory infections has been reported. Early studies of vitamin D and mice came to different conclusions, with one group reporting a link and the other no link between deficiency and infection. More recent studies of humans have also had divergent results. A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that people with the lowest blood vitamin D levels reported having significantly more recent colds or cases of the flu chronic respiratory disorders, especially those who had pre-existing respiratory ailments.massgeneral press release http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1103 A report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that children who took vitamin D3 supplements daily in winter were 42% less likely to get infected with seasonal flu than those who were given a placebo.food consumer newsite http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/2/other_diseases/vitamin_d_as_effective_as_vaccine_in_preventing_flu_1403100231.html Mongolian schoolchildren who drank vitamin D fortified milk during winter reported having fewer colds than those who received non-fortified milk. Another study found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence or severity of upper respiratory tract infections. Authors of one of the positive studies also stressed that their results would need to be confirmed in clinical trials before vitamin D could be recommended to prevent infections. The Institute of Medicine released a comprehensive, peer-reviewed report on calcium and vitamin D in 2011. The conclusion of the report was that the existing studies did not provide strong or consistent evidence for a link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory tract infections. The authors stated that data from randomised controlled trials would be needed, showing a dose response to vitamin D supplementation, before recommendations could be considered.DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES FOR CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium, Food and Nutrition Board.

Vitamin D supplementation Proponents of the vitamin D hypothesis have recommended dietary supplements (5,000 International Units (IU)/day for adults and 1,000 IU/day for every 25 pounds of body weight in children) and suggested that larger doses (2,000 IU/kg/day for 3–4 days) could be used to treat influenza. It has been noted that large doses of vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia and that \\"single megadoses\\" of vitamin D, while not especially harmful, may be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures.

In 2013 they raised $25 million and the product launched to college students on September 24, 2014. Since then it has rebranded as Treats, Inc. (2015), Surpriseme.io, Inc. (2016), and Surprise HR Holdings, Inc. (2017) after which Duplan founded a wholly owned subsidiary Surprise HR, Inc. (2017) which rebranded to Surprise.com, Inc. in 2020. The Treats concept was slightly tweaked with each rebranding to align with the new target market (focusing on user acquisition, employee appreciation, employee goal alignment).  History  Clinkle was founded in 2011 by Lucas Duplan, then a computer science student at Stanford University. Duplan had decided to work on mobile payments during a study abroad program in London after his freshman year. Upon returning to Stanford, Duplan received guidance from Mehran Sahami, a professor who taught the university's introductory programming methodology class. Clinkle rented a house in Palo Alto, California using money from Duplan's parents and a summer program through Highland Capital Partners. With approximately a dozen students building the app, it ran a beta test at Stanford in which testers could send payments to each other. Through VMware co-founder Diane Greene, Duplan met Accel partner Jim Breyer, who became interested in the company after discussing it with Stanford professors and graduate students. Breyer became an investor following his first meeting and product demonstration with Duplan and participated in a round of funding for the company. By June 2013, Clinkle had raised $25 million from a broad range of investors, including Greene, Andreessen Horowitz, Intel Capital, Intuit, Peter Thiel, Owen Van Natta, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The funding amounted to the largest seed round in Silicon Valley. Shortly after, Duplan moved the 50-person company from Mountain View to San Francisco. In 2016 a photo was leaked of CEO Duplan and Richard Branson burning wads of fake $100 bills. In October 2013, former Netflix chief financial officer Barry McCarthy became Clinkle's chief operating officer, and two more former Netflix executives later joined as vice presidents. McCarthy left Clinkle after less than 5 months at the company. Near the end of the year, the company laid off a quarter of its employees. In 2015, seven core employees quit and the remaining team was believed to be mostly consultants providing support and no more than 12, down from 70 several years ago. Forbes reported in January 2016 that investors were losing patience with the lack of any market product and were requesting a return of funds. Product Clinkle released an app for download on Google Play and the iTunes Store. Clinkle first launched on college campuses and targeted merchants near college campuses. Clinkle announced on September 26, 2013, that after two months of opening their college waitlists, over 100,000 students had signed up despite no clear product description. Until September 2014, the app had very limited functionality and only allowed users to join a waitlist with a launch date of September, 2014. Before launching, the company had released limited information about its product, despite significant press coverage. The product was intended to include a mobile app that served as an online wallet. Wallets would be linked to existing credit cards and bank accounts. A June 2013 report by TechCrunch stated that the app was going to use high-frequency sound to send payments between devices; however, the section was shortly retracted. Clinkle confirmed that the product would not require near field communication, a wireless technology used by Google Wallet and Apple Pay. Clinkle stated that the product would also provide merchants with information about their customers for the purpose of targeted sales promotions. Despite its initial launch as an alternative payments processing system, it lost its technological edge to new products like Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments app, and later Apple Pay, which achieved what the company had originally set out to do. The company decided to pivot, and launched to the public on September 24, 2014, a new flagship downloadable application aimed at college students. The launch debuted a Clinkle Card that allowed users to earn rewards for paying at stores and online. After every seventh payment, Clinkle card users were awarded a \\"Treat\\" to send to a friend, which had a chance of earning the recipient a free purchase.

The Association represents the interests of the predominantly medium- sized companies in the mechanical engineering industry towards policymakers and society, as well as towards business, the scientific community, public authorities and the media. With more than 1.3 million employees and a turnover of around EUR 228,7 billion (2019)Maschinenbau in Zahl und Bild, VDMA, 2020 mechanical and plant engineering is Germany's largest employer in the industrial sector. German machinery production is valued at EUR 224 billion (2019) and Germany's mechanical and plant engineering sector is extremely export-oriented (with an export rate of 80,3 percent; 2019).VDMA: Maschinenbau in Zahl und Bild 2020 In addition, VDMA sees itself as a platform that provides its member companies with various networks where they can discuss technological challenges, interdisciplinary issues and many other topics. The association was founded in 1892.  Core topics  VDMA concentrates its efforts on eight key topics: Markets and economy – VDMA provides its members with country-specific and economic data, which they can then use as a planning basis for their business decisions. Research and production – VDMA provides its member companies with a network, where new trends and technologies in production can be discussed so that they can forge new paths as part of Industrielle Gemeinschaftsforschung (industrial collective research, IGF). One of many examples here is Industrie 4.0. Energy and environment – VDMA essentially supports the German federal government's energy and climate protection goals and promotes an ambitious implementation of the European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive. German mechanical and plant engineering makes an important contribution to this by providing and using energy efficient technologies. VDMA combines the topic areas of technology, research and energy policy in various formats such as the VDMA Forum Energy, where VDMA pools the energy policy-related activities of the associations and the sector's expertise on energy. The Forum Energy also acts as a voice for the investment goods industry and represents the interests of mechanical and plant engineering towards policymakers and the public. Social and economic policy – Mechanical and plant engineering is the largest industrial employer in Germany, with more than one million employees. VDMA's core activities therefore include analysis, commenting and discussion of social and economic policy issues. The Association publishes its joint positions on economic policies regarding the following topics on an annual basis: labor market and wage policy, foreign trade policy, education policy, securing a skilled workforce, energy policy, Europe policy, research policy, social security, tax policy, technology policy, environmental policy and a sustainable state. Profession and training – VDMA is involved in activities relating to apprenticeships, degree programs and professional qualifications. VDMA's Education department is the main contact in this field. Companies and management – strategic positioning, operative management, human resource development, corporate social responsibility and many others. Against this backdrop, the Management Services department at VDMA is the first point of contact regarding management issues; its consultants are available to all member companies and obliged to maintain confidentiality. Law and taxes - VDMA's team of economic lawyers specialized in the investment goods industry work on the topics of law and taxes. Standardization and technology policy Standardization and technology policy facilitate technological and economical collaboration on a national, European and international level. VDMA supports the competitiveness of mechanical engineering via the DIN Standards Committee Mechanical Engineering (NAM). Furthermore, the Standardization department coordinates activities regarding the creation of VDMA Specifications – the standardization process for mechanical engineering.  Campaigns  Campaigns highlight VDMA's activities and focus on topics that are particularly important from VDMA's point of view. \\"Arbeit 4.0\\" – Everything remains different Industrie 4.0 will not only make economic processes and production process more efficient, but also help to change the world of work. Mechanical and plant engineering plays an important role here as both a provider and a user of Industrie 4.0 technologies. www.allesbleibt-anders.net Blue Competence – The sustainability platform The mechanical and plant engineering industry shows that sustainability increases profitability. This realization also holds true for other sectors and other parts of the world. The idea behind Blue Competence is to show that sustainable business can be a great help to both customers and producers in mechanical engineering. \\"Talentmaschine\\" – The mechanical engineering portal for the next generation VDMA uses the online portal Talentmaschine.de to reach out to school and university students who are interested in technology and looking for an apprenticeship, internship or traineeship. The portal offers a nationwide overview of job listings in mechanical engineering, and gives the around 3,200 VDMA members a handy tool that helps them find new talent. \\"Maschinenhaus\\" – The VDMA initiative for student success Increasing student success in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at all German universities is an important objective for VDMA. The aim is to lower high drop-out rates and help make more engineers available on the labor market. \\"Wir unternehmen was\\" – CSR is an important topic in mechanical engineering Many mechanical engineering companies in Germany not only develop sustainable products and processes, but also make a contribution to society with great commitment and responsibility. This commitment is as varied as the companies themselves.  Organization  VDMA is a registered association based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and comprises six regional subsidiaries, seven representative offices in foreign countries and 37 trade associations. VDMA was founded in 1892 and celebrated its 125-year anniversary in 2017. The strategic positioning and operative leadership of VDMA are the responsibility of the Executive Directorate. The Association is headed by a Board of Chairmen comprising three elected company representatives. The President is elected every three years and cannot be re- elected. A Restricted Board and a Main Board with company representatives from mechanical and plant engineering act as advisory committees for the Board of Chairmen.Zechlin, Jans-Jürgen: Verbandsmanagement im Strukturwandel: Analysen - Kommentare - Erfahrungen, Fossil-Verlag, Köln, 2000 VDMA Board of Chairmen: * Karl Haeusgen, President of VDMA, HAWE Hydraulik SE, Munich * Henrik Schunk, Vice-President of VDMA, Schunk GmbH & Co.

It has its origin in the Verein Rheinisch- Westfälischer Maschinenbauanstalten, which was founded two years earlier and aimed to improve delivery and price conditions for mining and plant machinery in particular. Its first office was in Düsseldorf. Several trade associations joined VDMA over the years that followed, one of them being the Verein Deutscher Werkzeugmaschinenfabriken (German Machine Tool Builders’ Association, VDW), which joined in 1916. In 1918, VDMA moved from Düsseldorf to Berlin.Hans Pohl, Johannes Markner: VDMA – 100 Jahre im Dienste des Maschinenbaus. MaschinenbauVerlag GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, 1992 In 1934, a year after the Nazis seized power, the new government adopted the “Gesetz zur Vorbereitung des organischen Aufbaus der deutschen Wirtschaft” (Law detailing the organic construction of the German economy). As part of this process, all business associations were united under one central management system and answerable to the Reich's Minister of Economic Affairs. VDMA became part of the newly founded the Wirtschaftsgruppe Maschinenbau (mechanical engineering economic group), membership of which was also compulsory for all companies that had not previously been part of an association. This group was led by Karl Lange, the Executive Director of VDMA. At the end of the war, the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Maschinenbau (business association for mechanical engineering, WVMA) was founded. A year later, the Verein Bayerischer Maschinenbau-Anstalten (association of Bavarian mechanical engineering institutes, VBMA), the Wirtschaftsvereinigung der Maschinenbau-Anstalten in Groß-Hessen (business association for mechanical engineering institutes in Greater Hesse, WVMH) and the Wirtschaftsverband Maschinenbau in Berlin (business association for mechanical engineering in Berlin) were founded. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Verbände der Deutscher Maschinenbau-Anstalten (working group of the associations of German mechanical engineering institutes, AVDMA) was the first supra-regional association to be founded, in 1947. In 1949, the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) was re-established in Königstein im Taunus. Shortly after that – in 1950 – VDMA established a liaison office in the German capital, Bonn. A year later, the Gesellschaft zur Förderung des Maschinen- und Anlagenbaus mbH (society for the promotion of mechanical and plant engineering, GzF) and the Maschinenbau Verlag GmbH (later VDMA Verlag) were founded. In 1954, VDMA took part in founding the Europe Liaison Group of the European Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic and Metalworking Industries (Orgalime) in Brussels, Belgium. In 1966, VDMA's headquarters moved to Niederrad, a district of Frankfurt. A number of sub- organizations were founded over the following years: Forschungskuratorium Maschinenbau e.V. (research association for the mechanical engineering industry, FKM) in 1968, Dokumentation Maschinenbau e.V. (DOMA) and the Deutsche Maschinenbau-Institut (German mechanical engineering institute, DMI) now Maschinenbau-Institut GmbH (MBI) in 1972, the Fachinformationszentrum Technik (technology information center) in 1979. During the next few years, political contacts were established and intensified on a national and international scale. VDMA established a liaison office in Brussels in 1972; another followed in Tokyo in 1984. In 1980, the Association changed its German name from Verein Deutscher Maschinenbau-Anstalten to Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau. The abbreviation, VDMA, remained the same. VDMA's Impuls Foundation was founded in 1992, followed by VDMA Gesellschaft für Forschung und Innovation mbH (society for research and innovation, VFI) in 1998. That same year, VDMA's Berlin office was inaugurated.

The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. The technology first appeared in January 1975 on the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Carina, the Toyota Corolla, and the Toyota Sprinter. There were three different versions initially introduced, called TTC-C for Catalyst, installing a catalytic converter, TTC-V for Vortex, installing an exhaust gas recirculation valve, and TTC-L which used a lean burn method. As Toyota's technology evolved the three systems were eventually incorporated together in future models. The TTC-V was a licensed copy of Honda's CVCC system, and was first introduced in February 1975. It was only available in the Carina and Corona lines, and only on the 19R engine, a modified 18R. From March 1976 the TTC-V system was upgraded to meet the stricter yet 1976 emissions standards. The TTC-V engine was discontinued in 1977. The \\"Vortex\\" approach was also used with Mitsubishi's MCA-Jet technology, with Mitsubishi installing an extra valve in the cylinder head, as opposed to the pre-chamber approach from Honda. Toyota installed its emission control technology in select Daihatsu vehicles, as Toyota was a part owner. The system was labeled \\"DECS\\" (Daihatsu Economical Cleanup System) and the versions installed were the DECS-C (catalyst) in the Daihatsu Charmant, and the Daihatsu Consorte. As the Japanese regulations continued to be tightened, the DECS-C system was replaced by the DECS-L (lean burn)ダイハツ希薄燃焼方式 DECS-L 広報資料 - ダイハツ工業 1976/05 method which was also installed in the Daihatsu Fellow, the Daihatsu A-series engine, the Daihatsu Charade, and the Daihatsu Delta.
