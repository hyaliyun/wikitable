Background Le Havre is a brown or black horse with a white coronet on his left hind foot, bred in Ireland by the Team Hogdala. The Hogdala team, based at the Haras de Coulonces is made up of Jan and Maja Sundstrom and their daughter Anna Drion: he was described by Drion as a \\"beautiful\\" foal. Le Havre was sired by Noverre, a top-class miles who won the Sussex Stakes in 2001 and finished second or third in ten other Group One races. As a breeding stallion, his other good winners included Music Show (winner of the Falmouth Stakes), I'm A Dreamer (Beverly D. Stakes), Miss Lucifer (Challenge Stakes), Summit Surge (York Stakes) and Enora (Preis der Diana). Le Havre's dam, the German mare Marie Rheinberg, was an unraced half- sister to the leading racehorse and sire Polar Falcon. As a descendant of the broodmare Barley Corn, Marie Rheinberg was distantly related to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sassafras. As a yearling, Le Havre was consigned by the Haras de Coulonces to the Arqana sale at Deauville in August 2007, where he was bought for €100,000 by the French trainer Jean-Claude Rouget acting on behalf of Gerard Augustin-Normand. Augustin-Normand later said that the colt \\"winked at him from the sales ring\\" and named him after his home town. During his racing career the colt was trained by Rouget at his stable near Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and was ridden in all but one of his races by Christophe Lemaire. Racing career =2008: two-year-old season= Le Havre made his racecourse debut at Deauville-Clairefontaine Racecourse on 30 August when he won the Prix de la Ville de Liseux over 1600 metres, beating Surdoue by three quarters of a length. Five weeks later the colt faced eight opponents in the Prix Nino over the same distance at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. He won by two lengths from the André Fabre-trained Feels All Right with a gap of three lengths back to Varenar (later to win the Prix de la Forêt) in third place. The colt was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Group One Critérium International over the same course and distance on 2 November in which he was ridden by Ioritz Mendizabal and started 5/2 favourite in an eleven-runner field. He raced in mid-division before making progress on the outside in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished seventh behind the British-trained colt Zafisio. =2009: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Le Havre ran in the Listed Prix Djebel over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 10 April. Most of the attention for the race was focused on the Freddy Head-trained favourite Naaqoos, who had won the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère and was regarded as a leading fancy for the 2000 Guineas. Lemaire on Le Havre tracked Davy Bonilla on Naaqooa before moving up to challenge the leader 200 metres from the finish. He gained the advantage in the last 100 metres and won by a head at odds of 4/1. On 10 May Le Havre contested the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started the 7.5/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Super Pistachio (Champagne Stakes), Naaqoos, Vocalised (Greenham Stakes, Tetrarch Stakes) and Silver Frost (Prix de Cabourg, Prix Thomas Bryon, Prix Omnium II, Prix de Fontainebleau). Le Havre raced towards the middle of the eleven-runner field and turned into the straight in fifth place. He made steady progress in the closing stages to take second place, two lengths behind Silver Frost and just ahead of Naaqoos and Super Pistachio. Le Havre was one of seventeen colts to contest the 172nd running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 7 June. Silver Frost started favourite ahead of Carthage (Prix de l'Avre), Super Pistachio, and Feels All Right with Le Havre starting at odds of 11.9/1. The other runners included Zafisio and the Prix Hocquart winner Wajir and the Criquette Head-trained Fuisse. Le Havre was not among the early leaders and turned into the straight in seventh place, positioned close to the inside rail before Lemaire switched him to the outside approaching the last 400 metres. The colt took second place 300 metres out, overtook the leader Fuisse 150 metres from the finish, and won by one and half lengths. Super Pistachio took third place ahead of Carthage and the 40/1 outsider Calvados Blues. After the race, Rouget said \\"I didn't know if the horse would stay ten furlongs as his pedigree is very fast, and because I wasn't sure, I wasn't overly confident\\". The reclusive Augustin- Normand watched the race at home on television. Le Havre sustained serious tendon injuries in the Prix de Jockey Club and his retirement was announced four weeks later. Stud record Le Havre was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Haras De La Cauviniere at Notre-Dame-de-Courson in Lower Normandy. In his first season at stud he sired the filly Avenir Certain who won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Prix de Diane. Amongst his other winners are Auvray (Prix de Lutèce, Prix Chaudenay), Queen Bee (Prix du Calvados), La Cressonniere and Villa Marina.

His employer noticed Nikodim's talent for drawing and provided the funds for him to study at the \\"Society for the Encouragement of the Arts\\", in Saint Petersburg.Prisimenant dailininką Nikodemą Silvanavičių \\"In Memoriam Nikodemas Silvanavičius\\" by Dalia Tarandaitė (2005) @ Literatūra ir menas. In 1856, he passed the entrance exams for the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied with Fyodor Bruni, Alexey Tarasovich Markov and Timofey Neff. He graduated in 1863 and was awarded the title of \\"free artist\\". For a short time, he lived in Vilnius, painting portraits, decorating churches and marrying the daughter of a local landowner. However, the suppression of Lithuanian culture that followed the January Uprising made life there increasingly difficult, so he moved back to his hometown with his new wife, and the local uyezd commissioned him to decorate all the churches in its jurisdiction. He also created several icons, none of which have survived. For his work, he was awarded the title \\"Artist of the Third Degree\\" and returned to the Academy in 1866 to learn how to make mosaics. From that point on, mosaics formed the largest portion of his artistic output and he worked on several major projects throughout Saint Petersburg. He later achieved the titles of \\"Second Degree\\" and \\"First Degree\\" and was named an Academician in 1876. The same year, one of works (\\"Prisoners\\") was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 3rd degree, in 1881. =His wife's illness= Shortly after, his wife was diagnosed with tuberculosis.Dailininkas Nikodemas Silvanavičius \\"The Painter Nikodemas Silvanavičius\\" by Dalia Tarandaitė (2005) @ Literatūra ir menas. Concerned that Saint Petersburg's climate was bad for her, he bought a home near Birštonas, a health resort, where she lived with their son Josef, who had a paralyzed arm. He spent his summers and vacations there, roaming about, making sketches for paintings, and briefly operating a photography studio. By 1898, he was a Counselor at the Imperial Academy but, after his wife died in 1901, he tendered his resignation, citing eye disease and old age, collected his pension, and moved to Birštonas permanently, where he set up a workshop in his home. In 1909, he was commissioned the Bishopric of Vilnius to create fourteen scenes depicting the Stations of the Cross for the new Church of Saint Jude the Apostle in Birštonas. In 1911, an inheritance enabled him to buy a post-station to provide Josef with a source of income. During World War I, he lived in Saint Petersburg. His place and date of death are disputed, but he probably settled in Prienai and died while on a visit to his native village.

It covers a 231,000 km² area that is bounded by Sardinia to the west, Corsica to the northwest, Sicily to the southeast, and peninsular Italy to the northeast. The Tyrrhenian basin displays an irregular seafloor marked by several seamounts and two distinct sub-basins - the Vavilov and Marsili basins. The Vavilov deep plain contains the deepest point of the Tyrrhenian basin at approximately 3785 meters. The basin trends roughly northwest-southeast with the spreading axis trending northeast-southwest.  Regional geologic setting  The Aeolian Islands The Tyrrhenian basin is located in a geologically complex portion of the Mediterranean Sea. The basin is partially encircled by several orogenic belts, including the Apennines to the northeast, the Alps to the north, and the Atlas mountains to the southwest. It is also bounded by a convergent boundary and associated trench to the southeast. Deep reflection seismic lines near the trench clearly show oceanic lithosphere from the African plate flexing beneath Calabria to join a seismogenic slab that extends down to 500 km beneath the Tyrrhenian basin. Between the upper slope of the trench and Calabria are a number of small fore-arc basins that developed through extensional listric faulting during the Tortonian. These basins subsequently subsided between the late Pliocene and Quaternary and are now infilled with mélange. The Aeolian Islands north of Calabria and Sicily represent the volcanic arc of the convergent system. The volcanism associated with these islands occurs at the northeast closure of the downgoing slab and began approximately during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene (1.5–1.7 Ma). The Tyrrhenian basin lies to the northwest of the Aeolian Islands and represents a back-arc basin formed from tensional forces associated with the northwest subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasian plate. Similar to other back-arc basins, the Tyrrhenian basin displays a shallowing of the Moho discontinuity towards the central part of the basin, a Wadati Benioff zone, abnormally high heat flow (exceeding 200 mW/m² in some places), and an active volcanic belt on the arc- ward edge of the basin. = Basement structure = Tyrrhenian basement rocks consist of late Paleozoic granites derived from the Hercynian orogeny. Basement rocks in the southeastern portion of the basin were reactivated during the Alpine orogeny while those to the northwest were undisturbed. Stratigraphy = Upper Sardinia Margin = The Upper Sardinia Margin is a fault-bounded passive margin located northwest of the Vavilov Basin. Seismic reflection surveys across the Upper Sardinia Margin exhibit a stratigraphic geometry suggestive of pre-rift, syn-rift, and post-rift sequences. Drill cores penetrating to the base of the syn-rift sediments identified a transgressive sequence related to subsidence of the continental crust during the rifting stage of the Tyrrhenian Basin opening. At the base of the syn-rift sequence are 60 meters of Tortonian conglomerate with subrounded clasts derived from metamorphosed carbonate and quartzitic basement. It is inferred that this conglomerate formation was deposited in a high-energy subaerial environment like an alluvial fan. Overlying the conglomerate formation are oyster-bearing glauconitic sandstones deposited in a nearshore environment. Late Tortonian to Early Messinian calcareous ooze and claystone with benthic foram assemblages overlays the sandstone formation; this indicates that water depth increased, perhaps due to subsidence at the end of the syn-rift period. The boundary between the syn-rift and post-rift periods is believed to be located in a 50-meter section of late Messinian gypsum that overlays the calcareous ooze and claystone formations. At the top of the stratigraphic section are 243 meters of Pliocene to Pleistocene post-rift sediment containing calcareous mud with occasional terrigenous clastics and volcanic ash. = Lower Sardinia Margin = The Lower Sardinia Margin lies near the transition between continental and oceanic crust. This is the easternmost point on the margin where pre-rift, syn-rift, and post-rift sediments can be clearly discerned on seismic reflection profiles. A drill core to the base of the syn-rift sediments revealed 533 meters of thinly-bedded, calcareous, siltstone and sandstone with dispersed detrital gypsum grains and anhydrite nodules. The entire sequence is reversely magnetized, which when placed in the context of the adjacent stratigraphy, suggests that it was deposited during the reversed polarity event of the Gilbert epoch (between 4.79 and 5.41 Ma). The environment of deposition for this section is uncertain; however, due to the presence of thin, well-graded layers and a lack of marine fossils, it is possible that the formation was deposited in a closed lacustrine setting. Overlaying the syn-rift sediments are 200 meters of Pliocene to Pleistocene hemipelagic marine sediment with intermittent volcanic glass. This sediment layer is believed to be deposited after the end of rifting due to its subhorizontal seismic reflection profile. = Vavilov Sub-Basin = The basement rock in the Vavilov Basin consists of strongly serpentinized peridotite with both high and low-temperature phases of deformation. The peridotite is overlain by 120 meters of tholeiitic pillow basalt containing carbonate-filled veins. Nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera within the carbonate veins constrain the age of emplacement between 3.1–3.6 Ma. Immediately above the basalt is a 100-meter-thick section of Pleistocene sedimentary cover, consisting primarily of nannofossil-rich mud with occasional reworked volcanogenic debris. = Marsili Sub-Basin = The basement rock of the Marsili Basin is vesicular basalt. Due to the abundance (10–30% of rock volume) and size (up to 3 or 4 mm) of the vesicles, it is likely that the basalt was emplaced as a flow rather than a sill. Overlaying the basement is 250 meters of calcareous mud and ooze with interbedded volcanoclastic layers. Benthic foraminifera and magnetic anomaly data from the base of this section constrain the terminus of rifting between 1.67 and 1.87 Ma. At the top of the stratigraphic section are 350 meters of volcanoclastic turbidites.  Basin tectonics and evolution  = Temporal onset of rifting = It is widely agreed that extension in the Tyrrhenian basin began in the late Miocene, as shown by the recognition in seismic reflection profiles of pre-evaporitic (i.e. pre-Messinian) sediments in the western Tyrrhenian and by age estimates based on the overall lithospheric thickness, basement relief, and heat flow. K-Ar dating of peripheral oceanic basalts, drilled at the southeast edge of the Vavilov plain, estimates the beginning of extension to be 7.3 ± 1.3 Ma. Basalts recovered near the spreading center, in middle of the Vavilov plain, yielded ages of 3.4–3.6 Ma. This means that back-arc extension in this part of the basin occurred approximately between the late Tortonian and the middle Pliocene. However, in the Marsili plain, the oldest basaltic crust was found to be 2.1 Ma. This lower age limit, along with the presence of a saddle containing continental crust (the \\"Issel bridge\\") between the Vavilov and Marsili plains, implies that there were two distinct episodes of back-arc extension. = Mechanism of development = Between the Tortonian and middle Pliocene, W-E directed extension opened the Vavilov plain and Sardinia margin in the northwest portion of the present day basin. By the end of the Pliocene, extension rapidly turned to NW-SE and was limited to the southeastern Marsili plain. This rapid shift in the direction and spatial location of extension may be due to how the relative velocities of interacting tectonic plates change over time. For example, if the horizontal velocity of the overriding Eurasian plate exceeds the velocity of slab rollback and trench retreat in the underthrusting African plate, then extension should not occur in the back-arc region. However, if the velocity of slab rollback and trench retreat exceeds that of the overriding plate, then back-arc extension will occur. The Pliocene-Pleistocene changes in Tyrrhenian back-arc extension may have also been influenced by the adjacent Adriatic and Sicilian forelands. These sectors were not thinned by rifting and are characterized by normal continental lithosphere. During its southeastward migration, the passively retreating oceanic slab had to adjust and deform in relation the large and buoyant continental sectors. Post-Pliocene migration was eventually driven through the narrow corridor (250 km) represented by the present Ionian Sea and thus separated the Adriatic and Sicilian sectors. Changes in lithospheric composition may have also contributed to differences in subduction geometry. For instance, during the first episode of subduction, thinned continental lithosphere underlying the Apenninic margin subducted beneath the Eurasian plate. However, in the second episode of subduction, it was instead Ionian oceanic lithosphere that was involved in subduction. A transition from continental to oceanic lithosphere subduction could explain the late onset of arc volcanism (2-1.5 Ma) as well as the lack of arc volcanism in the central Tyrrhenian basin. = Rates of extension and subsidence = The full spreading rate of the Tyrrhenian basin has been estimated to be 3–5 cm/yr based on kinematic reconstructions and magnetostratigraphy. This is a relatively slow spreading rate when compared to spreading rates in other back-arc basins like the East Scotia basin (5–7 cm/yr) and the Manus basin (13 cm/yr). The ratio between the initial crustal thickness and final crustal thickness, also known as the beta factor, is estimated to be 3.3 for the Tyrrhenian basin.  Petroleum resources  Although there are numerous petroleum plays in mainland Italy and the northern Ionian Sea, the potential for hydrocarbon accumulation in most of the Tyrrhenian basin is very poor. This is primarily due to the basin's high geothermal gradient which pushes the oil window to very shallow depths where structural and stratigraphic traps are uncommon. There is, however, active hydrocarbon exploration on the south edge of the basin near the Sicily Channel. Here, the small Narciso and Nilde fields produce sulphur- rich, light to medium-grade crude oil (API gravity ranging between 21 and 39). The primary reservoirs in these fields are Miocene karstic limestones that are sealed by Pliocene clays. The source of the hydrocarbons is unknown but is inferred to be Mesozoic limestone. Traps are structural in nature and are primarily thrust faults related to the Tunisian Atlas thrust belt. References .

Copper crown is of thin copper strip decorated with precious Carnelian and a Fiancé bead, typical of remains found at other Harappan sites. According to archeologist, the crown indicates that skeleton was probably of important person like chieftain or village head. Terracotta pottery, crudely crafted & not of fine quality, has also been found near the skeleton. A burial area is also exposed containing 21 pots of difference size & shape has also been found. Human bones & parts of skeletons were also found at the burial site.

Early life and career Warwick was born in Philadelphia in 1852 to Edward Warwick, a merchant, and his wife, Anne Minshall Warwick. His father was a native of Philadelphia, while his mother was an immigrant from the United Kingdom. Warwick was educated at the Zane Street Grammar School in Philadelphia, and was admitted to Central High School, although he did not attend. Instead, Warwick took a job as a bookkeeper to help support his family. While doing so, he studied the law, working as an apprentice in the office of E. Spencer Miller, a local lawyer. He later attended classes at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Admitted to the bar in 1873, Warwick soon found a position in the city solicitor's office. That same year, he married Ella Kate Griesemer. The two would have six children: two girls and four boys. He was interested in politics from an early age, and gave speeches on behalf of John F. Hartranft in his campaign for governor of Pennsylvania in 1876. After the election, Warwick opened his own law office and practiced for several years until George Scott Graham, newly elected District Attorney of Philadelphia, hired him in 1880. During James G. Blaine's campaign for the Presidency in 1884, Warwick gave speeches in his favor in Indiana and Ohio. That same year, Warwick was elected City Solicitor by a 14,000-vote margin, running ahead of the ticket. Three years later, he was reelected by a 48,000-vote majority. As City Solicitor, much of his work involved suits about the railroads, including the construction of elevated railways and disputes over street paving where rails ran on the public roads. Mayor In 1895, Philadelphia Republicans nominated Warwick for mayor. He was the candidate of the reform faction of the party, defeating machine boss Boies Penrose. Although one modern author described him as a \\"colorless but competent regular,\\" Warwick was popular with his contemporaries. As mayor, he oversaw the visit of Li Hongzhang, the Chinese politician and general, to the city in 1896. He was supportive of the Reading Railroad's construction of the City Branch along Pennsylvania Avenue and encouraged development of the Delaware River waterfront area. He also campaigned, unsuccessfully, for the state capital to be relocated to Philadelphia from Harrisburg. Author Mayors in Philadelphia were limited to one four-year term, so in 1899, Warwick left office. Besides continuing his law practice, he also wrote several books of historical scholarship, including Mirabeau and the French Revolution (1908), Danton and the French Revolution (1909), and Napoleon and the end of the French revolution (1910). A few years later, in 1913, he published a less formal local history, entitled Warwick's Keystone commonwealth; a review of the history of the great state of Pennsylvania, and a brief record of the growth of its chief city, Philadelphia. Warwick died later that year, and was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Design and development Following the Armistice of 1918, Germany continued to build aircraft and engines under the control of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control. For use on very large aircraft, Argus designed and built the As 5 WW-24 water-cooled piston engine. The As 5 consisted of six banks of cylinders arranged around a common crankshaft with a single output shaft. Each cylinder drove the crankshaft through a master and slave big end, similar to most radial engines. The top and bottom sets of three cylinder banks were set at 45° to each other with a 90° separation between the outermost banks. Individual cylinders with sheet metal water jackets shared the aluminium alloy heads, four to a bank. Inlet and exhaust valves were actuated by shaft driven overhead camshafts. The aluminium alloy crankcase was split top and bottom. Although some testing was carried out, the As 5 never flew and was abandoned along with the very large aircraft projects it was intended to power.

It stars Majid Michel, Alexx Ekubo, Mbong Amata, Susan Peters, Tana Adelana, Kokotso Charlotte, and introduces Rosemary Zimu as Champagne. This is Emem Isong's first film as a director. The film tells the story of a young couple (Alex Ekubo and Rosemary Zimu), who are in an \\"open marriage\\"; To meet their financial needs as a family, they often date unsuspecting people, scam them, and run away. They eventually meet Mr Douglas (Majid Michel), who takes them on an unexpected ride.

There's really nothing more to it\\". The film was shot in Johannesburg, South Africa and Houston, Texas in the United States. Shooting in South Africa in particular, posed a challenge, as the Isong had never really worked in the country before now. Champagne is Emem Isong's first film as a director; in an interview, she stated that she wanted to celebrate her 20 years anniversary in the film industry with Champagne. Release The theatrical trailer of Champagne was released on 19 November 2014. The film premiered in Lagos on 19 December 2014, and started showing at the cinemas on the same day. It premiered in the United Kingdom in March 2015. Critical reception The film so far has received negative critical reviews, Rosemary Zimu's performance has however been commended by most critics. Nollywood Reinvented rated the film 46%, concluding: \\"Alexx Ekubo and Rosemary Zimu played off each other’s strength and were able to hold the movie together in their scenes. Alexx is constantly improving as an actor and Rosemary does pretty well for a new actress even though they both could have definitely explored deeper into the emotions\\". Oris Aigbokhaevbolo of True Nollywood Stories gave a negative review, commenting: \\"An exploration of that tension between marital duties and financial necessities could take up the duration of a movie, but not with this attention-deficit fare. An unconvincing thriller in romance, near-comic clothing, and it seems no one told the actors. Save for South African newcomer Rosemary Zimu, the actors look unprepared for the film’s turning point moment. Emem Isong’s Champagne Fails To Pop\\". Samod Biobaku panned the film and performances from the actors (except for Zimu's performance), commenting: \\"In this movie, Emem [Isong] clearly struggles with creative consistency. From the lighting to the shallow dialogues and this rolls into a plot, so loose, it eventually becomes painfully disjointed. Midway into the movie, the feeling that you could walk out of the cinema hall and ask a friend to tell you what happened afterwards proved a realistic option. The story grips the highway of a saccharine-littered storyline that falls, stumbles, trips, takes flight, trips again, breaks down and somehow, manages to hurl its bulky frame across the finish-line where conflicts are ultimately resolved\\".

Public-key cryptography relies on construction of mathematical problems that are believed to be hard to solve if no further information is available, but are easy to solve if some information used in the problem construction is known. Some problems of this sort that are currently used in cryptography are at risk of attack if sufficiently large quantum computers can ever be built, so resistant problems are sought. Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertext, such as numerical values stored in an encrypted database. RLWE is more properly called Learning with Errors over Rings and is simply the larger learning with errors (LWE) problem specialized to polynomial rings over finite fields. Because of the presumed difficulty of solving the RLWE problem even on a quantum computer, RLWE based cryptography may form the fundamental base for public-key cryptography in the future just as the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problem have served as the base for public key cryptography since the early 1980s. An important feature of basing cryptography on the ring learning with errors problem is the fact that the solution to the RLWE problem can be used to solve the NP-hard shortest vector problem (SVP) in a lattice (a polynomial-time reduction from the SVP problem to the RLWE problem has been presented).  Background  The security of modern cryptography, in particular public-key cryptography, is based on the assumed intractability of solving certain computational problems if the size of the problem is large enough and the instance of the problem to be solved is chosen randomly. The classic example that has been used since the 1970s is the integer factorization problem. It is believed that it is computationally intractable to factor the product of two prime numbers if those prime numbers are large enough and chosen at random. As of 2015 research has led to the factorization of the product of two 384-bit primes but not the product of two 512-bit primes. Integer factorization forms the basis of the widely used RSA cryptographic algorithm. The ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem is built on the arithmetic of polynomials with coefficients from a finite field. A typical polynomial a(x) is expressed as: :a(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\\\ldots + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} Polynomials can be added and multiplied in the usual fashion. In the RLWE context the coefficients of the polynomials and all operations involving those coefficients will be done in a finite field, typically the field \\\\mathbf{Z}/q\\\\mathbf{Z} = \\\\mathbf{F}_q for a prime integer q. The set of polynomials over a finite field with the operations of addition and multiplication forms an infinite polynomial ring (\\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]). The RLWE context works with a finite quotient ring of this infinite ring. The quotient ring is typically the finite quotient (factor) ring formed by reducing all of the polynomials in \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x] modulo an irreducible polynomial \\\\Phi(x). This finite quotient ring can be written as \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x) though many authors write \\\\mathbf{Z}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x) . If the degree of the polynomial \\\\Phi(x) is n, the sub-ring becomes the ring of polynomials of degree less than n modulo \\\\Phi(x) with coefficients from F_q. The values n, q, together with the polynomial \\\\Phi(x) partially define the mathematical context for the RLWE problem. Another concept necessary for the RLWE problem is the idea of \\"small\\" polynomials with respect to some norm. The typical norm used in the RLWE problem is known as the infinity norm (also called the uniform norm). The infinity norm of a polynomial is simply the largest coefficient of the polynomial when these coefficients are viewed as integers. Hence, a(x)_\\\\infty = b states that the infinity norm of the polynomial a(x) is b. Thus b is the largest coefficient of a(x). The final concept necessary to understand the RLWE problem is the generation of random polynomials in \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x) and the generation of \\"small\\" polynomials . A random polynomial is easily generated by simply randomly sampling the n coefficients of the polynomial from \\\\mathbf{F}_q, where \\\\mathbf{F}_q is typically represented as the set \\\\\\\\{-(q-1)/2, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., (q-1)/2\\\\\\\\}. Randomly generating a \\"small\\" polynomial is done by generating the coefficients of the polynomial from \\\\mathbf{F}_q in a way that either guarantees or makes very likely small coefficients. There are two common ways to do this: # Using Uniform Sampling – The coefficients of the small polynomial are uniformly sampled from a set of small coefficients. Let b be an integer that is much less than q. If we randomly choose coefficients from the set: \\\\\\\\{ -b, -b+1, -b+2, \\\\ldots , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots , b-2, b-1, b \\\\\\\\} the polynomial will be small with respect to the bound (b). # Using discrete Gaussian sampling – For an odd value for q, the coefficients of the polynomial are randomly chosen by sampling from the set \\\\\\\\{ -(q-1)/2, \\\\ldots , (q-1)/2 \\\\\\\\} according to a discrete Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and distribution parameter \\\\sigma. The references describe in full detail how this can be accomplished. It is more complicated than uniform sampling but it allows for a proof of security of the algorithm. The paper \\"Sampling from Discrete Gaussians for Lattice-Based Cryptography on a Constrained Device\\" by Dwarakanath and Galbraith provide an overview of this problem.  The RLWE Problem  The RLWE problem can be stated in two different ways: a \\"search\\" version and a \\"decision\\" version. Both begin with the same construction. Let * a_i(x) be a set of random but known polynomials from \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x) with coefficients from all of \\\\mathbf{F}_q. * e_i(x) be a set of small random and unknown polynomials relative to a bound b in the ring \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x). * s(x) be a small unknown polynomial relative to a bound b in the ring \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x). * b_i(x) = (a_i(x)\\\\cdot s(x)) + e_i(x). The Search version entails finding the unknown polynomial s(x) given the list of polynomial pairs ( a_i(x), b_i(x) ). The Decision version of the problem can be stated as follows. Given a list of polynomial pairs ( a_i(x), b_i(x) ), determine whether the b_i(x) polynomials were constructed as b_i(x) = (a_i(x)\\\\cdot s(x)) + e_i(x) or were generated randomly from \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x) with coefficients from all of \\\\mathbf{F}_q. The difficulty of this problem is parameterized by the choice of the quotient polynomial (\\\\Phi(x)), its degree (n), the field (\\\\mathbf{F}_q), and the smallness bound (b). In many RLWE based public key algorithms the private key will be a pair of small polynomials s(x) and e(x). The corresponding public key will be a pair of polynomials a(x), selected randomly from \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x), and the polynomial t(x)= (a(x)\\\\cdot s(x)) + e(x). Given a(x) and t(x), it should be computationally infeasible to recover the polynomial s(x).  Security Reduction  In cases where the polynomial \\\\Phi(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial, the difficulty of solving the search version of RLWE problem is equivalent to finding a short vector (but not necessarily the shortest vector) in an ideal lattice formed from elements of \\\\mathbf{Z}[x]/\\\\Phi(x) represented as integer vectors. This problem is commonly known as the Approximate Shortest Vector Problem (α-SVP) and it is the problem of finding a vector shorter than α times the shortest vector. The authors of the proof for this equivalence write: :\\"... we give a quantum reduction from approximate SVP (in the worst case) on ideal lattices in \\\\mathbf{R} to the search version of ring-LWE, where the goal is to recover the secret s \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}_q (with high probability, for any s) from arbitrarily many noisy products.\\" In that quote, The ring \\\\mathbf{R} is \\\\mathbf{Z}[x]/\\\\Phi(x) and the ring \\\\mathbf{R}_q is \\\\mathbf{F}_q[x]/\\\\Phi(x). The α-SVP in regular lattices is known to be NP-hard due to work by Daniele Micciancio in 2001, although not for values of α required for a reduction to general learning with errors problem. However, there is not yet a proof to show that the difficulty of the α-SVP for ideal lattices is equivalent to the average α-SVP. Rather we have a proof that if there are any α-SVP instances that are hard to solve in ideal lattices then the RLWE Problem will be hard in random instances. Regarding the difficulty of Shortest Vector Problems in Ideal Lattices, researcher Michael Schneider writes, \\"So far there is no SVP algorithm making use of the special structure of ideal lattices. It is widely believed that solving SVP (and all other lattice problems) in ideal lattices is as hard as in regular lattices.\\" The difficulty of these problems on regular lattices is provably NP-hard. There are, however, a minority of researchers who do not believe that ideal lattices share the same security properties as regular lattices. Peikert believes that these security equivalences make the RLWE problem a good basis for future cryptography. He writes: \\"There is a mathematical proof that the only way to break the cryptosystem (within some formal attack model) on its random instances is by being able to solve the underlying lattice problem in the worst case\\" (emphasis in the original).  RLWE Cryptography  A major advantage that RLWE based cryptography has over the original learning with errors (LWE) based cryptography is found in the size of the public and private keys. RLWE keys are roughly the square root of keys in LWE. For 128 bits of security an RLWE cryptographic algorithm would use public keys around 7000 bits in length. The corresponding LWE scheme would require public keys of 49 million bits for the same level of security. On the other hand, RLWE keys are larger than the keys sizes for currently used public key algorithms like RSA and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman which require public key sizes of 3072 bits and 256 bits, respectively, to achieve a 128-bit level of security. From a computational standpoint, however, RLWE algorithms have been shown to be the equal of or better than existing public key systems. Three groups of RLWE cryptographic algorithms exist: = Ring learning with errors key exchanges (RLWE-KEX) = The fundamental idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding. The basic idea comes from the associativity of matrix multiplications, and the errors are used to provide the security. The paper appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012. In 2014, Peikert presented a key transport scheme following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending additional 1 bit signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also utilized. An RLWE version of the classic MQV variant of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange was later published by Zhang et al. The security of both key exchanges is directly related to the problem of finding approximate short vectors in an ideal lattice. = Ring learning with errors signature (RLWE- SIG) = A RLWE version of the classic Feige–Fiat–Shamir Identification protocol was created and converted to a digital signature in 2011 by Lyubashevsky. The details of this signature were extended in 2012 by Gunesyu, Lyubashevsky, and Popplemann in 2012 and published in their paper \\"Practical Lattice Based Cryptography – A Signature Scheme for Embedded Systems.\\" These papers laid the groundwork for a variety of recent signature algorithms some based directly on the ring learning with errors problem and some which are not tied to the same hard RLWE problems. = Ring learning with errors homomorphic encryption (RLWE-HOM) = The purpose of homomorphic encryption is to allow the computations on sensitive data to occur on computing devices that should not be trusted with the data. These computing devices are allowed to process the ciphertext which is output from a homomorphic encryption. In 2011, Brakersky and Vaikuntanathan, published \\"Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key Dependent Messages\\" which builds a homomorphic encryption scheme directly on the RLWE problem.

Career Stearns's career began at the age of 2 and a half as an actress and singer at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California. She also appeared in several films before going to Broadway. In 1947, Stearns, who looked young for her age, was offered a job as a fashion model for an early home shopping television program. On the advice of her newlywed husband Johnny, who thought the idea to be weak, she refused; Johnny suggested to the broadcaster that she instead host a domestic sitcom with him. On November 18, the DuMont Television Network debuted a new show starring the two entitled Mary Kay and Johnny. The series had the Stearnses playing fictional versions of themselves. On the show the pair portrayed a newlywed couple, also named Mary Kay and Johnny Stearns, who were trying to make it in New York. Most of the episodes took place in an apartment complex in Greenwich Village, New York. Mary Kay's counterpart was an everyday, run-of-the-mill, zany housewife and Johnny's counterpart was a bank employee. The series moved from DuMont to NBC in 1948 then to CBS then back to NBC where it finished its run in March 1950. Mary Kay and Johnny also achieved some firsts during its run. The series was the first sitcom to air on television, contrary to popular belief that I Love Lucy which premiered four years later was the first. It was also the first television series to feature a pregnancy, (the Stearnses' real life son Christopher), whose birth and character were written in the show in December 1948. It was also the first to feature a couple sharing a bed. After the show ended, the Stearnses moved to California where Johnny pursued a career in production. Stearns did another weekly television series by herself entitled Mary Kay's Nightcap which aired on NBC during the 1951-52 television season. She also had guest star appearances on Armstrong Circle Theatre and Kraft Television Theatre. She and her husband also had a seven-year stint as the spokespeople for U.S. Steel. She later stated that she never was particularly fond of television and largely did those shows as a means to earn a paycheck while she tried to make it big on Broadway. Personal life Stearns was married to actor and producer Johnny Stearns. They married in 1946 and she was widowed on December 16, 2001 when Johnny died at the age of 85. They had three children together; Christopher, Jonathan and Melinda. Stearns also has one grandson.

Consumption of caffeine has long been linked to anxiety. The effects of caffeine and the symptoms of anxiety both increase activity within the sympathetic nervous system. Caffeine has been linked to the aggravation and maintenance of anxiety disorders, and the initiation of panic or anxiety attacks in those who are already predisposed to such phenomena. Caffeine usage surpassing 200 mg has been shown to increase the likelihood for anxiety and panic attacks in a population. Excessive amounts of caffeine can result in symptoms from general anxiety to obsessive-compulsive and phobic symptoms. DSM-5 classification =Diagnostic criteria= Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of the DSM-5 diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-5, is the current authority for psychiatric diagnosis in the United States. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder falls under the category of anxiety disorders in the DSM-5, and not the category of substance-related and addictive disorders, even though the symptoms are due to the effects of a substance. Diagnosis according to the DSM-5 is dependent on various criteria. Patients must present symptoms of either panic attacks or anxiety. There must also be evidence that the panic or anxiety symptoms are a direct result of the use of the intoxicating substance. In caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, such symptoms would be due to the consumption of caffeine. The DSM-5 makes the distinction that the substance must be physiologically capable of leading to the anxiety and panic symptoms. This establishes the relationship between the abused chemical agent and the observed clinical effects. Caffeine has been proven to act as an antagonist on adenosine receptors, which acts as a stimulant and therefore fulfills this criteria. Symptoms must also not have a more likely clinical cause, such as another type of anxiety disorder, come before the ingestion of the intoxicating substance, or last for an extended amount of time after stopping the use of the substance. Diagnosis also requires that the panic attacks or anxiety due to the use of the intoxicating substance cause a certain amount of disturbance in the patient or lead to deficiency of varying types of daily performance. =Diagnostic features= In addition to the criteria above, it is important to recognize that the diagnostic criteria for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are not met if the symptoms of panic come before the intoxication by the substance. In caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, a diagnosis will not be made if symptoms of anxiety or panic precede the ingestion of caffeine. Also, if symptoms persist for more than one month after substance intoxication, the diagnosis cannot be made. Persistence and continuation of symptoms beyond the initial consumption of caffeine suggest an alternate diagnosis that would better explain the long- lasting symptoms. Anxiety symptoms caused by caffeine are often mistaken for serious mental disorders including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, leaving patients medicated for the wrong issue. A caffeine-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made, rather than a substance abuse or intoxication diagnosis, when symptoms of panic attacks or anxiety predominate. =Prevalence= Although exact rates of prevalence are not available, general population data shows a 0.002% prevalence over a year-long period and higher prevalence within clinical populations. Caffeine Caffeine structure Caffeine is a methylxanthine, and is hydrophobic. The structure of caffeine allows the molecule to pass freely through biological membranes including the blood-brain barrier. Absorption in the gastrointestinal tract reaches near completion at about 99% after only 45 minutes. Half-life of caffeine for most adults is between 2.5 and 4.5 hours when consumption is limited to less than 10 mg/kg. However, during neonatal development, half-life for the fetus is significantly longer and decreases exponentially after birth to reach a normal rate at about 6 months. Cytochrome P-450, a hemeprotein, acts in liver microsomes to metabolize caffeine into dimethylxanthines, monomethylxanthines, dimethyl uric acids, monomethyl uric acids, trimethylallantoin, dimethylallantoin, and derivatives of uracil. Most caffeine is metabolized by 3-methyl demethylation, forming the metabolite of paraxanthine. Many metabolites, in addition to caffeine, act within the body and are partly responsible for the physiological response to caffeine. Mechanism of caffeine action Caffeine acts in multiple ways within the brain and the rest of the body. However, due to the concentration of caffeine required, antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary mode of action. The following mechanisms are ways in which caffeine may act within the body, but depending on necessary caffeine concentration and other factors may not be responsible for the clinical effects of the substance. =Mobilization of intracellular calcium= At very high concentrations of about 1–2 mM, caffeine lowers the excitability threshold in muscle cells, leading to prolonged contraction. The introduction of such high doses of caffeine allows calcium to enter the muscle cell through the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum more readily. Influx of calcium through the membranes in muscle cells requires at least 250 μM of caffeine. Normally, other toxic effects of caffeine begin to occur in concentrations over 200 μM, however average consumption averages lead to concentrations less than 100 μM. This means that calcium influx and mobilization are most likely not the cause of caffeine's effect on the central nervous system, and are therefore not the cause of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder. =Inhibition of phosphodiesterases= Methylxanthines such as caffeine inhibit the action of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which normally acts to break down cAMP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, is a second messenger important in many cellular processes and is a critical factor in signal transduction. The inhibition of the phosphodiesterase would lead to a buildup of cAMP, increasing the activity of the second messenger throughout the cell. Though this mechanism is possible, it only occurs after levels of caffeine have reached a toxic level, and therefore it is unlikely to explain the mechanism of caffeine in the brain. =Antagonism of adenosine receptors= There are four well-known adenosine receptors found in the body, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. The endogenous agonist for these receptors is adenosine, which is a purine nucleoside that is important for processes such as energy transfer in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and signal transduction in the form of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). A2B and A3 receptors require concentrations of caffeine that do not occur at normal physiological levels or with normal levels of caffeine consumption in order to be antagonized, and will therefore not be considered as a possible mechanism for caffeine-induced anxiety. Caffeine acts as an antagonist of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors. Adenosine is a normal neuromodulator that activates adenosine g-protein coupled receptors. The actions of A1 and A2A receptors oppose each other but are both inhibited by caffeine due to its function as an antagonist. A2A receptors are coupled to Gs proteins which activate adenylate cyclase and some voltage gated Ca2+ channels. A2A receptors are located in dopamine rich brain regions. A2A receptor mRNA was found in the same neurons as the dopamine receptor D2 within the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and tuberculum olfactorium. A2A receptors are not found in neurons that express the dopamine receptor D1 receptors and Substance P. Within the striatum, part of the basal ganglia, activation of A2A receptors by adenosine increases GABA release, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When caffeine binds to the receptor, less inhibitory neurotransmitter is released, supporting caffeine's role as a central nervous system stimulant. A1 receptors are paired with the G-proteins of Gi-1, Gi-2, Gi-3, Go1, and Go2. The g-proteins of A1 receptors continue to inhibit adenylate cyclase, some voltage gated Ca2+ channels, and activate some K+ channels, and phospholipase C and D. A1 receptors are primarily located in the hippocampus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and particular thalamic nuclei. Adenosine acts on A1 receptors to decrease opening of N-type Ca2+ channels in some hippocampal neurons, and therefore decrease the rate of firing since Ca2+ is necessary for neurotransmitter release. Caffeine's antagonistic action on the A1 receptor thus decreases the action of adenosine, allowing increased Ca2+ entry through N-type channels and higher rates of neurotransmitter release. =Other actions of caffeine= Though antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary mechanism of caffeine, Introduction of the methylxanthine into the body also increases the rate of release and recycling of some monoamine neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and dopamine. Caffeine also has an excitatory effect on mesocortical cholinergic neurons by acting as an antagonist on adenosine receptors that normally inhibit the neuron. Genetics and variability of caffeine consumption While many factors contribute to individual differences in a person's response to caffeine, such as environmental and demographic factors (i.e. age, drug use, circadian factors, etc.), genetics play an important role in individual variability. This inconsistency in responses to caffeine can take place either at the metabolic or at the drug-receptor level. The effects of genetic factors can occur either directly by changing acute or chronic reactions to the drug or indirectly by altering other psychological or physiological processes. Some of these processes include wakefulness, stimulation, and mood and cognition enhancement. Low doses can result in psychological effects of \\"mild euphoria, alertness, and enhanced cognitive performance\\"; higher doses produce physiological side effects of nausea, anxiety, trembling, and jitteriness. There are individuals who are prone to caffeine's anxiogenic effects whilst others are susceptible to its caffeine-induced sleep disturbances and insomnia. Studies with twins have shown that genetics influence individual differences in response to caffeine. Homozygous twins have been found to react in more consistent ways to the caffeine than heterozygous twins. Behavioral effects Caffeine's widespread appeal is due primarily to its mild psychostimulant properties, which increase alertness and cognitive arousal and diminish fatigue. Caffeine also produces a wide range of other symptoms, including upregulation of the cardiovascular system, increased global cognitive processing, and improved physical functioning. Cardiovascular effects can range from increased heart rate and reactivity to severe cardiac arrhythmia. The cognitive effects of caffeine include increased performance in memory, attention, and text reading. The physical effects of caffeine include lowered sensations of pain, less perceived effort, and increased muscle strength and endurance. However, at doses above ~400 mg, both cognitive and physical performance begins to worsen and symptoms of anxiety increase. These anxiety symptoms include persisting insomnia, nervousness, and mood fluctuations. When undergoing stress, the body activates a system-wide response mechanism known as the HPA axis. This stress signal begins at the level of the hypothalamus in the brain and undergoes subsequent amplifications throughout the body. This system elevates levels of stress hormones in the blood, which results in the body shutting down secondary bodily processes and increasing alertness to better prepare for response to the perceived threat. Studies show that activation of this pathway is correlated with anxiety-like behaviors, including panic, post-traumatic stress, and generalized anxiety disorders, as well as depression. Rodent studies show that caffeine consumption in adolescence results in dysregulation of HPA axis function as well as central nervous system response, which impairs the body's response to stressful stimuli. In cases of prolonged consumption of excess amounts of caffeine, studies show that individuals exhibit a reduced response to HPA axis activation by the hormone ACTH and a generalized increase in basal levels of stress hormone corticosterone. Researchers concluded that the sensitivity of adrenal glands to ACTH is diminished by caffeine consumption. People diagnosed with panic disorder show less HPA activity following stressful stimuli than their healthy control counterparts. Susceptible populations Caffeine has varying effects on anxiety across given populations. The populations most susceptible to caffeine-induced anxiety disorder include those already diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and adolescents. Adolescents, particularly, are at increased risk for developing anxiety disorders and anxiety-related symptoms. While few human studies have been done to investigate this connection, many rodent studies show a correlation between caffeine consumption in adolescence and increased anxiety. These studies showed that in adolescent rodents exposed to caffeine functioning of serotonin systems was affected, leading to increased anxiety; anxiety-related behaviors were higher than in adult rats exposed to the same amount of caffeine; and reward seeking behaviors as well as mood fluctuations were increased as the rodents matured. Long-term health effects To date, there is no evidence to show a connection between caffeine consumption and long-term effects on anxiety. This may be a result of a lack of research investigating this, and not a lack of evidence produced from such studies. However, there is a significant amount of research regarding the long-term health effects of caffeine in general. When consumed in moderation, caffeine can have many beneficial effects. However, over the course of several years, chronic caffeine consumption can produce various long-term health deficits in individuals. Among these, rodent studies have suggested caffeine intake may permanently alter the brain's excitability. As previously stated, long-term effects are most often seen in adolescents who regularly consume excess amounts of caffeine. This can affect their neuroendocrine functions and increase the risk of anxiety-disorder development. Treatment For individuals prescribed anti-anxiety medications such as alprazolam (Xanax), caffeine can introduce further problems by increasing rates of cytotoxicity and cell death by necrosis. This leads to these medications being essentially ruled out as viable treatments for caffeine-induced anxiety. Due to caffeine's negative interaction with anti- anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines, treatments for caffeine-induced anxiety disorder tend to focus on abstinence from or a reduction of caffeine intake and behavioral therapy. Some doctors may recommend a continuance of caffeine consumption but with the provision that the patient actively takes note of physiological changes that happen after caffeine intake. The goal of this approach is to help patients better understand the effects of caffeine on the body and to distinguish threatening symptoms from normal reactions.

Plot A Spanish dancer, in front of an inn in the Spanish mountains, is courted by a smuggler, who asks her to marry him. She agrees. Later, in the dancer's room, another man enters and declares his love for her. The smuggler, entering unnoticed, hears the declaration of love, and a violent argument breaks out between the two rivals for the dancer's affection. The suitors travel to a remote spot in the mountains and fight to the death; the smuggler wins the fight when the other suitor falls over a precipice. Returning to the dancer's room, the smuggler comes to meet his beloved, but the dancer refuses him when she finds out he killed his rival. The smuggler stabs himself in despair.

The bunker complex, designated as Hill 61 and codenamed Hillman by the British, was attacked on 6 June 1944 by the Suffolk Regiment and the fortress finally surrendered the following morning. The delay in taking the bunker complex has been cited as a reason for the Allies not completing their major D-Day objective of taking Caen. The bunkers are now open as a museum and run by local volunteers. Construction In 1942, towards the southern part of Colleville-Sur-Orne (renamed Colleville- Montgomery after the war), the Organisation Todt built a 24-hectare bunker complex consisting of 18 bunkers including two H608 command post bunkers (with armoured observation cupolas) and a H605 bunker for artillery guns. It was designated at Widerstandsnest 17 (resistance nest (strongpoint) WN17) by the Germans and served as headquarters of the 736th Grenadier Regiment. The complex was situated on high ground behind Ouistreham on the Périers Ridge, overlooking what was to become the D-Day landing beach Sword. As Hillman had no artillery it controlled the firing of the artillery at Widerstandsnest 16 (WN16), codenamed Morris by the Allies. The bunker complex was codenamed Hillman (other nearby bunkers were named Morris, Daimler and Humber after various makes of British car) by the British during the Normandy landings in June 1944. Garrison Hillman was the regimental headquarters and command post for the coastal defence in the area and commanded by Colonel Ludwig Krug. The bunkers housed approximately 150 officers and men of 736 Grenadier Regiment (part of the 716th Static Infantry Division). A number of observation bunkers featured armoured cupolas with a thickness of approximately to . The bunkers were well equipped, with mechanical ventilation systems, medical facilities, ammunition and food storage. Between bunkers ran a network of trenches linking the different underground positions, consisting of the headquarters, signal centre, radio room, mess rooms and bathrooms. Every position was connected with each other through a network of telephone lines buried or underground. The entire complex was also surrounded by Tobruk pits (for machine guns), barbed wire and mine fields. Built at above sea level, the complex offered direct views of the landing beaches, as well as the mouth of the Orne river. The field of fire or killing zone extended for approximately . D-Day On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the bunker were assaulted by the 1st Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Goodwin, part of the 8th Infantry Brigade of the British 3rd Infantry Division. The Suffolks had landed on Sword Beach at around 08:30 that morning and began heading inland to clear their objectives. Supporting the Suffolks were tanks from A Squadron, Staffordshire Yeomanry and C Squadron of the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, two batteries from 33rd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery and 76th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers of the 246th Field Company and a machine-gun platoon from 2nd Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. The Hillman bunkers were initially reconnoitred by Captain Geff Ryley, commanding officer of A Company. Ryley passes on information for British artillery, mortar crews and tanks to shell the bunkers. Attacking at approximately 1305, Hillman was initially outflanked to the north, where the Royal Engineers cleared mines and barbed wire using Bangalore torpedoes. Suffolks A Company passed through this clearance, led by Lieutenant Mike Russell. The company advanced into the German trenches but faced heavy machine gun fire (Captain Ryley being killed) and retreated. The well-designed and defended bunkers proved difficult to take and the Suffolks brought Shermans from 13/18 Hussars and a second assault over-ran the site. To silence the bunkers Sherman Fireflies fired on the armoured cupolas but the rounds bounced off. The well-defended bunkers were proving an incredibly difficult task for the infantry, too. The combined armour and infantry succeeded in taking most of the complex by 2015 hours. The last remaining bunker surrendered on the early morning of 7 June by which time the Suffolks had lost two officers and five men killed and 24 wounded. Historians suggest that the strong resistance of Hillman contributed to preventing the 3rd Infantry Division taking Caen as planned by the evening of 6 June.

GCKD involves cystic dilation of Bowman's capsule. It can occur with or without congenital abnormality. Glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) is a renal cystic disease that can be classified in five major groups Sahay, M., & Gowrishankar, S. (2010). Glomerulocystic disease. NDT plus, 3(4), 349–350. doi:10.1093/ndtplus/sfq048 including familial, familial/sporadic heritable, glomerulocystic kidneys as a component of other cystic disease, sporadic, and acquired. The direct mechanism is not well researched but the main symptom is dilated or enlarged Bowman's capsule with glomerular cysts. The cysts are mostly located on the subscapular area of the renal cortex. Symptoms can vary in each case particularly between age groups. CT and MRI tests are recommended to differentiate and diagnose GCKD. Recovery includes medication to manage hypertensivity, diabetes, and surgery if necessary. Further research must be done to find the direct cause and best treatment plans. There are no alternate names for this disease but it is often misdiagnosed as other related kidney diseases.  Signs and symptoms  * Dilation of Bowman's space in the plane section of two to three fold of normal Bissler, J. J., Siroky, B. J., & Yin, H. (2010). Glomerulocystic kidney disease. Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany), 25(10), 2049–2059. doi:10.1007/s00467-009-1416-2 * Kidneys can be described as hypoplastic: meaning kidney have some abnormalities * Size of kidneys can be normal or greatly enlarged depending on the individual case * Transcriptional reprogramming Sung MH. (2013) Transcriptional Reprogramming. In: Dubitzky W., Wolkenhauer O., Cho KH., Yokota H. (eds) Encyclopedia of Systems Biology. Springer, New York, NY: the expression of some genes is elevated and other genes are repressed during transcription * Changes in cilia length * Cysts in kidneys can be diffuse or clustered and uneven in development Rosanna Gusmano, Gianluca Caridi, Monica Marini, Francesco Perfumo, Gian Marco Ghiggeri, Giorgio Piaggio, Isabella Ceccherini, Marco Seri, Glomerulocystic kidney disease in a family, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Volume 17, Issue 5, May 2002, Pages 813–818, https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/17.5.813 * Blood vessels can show fibrointimal hyperplasia and luminal narrowing :meaning a layer of the blood vessel called tunica intima may thicken and the blood vessels will have a smaller opening * Glomerular tufts collapsed or reduced :can also be described as the network of capillaries in the glomerulus that are the beginning of blood filtration * Tubular obstruction possible There is variation in signs and symptoms depending on the age of onset for GCKD: * Cases in neonates or newborn children can present with hypertension, abdominal masses, early onset diabetes, and variable degrees of renal failure also known as kidney failure * Cases in adults can present with flank pain or upper abdomen discomfort, hematuria, and hypertension/high blood pressure  Cause  Glomerulocystic kidney disease can be inherited by autosomal dominant inheritance, develop due to urinary tract obstruction, manifest in cell proliferation during organogenesis Bissler, J.J., Siroky, B.J. & Yin, H. Pediatr Nephrol (2010) 25: 2049. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-009-1416-2 , and develop through other related kidney diseases. Familial heritable GCKD can be inherited by offspring through adults which can cause GCKD in children or babies. Medical associations related to main cause: GCKD can be associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. It can also be found in a number of patients with the following: * Tuberous sclerosis complex * medullary cystic kidney disease * Jeune syndrome * Nephronophthisis * Meckel–Gruber syndrome * Orofaciodigital syndrome * Zellweger syndrome In addition, GCKD can be a component of renal dysplasia after fetal renal damage such as drug use by the mother.  Mechanism/Pathophysiology  The mechanism of cyst formation in Glomerulocystic kidney disease is not well understood. There is speculated to be a connection to HNF-1ß in familial GCKD which is critical in the development of the kidney, pancreas, and liver. Mutations in the HNF-1ß gene are a cause of renal cystic kidney disease and early onset diabetes However, in nonfamilial GCKD, HNF-1ß may not have a role. There are a variable amount of glomeruli with dilated Bowman's capsules within patients with GCKD. Tufts of the glomerulus attached to the walls of the capillaries have the possibility to be collapsed or shrunk. The epithelia in the wall of the capsule are also flattened. The enlargement of the kidney can be related to the degree of cyst formation. The cysts which come from the Bowmans space can also cause the kidneys to appear asymmetrical or misshapen. Cysts can cause injury by destroying nearby renal tissue Srivastava, R. N., & Bagga, A. (2016). Pediatric nephrology. New Delhi: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) LTD. Familial GCKD can have enlarged or normal size kidneys. Early onset seen in infants can be accompanied with severe renal insufficiency while in adulthood the renal damage can be less severe.  Diagnosis  There must be a differential diagnosis done for GCKD because it can appear so similar to other kidney disease. To differentiate it from autosomal recessive polycystic disease it is found there is abnormal medullary pyramids in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease but not GCKD. Imaging of small renal cysts with sub scapular distribution also help to separate it from other diseases. In ADPKD cysts can be observed in the cortex and medulla, while GCKD they just present in the cortex. Diagnosis for GCKD can be confirmed if 5 percent or more of glomeruli are cystic . CT scans are one way to test but are not able to make distinctions between other diseases. MRI's are recommended because they are able to make definitive diagnosis of GCKD Oliva, M., Hsing, J., Rybicki, F. et al. Abdom Imaging (2003) 28: 889. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-003-0024-z. Ultra sonographs can also be useful. A biopsy may also help differentiate from other cysts because in GCKD there will be tubular and glomerular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Lundquist, A. L. (2019, January 23). \\"Hereditary Renal Cystic Diseases: Glomerulocystic Kidney Disease\\" Family history of various kidney diseases and related medical associations may also be an indicator of GCKD and help with the diagnosis.  Treatment  There are various treatment methods available and they vary case to case. Below are the known treatment methods at this time: * Anti-hypertensive drug: used to treat the high blood pressure * Diabetes management (if applicable): which involves exercising regularly, eating right, and keeping track of ones numbers * Surgery, if necessary because of anatomical abnormality, and to drain cysts * Diet changes to reduce the amount of phosphate, protein, sodium, acid, and sugar intake * Blood pressure medication * Dialysis can help to support the damaged kidney if the case is severe enough * Other treatment methods are unknown at this time  Prognosis  There are no specific studies done on Life Expectancy or statistical information for the prognosis of GCKD. For other kidneys diseases depending on degree the prognosis is generally positive. Life span may be shortened but that has not been proven. Most likely patients with GCKD will be on close watch and have a regimented diet.  Epidemiology  GCKD is rare and there have not been many cases reported. Age of onset can happen anytime although it is more common in infants and young children . For most chronic kidney disease cases, women live longer than men.  Research directions  There is much need for further research in many aspects of GCKD. Specific mechanism and physiology for development of the disease needs more clarity. The developmental genes with roles in GCKD must be clarified. Treatment plans need to be tested and implemented specifically for GCKD. More statistics need to be collected as this emerging disease becomes more well known.

Willow Wilson. In the novel, a Middle Eastern hacker named Alif discovers a book of djinn tales which may lead to a new age of quantum computing. The novel won the 2013 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Plot Summary In an unnamed Middle Eastern security state, the hacker Alif discovers that his love interest Intisar is entering an arranged marriage with another man. He creates a computer program, Tin Sari, to identify Intisar’s digital footprint and block her from seeing him online. Alif’s computer is attacked by The Hand, a prince who seeks to identify and imprison dissidents. The Hand is also Intisar's fiancé. Unable to contact Alif online, Intisar sends him a book. Alif is stalked by secret police, causing him to flee with his neighbor Dina. They seek out a gang leader named Vikram the Vampire for protection. They are rescued by two djinn: Vikram and his sister Azalel, who had been living as Alif and Dina's housecat. Vikram reveals that Intisar’s book, the Alf Yeom, is a collection of djinn tales containing powerful secrets. They meet a convert who specializes in antique books, and they learn that The Hand is seeking the Alf Yeom. Dina, the convert, Alif, and Vikram seek shelter from the police in a mosque. Alif decodes the Alf Yeom and attempts to create a quantum computer. Dina and the convert escape, Vikram is killed, and Alif is captured and interrogated by The Hand. Months later, he is rescued by NewQuarter01, a prince and hacker. Alif learns that his public arrest has become a cause célèbre for anti-regime activists. Alif reunites with Dina and the convert in the djinn city of Irem. Vikram died during the escape, but the convert is pregnant with his child; she uses this status to assure the cooperation of Vikram's allies. In the City, The Hand’s attempt to replicate Alif’s quantum computer has failed, leading to massive Internet outages and riots in the streets. Alif uses Tin Sari to counteract the Hand’s control of the City’s infrastructure and restore Internet Access to the City, further assisting the rioters. As Alif's djinn allies battle The Hand's, The Hand is identified and lynched by rioters. Alif and Dina escape. Reception Alif the Unseen received positive reviews. The New York Times described it as a genre-defying work, with elements of fantasy, dystopian fiction, techno-thriller, and Islamic mysticism. The Times called the novel \\"a resounding, heterodox alternative\\" to American fiction which is often safe and provincial. Publishers Weekly praised the juxtaposition of Arab mythology and modern-day computer theory, as well as the novel's exploration of the cultural conflicts between the East and the West. This was echoed by other reviews, which praised the way in which the novel combined the threads of technology and religion. Others praised the novel's handling of relevant societal concerns, as well as Wilson's storytelling and characterization. Salon praised its scope, comparing it positively to the works of Philip Pullman and Neil Gaiman. Some reviews gave the novel more mixed reviews. The Los Angeles Times found the novel's focus on storytelling and multiple layers of meaning to be compelling, but criticized the novel's romantic elements as \\"melodramatic and contrived\\". Kirkus Reviews praised Wilson's ambition but believed the novel to be slow- paced and bloated.  Awards  The novel won the 2013 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. It was nominated for the 2013 Locus Award for Best First Novel, as well as for the Hammett Prize (2012), the John W. Campbell Memorial Award (2013), Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire for Best Foreign Novel (2014), Women's Prize for Fiction (Longlist, 2013), the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize (2012), and the Goodreads Choice Award for Fantasy (2012).

The band put out 2 full-length albums on the Minneapolis label Amphetamine Reptile before recording their last LP for Vern Rumsey of Unwound's label, Punk In My Vitamins. Tours with Sebadoh, Karp, Unwound, Hovercraft, Caustic Resin, The Lies, Faith No More, and Chokebore helped gain them a national as well as international following. History The band first formed in 1993 in Palm Desert, California by guitarist and vocalist Imaad Wasif and drummer Brian Girgus. Initially, Girgus played bass, however he switched to the drums when the group faced difficulty finding a drummer. The band issued their debut 7-inch single titled Two Songs in early 1994 through Punk In My Vitamins?, an independent label operated by Vern Rumsey, the bassist of Unwound. The duo followed this up with a second 7-inch single, Brass Tracks, which was issued in 1995 through X-Mas Records. That same year, the band was signed onto Amphetamine Reptile Records, who issued their debut full-length All Destructive Urges... Seem So Perfect on November 11, 1996. That same year, the band moved out to San Francisco, where they would stay until their disbandment in 2000. After moving to San Francisco, the band began production for their next album, Kill the Lights. For this album, the duo recruited bassist Justin Halterlein. The album's production was rocky, for the trio did not get along well and tension began to build. Halterlein would leave the band soon after the release of the album on July 8, 1997. After the release of Kill the Lights, the group left Amphetamine Reptile amicably. For their next album, the duo recruited bassist Tiber Scheer, who previously performed in the band P.E.E. The group then released The Going Away Present through Punk In My Vitamins? on May 4, 1999 before their break-up in 2000. The founding members of the band went on to various solo projects as well as playing in The Folk Implosion, Track Star, The Yeah, Yeah, Yeah's, Wooden Shjips, and others. Wasif and Girgus currently reside in Los Angeles, while Scheer relocated to Chicago.

Kutai basin outlined in blue The Kutai sedimentary basin extends from the central highlands of Borneo, across the eastern coast of the island and into the Makassar Strait. With an area of 60,000 km2, and depths up to 15 km, the Kutai is the largest and deepest Tertiary age basin in Indonesia. Plate tectonic evolution in the Indonesian region of SE Asia has produced a diverse array of basins in the Cenozoic. The Kutai is an extensional basin in a general foreland setting. Its geologic evolution begins in the mid Eocene and involves phases of extension and rifting, thermal sag, and isostatic subsidence. Rapid, high volume, sedimentation related to uplift and inversion began in the Early Miocene. The different stages of Kutai basin evolution can be roughly correlated to regional and local tectonic events. It is also likely that regional climate, namely the onset of the equatorial ever wet monsoon in early Miocene, has affected the geologic evolution of Borneo and the Kutai basin through the present day. Basin fill is ongoing in the lower Kutai basin, as the modern Mahakam River delta progrades east across the continental shelf of Borneo. Plate tectonic setting Tectonic plates boundaries detailed-en Sunda Plate map-fr The Cenozoic plate tectonics of the Indonesian region have generated a complex assemblage of micro-continental blocks and marginal ocean basins surrounded by extensional margins, subduction zones and major transcurrent faults. The island of Borneo and the Kutai basin are located on the Sunda micro-plate, which is bounded to the north and west by the Eurasian plate, to the south by the Indo-Australian plate and to the west by the Philippine and Pacific oceanic plates. In the Cenozoic, the Indo-Australian plate has been moving north and subducting under Eurasia. The collision of the Indian continent with Eurasia halted subduction and uplifted the Himalayas. In between the continents of India and Australia, the oceanic crust is still subducting under the Sunda plate, forming the Sunda trench and Sunda Arc. Australia and Australian derived micro-plates collided with the Sunda plate and Pacific plate in the Pliocene, creating a complex of subduction zones and island arcs. The Philippine plate has been obliquely subducting the Sunda plate for most of the Cenozoic. The complex interaction of the Sunda, Eurasian, Indo-Australian, Philippine and Pacific plates in the Cenozoic has controlled the evolution of approximately 60 Tertiary sedimentary basins in the Indonesian region. Many of these basins, including the Kutai, have formed in a back arc extensional setting, driven by passive or active subduction rollback. The mid Miocene episode of inversion in the Kutai can be linked to collision of continental fragments from the South China Sea with NW Borneo. The Pliocene inversion episode is contemporaneous with the collision of Australia with the Banda arc, with structural connections provided by strike- slip fault systems through Sulawesi. Geology of Borneo Simplified geologic map of Kalimantan (Borneo) Island Map of Borneo and surrounding features. Made using GeoMapApp The basement rock of Borneo is a complex mosaic of geologic terrains, commonly interpreted as the product of primarily Mesozoic accretion of micro-continental fragments, island arc material, oceanic crustal material and marginal basin fill onto the Paleozoic core of the Schwaner Mountains in the southwest of the island. The Schwaner Mountain area consists of early-mid Cretaceous granitic batholiths intruded into Silurian to Permian age metamorphic units. NW of the Schwaner Mountains is a small area of older continental basement consisting of Permo-Triassic granite and metamorphic rocks. SE of the Schwaner Mountains, volcanic island arc and ophilitic rocks emplaced in the late Cretaceous comprise the Meratus Mountains. The basement terrain of eastern and northern Borneo is interpreted to be Cretaceous subduction melange, mostly covered by tertiary sediment. The basement of Western Borneo is an accreted melange of upper cretaceous to Paleocene age that formed the central Kalimantan Ranges as the result of SW directed subduction beneath the continental core of Borneo. The Cenozoic evolution of Borneo is predominantly controlled by active regional and local tectonics and climate. In the Paleocene, Borneo was a promontory of SE Asia, partially separated by oceanic crust of the proto-South China Sea. There is geologic evidence that suggests Borneo has rotated counter clock wise about 45° from its orentation at the end of the Oligocene while remaining to straddle the equator. This would indicate most of the Paleogene sediment in North Borneo was sourced from Indochina. In the Mid Eocene formation of the Celebs Sea and Makassar Strait rifted the eastern margin of Borneo while subduction of oceanic crust occurred on the western margin, producing deep basins on both sides. In the late Oligocene to Early Miocene, the central mountain ranges of Borneo began to rise. The equatorial perhumid climate provided intense chemical weathering and erosion of the newly uplifted rock and filled the marginal basins of Borneo with sediment. Neogene sediments are up to 9 km thick in sections of some basins. Reconstruction of the sediment volume indicates that at least 6 km of crust was removed from the interior of Borneo in the Neogene. A period of punctuated compressional events beginning in the mid Miocene affected the continued evolution of these basins, deforming and inverting them. Igneous activity continued throughout the Cenozoic but was particularly more active in the northern region of Borneo in the Neogene. Basin margins The Kutai basin traverses the eastern slope of the island of Borneo down from the central highlands, across the modern coastline to the basin floor of the Makassar Straits. It is bound to the North by the Mangkalihat High and the Central Kalimantan Ranges, to the south by the Paternoster Platform, Adang fault zone and the Schwaner and Meratus mountains. The Muller mountains form the western basin margin. In its present configuration, the basin can be divided into two parts. The western, or upper Kutai which has been inverted 1500-300' above sea level, and the eastern, or lower Kutai which is still receiving sediment. Basin formation and evolution Basin formation was initiated in the middle Eocene as extension related to the opening of the Makassar straits and Celebes Sea rifted the crust of Eastern Borneo. This rifting created a broad system of half grabens that reverse polarity along NNE-SSW and N-S trending normal faults. Thermal subsidence in the late Eocene and early Oligocene induced minor reactivation along the existing faults. During the late Oligocene there was a brief renewal of extension and rifting along the northern margin of the basin, while the other basin margins experienced uplift. Inversion of the basin began in the Late Oligocene. Tectonic uplift of Borneo in the earliest Miocene inverted the Upper Kutai basin above sea level. Inversion continued in a punctuated fashion through the Miocene and Pliocene. A compressional regime is implied for the later inversion events with stresses transmitted from regional plate collisions. The high angle normal faults were reactivated as thrust faults, inverting the half-grabens. The locus of inversion shifted east with each event. Basin fill Sedimentation in the Kutai basin has been relatively constant throughout the Tertiary. Syn-rift deposition in the Eocene was focused in small, local depocenters within individual half-grabens. Lithology of the initial graben fill is highly variable due to the wide zone of rifting, and ranges from fully terrestrial in the western basin, to fully marine in the eastern basin. A typical initial graben fill in the Kutai basin is composed of coarse and poorly sorted basement derived material. Syn-rift sedimentation following the initial graben fill is variable across the basin, but several distinct facies tracts have been identified. Non marine, deltaic, shallow marine, deep marine and carbonate platform syn-rift deposits are found in the basin. Sag phase deposition begins in the upper Eocene to Oligocene. A more regional depocenter developed in response to marine inundation. The eastern basin, already influenced by marine conditions quickly transitioned to a deep marine depositional environment, while the western basin transitioned more slowly. A thick marine shale was deposited across much of the basin, while carbonate sedimentation continued on isolated high areas and basin margins. The sag phase marine shale has been observed to lie directly upon basement, and is a regional \\"blanket\\" over the syn-rift lithologies. Large carbonate platforms developed along the basin margins as the result of shallowing marine environments in the early phases of the Late Oligocene tectonic uplift event and a marine regression. As tectonic uplift of central Borneo continued into the lower Miocene, the westernmost portion of the Kutai Basin was inverted above sea level, forming the Upper Kutai Basin. There was a significant change in the character of sedimentation in the Kutai Basin in the Early Miocene. Large amounts of clastic sediment derived from the rising central mountains, and the now inverted Paleogene poured into the lower Kutai Basin. The proto- Mahakam river began to prograde eastward. Subsequent tectonic inversion events in the middle Miocene and Pliocene continued to shift the deltaic depocenter of the Mahakam river eastward into the Makassar Strait. Compression in the middle Miocene produced a coast parallel anticlinorum into which the Mahakam river incised as the folds were inverted. This incision has prevented any lateral migration of the lowermost Mahakam river, creating a point source deltaic depocenter that has been active since the mid Miocene. Neogene sediments in the vicinity of the modern Mahakam delta are up to thick. The total depth of the Kutai basin at this location could be up to . DEM of the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Made using GeoMapApp. Structure Geologic Map of the Mahakam Delta showing thrust faulting, folding of Miocene strata, and the incision of the Mahakam River into the fold belt The most prominent geologic structure in the Kutai Basin is the Samarinda anticlinorium—Mahakam foldbelt, a series of NNE-SSW trending folds and faults in Miocene deltaic strata that parallel the modern coast line. The tightly folded, asymmetric, and thrust fault bound anticlines range from 2–5 km wide and 20–50 km long and separated by broad, open synclines. Onshore, the anticline crests are commonly eroded and breached, and the amount of erosion and structural complexity increase toward the west. A detached fold belt in the westernmost region of the anticlinorium transitions to thrust cored folds in the central region and simple symmetric/asymmetric structures in the easternmost offshore region. The tectonic origin of the fold belt has been attributed to a number of geodynamic processes. One explanation for the detachment folding is directly related to basement inversion along the rift stage normal faults, producing folding above a detachment surface in an underlying over-pressured shale. Another is the inversion of delta top grabben systems. These syn-depositional faults form in conjunction with delta toe thrust faults due to differential loading. When contraction occurs while delta progradation is active, re-activation along these faults produces detached, uplifted anticlines Tertiary igneous activity Three suites of intrusive and volcanic rocks are found in the Kutai Basin, and have been used to constrain the Tertiary stratigraphy . The felsic Nyaan volcanics, dated to 48-50 Ma may be related to the extensional tectonics that initiated basin formation. In some locations, the Nyaan volcanics and equivalents are at the base of the Tertiary sedimentary succession, while at other locations bedded tuffs, agglomerates and reworked pyroclastics are part of the late Eocene succession. The Sintang Intrusive suite are mafic to felsic and have a fine crystalline nature which indicates high level emplacement. K-Ar dates of 41-8 Ma have been obtained from rocks assigned to the Sintang suite. Volcanics interpreted to be the sub-aerial products of the Sintang intrusion are found to be interbedded with Late Oligocene to middle Miocene sediments, suggesting that volcanism occurred before and after the early miocene inversion event. The Metulang suite are mid to high-k calc-alkaline basalts and andesites with K-Ar ages between 2.4-1.7 Ma. They form high level intrusions and lava flows.

It was a wood-frame pre-fabricated office building that was brought by ship to San Diego, which was typical of many American buildings in that area at that time. It had a false front and full-length wooden porch. George Alonzo Johnson, a steamboat captain on the Colorado River and owner of the Colorado Steam Navigation Company and of the Rancho Santa Maria de Los Peñasquitos, built the building on a vacant lot on La Plaza de Las Armas, in Old Town, which was purchased from Tomasa Pico de Alvarado, his mother-in-law, in 1869.

Early life and education  Erich Stem was born in Richmond, Virginia, and began composing music at the age of twelve. He studied composition under John Hilliard and Robert Gibson, earning a Bachelor of Music degree from James Madison University in 1996 and a Doctor of Musical Arts from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2003. He participated in the Orchestra Reading Project of the Minnesota Composers Forum (now the American Composers Forum) in 1995 with the Plymouth Music Series Orchestra, engaging in master classes with composer Stephen Paulus. He also participated in the Minnesota Orchestra’s 2002 Composer Institute, headed by Aaron Jay Kernis, with a composition titled Escape. It was subsequently performed by the Richmond Symphony Orchestra as part of their 2003-04 Masterworks Series.  Career  Stem’s works have been performed in the United States, England, Romania, and the Netherlands. His chamber music can be heard on albums by counter)induction, Juventas New Music Ensemble, SOLI Chamber Ensemble, and Cadillac Moon Ensemble. In 2004, he was commissioned by the Aurelia Saxophone Quartet to compose a work for a double CD release, featuring arrangements of Bach’s fugues and fifteen fugues by living composers. The album, C in Fugue of Dog, was nominated for the 2005 Edison Award. Stem accepted a position in 2004 as an assistant professor of music at Indiana University Southeast, where he served as a director and composer for a music label, New Dynamic Records. By 2017, the label had released six works by Stem and music by 62 living composers, including 42 world premiere recordings. New Dynamic Records was featured in publications such as Time Out New York, Music and Vision (now Classical Music Daily]), Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, I Care If You Listen, and The Juilliard Journal. Stem’s music has been described as \\"sophisticated and intriguing\\" (The Washington Post) and as having a \\"fluent and chaotic exchange that breaks minimalism apart\\" (A Closer Listen). It pulls from a variety of sources, including American jazz, Japanese shakuhachi music, and Stem's interest in improvisation. His affinity for the history and towns of the United States led to a project called America By: A Symphonic Tour. With support from Indiana University’s New Frontiers in the Arts and Humanities initiative and a fiscal sponsorship from Aaron Copland House, Stem has written and continues to compose music for various orchestras around the United States. Each piece on the tour is intended to represent the unique attributes and history of one orchestra's hometown. The first orchestra of the project, Bainbridge Symphony Orchestra, commissioned a piece called \\"Bainbridge,\\" which premiered on February 22, 2014. The West Virginia Symphony Orchestra, University of Portland Orchestra, Arlington Philharmonic Orchestra, and the James Madison University Symphony Orchestra have also commissioned and performed Stem's music as part of the tour. Stem is also one of the founding members of A/Tonal, a music performance group.

Survey date: 1854. Publication date: 1856. Services The line was worked by steam although the early intention may have been to work the line as a horse drawn waggonway with independent hauliers. Passenger services had started from 1845 and a road coach ran between Edinburgh to Longridge from 16 May 1846, passengers disembarking travelling on by train to Townhead.

The later station had a single short platform that was accessed off the A706 on the Longridge side and appears to only have had a pedestrian access with no goods yard or sidings.

The overbridge on the line towards Morningside has been removed as has the railway bridge at the later station.

He later commanded HMS Diadem at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797 and served during the Napoleonic Wars on the Transportation Board. Life Towry was born in March 1767, educated at Eton College and joined the Royal Navy at 13 under the patronage of Lord Longford. He served during the American Revolutionary War aboard HMS Alexander and participated in the relief of the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1782. Following the end of the war he continued in service under the Duke of Clarence and at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars he was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet under the patronage of Lord Hood. He was rapidly promoted and by 1794 was a post captain in command of the small 28-gun frigate HMS Dido.Gentleman's Magazine, Captain George Henry Towry Dido was the only ship of the Mediterranean Fleet to exchange fire with French ships during Martin's cruise of 1794, but was unable to prevent the French escaping into Gourjean Bay. In June 1795, Dido was ordered, with HMS Lowestoffe, to detach from the fleet off Menorca and search for the French Mediterranean Fleet near Toulon. On 24 June 1795, at roughly the midpoint between Menorca and Toulon, Towry encountered a French squadron of two frigates on an identical mission from the French commander Contre- amiral Pierre Martin. The squadrons engaged, Dido narrowly avoiding being crushed during a ramming attempt by Minerve and becoming entangled in the French ship's rigging. Driving off boarding attempts, Dido snapped off the French bowsprit and together with Lowestoffe then battered Minerve into surrender. the other French ship, Artémise, played little part in the engagement and was easily driven off. Towry brought his prize back to the British fleet, where it was recommissioned as a Royal Navy frigate with the same name and Towry placed in command. In 1796, Towry was given command of the 64-gun ship of the line HMS Diadem and in February 1797 commanded her at the Battle of Cape St Vincent where the Spanish Fleet was defeated. Shortly afterwards Diadem returned to Britain and Towry took command of HMS Uranie and HMS Cambrian before the Peace of Amiens in 1802. At the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars Towry was given command of HMS Tribune, but after a winter patrol he became ill and was forced to withdraw from active service. He was given a sinecure on the Transport Board and continued in this position until its dissolution. In 1802 he married a Miss Chamberlayne and had a marriage noted for its \\"greatest harmony and most perfect happiness\\" until her untimely death in 1806 which left him grief-stricken. They had three children, two of whom survived infancy. Towry died of natural causes at his father's house in April 1809 and was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church.

History The name comes from the legend regarding the founding of Siena, that a soldier by the name of Camulio had been sent to Siena by the founder of Rome, Romulus, to capture his nephews Senio and Ascanio. However, Camulio instead stayed and built a town around the area of the portal. Over the centuries, this gate, which lead towards Florence was often the most defended.

A few years later, the Miller estate, having parted ways with Beneke over creative differences, hired Ray McKinley, principal drummer in Miller's Army Air Force band, to organize a new \\"ghost band\\" in 1956. Hollywood contributed to the band's popularity and that of its founder and original members with the 1953 release of The Glenn Miller Story on the big screen. The band garnered award nominations and box office success, as well as top hit status for its soundtrack album in 1954. The Glenn Miller Orchestra has recorded and performed under various leaders, from 1956 to this day. Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco succeeded McKinley in 1966.

It was designed by Claude William Chambers and built in 1907. It is also known as Ace House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999.  History  The former RS Exton and Co Building was constructed in 1907 as the premises of the renowned painters and decorators, RS Exton and Co. The warehouse was designed by Brisbane architect, Claude W Chambers. Recently, the building was partially demolished and the facade only survives. Robert Skerrett Exton was a prolific painter, decorator and glazier who practiced in Brisbane from 1882 until 1921. In 1882 Robert Skerrit Exton established a painting and decorating partnership with George Gough. Both men were from Lincolnshire, England. Exton arrived in Brisbane and in the 1870s established himself as a glazier in Harcourt Street, Fortitude Valley. By 1880 Exton had moved to premises at 337–9 Queen Street, Brisbane. In 1882 the partnership of Exton and Gough allowed an expansion of Exton's solo concern. George Gough was a painter and decorator of many years experience. In 1883 the partnership moved from Exton's earlier premises to 526 Queen Street, opposite Petrie Bight. The partnership continued here and with branches in Toowoomba and Rockhampton until 1907 when it dissolved. Typical of most painters and decorators of the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries, Exton and Gough and their employees provided a wide range of services for the householder or business person building or improving their premises. Services included painting and decorating, and signwriting. Exton and Gough also provided paint supplies for tradesmen and were agents for embossed metal ceilings and importers of art glass and wallpapers of the latest European design. During the 1880s Exton and Gough expanded their business to incorporate a department for the manufacture of stained glass, the only of its kind in Queensland. Exton and Gough quickly assumed a reputation for high quality work and were commissioned for prestigious projects including Government House (George Street), the Treasury Building, Customs House, the Smellie and Co Warehouse, the Wesleyan Methodist Churches in Brisbane and Fortitude Valley. Exton and Gough provided stained glass windows for St Stephen's Cathedral and St Patrick's Church in Fortitude Valley. During the 20th century, Exton worked on the Brisbane City Hall and the Regent Theatre. Following the dissolution of the Exton and Gough partnership, RS Exton and Co was formed and George Gough established a separate painting and decorating business in Albert Street. RS Exton constructed a building at 333 Ann Street to continue business. Robert Skerrett Exton acquired the title for the land on 17 April 1907. Exton and Arthur Hatton, an associate, obtained a mortgage on the property in December 1907 for $1000 with a time frame of just over 2 years to repay the loan. The Ann Street property was transferred to RS Exton and Co on 5 December 1910 when RS Exton and Co became a limited company and Robert Skerrett Exton, Arthur Joseph Hatton, William Exton and Robert Harold Exton were appointed as the directors. The warehouse is thought to be designed by Brisbane architect Claude W Chambers, as the RS Exton and Co Warehouse appears in the list of completed buildings in an advertisement for Chambers in Queenslanders As We See 'Em of 1915. When constructed the building's face brick facade was symmetrically arranged around a central round arched full length recess flanked by narrower double arched recesses. Greek key relief moulding on cement panels, signage and other classical motifs decorated the facade. The choice of Ann Street, as the site of the RS Exton and Co Warehouse was in accord with other early twentieth-century business who maintained businesses in the Street. At the time RS Exton and Co constructed its warehouse, this area of Ann Street had been transformed with the construction of the Central railway station in the late 1880s; a number of hotels including the Canberra Hotel and the Oxford Hotel were established nearby along with a number of businesses and churches. Immediately adjacent to the RS Exton and Co Warehouse was J Simmonds Monumental Works, located adjacent to St Andrews Presbyterian Church on the corner of Creek and Ann Streets. Subsequent to the construction of the RS Exton and Co Warehouse, the Masonic Temple, Shell House, the Government ANZAC Square Offices, the People's Palace, the City Hall and other hotels and businesses were constructed in Ann Street. Ann Street, a series of two to four storeyed buildings built to the footpath and punctuated occasionally with towers became a significant promenade through Brisbane. Since the 1960s, many of these earlier buildings have been demolished and replaced with multi storeyed office buildings. RS Exton and Co continued to offer painting and decorating services and expanded the stained and leaded glass aspect of the business. In 1913, The Salon reported that the leadlight department of RS Exton and Co was under the management of Herbert M. Smyrk who for many years was one of the principal artists in the studio of Messrs William Morris and Co, Ruskin House, London. He had previously produced much fine work in the studio of E. F. Troy in Gawler, South Australia. The windows produced by the RS Exton and Co are of very quality and are clearly influenced by the work of the English Arts and Crafts movement, particularly the stained glass work of Edward Burne-Jones. RS Exton and Co began to concentrate more fully on the design and manufacture of ecclesiastical and domestic glass. To this end, RS Exton and Co employed several young artists to design the stained glass work. The most prolific and renowned of these designers was William Bustard who was employed in 1921 on commission as a stained glass designer. Bustard remained an employee on this basis with RS Exton and Co until the closure of the glass studio in 1958 with the demise of interest in decorative glass. Bustard was a prolific producer of fine stained glass which was used throughout Queensland, fine examples being in St Mark's Anglican Church, Warwick; St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Spring Hill; St Thomas' Anglican Church, Toowong; and St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, Rockhampton. Other significant designers included Charles Lancaster, whose work survives at Hampton Court, Bowen Terrace, New Farm and George Oxlade who later formed his own painting and decorating business, Oxlade Brothers, who are operating to this day at art suppliers. The company expanded in the 1910s or 1920s and another building was constructed adjacent to the western side of the 1907–1908 warehouse. This building has since been demolished. RS Exton died in 1921 and the company was compromised by the effects of the early 1930s Depression and by World War II. The business contracted through the 1940s and the glass department closed in 1958. In the early 1940s the Ann Street Warehouse of RS Exton and Co, was used by EJ Lynch Motor Body Repairs Hoods and Upholstery. The remainder of the building apart from the facade was demolished in the late 1980s or early 1990s, prior to the heritage listing. The development that was to replace it was abandoned in 1990, and the site sat vacant until the mid-2000s, when the \\"333 Ann St\\" office tower was built in its place.  Description  The former RS Exton and Co Building is situated on the south eastern side of Ann Street within a precinct of early low scale buildings, including the Masonic Hall, CPS House and St Andrew's Uniting Church. The facade continues the scale of these buildings. The remnants of the building include the north western facade addressing Ann Street and remnant walls returning from this. The facade is a symmetrical composition of face brick construction laid in English bond with rendered detailing. The facade is surmounted by a parapet with a projecting stepped up central bay housing a pediment. A rendered cornice runs the length of the parapet and stepped section. The pediment detail is embellished with dentilling and with the date \\"A. 1907. D\\" in relief lettering. Flanking the pediment is lettering repeated on each side, \\"RS Exton and Co\\". The facade comprises a central round arched recess extending from ground floor level to just below the parapet. This central recess is flanked by narrower paired round arched recesses. The arched recesses of the facade are ornamented with rendered keystone and string courses.  Heritage listing  The former RS Exton and Co Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As the only known premises of the RS Exton and Co business, or its predecessors, to survive, the building facade at 333 Ann Street has important and rare associations with a prolific and well known painting, decorating and stained glass business who were responsible for work to many of Queensland's outstanding nineteenth- and early twentieth-century buildings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The RS Exton and Co Building comprises a well designed warehouse facade of aesthetic and architectural value which contributes to the scale and architectural quality of this area of Ann Street. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Through its position on Ann Street and the quality of the external detailing, the remnant building demonstrates the ethos and significance of the RS Exton and Co firm.

Turner and his work have gained a cult following as Turner is known as the lone understudy of the guitarist, Jimi Hendrix. Turner's recording career was brief, but his lone album has become highly collectable for its resemblance to the style of his mentor. Biography Velvert Turner was born on October 12, 1951 in Brooklyn, New York. At an early age, Turner had a profound interest in the guitar, and constantly practiced with it. In 1966, Turner met Hendrix while he was in Brooklyn, and the two became friends when they realized their mutual passion for the electric guitar. Hendrix took Turner under his wing, mentoring him through instructional sessions, and personal advice in Hendrix's apartment on 302 West 12th Street. Since Hendrix was left-handed, during Turner's lessons he studied Hendrix's technique through a mirror to accommodate to his unorthodox style. Turner would regularly be invited to Hendrix's performances, and Turner boasted to his friends of knowing the guitarist as his recognition reached a national scale. All but one regarded Turner's statements as mere lies, the one believing him being Richard Lloyd, later the guitarist of the band, Television. Through Turner, Lloyd was taught how to emulate the style and guitar licks of Hendrix, and the two became good friends. After the death of Jimi Hendrix, Turner sought to establish his own music career by forming his own band, The Velvert Turner Group. The band was composed of Turner on lead guitar and as lead vocalist, Prescott Niles on bass guitar, Christopher Robinson on keyboards, and Tim McGovern on drums. Turner even resembled Hendrix, sporting an afro and wearing colorful clothing in concerts. Performance-wise, Turner was also known to play behind his back or with his teeth. In 1972, Tom Wilson pursued the opportunity to record the band for their debut album on the Phillips label. The group's debut album, Velvert Turner Group, reflects the guitar playing of Hendrix's later work, and Turner even produced vocals similar to Hendrix. All of the tracks were original material, except for the final song on the album, a cover version of the Hendrix song, \\"Freedom\\". Even the back cover of the album features a fish-eye view image, reminiscent of The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced?. The group failed to make the national charts, and the band broke up soon after. Turner's former bandmates reappeared in groups including The Knack, The Motels, Burning Sensations, and The New York Dolls. Turner sporadically performed in solo and collaborative tours thereafter. In 1977, Turner played guitar on three tracks for the Arthur Lee solo effort, Arthur Lee. In the mid-1980s Turner narrated an instructional video depicting the playing style of Jimi Hendrix. Turner did not perform any chords as they were played by Andy Aledort. For the latter portion of Turner's life, he worked in Samatarian Village in Brooklyn. He mainly dealt with supporting those struggling with substance abuse. On the morning of December 11, 2000 Turner died at the age of 49. Turner was featured on the 2004 Hendrix tribute album, Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix, in a 43-second guitar solo titled, \\"Going Home\\". Lloyd, in 2009, produced a tribute album called The Jamie Neverts Story in memoriam to Turner and Hendrix. Jamie Neverts was the code-name used when he and Turner were speaking of Hendrix. The front cover art of the album is an altered version of Turner's debut album.

Similarly to GLM, a link function relates the expected value of the response variable to a linear predictor, which in case of GFLM is obtained by forming the scalar product of the random predictor function X with a smooth parameter function \\\\beta . Functional Linear Regression, Functional Poisson Regression and Functional Binomial Regression, with the important Functional Logistic Regression included, are special cases of GFLM. Applications of GFLM include classification and discrimination of stochastic processes and functional data. Overview A key aspect of GFLM is estimation and inference for the smooth parameter function \\\\beta which is usually obtained by dimension reduction of the infinite dimensional functional predictor. A common method is to expand the predictor function X in an orthonormal basis of L2 space, the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with the simultaneous expansion of the parameter function in the same basis. This representation is then combined with a truncation step to reduce the contribution of the parameter function \\\\beta in the linear predictor to a finite number of regression coefficients. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) that employs the Karhunen–Loève expansion is a common and parsimonious approach to accomplish this. Other orthogonal expansions, like Fourier expansions and B-spline expansions may also be employed for the dimension reduction step. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) can be used for selecting the number of included components. Minimization of cross-validation prediction errors is another criterion often used in classification applications. Once the dimension of the predictor process has been reduced, the simplified linear predictor allows to use GLM and quasi-likelihood estimation techniques to obtain estimates of the finite dimensional regression coefficients which in turn provide an estimate of the parameter function \\\\beta in the GFLM. Model components =Linear predictor= The predictor functions \\\\textstyle X(t), t \\\\in T , typically are square integrable stochastic processes on a real interval T and the unknown smooth parameter function \\\\beta(t), t \\\\in T , is assumed to be square integrable on T. Given a real measure dw on T, the linear predictor is given by \\\\eta = \\\\alpha + \\\\int X^c(t)\\\\beta(t)\\\\,dw(t) where X^c(t)=X(t)-\\\\text{E}(X(t)) is the centered predictor process and \\\\alpha is a scalar that serves as an intercept. =Response variable and variance function= The outcome Y is typically a real valued random variable which may be either continuous or discrete. Often the conditional distribution of Y given the predictor process is specified within the exponential family. However it is also sufficient to consider the functional quasi-likelihood set up, where instead of the distribution of the response one specifies the conditional variance function, \\\\rm{Var}(Y\\\\mid X) = \\\\sigma^2(\\\\mu) , as a function of the conditional mean, \\\\rm{E}(Y\\\\mid X)=\\\\mu . =Link function= The link function g is a smooth invertible function, that relates the conditional mean of the response \\\\rm{E}(Y\\\\mid X) = \\\\mu with the linear predictor \\\\eta= \\\\alpha + \\\\int X^c(t)\\\\beta(t)\\\\,dw(t). The relationship is given by \\\\mu= g(\\\\eta) . Formulation In order to implement the necessary dimension reduction, the centered predictor process X^c(t) and the parameter function \\\\beta(t) are expanded as, : X^c(t)= \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\xi_j \\\\rho_j(t)\\\\text{ and }\\\\beta(t)= \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j\\\\rho_j(t), where \\\\rho_j, j=1,2,\\\\ldots is an orthonormal basis of the function space L^2(dw), such that \\\\int_T \\\\rho_j(t)\\\\rho_k(t) \\\\, dw(t) = \\\\delta_{jk} where \\\\delta_{jk} =1 if j=k and 0 otherwise. The random variables \\\\xi_j are given by \\\\xi_j= \\\\int X^c(t) \\\\rho_j(t) \\\\, dw(t) and the coefficients \\\\beta_j as \\\\beta_j=\\\\int \\\\beta(t) \\\\rho_j(t) \\\\, dw(t) for j=1,2, \\\\ldots . \\\\text{E}(\\\\xi_j)=0 and \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j^2 < \\\\infty and denoting \\\\sigma_j^2= \\\\text{Var}(\\\\xi_j)= \\\\text{E}(\\\\xi_j^2), so \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\sigma_j^2 = \\\\int \\\\text{E}(X^c(t))^2 \\\\, dw(t) < \\\\infty. From the orthonormality of the basis functions \\\\rho_j, it follows immediately that \\\\int X^c (t)\\\\beta(t) \\\\, dw(t)= \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j. The key step is then approximating \\\\eta= \\\\alpha+ \\\\int X^c(t)\\\\beta(t)\\\\,dw(t)= \\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j by \\\\eta \\\\approx \\\\alpha +\\\\sum_{j=1}^p \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j for a suitably chosen truncation point p. FPCA gives the most parsimonious approximation of the linear predictor for a given number of basis functions as the eigenfunction basis explains more of the variation than any other set of basis functions. For a differentiable link function with bounded first derivative, the approximation error of the p-truncated model i.e. the linear predictor truncated to the summation of the first p components, is a constant multiple of \\\\text{Var}(\\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j)= \\\\text{E}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j\\\\right)^2\\\\right)= \\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j\\\\sigma_j^2. A heuristic motivation for the truncation strategy derives from the fact that \\\\text{E}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j\\\\right)^2\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j\\\\sigma_j^2 \\\\leq \\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\beta_j^2 \\\\ \\\\sum_{j=p+1}^\\\\infty \\\\sigma_j^2 which is a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and by noting that the right hand side of the last inequality converges to 0 as p \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty since both \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty\\\\beta_j^2 and \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty\\\\sigma_j^2 are finite. For the special case of the eigenfunction basis, the sequence \\\\sigma_j^2, j=1,2,\\\\ldots corresponds to the sequence of the eigenvalues of the covariance kernel G(s,t)= \\\\text{Cov}(X(s), X(t)), \\\\ s,t \\\\in T. For data with n i.i.d observations, setting \\\\xi_j^0 = 1, \\\\beta_0= \\\\alpha and \\\\xi_j^i = \\\\int X_i(t)\\\\rho_j(t) \\\\, dw(t), the approximated linear predictors can be represented as \\\\eta_i= \\\\sum_{j=0}^p \\\\beta_j \\\\xi_j^i, i=1,2,\\\\ldots,n which are related to the means through \\\\mu_i=g(\\\\eta_i). Estimation The main aim is to estimate the parameter function \\\\beta. Once p has been fixed, standard GLM and quasi-likelihood methods can be used for the p-truncated model to estimate \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta^T=(\\\\beta_0, \\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\beta_p) by solving the estimating equation or the score equation U(\\\\beta)=0. The vector valued score function turns out to be U(\\\\beta)= \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\\\\mu_i) g'(\\\\eta_i) \\\\xi_i / \\\\sigma^2(\\\\mu_i) which depends on \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta through \\\\mu and \\\\eta. Just as in GLM, the equation U(\\\\beta)=0 is solved using iterative methods like Newton–Raphson (NR) or Fisher scoring (FS) or iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS) to get the estimate of the regression coefficients \\\\boldsymbol \\\\hat{\\\\beta} , leading to the estimate of the parameter function \\\\hat{\\\\beta}(t)= \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_o+ \\\\sum_{j=1}^p \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_j\\\\rho_j(t) . When using the canonical link function, these methods are equivalent. Results are available in the literature of p-truncated models as p \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty which provide asymptotic inference for the deviation of the estimated parametric function from the true parametric function and also asymptotic tests for regression effects and asymptotic confidence regions. Exponential family response If the response variable Y_i, given X_i \\\\in L^2(T) follows the one parameter exponential family, then its probability density function or probability mass function (as the case may be) is :f(y_i\\\\mid X_i)= \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{y_i\\\\theta_i-b(\\\\theta_i)}{\\\\phi} + c(y_i,\\\\phi)\\\\right) for some functions b and c , where \\\\theta_i is the canonical parameter, and \\\\phi is a dispersion parameter which is typically assumed to be positive. In the canonical set up, \\\\eta_i= \\\\alpha + \\\\int X_i^c(t) \\\\beta(t) \\\\, dw(t)= \\\\theta_i and from the properties of exponential family, : \\\\mu_i= b'(\\\\theta_i),\\\\text{ and so } \\\\mu_i= b'(\\\\eta_i). Hence b' serves as a link function and is called the canonical link function. \\\\text{Var}(y_i)= \\\\phi b(\\\\theta_i)= \\\\phi b(\\\\eta_i)= \\\\phi g'(\\\\eta_i)= \\\\phi g'(g^{-1}(\\\\mu_i))) is the corresponding variance function and \\\\phi the dispersion parameter. Special cases =Functional linear regression (FLR)= Functional linear regression, one of the most useful tools of functional data analysis, is an example of GFLM where the response variable is continuous and is often assumed to have a Normal distribution. The variance function is a constant function and the link function is identity. Under these assumptions the GFLM reduces to the FLR, : \\\\mu= \\\\operatorname{E}(Y\\\\mid X)= \\\\eta= \\\\alpha + \\\\int X^c (t)\\\\beta(t) \\\\, dw(t) Without the normality assumption, the constant variance function motivates the use of quasi-normal techniques. =Functional binary regression= When the response variable has binary outcomes, i.e., 0 or 1, the distribution is usually chosen as Bernoulli, and then \\\\mu_i= P(Y_i=1 \\\\mid X_i). Popular link functions are the expit function, which is the inverse of the logit function (functional logistic regression) and the probit function (functional probit regression). Any cumulative distribution function F has range [0,1] which is the range of binomial mean and so can be chosen as a link function. Another link function in this context is the complementary log–log function, which is an asymmetric link. The variance function for binary data is given by \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y_i)= \\\\phi \\\\mu_i (1- \\\\mu_i) where the dispersion parameter \\\\phi is taken as 1 or alternatively the quasi-likelihood approach is used. =Functional Poisson regression= Another special case of GFLM occurs when the outcomes are counts, so that the distribution of the responses is assumed to be Poisson. The mean \\\\mu_i is typically linked to the linear predictor \\\\eta_i via a log-link, which is also the canonical link . The variance function is \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y_i)= \\\\phi \\\\mu_i, where the dispersion parameter \\\\phi is 1, except when the data might be over-dispersed which is when the quasi-Poisson approach is used. Extensions Extensions of GFLM have been proposed for the cases where there are multiple predictor functions. Another generalization is called the Semi Parametric Quasi-likelihood Regression (SPQR) which considers the situation where the link and the variance functions are unknown and are estimated non-parametrically from the data. This situation can also be handled by single or multiple index models, using for example Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR). Another extension in this domain is Functional Generalized Additive Model (FGAM)) which is a generalization of generalized additive model(GAM) where :g^{-1}(\\\\operatorname{E}(Y\\\\mid X)) = \\\\alpha + \\\\sum_{j=1}^p f_j(\\\\xi_j), where \\\\xi_j are the expansion coefficients of the random predictor function X and each f_j is an unknown smooth function that has to be estimated and where \\\\text{E}(f_j(\\\\xi_j))=0.. In general, estimation in FGAM requires combining IWLS with backfitting. However, if the expansion coefficients are obtained as functional principal components, then in some cases (e.g. Gaussian predictor function X), they will be independent in which case backfitting is not needed, and one can use popular smoothing methods for estimating the unknown parameter functions f_j. Application Egg laying trajectories of medflies for the first 25 days A popular data set that has been used for a number of analysis in the domain of functional data analysis consists of the number of eggs laid daily until death of 1000 Mediterranean fruit flies (or medflies for short). The plot here shows the egg laying trajectories in the first 25 days of life of about 600 female medflies (those that have at least 20 remaining eggs in their lifetime). The red colored curves belong to those flies that will lay less than the median number of remaining eggs, while the blue colored curves belong to the flies that will lay more than the median number of remaining eggs after age 25. An related problem of classifying medflies as long-lived or short-lived based on the initial egg laying trajectories as predictors and the subsequent longevity of the flies as response has been studied with the GFLM See also *Functional additive models *Functional data analysis *Functional principal component analysis *Generalized linear model *Karhunen–Loève theorem *Lp space *Quasi-likelihood *Stochastic processes References Functional linear model ","title":"Generalized functional linear model"},{"id":"45589824","text":"Valeira Dam () is a concrete gravity dam on the Douro, where the river forms the border line between the districts of Viseu and Bragança.

It is approximately long and flows through Hazle Township. The stream drains part of the city of Hazleton. In the early 1900s, it was polluted by acid mine drainage. A borehole was dug near the mouth of the stream in the late 1800s. Course Gravel Run begins in Hazle Township, very near the city of Hazleton. It flows northwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning north. Over the next few tenths of a mile, the stream passes near the Hazleton Area High School and flows down a small hill. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Black Creek. Hydrology, geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Gravel Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. A report by the Pennsylvania Department of Health in the early 1900s described Gravel Run as being a small stream. It was described as being long in the early 1900s. A diamond drill borehole dug in the late 1800s at the mouth of Gravel Run revealed 15 different strata within roughly of the surface. The top consisted of surface wash and dark slate. The next contained coal with slate, soft gray sandy shale, pulverized rock and sand, gray shale and graphite, pulverized rock and coal, brown sandy clay and pulverized rock, light red and yellow-brown shale, and fine gray sandstone, in that order. The next consisted of dark gray sandstone and coarse gray sandstone with pebbles, in that order. The final contained gray sandstone, gray sandstone with pebbles, and gray sandstone with coal slate, in that order. Overall, the borehole revealed 38 different strata. Gravel Run, like many streams in its vicinity, was polluted by acid mine drainage in the early 1900s. The acid mine drainage came from mines in and near the city of Hazleton. Watershed Gravel Run is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hazleton. It drains a portion of the northwestern part of the city of Hazleton. It drains the older part of the city as well as the Green Ridge Territory. Gravel Run is one of eleven officially named streams in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek that has not been assessed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. History Gravel Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202232. The stream appears in the Atlas of the Anthracite Coalfields of Pennsylvania, which was published in 1888. Historically, the Pennsylvania Railroad owned a tract of land in the vicinity of Gravel Run.

Scholars speculate the Scientology cross may have been inspired by Aleister Crowley's use of the Rose Cross. The eight-pointed Scientology cross Scientology is suspected or alleged by some observers of being inspired by, or sharing elements with, a number of esoteric or occult systems. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard claimed to have had a near-death experience in 1938 that inspired him to write Excalibur, an unpublished manuscript based on the revelations from the experience. In 1945–46, Hubbard was briefly involved with and defrauded Jack Parsons, an American rocketry pioneer who was also a devoted Thelemite and member of the Agape Lodge of Aleister Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis, in Pasadena, California. In 1950, Hubbard published Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, and in 1953 he organized the Church of Scientology. Hugh B. Urban, a scholar on religion who has written much about Scientology, writes that while some writers, such as Jon Atack, assert that Crowley's ideas on magic are at the core of Scientology, others, including Roy Wallis and J. Gordon Melton, have dismissed the connection between occultism and the Church. He argues further that the occult elements are combined with concepts in Eastern religions, science fiction, popular psychology and Hubbard's own thoughts, while confirming that there is one element that is related to the occult in the religion.: \\"Other ex-members and critics such as Jon Atack have alleged that Crowley's magic lies at the inner core of Scientology. [...] Meanwhile, many scholars, such as Roy Wallis and J. Gordon Melton, have largely dismissed Hubbard's connection to Crowley, arguing that \\"there is no evidence that Hubbard's system of Scientology owes any great debt to that of Crowley.\\" [...] In Hubbard's religious bricolage, occult elements drawn from Crowley were indeed one important element, but neither more nor less important than the many other drawn from pop psychology, Eastern religions, science fiction and a host of goods available in the 1950s spiritual marketplace.\\" Hubbard's early interest in the occult Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. Hubbard's eldest son, Ronald DeWolf, related a story that L. Ron Hubbard had \\"first discovered Magick\\" at the age of sixteen when he read Aleister Crowley's The Book of the Law. Author Jon Atack reports that Hubbard joined the Rosicrucian order Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) in 1940, completing the first two neophyte degrees. According to Atack, Hubbard's membership lapsed on July 5, 1940. Near-death experience and Excalibur In April 1938, Hubbard reportedly had a bad reaction to a drug during a dental procedure. According to his account, this caused a near-death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of \\"The One Command\\" or Excalibur. The contents of Excalibur formed the basis for some of his later publications.Hubbard, \\"The Anatomy Of Thought\\". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised 15 March 1975. Arthur J. Burks, who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the \\"one command\\": to survive, a theme that Hubbard revisited in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Burks also recalled that the work discussed the psychology of a lynch mob. Hubbard cited Excalibur as an early version of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Aleister Crowley's magical order Golden Dawn garb In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John \\"Jack\\" Whiteside Parsons, an avid occultist and Thelemite, follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO).Miller, p. 113 Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the \\"Babalon Working\\", a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Thelemite Goddess. In 1969, The Sunday Times published an exposé by Australian journalist Alex Mitchell detailing Hubbard's experiences with Parsons and the OTO. Hubbard's experience with hypnosis Hubbard was known to his associates in the late 1940s as a talented hypnotist. During this period, he worked in Hollywood posing as a swami. The Church says that Hubbard's experience with hypnosis led to his discovery of the principles of Dianetics as a technique for solving man's problems.Hubbard, What is Scientology?, 1998 softcover edition, pg. 529. Affirmations The \\"Affirmations\\" is a document purportedly written by Hubbard in the late 1940s, a few years before he established Dianetics (1950) or Scientology (1952). The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis. Many suggestions encourage Hubbard to believe in his own occult powers: * \\"That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.\\" * \\"That my magical work is powerful and effective.\\" * \\"You are psychic.\\" Several suggestions reference a guardian spirit: * \\"You can do automatic writing whenever you wish. You do not care what comes out on the paper when your Guardian dictates.\\"Wright, p. 53-4 * \\"Nothing can intervene between you and your Guardian. She cannot be displaced because she is too powerful. She does not control you. She advises you.\\" * \\"The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of your Guardian.\\" * \\"You can talk with her and audibly hear her voice above all others.\\" Another suggestion involves numerology: \\"That the numbers 7, 25 and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.\\" Scholars have noted that the Affirmations contain themes that reappeared later in Scientology. One Affirmation foreshadows Hubbard's future interest in mental healing: \\"You understand all the workings of the minds of humans around you, for you are a doctor of minds, bodies and influences.\\" Lawrence Wright suggests \\"Hubbard is using techniques on himself that he would later develop into Dianetics.\\" He draws parallels with the practice of \\"auditing\\" used in Dianetics and Scientology, noting that the Affimations and Dianetics both involve tackling difficult memories that hold back mental and spiritual progress. The Affirmations became public knowledge during the 1984 lawsuit against Hubbard's former archivist, Gerald Armstrong. In that settlement, Armstrong was required to return \\"all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard\\". As religious studies scholar Hugh Urban comments, \\"here the church clearly indicates that the text was written by L. Ron Hubbard, and it seems difficult to understand why the church would file suit to retain ownership of the text were it not an authentic document.\\" Dianetics Hubbard conducting a Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950 In a 1949 letter to Forrest Ackerman, Hubbard promises his upcoming work will give Ackerman the power to \\"rape women without their knowing it, communicate suicide messages to your enemies as they sleep, sell the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the mayor for cash, evolve the best way of protecting or destroying communism\\". Hubbard admits he has \\"not decided whether to destroy the Catholic church or merely start a new one.\\" In 1950, Hubbard published an article entitled \\"Dianetics: the Evolution of a Science\\" in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. In that article, Hubbard discusses the use of hypnosis, automatic writing, automatic speaking and clairvoyance. Author Jon Atack has noted Hubbard seems to have a special interest in the Roman goddess 'Diana'. In 1946, using money from Jack Parsons, Hubbard purchased a boat named \\"Diane\\". In 1952, Hubbard named his daughter Diana. Later, Hubbard named a sea org vessel 'Diana'. Atack speculates \\"Dianetics\\" might be a 'double-entendre', and notes the existence of the earlier occult practice of Dianism. Philadelphia Doctorate Course In December 1952, Hubbard recorded a series of audio lectures in which he connects Crowleyite magical rituals and the practice of Scientology. Hubbard explains the use of Tarot, and discusses \\"the magic cults\\" of the 8th-12th centuries. He recommends The Master Therion as \\"the only modern work that has anything to do with them\\". He describes the book's author, Aleister Crowley, as \\"my very good friend,\\" though there is some question about his intent in this remark because Hubbard never met Crowley personally. Hubbard also explains that Crowley \\"signs himself \\"The Beast\\"; \\"The Mark of the Beast, 666.\\"\\" In The Book of the Law, Crowley wrote \\"The whole and sole object of all true magickal training is to become free from every kind of limitation.\\" Hubbard repurposed this for his movement, lecturing that \\"Our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any type of limitation.... Old Aleister Crowley had some interesting things to say about this. He wrote the Book of the Law.\\" Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard's eldest son, wrote that \\"In preparation for the next day's lecture, [Hubbard]'d pace the floor, exhilarated by this or that passage from Aleister Crowley's writings.\\" During the Philadelphia course, Hubbard jokes that he is \\"the prince of darkness\\", which is met with laughter from the audience. \\"Heidi Forrester\\" sex incident According to a former member of the Sea Organization pseudonymously named \\"Heidi Forrester\\", in late 1975 she met with \\"a heavy-set older man. He had reddish grey hair, slightly long in the back. He was wearing a white shirt, black pants, black tie, and black shoes, highly polished.\\" She recalls \\"He lay on top of me. As far as I can tell he had no erection. However, using his hand in some way he managed to get his penis inside me. [...] Then for the next hour he did absolutely nothing at all. I mean nothing!\\" \\"Original\\" OT8 Operating Thetan level VIII is the highest level of auditing in Scientology. It is known as \\"The Truth Revealed\\". It was initially released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988. In OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death. Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work.\\"By the time you read this I will no longer be occupying the body and identity that you have known as Ron.\\" Hubbard explains that the reader has \\"undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth\\" but \\"the story was never written, nor spoken... It is only now that I feel it safe to release the information\\". Hubbard mentions the Book of Revelation and its prophecy of a time when \\"an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti- Christ, will reign\\". According to Hubbard, the \\"anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer\\". Hubbard writes \\"My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period.\\" In the document, Hubbard also teaches that \\"the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be. In addition to being a lover of young boys and men. he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred\\". =Authenticity= The document was posted to the Internet in 1995 as part of the Fishman papers. The Church of Scientology denies the document's authenticity, though notable defectors have described receiving the document as part of their training for the rank of OT8. George White, a public scientologist who had received OT8 in the summer of 1988, asserts the document is authentic. Frank Oliver, a former operative with Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, reports having discovered the document in the church's archives. Jesse Prince, former second-in-command of Scientology's Religious Technology Center, reports that OTVIII was revised after early participants were \\"horribly upset\\" by the content. Ronald DeWolf statements Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr., Hubbard's eldest son, had been an active participant in the early days of Scientology. In 1959, he left Scientology and later took the name Ronald DeWolf. In the mid-1980s, DeWolf gave a series of sworn statements and interviews detailing his father's history. DeWolf explained his father had been \\"deeply involved in the occult and black-magic.\\" According to DeWolf, Aleister Crowley's death in 1947 was a pivotal event that led Hubbard to \\"take over the mantle of the Beast\\". DeWolf claimed that \\"Black magic is the inner core of Scientology\\", arguing that \\"my father did not worship Satan. He thought he was Satan.\\" In 2014, Jamie DeWolf (Ronald's grandson) announced the discovery of Ronald DeWolf's unpublished memoir which had been written in 1981. That work discusses the Hubbards' history of occult practices.

Subsequently, she made one voyage to New South Wales transporting convicts. She was last listed in 1819. Indiaman Moses Agar contracted with the EIC for Lord Eldon to make six voyages for a per ton freight charge of £13 19s 6d per ton (in peacetime). Only her first voyage for the EIC would take place in peacetime. =EIC voyage #1 (1802-03)= Captain Jasper Swete left the Downs 14 June 1802, bound for St Helena and Bengal.Swete’s name often shows up in records as \\"Sweet\\". Lord Eldon sailed in company with Minerva. The Directors of the EIC had ordered Minervas captain to travel with Lord Eldon, something that annoyed him as the French Revolutionary Wars had ended and so he didn’t need the reinforcements, and Lord Eldon was particularly slow.Calcutta Review, Vol.27, p.282. Lord Eldon reached St Helena on 30 August, the Cape on 20 October, and Acheh on 7 January 1803. She arrived at Calcutta on 31 January. She brought detachments of the 8th Dragoons and the 22nd Regiment of Foot, which were transferring to India from the Cape. For here homeward leg she passed Kedgeree on 20 April, reaching St Helena on 9 August and Cork, Ireland, on 1 December. Lord Eldon arrived at the Downs on 12 December. =EIC voyage #2 (1804-05)= Captain Jasper Swete left Portsmouth on 9 June 1804, bound for Bengal and Benkulen. By this time the Napoleonic Wars had broken out and after Swete had left Portsmouth he was issued a letter of marque on 25 June. The letter of marque authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French should the occasion arise, not just defensive action against them or pirates. Lord Eldon reached Madeira on 6 July and arrived at Calcutta on 21 December. Hoomeward- bound, she passed Saugor on 31 March 1805, reached Benkulen on 17 May, and St Helena on 6 September. She arrived at the Downs on 6 December. On her arrival in England, Lord Eldon reported that she, the Indiaman Tottenham, and three whalers had left St Helena under escort by the gun-brig when in the vicinity of they sighted three frigates and a brig, which they believed were Spanish. The enemy vessels, Spain being a French ally at that time, chased them from 9a.m. to 8p.m.Lloyd's List, no.4278, – accessed 4 March 2015. Her travails were not over, however. On 16 December The Times reported that two days earlier, Lord Eldon, with a cargo of pepper from Benkulen, Sumatra, had stuck on the sands at the Nore, and could not be got off. =EIC voyage #3 (1806-07)= Captain John William Young left Portsmouth on 10 June 1806, bound for Bengal. Lord Eldon arrived at Calcutta on 20 November. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 26 March 1807, and reached St Helena on 31 July. Early in the morning of 9 November, Lord Eldon was anchored off the Needles, and almost home. A brig approached her in the dark and the fog; seeing her, the crew fled below deck as they feared she was an English naval vessel come to try and press them. Actually, the brig was a French privateer, and the lack of a deck crew made it easy for the privateer’s men to board. Captain Young heard unusual sounds, went on deck, and raised the alarm. The crew returned to the deck and killed five privateers. Young himself then with a single blow of his sword, beheaded one man who was at the helm, who turned out to be the privateer’s boatswain. In the confusion the privateer escaped.Gentleman's Magazine (1807), Vol. 77, Part. 2, p.1071. =EIC voyage #4 (1808-09)= Young left Portsmouth on 10 June 1808, bound for Bombay. Lord Eldon reached Madeira on 25 June. On 10 October, Lord Eldon and the Indiaman Caermarthen were about six leagues from the island of Cortivy. They estimated her position as . (The actual coordinates are .) The significance of the estimation, rough as it was, still located the island several miles southwest of where it had until then been believed to be. Lord Eldon arrived at Bombay on 30 October. That day, HMS Nereide came up and pressed four seamen; a fifth jumped into the sea and swam ashore. Homeward bound, Lord Eldon reached Point de Galle on 8 February 1809. On 15 February she sailed from Point de Galle as part of a fleet of 15 East Indiamen under escort by and .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.216. On 14 March, off Mauritius, a gale developed.

She arrived at the Downs on 13 July. =EIC voyage #5 (1810-12)= Young left Portsmouth on 12 May 1810 bound for Bombay and. Lord Eldon reached Madeira on 27 May and Bombay on 5 October. Lord Eldon reached Calicut on 24 November and Point de Galle on 4 December, and arrived at Calcutta on 25 January 1811. She left Calcutta, passing Saugor on 4 March, reaching Malacca on 7 June. The reason Batavia was at Malacca was that she served as a transport during the British invasion of Java in 1811. She was part of the third division, which sailed from Malacca on 14 June 1811.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 27, (Jan-Jun 1812), p.109. Lord Eldon was at Batavia on 10 August. She returned via Malacca on 19 October, Penang on 1 November, and on 20 December arrived at Calcutta again. For her homeward trip, Lord Eldon passed Saugor on 8 March 1812, reaching Mauritius on 19 May, and St Helena on 2 June. In September Lord Eldon, , , , and were at on their way from Saint Helena to England and under escort by HMS Loire.Lloyd's List, №4713, – accessed 4 March 2015.

One was an 18-month old heifer, a \\"Braminico\\", or \\"true Bengal breed\\". The governor of Mauritius put her on board at the behest of Lord Minto, as a gift for the Prince Regent. The other bovine was a bull of the same breed, a present for a Colonel Herriot.Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year (1812), Vol. 54, p.136. =EIC voyage #6 (1813-14)= Captain Jacob Cowles left Torbay on 25 March 1813, bound for Batavia. Lord Eldon reached Madeira on 8 April and arrived at Batavia on 2 August. Homeward bound, she reached Anger on 27 October and St Helena on 13 January 1814.

She arrived at the Downs on 2 July. Convict transport At some point after her return, Buckle and Co. bought Lord Eldon. Apparently she was sold for use as a hulk, but instead transported convicts to Australia. She appears in Lloyd's Register for 1818 with Lamb, master, and her trade London- Botany Bay.Lamb was the brother of John Lamb, who made two voyages transporting convicts on , also a Buckle-owned ship, after having been made redundant in the Royal Navy in 1815. Actually, she had sailed from Britain on 9 April 1817. Her master was James Thomas Lamb and he sailed her to Port Jackson via Madeira and Rio de Janeiro. On 7 May, as Lord Eldon was at while on her way from London to New South Wales, a privateer schooner full of men and armed with long 18 or 24-pounder guns, fired on her.Lloyd's List №5186. She arrived at Port Jackson on 30 September. Lord Eldon had sailed with 220 male convicts and arrived with 215, one having escaped at Rio by jumping overboard and swimming to shore, and four having died on the voyage. The 46th Regiment of Foot provided a guard of 30 men, under the command of a lieutenant from the 1st Regiment of Foot. Lord Eldon left in December 1817, with destination Batavia. When Lamb and Lord Eldon returned to Britain in 1819, Buckle & Co. gave him command of their new, 435 ton (bm) Indiaman Hoogly. Fate Lord Eldon is last listed in 1819 in both Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping.

History  = Pre-Yacht Club Years = In 1925, two local bankers, Bruce Sharpe and Charlie Towne, purchased a 14-foot cat boat and began sailing it on Monterey Bay out of Santa Cruz, California. Their sailing enthusiasm was noticed and they were soon joined by local merchant Sam Leask Jr. after which they joined the nearest yacht club, the San Francisco Yacht Club, which was located at Sausalito Cove. Soon after they joined, the overcrowded conditions in the cove led to a movement to relocate the clubhouse. The membership, however, was deeply divided as to whether to move the club to Belvedere Cove or to a site on the San Francisco waterfront. A majority favored the Marin site and the clubhouse was relocated. The remainder of the members split from the club and formed the St. Francis Yacht Club on the Marina. The trio from Santa Cruz had friends on both sides of the schism and rather than choose sides, Sharpe put forth the idea of starting a yacht club closer to home. Sharp, Towne and Leask invited a dozen or so friends to join them for dinner in a balcony room at the Saddle Rock Grill and a lively discussion took place about the possibility of forming a local yacht club. By the time “last call” was sounded, all those present agreed to become members, thus establishing the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. It was January 5, 1928. = Early Yacht Club Years = The infant club did not immediately spark a storm of sailing activity. As Leask recalled: “…At the outset, the members’ knowledge of things nautical was decidedly limited. It was the era of prohibition and in order to hold the membership together we resorted to frequent expeditions to nearby bootleg establishments for meetings which were hilarious and convivial if not particularly yachting oriented.” The SCYC kept up its San Francisco connections, sponsoring long-distance races with both the San Francisco Yacht Club and the St. Francis Yacht Club. One of the first races that the Santa Cruz Yacht Club sponsored was a power boat race from Long Beach to San Francisco. The San Francisco boating fraternity welcomed the presence of SCYC members on their top-flight yachts which were manned by competent and well- disciplined crews. Sharp was elected the first Commodore, Jay Harris, who designed the club burgee, the second, and Leask the third. Those who were present at the time agree that the first truly accomplished seaman to join the club was Lino Nicoli who owned the 42-foot yawl “Pathfinder.” It was Nicoli who first introduced many of the early members to the fine art of seamanship. The club purchased a pair of 18-foot cub class sloops, the original “Jack” and “Jill” which were moored in the lee of the wharf. The two sloops served the membership well, but the “Jack” was lost on the beach in an early winter storm in 1942. Initially, club meetings were held in the Casino Building courtesy of the Seaside Co. In 1930, a gear room and clubhouse was established on the wharf. It was 6 feet by 12 feet and contained two lockers, a table, and a bench. The head was a hole in the floor. = Wharf Years = The SCYC was active in hosting several long-distance races down from San Francisco Bay, including the still popular Windjammers Race (1938). Held on Memorial Day weekend and later on Labor Day, the Windjammers event blossomed into the premier local sailing event. Dozens of the Bay Area’s finest yachts stood at anchor off the wharf following their run down the coast. Cries of “Shore boat!” echoed across the moorings, bringing Sea Scouts scurrying about dropping off Sunday papers and ice and ferrying sailors to and from shore. SCYC members prepared breakfast for the racers, providing sustenance for the long weekend’s activities. The large regattas were suspended for the duration of World War II but most of the club’s yachts remained active. By the mid-1950s, the clubhouse boasted amenities such as a real head and a shower. There was a bar and couches and even a balcony ideally suited for firing the cannon at the start of a race or sipping a four-bit cocktail and watching the sunset over Mark Abbott Memorial Lighthouse, commonly known as Lighthouse Point. = Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor Years = In 1962, after decades of planning, the Army Corps of Engineers began the construction on the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor at Wood’s Lagoon, beginning first with, what is today known as, the South Harbor. The South Harbor was completed in 1964, and an initial 360 slips were dedicated. In 1950, an election officially formed the Santa Cruz Port District under the guidelines of the State of California Harbors and Navigation Code and soon after the Santa Cruz Yacht Club began a search for property for a clubhouse near the soon-to-be Yacht Harbor. The present 4th Avenue clubhouse was purchased with a down payment put up by a group of members and was rented out until the harbor officially opened in 1964. The membership quickly went to work on the new clubhouse, first building a deck and the steps that lead down to the harbor. However, soon after the initial construction was being completed, a major earthquake in Alaska generated a tsunami that damaged many of the docks. A short time later, the first of several anchovy kills turned the harbor into a reeking, paint-peeling muck. A thick layer of dead baitfish filled the channels, ruining brightwork and causing a stench that lasted months. These anchovy runs into the Yacht Harbor occur regularly and the Santa Cruz takes steps to mitigate deoxygenation and mass die-off through mechanical aeration machines located at the end of several of the docks throughout the harbor. The 1970s saw Santa Cruz and the yacht club come to the forefront of the Ultra Light Displacement Boat (ULDB) movement that revolutionized yacht racing. In 1977 Bill Lee’s “Merlin” shattered the Trans Pacific Race record and Santa Cruz ULDBs of all sizes became the boats to beat. Merlin’s record stood for 20 years. That same year, the clubhouse underwent a major expansion and remodel. Ten years later an interior remodel was completed and in 2012 the clubhouse went through a complete remodel, including the addition of a Tram, assuming its present configuration. In 2013, the SCYC hosted the official ribbon cutting for the clubhouse tram and lower level remodel.  Club Identification  = Club Burgee = The signal flag of the Club shall be a pointed burgee, divided vertically by a swallowtail with the hoist white and the fly red; superimposed shall be a blue circle containing a cruciform cross of white at an angle of 45 degrees toward the hoist. The blue circle shall have a diameter of one-half the length of the hoist and the center thereof shall be placed at the point of the swallowtail nearest the hoist. The flag shall be made an inch in length for each foot overall lot the yacht flying this flag.  Sailing Programs  = Junior Program = The Santa Cruz Yacht Club provides Junior membership eligibility to individuals between the ages of 8 and 21 years old. The Santa Cruz Yacht Club Junior program serves as a starting point for sailing for many youths in Santa Cruz County, as well as many surrounding counties and encourages youth sailing by providing Sailing instruction with emphasis on safety and seamanship, racing, day sailing, and cruising opportunities, and a learning environment that fosters courtesy, good sportsmanship, and community service. The Santa Cruz Yacht Club Junior Program hosts three discrete programs for sailors:  El Toro  The El Toro program is for sailors 8-14 Years of Age. These young sailors are taught fundamentals of proper boat handling, rigging, sailing in different conditions, racing, and tactics in El Toros on Pinto Lake.  Scholastic  The Scholastic program is for high school sailors who wish to train and race FJs competing with other schools in the region. Coached practices are held just outside the Santa Cruz Yacht Harbor in the Monterey Bay.  Advanced  The Advanced program is for high school sailors who compete independently in other venues such as Lasers and 29ers throughout the Bay Area and around the world. = Corinthian Program = The Santa Cruz Yacht Club provides Corinthian membership eligibility to individuals between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-six and who actively crew on boats of Regular members of the club or skipper their own boats under the burgee of the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. Corinthian members enjoy the same privileges as Regular Members except that they may not vote on affairs of the club which are subject to meetings of the Club, or serve as an officer or director. The Corinthian Program provides a bridge between the Junior and Regular membership and helps to encourage active participation in the club by young adults. The Corinthian Program provides venues for sailing education and training for new and experienced sailors, including Sailing instruction for beginning, intermediate and advanced sailors in dinghies, keelboats and powerboats as well as a formal mentorship program which connects sailors with common interests.

After training in Manhattan's Turtle Bay Park, the unit left New York for Fortress Monroe, Virginia, on June 14, 1861.

While stationed at Fortress Monroe, General Benjamin Butler commanded a joint army- navy expedition to capture Confederate Forts Hatteras and Clark. In the ensuing Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries, a mixed amphibious force led by the 20th New York's commander, Colonel Max Weber, accepted the surrender of the two forts. The landing was a botched affair, in which high seas prevented the majority of the invasion force from landing and left a mere 318 men stranded on shore with inadequate provisions.Report of Colonel Max Weber, OR, S. I V. 4 Pg. 589-590 The ensuing Union naval bombardment, however, forced the Confederate garrisons to surrender. The portion of the 20th which had taken part in the invasion remained in the vicinity of Forts Hatteras and Clark for several weeks, until reports reached Major General John Ellis Wool that soldiers from the regiment had committed \\"depredations and various outrages\\" on the inhabitants.Report of Major General John Ellis Wool, OR S. I V. 4 Pg. 581 Other sources suggest that the colonel of the 9th New York blamed the looting on the men of the 20th to protect the reputation of his own regiment, which had also participated.http://gkkapp.home.infionline.net/A%20Regimental%20History%20of%20the%2020th%20NYSV.htm#d Ernst von Vegesack in 1863, as colonel of the United Turner Regiment. On June 9, 1862, the 20th New York was transferred to the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac in preparation for the Peninsula Campaign. The regiment did not engage in pitched battle until the Battle of White Oak Swamp, in which a Confederate artillery bombardment surprised the 20th New York as they were encamped. A significant number of the enlisted men and officers were routed, including the regiment's new commander, Colonel Francis Weiss.Report of Brigadier General John Davidson, OR, S.

Mutiny As the 20th New York closed in on the end of its two years of service, questions arose as to whether the two years started from the point at which they were mustered into New York service or United States service. On April 29, 1863, the regiment was engaged in maneuvers which would lead to the Battle of Chancellorsville. When ordered to cross the Rappahannock River, approximately two hundred men refused to do so.Report Accompanying the Act for the Relief of Certain Enlisted Men of the Twentieth Regiment of New York Volunteer Infantry, 58th Congress, 3rd Session, 1905, HR 1860. Via Kappesser, Gary. \\"Twentieth New York State Infantry.\\" Accessed March 6, 2015. http://gkkapp.home.infionline.net/20NYSV.htm The mutineers were quickly tried and convicted for mutiny in the face of the enemy, and sentenced to hard labor. Lobbying efforts by Kleindeutschland elites and the support of Army of the Potomac Provost Marshal Marsena R. Patrick led to their sentence being commuted to dishonorable discharges, although these discharges were converted to honorable discharges by a declaration by the war department and a law passed by Congress in 1905. The remainder of the regiment crossed the Rappahannock and participated in the Battle of Salem Church, in which the unit incurred higher casualties than at any other battle. The survivors of the regiment returned to New York City and were mustered out on June 1, 1863. Casualties Over the course of its service, 61 officers and men were killed or mortally wounded in battle. An additional 58 officers and enlisted men died of disease.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Jones played rhythm guitar in Bo Diddley's band in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming one of the first (perhaps the first) female rock guitarists in a highly visible rock band, and was sometimes called the Queen Mother of Guitar. Early life Born in Harlem, New York City, in 1940, Jones grew up in the Sugar Hill section, and attended the High School of Performing Arts where she studied tap and ballet dance and trained in opera. Even from a very young age, she found herself completely consumed with music; purchasing her first guitar at the age of 15. She was briefly in a local doo-wop group, the Bop Chords, which disbanded in 1957. A chance meeting with Bo Diddley, who was impressed to see a girl with a guitar case, led to an invitation to join Diddley's band as a guitarist and singer. She recorded with him from 1957 to 1961 or 1963, appearing on singles including \\"Hey! Bo Diddley\\", \\"Road Runner\\", \\"Bo Diddley's A Gunslinger\\", and the instrumental \\"Aztec\\" which she wrote and played all the guitar parts. However, throughout her career, Peggy Jones always strived to be an independent artist and was involved in an R&B; band known as the Jewels, among other various names. Throughout her time with Diddley, Jones maintained the separate career she had begun independently as a songwriter, session musician, and bandleader. She led her own band, the Jewels (also known as the Fabulous Jewels, Lady Bo and the Family Jewels, and various other names, but not to be confused with The Jewels), which became a top R&B; band on the New York – Boston east coast club scene the 1960s and 1970s. She eventually left Diddley's band to concentrate on the Jewels and other activities. She was replaced with another female guitarist, Norma-Jean Wofford (\\"The Duchess\\"). Jones played guitar on Les Cooper's 1962 instrumental \\"Wiggle Wobble\\" and percussion on the 1967 hit \\"San Franciscan Nights\\" by Eric Burdon and The Animals and other recordings and later backed James Brown and Sam & Dave. She remained musically active well into the 21st century. Solo work She left Bo Diddley's band in 1961 to focus on her work with the Jewels. In 1970, she re-joined Bo Diddley’s band, bringing The Jewels with her. Jones was known for playing the Roland guitar synthesizer, an experimental instrument not typically heard in rhythm and blues music. Relationships Jones met Bo Diddley in 1956 backstage after playing with the Bop-Chords in the Apollo Theater in the neighborhood of Harlem. Many assumed that Lady Bo and Bo Diddley were a couple, considering her given name, but that was not the case. She was married to the band’s bass player, Wally Malone. Malone lived in the mountains of western Pennsylvania when he first met Jones in a New York club in the 1960s. Later, Jones invited Malone into her band in 1968 and got married. They both moved to San Jose, California where Jones played at a show with Bo Diddley and that was the time she received her nickname, “Lady Bo.” In 1962 Jones left Bo Diddley and recruited The Duchess to play for him. In 1979, Malone and Jones moved to Boulder Creek. Death At the age of 75, Peggy Jones died on September 16, 2015, leaving behind her husband, Wally Malone. He announced his wife’s death via Facebook, saying, “Today is one of the saddest days of my life. My wife and partner of 47 years has been called up to that great rock & roll band in the heavens to be reunited with Bo Diddley, Jerome Green and Clifton James. The last hour and a quarter I spent by her side and the last thing I said to her was the quote above regarding Diddley and band. The other thing I added at the end of it is that band doesn’t have a bass player and for them to please hold that seat until it is my time to join them. The incredible part of this is immediately after saying this to her there was a quick sound that came from her and right then her heart stopped beating. Many of you know about the Bo Diddley connection but in case not my wife’s professional stage name is Lady Bo.” Discography With Bo Diddley *Go Bo Diddley (Checker, 1959) *Have Guitar Will Travel (Checker, 1960) *Bo Diddley in the Spotlight (Checker, 1960) *Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger (Checker, 1960) *Bo Diddley Is a Lover (Checker, 1961) *Bo Diddley's a Twister (Checker, 1962) *Bo Diddley (Checker, 1962) References External links *Lady Bo's website Category:1940 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Bo Diddley Category:Fiorello H.

He is the President of Vertical Aerospace.  Personal life and education  Fitzpatrick was born in Belfast. He studied at Our Lady and St Patrick's College and the University of Edinburgh, where he received his master's degree in finance and business. , he lived in the Cotswolds with his wife Sophy and their three children.  Career  =Early career= In 2001, after graduating, Fitzpatrick founded The Rental Guide, a real estate advertisement business which promoted properties in Scotland online and via a free newspaper. Livewire nominated him for the Young Entrepreneur of the Year. Fitzpatrick closed the business due to concerns about its ability to scale given limited numbers of real estate agents. He moved to London to take jobs in the financial sector with Societe Generale and JP Morgan. =OVO Energy= Fitzpatrick founded OVO Energy in 2009. The company was the culmination of a five-year plan during which he received a licence from Ofgem, the UK energy regulator, and saved the £350,000 to start the business. As of July 2016, the company served 685,000 customers and employed over 1,000 people in Bristol and London. He acknowledged his inexperience with the energy market, and used the five years to study the industry; he credited the experience he gained with complex finances during those five years as critical to the company's survival. In 2014, Fitzpatrick won Entrepreneur of the Year at the National Business Awards. In 2018, Fitzpatrick led OVO Energy in the successful acquisition of one of its competitors, Spark Energy. Conflict with Big Six energy suppliers In autumn 2013, Fitzpatrick testified before Parliament's Energy and Climate Change Select Committee on the subject of rising energy prices. He testified that he could not explain why the \\"Big Six\\" energy suppliers, the six largest providers of gas and electricity in the United Kingdom, raised prices. He also noted that Ovo's prices had not increased because the wholesale cost of energy to suppliers remained unchanged. The BBC credited Fitzpatrick's testimony with being one of the drivers behind a 2014 Ofgem investigation into whether the market-dominating Big Six negatively limited competition. Use of company funds In 2014 Fitzpatrick sold OVO stock to raise £2 million or 4.5% of the company to purchase his family home. The move drew criticism from The Guardian newspaper because in the previous year the company earned only £300,000 and had £9 million in liabilities. = Imagination Industries = Fitzpatrick is the sole owner of Imagination Industries Ltd, a holding company which has OVO Energy among its subsidiaries alongside many smaller companies in retail energy supply and related businesses such as electric car charging. Three of the energy supply subsidiaries operate in Australia, France and Germany. Another subsidiary, Vertical Aerospace Ltd, develops electrically powered VTOL aircraft.  Formula One  Fitzpatrick, a self-described lifelong Formula One enthusiast, became owner of and a major investor in the Manor Marussia Formula One team in 2015, taking over after the collapse of the team's previous parent company. Partnering with former Sainsbury's executive Justin King, who joined as interim chairman but did not directly invest in the team, Fitzpatrick contributed £30 million in personal funds to Manor Marussia and re-built the team run by Graeme Lowdon and John Booth after some of its assets had been auctioned off to repay the debts. On 6 January 2017 it was reported that Manor Racing had entered administration, and were on the verge of collapsing. On 27 January 2017, the team collapsed after administrators failed to secure a sale of the business.

Biography  Portrait of Rudy Krejci 1946 in a soccer kit for Moravska Slavia, Brno, Czechoslovakia Rudy Krejci was born in Hrušky, Moravia (then Czechoslovakia) in 1929. His father, a railwayman, was a Czechoslovak who received his basic education solely in German. His mother was a Moravian- Slovak with Czech education. Krejci studied at high school in Kromeriz and Brno, where he was introduced to philosophy by professor Antonin Kriz, who translated Aristotle's work into the Czech language. His studies were terminated on May 1, 1949 due to his membership of an anticommunist dissident student group. Krejci had to go into hiding in a secret room of his father's apartment, where he stayed for five years.Dan O'Neill: Project Chariot Thoughts on History, Public Policy and Ethics, Frame of Reference, An Irregular Publication of the Alaska Humanities Forum, Vol.1, No.1, July, 1989 Documentary about Rudy Krejci on the Czech Television, published January 17, 2015 In May 1954, with the help of his father, he escaped Czechoslovakia hiding in a coffin under a coal wagon covered with vinegar and mustard, and made it to Vienna, Austria. From 1954-1959 Krejci studied at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, majoring in philosophy, psychology, Russian history and literature. In 1959 he became a Doctor of Philosophy. Krejci then went to the United States to work as an engineer for Bechtel Corporation and Bethlehem Steel, and in 1960 he was offered a contract to teach Russian and German at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. Two years later he established a Philosophy program, and 13 years after that he added a Humanities program.

In response to Krejci's opposition to the project, Krejci said that \\"Wood came to me and told me: \\"If you go on as you do now, there is only one way, one way from Alaska, direct, down to lower states.\\" As a result of Krejci's opposition, Project Chariot never happened.

Class determination ISO collects data for more than 47,000 communities and fire districts throughout the country. The data is then analyzed using a proprietary Fire Suppression Rating Schedule (FSRS). The Schedule then assigns a PPC score between 1 and 10 to the department, with Class 1 representing \\"superior property fire protection\\" and Class 10 indicating that an area doesn't meet the minimum criteria set by the ISO. On July 1, 2013, the revised FSRS was released, adding an emphasis on a community's effort to limit loss before an incident occurs. In developing a PPC, the following major categories are evaluated: *Emergency Communications: Fire alarm and communication systems, including telephone systems, telephone lines, staffing and dispatching systems. *Fire Department: The fire department, including equipment, staffing, training and geographic distraction of fire companies. *Water Supply: The water supply system, including the condition and maintenance of hydrants and the amount of available water compared with the amount need to suppress fires. Added 2013 criteria: *Fire Prevention: programs that contain plan review; certificate of occupancy inspections; compliance follow-up; inspection of fire protection equipment; and fire prevention regulations related to fire lanes on area roads, hazardous material routes, fireworks, barbecue grills, and wildland-urban interface areas. *Public Fire Safety Education Programs: fire safety education training and programs for schools, private homes and buildings with large loss potential or hazardous conditions and a juvenile fire setter intervention program. Minimum requirements To receive a PPC, a fire department must meet minimum infrastructure, staffing and equipment requirements. If a department doesn't meet at least one of the following requirements, then they are assigned a Class 10 rating. =Organization= *Formal fire department organized under state or local laws. *Must have one person responsible for the operation of the department (example: Chief). *Service area must have definite boundaries. *For departments that service multiple communities, a written contract must be present. =Membership= *The department must respond at least four firefighters to structure fires. The chief may account for one of those required positions. =Training= *The department must conduct at least two hours of training every two months for active firefighters. =Alarm notification= *There must be no delay in receiving alarms and dispatching firefighters/apparatus. =Housing= *Apparatus must have adequate housing, as to protect it from weather.

The official street names are Læderstræde (until Hyskenstræde), Kompagnistræde (until Gåsestræde) and Farvergade. The shops along the street are generally smaller and more eclectic than the flagship stores on neighbouring Strøget. It is dominated by art galleries and antique shops. It is known for its rich gay culture with lgbt-citizens, shops, bars, restaurants and coffeehouses. History Gedde's map of Copenhagen showing Læderstræde in the 1750s Læderstræde originally continued all the way to Tådhusstræde where it turned into Farvergade. The first part of the name Læderstræde does not refer to 'leather' (Danish: Læder), as the modern name would suggest, but to Ladbro, a jetty which projected from Copenhagen's first harbor at Gammel Strand. The name is first recorded in 1397 as Laadbrostrede. The name is later seen in the forms Lathbrostrede (1416), Lædherstrædet (1423), Lædærstredhet (1461) and Lederstredet (1475). Det Danske Compagni, later the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society, was based in a building at No. 16 from about 1447. The Royal Shooting Society moved to a new site outside the Western City Gates in the 1750s. A new synagogue opened in the street in 1764. Læderstræde was home to many Jewish immigrants from the early 17th century. Copenhagen's opened in Læderstræde in 1729. The building was converted into a public house by restaurateur Christian Berg in 1742 and was subsequently known as Bergs Hus (Berg's Gouse). A small temporary theatre venue opened in the synagogue's former assembly room on 16 April 1848. It was the first of its kind after theatre had once again been legalized following the pietist king Christian VI's death. It later led to the establishment of the Royal Danish Theatre on Kongens Nytorv. In 1765, the first Synagoge in Denmark was built at present day No. 16. Copenhagen Farvergade (literally \\"Dyer Street\\") takes its name after Farvergården, the royal textile dyeing plant, which was located in a courtyard off the street from 1560. Farvergården was later used as a prison before it was replaced by the Vartorv institution in 1665. The old buildings were demolished in the 1720s. The street had an infamous reputation for prostitution until this activity was prohibited in the street in 1884. Most of Læderstræde was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen fire of 1795 but rebuilt over the next few years. The Great Synagogue was later rebuilt at a new site in Krystalgade. In 1884, the last portion of Læderstræde and the first portion of Farvergade was renamed Kompagnistræde in commemoration of Det Danske Compagnie. Strædet is especially known for its rich gay culture with many lgbt citizens, shops, bars, restaurants and coffeehouses. In this area like in most parts of the city you can kiss and walk hands in hands with your partner in public without being stared at. Notable buildings and residents =Læderstræde= The large property on at the corner of Læderstræde (No. 1) and Højbro Plads (No. 4) is from 1796-1797 and was originally built for the publisher Johan Frederik Schultz. It has 20 bays on Læderstræde and 9 on the square. The corner bay which is topped by a small spire was added in about 1900. The building housed the Ministry of Environment from 1993 to 2014. It has now been converted into apartments and a Moss Copenhagen flagship store. Other listed properties in Læderstræde that date from the time immediately after the fire are No. 5, No. 7, No. 13, No. 15 and No. 36. =Kompagnistræde= Kompagnistræde 23 A few of the buildings on Kompagnistræde predate the fire of 1795. The half-timbered building at No. 23 was originally built over two storeys in 1734 but extended with an extra floor in 1739 and again in 1762. No. 25 is from 1730 but was extended with one floor in 1837. No. 31 and 33 are from 1734. The building is now home to Tortus Copenhagen, a ceramics studio run by American potter and designer Eric Landon. Farvergade viewed from Regnbuepladsen Most of the other buildings along the street are from the late 1790s and most are listed. Andreas Hallander built No. 16 and 30-32\\\\. Johan Martin Quist built No. 19. The yellow Kompagnihuset building at No. 39 was built as a brewery in 1803. The brewery had until then been located at Vandkunsten 8 on the other side of the block. This building was instead converted into a new residence for the brewer. The two bays to the right date from an expansion in 1850. =Farvergade= Farvergade is dominated by the large Vartorv complex.

Hope Booth (1878 − December 15, 1933) was a vaudeville, burlesque, and theatre actress. Life Booth was born in Toronto and was the daughter of William Beresford Hope, who was a member of the Canadian parliament for South Ontario. Her first marriage was to James A. B. Earll. After her second marriage, to Renold Wolf, a drama critic, in Yonkers, New York on February 4, 1903, she changed her name to \\"Hope Booth Wolf.\\" She toured with the companies of Daniel Frohman and Mrs. Fiske, appearing in \\"The Little Blond Lady\\", a piece by George M.

She divorced Mr. Wolf in 1910 on the grounds of \\"abandonment\\". According to a press report, dated in December 28, 1909 from Gilliams Press Syndicate: \\"Mr. Wolf abandoned his wife in August of 1909.

She died at the Monroe Hotel, on 23rd St and Third Avenue in New York, where she reportedly had not left her room for years. She was living there with Lawrence W. Thomas, her third husband. By all accounts Hope Booth had a remarkable career in vaudeville, spanning at least 15 years (from 1893-1909). Hope Booth appeared on the cover of the New England Home Magazine in August 1893, during the height of her career. However she was not without her various detractors.

He was formerly the Chief Executive Officer of Snowflake Computing, a data warehousing startup. Muglia is known for managing divisions at Microsoft that supported the Microsoft Office Suite, Windows Server and MSN Network product families. He was one of four presidents that reported directly to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Muglia held several executive positions at Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2011. He worked briefly for Juniper Networks, then accepted his position as CEO of Snowflake Computing in June 2014. Early life Bob Muglia was born in 1959 in Connecticut. His father was an automotive parts salesman. Muglia started working at his first job when he was 15 years old. He moved to Michigan and earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1981. After graduating, he started working for ROLM Corporation. Career =Microsoft= Windows and business software Bob Muglia started his Microsoft career in 1988. He was the first product manager for SQL Server. Muglia also served as the director of Windows NT Program Management and User Education. He was promoted to vice president of the Windows NT division in October 1995. Muglia later held the position of vice president of the Server Application group, until he was promoted to senior vice president of the Applications and Tools group in February 1998. Bob Muglia was influential in a corporate restructuring at Microsoft in 1999, which assigned business divisions to customer types, rather than technologies. As part of the re- structuring, Muglia became head of the business-productivity group, which oversaw Microsoft Office, Exchange and other business software. According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed developers to visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led other efforts to incorporate customer input into product development at Microsoft. Muglia testified in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. antitrust lawsuit, and in a case between Microsoft and Sun Microsystems regarding Microsoft's use of Java. According to New York Times reporters Steve Lohr and Koel Brinkley, the judge embarrassed Muglia by rebuking him for his persistent characterization of an email from Bill Gates. Muglia also negotiated aggressively with RealNetworks, regarding an antitrust dispute between the two companies. In August 2000, Muglia was appointed to vice president of a new .NET Services Group. The following year he was reassigned to focus on database technologies as senior vice president of the Enterprise Storage Services Group. He helped develop Microsoft's plan for autonomic computing, which was announced in March 2003. By early 2004, Muglia held the position of senior vice president of the Windows Server Division. Servers and tools division Another re-organization at Microsoft in 2005 resulted in Muglia taking the position of Senior Vice President of Servers and Tools before being promoted to president of the division in 2009. This made Muglia one of four presidents at Microsoft. During his tenure, the business group grew its revenues more than ten percent each year for six years. The division accounted for more than 20 percent of Microsoft's revenues by January 2009. In this position, Muglia led Microsoft's ten-year plan for data center and desktop automation products, its Dynamic Systems Initiative and its Dynamic IT strategy. In October 2010, developers criticized Muglia for suggesting Microsoft would put less emphasis on Silverlight; a statement he later retracted. Muglia announced his resignation from Microsoft in January 2011; he was replaced by Satya Nadella, now Microsoft's CEO. He was the fourth executive reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to resign between early 2010 and 2011. According to Financial Times, Ballmer credited Muglia for growing the servers and tools division, but implied the departure was related to disagreements between the two executives about the company's cloud computing strategy. =Juniper= In July 2011, a few months prior to Muglia's last day at Microsoft, Juniper Networks announced it would hire Muglia as the executive vice president of its software division. He reported to then Juniper CEO Kevin Johnson, who (along with other Juniper staff) is also a former Microsoft executive. Muglia was hired to consolidate Juniper's software groups under a new division called Software Solutions. He also helped develop Juniper's software-defined networking (SDN) strategy. In December 2013 Muglia quit Juniper, a month after Shaygan Kheradpir was appointed as the company's new CEO. Several other Juniper executives also left around this time. =Snowflake computing= Bob Muglia was Chief Executive Officer of Snowflake Computing, a cloud-based data-warehousing startup until April 2019. He joined the company in June 2014, a couple years after it was founded in 2012. Snowflake Computing came out of stealth mode that October.

Tripartite synapses occur at a number of locations in the central nervous system with astrocytes and may also exist with Muller glia of retinal ganglion cells and Schwann cells at the neuromuscular junction. The term was first introduced in the late 1990s to account for a growing body of evidence that glia are not merely passive neuronal support cells but, instead, play an active role in the integration of synaptic information through bidirectional communication with the neuronal components of the synapse as mediated by neurotransmitters and gliotransmitters.  Evidence of the Tripartite Synapse  Evidence for the role of astrocytes in the integration and processing of synaptic integration presents itself in a number of ways: *Astrocytes are excitable cells: In response to stimuli from any of the three components of the tripartite synapse, astrocytes are capable of producing transient changes in their intracellular calcium concentrations through release of calcium stores from the endoplasmic reticulum *Astrocytes communicate bidirectionally with neurons: Through changes in their calcium concentration excitability, astrocytes are able to detect neurotransmitters and other signals released from neurons at the synapse and can release their own neurotransmitters or gliotransmitters that are, in turn, capable of modifying the electrophysiological excitability of neurons. *Astrocytes are capable of responding selectively to stimuli: Astrocytes of the hippocampal stratum oriens form tripartite synapses with axonal projections from the alveus. The alveus projections can form either glutamatergic or cholinergic synapses with the stratum oriens, but the astrocytes of this region respond with changes in calcium concentration only to cholinergic activation of alveus projections. This is not merely due to a sensitivity of these astrocytes exclusive to acetylcholine, as they will also respond to glutamatergic synaptic activity originating from a different brain region, the Schaffer collateral. *Astrocytes integrate and modulate information from their synaptic inputs: Astrocytic calcium concentration changes in response to simultaneous stimulation by two neurotransmitter types is not always a linear summation (a linear summation being an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the astrocyte in response to two simultaneous stimuli that would be the equivalent of adding the calcium concentration changes that would occur in response to each stimulation individually) of the effects of each individual input but varies by the transmitter combinations as well as frequency of stimulation. The hippocampal stratum oriens astrocytes, which respond to synaptic activity from glutamatergic neurons originating in the Schaffer collateral and cholinergic neurons originating in the alveus, produce changes in their intracellular calcium concentrations that is non-linear with the strength of synaptic input. Additionally, these same stimuli are capable of producing either a potentiated calcium concentration response at low frequencies of stimulation or a depressed calcium concentration response at high frequencies of stimulation.

It was given its nickname in honor of the Norwegian astrophysicist Sjur Refsdal, who, in 1964, first proposed using time-delayed images from a lensed supernova to study the expansion of the universe. The observations were made using the Hubble Space Telescope. Einstein cross The host galaxy of SN Refsdal is at a redshift of 1.49, corresponding to a comoving distance of 14.4 billion light-years and a lookback time of 9.34 billion years. The multiple images are arranged around the elliptical galaxy at z = 0.54 in a cross-shaped pattern, also known as an \\"Einstein cross\\". Reappearance thumbcenter600pxThe image to the left shows a part of the deep field observation of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 from the Frontier Fields programme. The circle indicates the predicted position of the newest appearance of the supernova. To the lower right the Einstein cross event from late 2014 is visible. The image on the top right shows observations by Hubble from October 2015, taken at the beginning of the observation programme to detect the newest appearance of the supernova. The image on the lower right shows the discovery of the Refsdal Supernova on 11 December 2015, as predicted by several different models. After the discovery of the Refsdal Supernova, astronomers predicted that they would have the rare opportunity to see the supernova again in about one year, after the four images had faded away. This is because the initially observed four-image pattern was only one component of the lensing display. The supernova may have appeared as a single image some 40–50 years ago elsewhere in the cluster field. The supernova Refsdal reappeared punctually at the predicted position between mid-November 2015 and December 11, 2015 (with the exact date being uncertain by approximately one month which is the interval between two consecutive Hubble observations), in excellent agreement with the blind model predictions made before the reappearance was observed. The time delay between the original quadruplet observed in 2014 and the latest appearance of the supernova in 2015 was used to infer the value of the Hubble constant. This is the first time this technique, originally suggested by Refsdal, has been applied to supernovae.

Applying category management to purchasing activity benefits organisations by providing an approach to reduce the cost of buying goods and services, reduce risk in the supply chain, increase overall value from the supply base and gain access to more innovation from suppliers. It is a strategic approach which focuses on the vast majority of organisational spend. If applied effectively throughout an entire organisation, the results can be significantly greater than traditional transactional based purchasing negotiations, however the discipline of category management is sorely misunderstood. The concept of Category Management in purchasing originated in the late 1980s. There is no single founder or originator, but the methodology first appeared in the automotive sector and has since been developed and adopted by organisations worldwide. Today Category Management is considered by many global companies as an essential strategic purchasing approach. Category Management has been defined as “an evolving methodology that drives sourcing strategy in progressive organisations today”.\\"Five Best Practices for Category Management\\", Justin Falgione et al., Inside Supply Management, August 2008 The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply defines Category Management as: :\\"Organizing the resources of the procurement team in such a way as to focus externally onto the supply markets of an organisation (as against having a focus on the internal customers or on internal Procurement departmental functions) in order to fully leverage purchasing decisions”.CIPS Knowledge Works: Category Management, July 2007 Jonathan O'Brien, author of Category Management in Purchasing, defines Category Management as: :\\"the practice of segmenting the main areas of organisational spend on bought-in goods and services into discrete groups of products and services according to the function of those goods or services and, most importantly, to mirror how individual marketplaces are organised. Using this segmentation organisations work cross functionally on individual categories, examining the entire category spend, how the organisation uses the products or services within the category, the marketplace and individual suppliers.\\"O'Brien, J., Category Management in Purchasing, Second Edition (2012), Kogan Page, London, E-ESBN 978 0 7494 6499 8 Mark Webb of Future Purchasing makes three statements in defining Category Management: :\\"It is a strategic end-to-end process for buying goods and services; it aligns business goals and customer requirements with supply market capability and it maximises long-term value for the organisation.\\" http://www.futurepurchasing.com/blog/2014/02/07/is-category- management-more-than-just-strategic-sourcing Peter Hunt, partner at ADR International, writes :“the term category management can mean different things to different people, so a working definition is needed. A ‘category’ is the logical grouping of similar expenditure items, such as spend on advertising agency services or IT hardware. Category management is the sourcing process used to manage these categories to satisfy business needs while maximising the value delivered from the supply base”.'Category management explained\\", Supply Management, 30 January 2003, accessed 26.5.2011. Many public sector organisations have recently adopted category management as a strategic transformation tool. Sir Philip Green, in his “Efficiency Review” of UK government spending, recommended that “centralised procurement [should be] mandated for common categories to leverage ... buying power and achieve best practice”.Sir Philip Green, Efficiency Review by Sir Philip Green , accessed 13.6.2011 In the United States, the federal General Services Administration, working with the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), adopted Category Management as an operational tool for purchasing in April 2014.http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2014/04/09/the- future-fas-categorically-the-right-thing-to-do-for-taxpayers/ , accessed 6.3.2015 References Category:Management by type ","title":"Category management (purchasing)"},{"id":"45590556","text":"Philadelphus pekinensis (mock orange, 太平花 tai ping hua) is a species of deciduous shrub, high, endemic to northern and western China and Korea, with fragrant flowers up to 1\\" across in small clusters.

Claire believes they like her but through Mitchell she realizes that they only see her as their boss and not as a friend. When Jay gives Claire a list of things she has to say to the employees that will insult them and she does not feel well to do, Mitchell takes the list and does it himself not caring if everyone starts disliking him again.

Though he loves Stella, Jay has no choice but to take her away from home till they know the truth about Joe's allergic rash.

They closed their review by labeling the episode as \\"a great return episode after a little hiatus\\". Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection rated the episode with 7.6/10 saying \\"This week, the show focuses in on what works better: simple comedy that interconnects the generations. It still feels bland but at least it scares up a laugh or two in the process. [...] The result is an episode that draws a shrug from the unlucky viewer. Modern Family once created strong buzz and gave us strong, relatable characters we loved (and sometimes loved to hate). Now it feels like it’s churning through the motions, having run out of anything useful to say about them.\\" Nora Williamson from TV and Film Review gave a mixed review to the episode saying that \\"...[the episode] had a few good moments, but otherwise I thought the episode could have been a lot funnier. I also don’t like it when the story lines are quite separate. I know that the three families can’t spend every episode together, but when they do, that is when Modern Family is at its best. [...] \\"Rash Decisions\\" definitely has some witty lines and funny moments but I just know that Modern Family can do so much better.

After Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) protests, Cameron is up to find a mutual solution that ends up being him singing \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" and Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) yelling, dressed in a karate gi. Mitchell quickly comes to learn that the only reason Cameron is skeptical toward Lily’s performance is because of his nemesis, Andrew (Jeremy Scott Johnson), who will attend the talent show as well, to support his child. Mitchell puts the foot down and decides that Lily will be performing at the talent show, with or without Cameron’s support. At the talent show, after a powerful performance by Lily's classmate and Andrew revoking his daughter from the show, the couple decides to repeal Lily’s performance as well.

The soldiers died on the battleground of Garrison Hill in the tennis court area of the Deputy Commissioner's residence. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which maintains this cemetery among many others in the world, there are 1,420 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War at this cemetery, and a memorial to an additional 917 Hindu and Sikh soldiers who were cremated in accordance with their faith. The memorial was inaugurated by Field Marshal Sir William Slim, then Commander of the 14th Army in Burma. Location Entrance to the cemetery The Kohima War Cemetery is located in the center of Kohima city, capital of the Indian state of Nagaland, at the location where a decisive battle was won by the Allied Forces during the Second World War, forcing the Japanese army to retreat. This location is on the ridge below and above the tennis court. The cemetery is on the northern side of the Imphal- Dimapur road (State Highway 39) and from the Indo-Burma border. Kohima is well-connected by air services from Calcutta, Delhi, and Guwahati. On land, the journey from Guwahati is long and arduous. History In March 1944, the Japanese 15th Army attacked the British troops stationed in Kohima and Imphal in northeast India with intent to prevent an attack on Burma. In the first week of April, the Japanese attacked at Kohima and Imphal via Mizoram from the Indo-Burma border, to destroy the supply bases of the British. They laid siege on the Allied forces stationed at Kohima and also at Imphal. Reaching Kohima during April 1944, the Japanese 15th Army occupied a strategic location on Garrison Hill and continually attacked a small contingent of the Commonwealth forces, which successfully held their ground until reinforcements were brought in. In the battle at the tennis ground (now marked by white concrete lines) of the Deputy Commissioner's bungalow (which was destroyed during the war), which also involved hand-to-hand fighting between the opposing forces, the Commonwealth forces prevailed over the Japanese forces and forced them to retreat in defeat. There were heavy casualties on both sides. This battle was the turning point for the Allied forces. In 2013, the British National Army Museum voted the Battle of Imphal and Kohima as \\"Britain's Greatest Battle\\". Description The stone memorial with the Kohima Epitaph Kohima Cemetery with view of Kohima town The cemetery is set in peaceful surroundings with well-manicured grassland in which roses bloom in season. The cemetery is sited at the exact location where the battle was fought, and provides a panoramic view of the town of Kohima. It is marked at its two ends by tall, concrete structures engraved with the cross.} Between the two structures, along the sloping ground, a series of terraces of in height have been created; these contain stone markers embedded with bronze plaques carrying the name of each Commonwealth soldier who died on the Kohima battlefield. These markers are made distinctly visible by a white wash. There are two memorial crosses, one at the upper end and the other at the lower end of the cemetery. The upper-end memorial is located at the highest end of the cemetery. It commemorates the names of the Indian and Sikh soldiers (917 Hindu and Sikh soldiers who had been cremated as per their religious rites) who were part of the British Indian Army and died on the battlefield. The epitaph inscribed on this memorial reads: The lower-end memorial is dedicated to the 2nd Division. It is a tall, massive stone (similar to the stone used by the Naga tribes to mark the graves of their dead) fixed over a dressed stone platform. This stone was originally located on a spur at Maram, to the south of Kohima, which was then shifted with the help of Naga people to be erected at the 2nd British Division's war cemetery. While the top part of the memorial is marked with a cross, at the lower part lies a bronze plate that carries an epitaph. The epitaph, titled Kohima Epitaph, reads: The above verse, which became world- famous, is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875–1958) and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph written by Simonides to honour the Spartans who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.. Another notable feature at the site is a cherry tree near the tennis court where the battle was fought, where a small brass plaque reads: The original tree, from which a branch has been used to create the present tree where the plaque is fixed, had been used for target practice by the Japanese forces. It was destroyed during the battle. Hence, Kohima Battle is also known as the \\"Battle Under the Cherry Tree\\". Close to the Garrison Hill, memorials for the 2nd Battalion, the Dorsetshire Regiment, and several other regiments have been established. In the list of the dead marked by stones at the cemetery, there are 64 names of Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders soldiers; the memorial, however, lists 96 names, out of which the graves of 32 were located. Memorial service On the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2005, a memorial service was held at the Kohima War Cemetery attended by 41 members of the Royal British Legion. Brigadier John Farmer, representing the Royal British Legion, and Brigadier RL Sharma of the 2nd Assam Rifles, laid wreaths at the memorial. Reverend Dr Neiliezhü Üsou, officiating chaplain, conducted the memorial service. A notable pilgrim to the memorial was Hildra Martin Smith, aged 84, who came in a wheelchair; he had participated in the Kohima battle as a Lieutenant of the British Army. The visit was initiated by the Royal British Legion of the United Kingdom, which regularly sponsors such war grave pilgrimages. Ten years later another memorial service was held in the cemetery, attended by senior British Army officers, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Kohima.

The clock-tower was built in 1870 and stood there until its partial collapse and subsequent demolition in 1950s. The term \\"Chandni Chowk\\" (translation: silvery or moonlit square) originally referred to this location which later came to designate the entire street. The Ghantaghar location has been regarded as the center of Delhi, and even now serves as a center for major civic events. Today, it is an open and congested area. The Delhi Town Hall is located just to the north of this site. It was perhaps the oldest clock tower in India, constructed before Rajabai Clock Tower, Mumbai, 1878, Husainabad Clock Tower, Lucknow, 1881, Secunderabad Clock Tower, Secunderabad, 1897 and Allahabad Clock Tower, Allahabad, 1913. While the clock tower is long gone, the location is still termed Ghantaghar within Old Delhi. Ghantaghar was the location of some of the events relating to the Indian's freedom movement. On 30 March 1919, many protesters were killed by the British soldiers. It is still a very popular spot for organizing protests. Jahanara Begum's caravanserai that formed the original Chandni Chowk, from Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalf's 1843 album The Caravanserai and Town Hall The old city of Delhi was laid out by princess Jahanara Begum, who constructed an elegant caravanserai on the East side of the street with gardens in the back. Herbert Charles Fanshawe, in 1902, mentions about the serai: \\"Proceeding up the Chandni Chauk and passing many shops of the principal dealers in jewels, embroideries, and other products of Delhi handicrafts, the Northbrook Clock Tower and the principal entrance to the Queen's Gardens are reached. The former is situated at the site of the Karavan Sarai of the Princess Jahanara Begum (p. 239), known by the title of Shah Begum. The Sarai, the square in front of which projected across the street, was considered by Bernier one of the finest buildings in Delhi and was compared by him with the Palais Royal, because of its arcades below and rooms with a gallery in front above. Bernier was of opinion that the population of Delhi in 1665 was much the same as that of Paris, a striking instance of how the population follows the court in the East. The gardens must at one time have been extremely beautiful specimens of eastern pleasure retreats, and even now are very pretty.\\" The serai was demolished perhaps even before the ghadar of 1857. The serai was replaced by the Victorian-Edwardian architecture building now known as the Town Hall, and the pool in the middle of the square was replaced by a grand clock tower. The Town Hall was actually planned before the Revolt, and was built in 1860-5, as a center for the Europeans and was initially called the Lawrence Institute. The Institute contained a Darbar Hall with a public library and reading rooms. According to MCD, the Town Hall had been planned to serve as an office for the municipality, chamber of commerce, a literary society and a museum to ‘improve the local minds and to forward intercourse between Europeans and natives.’ \\"A street scene in the Imperial City,\\" photo by Jadu Kissen, acquired by a visitor in 1910, as viewed from Nai Sarak The Northbrook Clock tower In front of Lawrence Institute, in the center of the Chandni Chauk, a 128 feet tall lofty Gothic clock-tower with four faces were constructed. Built by Delhi Municipality at a cost of Rs. 28,000, it was formally termed the Northbrook Clocktower. after Thomas Northbrook, the Viceroy of India from 1872 to 1876. Northbrook hotel, a famous hotel near the Moree gate was also named after him. The tower is said to have been 80 years old when it collapsed, implying its construction occurred in 1870. It was actually standing in 1870 already according to Alfred Harcourt who wrote in 1870:The New Guide to Delhi, Alfred Frederick Pollock Harcourt, Edition 2, Published 1870, p.21 :Facing the Delhi Institute on the Chandni Chowk side, is a handsome and well-finished Clock Tower with four faces, and a chime of five bells. The City is indebted for this useful as well as ornamental structure also to the Municipal Committee at a cost of Rupees 25,500. It is 128 feet above the ground. It is said that the pigeons sat on their hands so that it never showed the correct time. When Lord Northbrook visited Delhi, he did not quite like the architecture.The Delhi Omnibus, Thomas George Percival Spear, Narayani Gupta, Robert Eric Frykenberg, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 86] Statue of Queen Victoria Inside the railings of the street a Statue of Queen Victoria, the late Queen Empress of India was placed by Mr. James Skinner, a grandson of Colonel Skinner, C.B. in front of the Municipal building.

The upper part of the tower collapsed in 1950, killing some local citizens. That resulted in a court case Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Subhagwanti, AlR 1966 SC 1750 Mr. Chakravarty, the Municipal Engineer, mentioned that the building was 80 years old and the expected life of the structure of the top story, considering the type of mortar used, could be only 40 to 45 years, and the surviving middle story could be saved for another 10 years. The High Court also took into consideration the statement of a Mr. Puri that when he inspected the building after the collapse and examined the mortar, he found that the mortar was reduced to powder without any cementing properties. The Municipal Corporation later allocated 2 lakh in 1957 for rebuilding, however, the structure had come to be known as an English relic, and thus it was never rebuilt.  Legacy The clock tower in Sabzi Mandi, Ramrup Tower, 1941, was inspired by the Ghantaghar tower, and it survives to this day. In popular culture An old song recalls the clocktower (ghantaghar) that once stood in the center, and India's freedom struggle ( video search): घंटाघर की चार घड़ी, चारों में ज़ंजीर पड़ी, जब भी घंटा बजता था, खड़ा मुसाफिर हंसता था। हँसता था वो बेधड़क आगे देखो नयी सड़क  नयी सड़क पर बुआ बाजरा आगे देखो शहर शाहदरा  शहर शाहदरा में लग गयी आग आगे देखो गजियाबाद  गजियाबाद में फूटा अंडा उसमे से निकला तिरंगा झंडा  झन्डे से आई आवाज़ इंक़लाब ज़िन्दाबाद  It recalls the satyagrah by Swami Shraddhanand in the 1930s near the Ghantaghar. Close the site, now his statue marks the event. The events are recalled in Ek Delhi Aur by Rajendra Sharma in the voice of a kan-mailya (ear cleaners of old Delhi) When film producer B.R.

Her works often explore the social and gender issues facing lesbians in Mexico. Cuevas's videos and films have screened at Sundance, New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, She is one of the first videoartists in Mexico that was legitimized by cultural institutions. Her films have been shown in festivals such as Sundance, New York Film Festival, and the touring film series, Mexperimental Cinema. Among her noted works is a 1993 video clip entitled Corazon Sangrante. Her works has also being shown in art institutions such as Berkeley Art Museum, Contemporary Art Museum of San Diego, Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporáneo de la Ciudad de México, New York's Guggenheim Museum and Museum of Modern Art, which in 2001 added nine of her works to their video collection.  Biography  Ximena Cuevas was born in 1963 in Mexico City. She is the second daughter of the marriage of Bertha Riestra., a psychologist and cultural promoter and José Luis Cuevas, a visual artist, whom had great influence in the on the early education of Ximena: “as a small child I was next to his drawing table, fascinated to see all those lines with their own life somehow(...)” After living with her family different places such as Mexico City, Cuernavaca, Paris, and New York, Cuevas decided work in cinema, first as an assistant and later on, she continued to work with directors such as Konstantinos Costa-Gavras, John Schlesinger, John Houston, and Arturo Ripstein. In 1979 she began working at the Cineteca Nacional National Film Archive in Mexico City repairing films by cutting scenes censored by the government. This experience inspired her interest in film and the moving image. At the beginning of the 80s, motivated by the path open by Pola Weiss, Andrea di Castro y Sarah Minter, Cuevas started to consider experimental cinema a possibility for her artistic exploration, founding the collective Cosa Nostra in the 90s along with Rafael Curquidi, Doménico Campelo, Eduardo Vélez, and others, this was a kind of “intervention mafia” that pretended to insert film situations out of context. After the projection in the Anthropology Museum in September 1992, this group was critically acclaimed by the writer Jorge Ayala Blanco on his article “Viva el Post Cine”. This experiences guided by the desire of play had the logical consequence of a unique video language. The work of Cuevas is recognized as a relevant contribution to the context of the last two decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, particularly in Mexico. Often her work is a commentary on culture, politics and social issues using irony, exploring this from a feminist perspective an women's role in contemporary society. Lesbianism and gender identity are also recurrent themes in her work. Besides her artist career, she has also worked in production, coordination, and editing with Marcela Fernández Violante (for whom Ximena edited the short De cuerpo presente, 1997), Jesusa Rodriguez (Víctimas del Pecado Neoliberal, 1995) and Astrid Hadaad (Las Reinas Chulas], and in 2015, by invitation of Isela Vega, to work on the 40 year homage of the work by singer Juan Gabriel, a referent on Mexican popular culture. Since 2011 Cuevas lives on and off in the state of Guerrero and has been heavily involved in environmental conservation efforts with sea turtles.  Work  Cuevas has been recognized as a significant contributor to videography by the Mexican government. Many of her films offer social commentary on corruption and its impact on culture, society and politics and explore from a feminist perspective the place of women in society. Lesbianism and its societal portrayal is also a recurring theme. Beginning in 1990, after becoming disillusioned with traditional films being made both nationally and internationally, Cuevas purchased a camera and began producing her own films. She has received scholarships from the Mexican National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA), the Fideicomiso para la Cultura México (Trust for Mexican Culture), an Eastman Kodak Worldwide Independent Filmmaker Production Grant among others and has made presentations at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and the Guggenheim of New York and Bilbao, Spain. Cuevas' work is most known for its subtle irony of evaluating contemporary society and exposing the incongruity between social customs and beliefs versus the reality of living using a combination of truth and fiction. She deconstructs myths of the \\"typical middle-class Mexican family\\", heteronormative relationships, concepts of beauty, through parody of the ridiculousness of their traditional portrayal in popular culture. In her own words, her videos uncover the \\"half lies\\" of the collective Mexican imagination. The Sundance Film Festival, New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the touring film series, Mexperimental Cinema, have all been venues for screenings of Cuevas' films. Among her noted works is the 1993 video clip entitled \\"Corazon Sangrante\\" which received recognition as a Tatu de Oro (Golden Tattoo) best music video. In 2011, Cuevas announced that she would no longer be making films of social commentary, but instead was working on a project in Guerrero dedicated to the conservation of sea turtles. Awards She has received many awards, including a Certificate of Merit from the Chicago International Film Festival of 1993, the Barbara Aronofsky Latham Memorial Award in 2001 and an award as the Best Experimental Video from the 18th San Antonio Film Festival in 2012. In 2001, the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired nine of Cuevas' videos for its permanent collection, which was the first time a Mexican video artist's work had been included in MoMA's collection. A total of twenty-four of her videos are in MoMA's collection.

She has popularized \\"street art\\" in the streets of Kabul and has exhibited her art in several countries including India, Iran, Germany, United States of America, Switzerland, Vietnam, Norway, Denmark, Turkey, and Italy, Canada, and in diplomatic missions in Kabul. Hassani paints graffiti in Kabul to bring awareness to the war years. In 2014, Hassani was named one of FP's top 100 global thinkers. Biography Graffiti at Darul Aman Palace, Kabul, Afghanistan 330x330px Hassani was born in 1988 and spent her childhood in Iran; her parents had temporarily immigrated there, from Kandahar, Afghanistan during the war. Hassani showed interest in painting from a young age. While in the ninth grade, Hassani lacked access to art classes, as it was not permitted to Afghans in Iran. Upon her return to Kabul in 2005, she pursued a degree at Kabul University in arts. Shamsia holds a BA degree in Painting and a master's degree in Visual Arts from Kabul University in Afghanistan. She later began lecturing and eventually became the associate professor of Drawing and Anatomy Drawing at Kabul University, establishing Berang Arts, a contemporary art collective. Creating colorful graffiti, Hassani works to mask the negativity of war. She claims that, \\"image has more effect than words, and it's a friendly way to fight.\\" She also uses her art to fight for women's rights, reminding people of the tragedies women have faced and continue to face in Afghanistan. Hassani studied the art of graffiti in Kabul in December 2010 during a workshop hosted by Chu, a graffiti artist from the United Kingdom. Following the workshop, Hassani began to practice street art on walls in the streets of Kabul. Because graffiti supplies are cheaper than supplies for traditional art forms, Hassani chose to continue with the art form. One of her works is on the walls of Kabul's Cultural Centre, and features a burqa clad woman seated below a stairway. The inscription below it reads (in English), \\"The water can come back to a dried-up river, but what about the fish that died?\\" In order to avoid public harassment and claims of her work being \\"un-Islamic\\", she completes her work quickly (within 15 minutes).  War and burqas  In 2013 she told Art Radar: \\"I want to colour over the bad memories of war on the walls, and if I colour over these bad memories, then I erase [war] from people's minds. I want to make Afghanistan famous for its art, not its war,\\" Hassani mainly depicts stylized, monumental images of women wearing burqas. According to the artist,\\"I want to show that women have returned to Afghan society with a new, stronger shape. It's a new woman. A woman who is full of energy, who wants to start again.\\" In an interview, Hassani explained, \\"I believe there are many who forget all the tragedy women face in Afghanistan; that is why I use my paintings as a means to remind the people. I want to highlight the matter in the society, with paintings reflecting women in burqas everywhere. And I try to show them bigger than what they are in reality, and in modern forms, shaped in happiness, movement, maybe stronger. I try to make people look at them differently.\\" As a female street artist, Hassani is often harassed: \\"It is very dangerous for a girl to paint in the streets in Kabul,\\" she says; \\"Sometimes people come and harass me; they don't think it is allowed in Islam for a woman to stand in the street and do graffiti.\\"  Digital art  Hassani is also involved in presenting this art work in a digital format through her project titled \\"Dreaming Graffiti.\\" This presentation is made in a series in which she paints or \\"photoshops colors and images onto digital photographs to explore issues of national and personal security\\".

Rajkumari was the first published Indian woman from the Caribbean and although she never wore the term \\"feminist,\\" her life's work contributed to this movement in her hemisphere of the world, in addition to her advancement of a national Guyanese culture of integration while still upholding Indian culture within this new mold. Her iconic poem, \\"Per Ajie,\\" epitomizes the journey of Indians to the Caribbean, through the eyes of an Indo-Caribbean visualizing her paternal great-grandmother making the voyage on one of the historic migratory ships headed for Guyana. It was written in a Shakespearean style of language, in order to elevate the topic of Indian indentureship into circles of serious literary critique. Another piece, \\"I See Bent Figures,\\" describes the struggles and achievements of indentured Indians laboring on plantations in the Caribbean. Singh's work is an important part of the early Hindu Caribbean literary canon, with her poem \\"No More Kitchrie for the Groom\\" shedding light on the shared responsibility of families and communities for the well-being of daughters, and the abuse of the Hindu tradition of dowry. Another of her poems \\"Deepavali,\\" is a picturesque piece documenting Diwali rituals in the Caribbean. Rajkumari was also a dramatist whose work has been described as lively and polemical. A \\"critic of Indian racial chauvinism and gender oppression\\", she was a key member of the British Guiana Dramatic Society during the period from 1929 to 1947. Her essay \\"I am a Coolie\\" takes a word which at first connoted something negative and turns it into a concept of positive cultural identity. In the 1970s, she founded The Messenger Group, a Guyanese literary collective created to foster and nurture Indo-Caribbean artists and writers. Those mentored within this group include Mahadai Das, Rooplall Monar, Henry Muttoo, and Gushka Kisson, among others. In fact, Das' poem \\"They Came in Ships\\" relays the immigrant message of \\"Per Ajie.\\" Also a broadcaster on Radio Demerara, Rajkumari wrote several radio plays and on-air programs for \\"Broadcast to Schools.\\" Rajkumari was a Wordsworth McAndrew Award Laureate (2002) and was also honored with Guyana's Arrow of Achievement (1970). Rajkumari hailed from and proliferated a lineage of arts and activism. Her father was Dr. Jung Bahadur Singh, OBE, a politician, doctor, and philanthropist involved in various groundbreaking institutions and movements in Guyana around a critical time before the nation gained independence. J. B. Singh was a founding member and president of the British Guiana East Indian Association and with his wife, Rajkumari's mother Alice Bhagwandai Singh, was also pivotal in the evolution of Indo-Caribbean theatre, as they were co- founders of the British Guiana Dramatic Society, which produced plays with an Indo-Caribbean cast and crew. Over in Suriname, Rajkumari's maternal grandfather, Seetal Prashad was a renowned champion of Indian rights. Rajkumari, crippled by polio from the age of six, had eight children, and continuing the family legacy of arts and activism, her son, Karna Singh, is an author and cultural historian, and her son Gora Singh, was the Caribbean's most highly acclaimed kathak dance exponent and founder of The Rajkumari Cultural Center, a New York-based non-profit cultural organization. Her daughter, Pritha, is a dramatist and playwright, and her daughters Chitra and Radha are musicians, composers, vocalists and recording artists.

The single, released by Atco Records, became the band's only Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when it peaked at number 17. It would later reappear on the group's 1968 studio album, The Rose Garden. \\"Next Plane to London\\" became one of the most memorable one-hit wonders of the late sixties, yet has never been recorded by another prominent group, apart from an unreleased demo by the band They Might Be Giants.Secondhandsongs.com: Next Plane to London versions History The band's first incarnation was as the Blokes, a Byrds-inspired band. The Blokes recorded their own material, but became known for promoting a single by professional musicians who went under the name, The Giant Sunflower. The single, \\"February Sunshine\\", became a Los Angeles hit, and the Blokes became known as The Giant Sunflower for a couple of weeks to perform the song in their live act. The Blokes recorded demos with Charlie Greene, and Brian Stone when it was announced they needed a new name. As guitarist John Noreen states, \\"Everything was 'flower power' at that time, so The Rose Garden made sense\\". Under the new band name, the group recorded numerous demos in search of the one song to become their debut single. At first, their efforts appeared in vain until their promoter, Pat Pipolo, put managers Greene and Stone in contact with songwriter Kenny Gist Jr.. Gist Jr.'s composition, \\"Next Plane to London\\", was chosen to be recorded as the A-side to the debut single. =Recording and release= Recording commenced in Nashville Recording Studios in Hollywood under a time-constrained schedule. Noreen was unable to create a guitar solo in time for recording, so Greene and Stone suggested that the signature \\"airport voice\\" be put in its place. Don Elliot, a program director for KBLA Radio, was brought in to record the voice on a Neumann microphone. The melodies were basic 1-4-5 chord progressions with some well-placed minor chords in the refrain and bridges. Lead vocals were performed by Diana Di Rose, notable for her lower-toned vocals, with James Groshong and Nareen joining for three-way harmonies. The overall style was reminiscent of Gene Clark, who offered the band two of his own compositions in their past demo recordings. Lyrically, the song narrates a story of a female- musician on her way to London in search of fame. On the way, she misses her lover, whom she hopes does not get his heart broken from her departure. For the B-side, the band choose \\"Flower Town\\", which was a part of their early demos that was then re-recorded. \\"Next Plane to London\\" b/w \\"Flower Town\\" entered the Hot 100 on October 21, 1967, at number 91. It first appeared on KBLA Radio, one of the earliest FM radio stations. More than two months later, on December 30, 1967, the single reached its peak position at number 17, the same day that the band lip-synced the two tracks from the record on American Bandstand. Following extensive touring in the Southwest, the song was featured as the opening track for the band's debut album, The Rose Garden. The album was released in April 1968. A French cover version of the song (\\"Je vais à Londres\\") was released in Canada in 1968 by Renée Martel.

It is sold under the name EnteraGam. EnteraGam (SBI) is intended for the dietary management of chronic diarrhea and loose stools. It must be administered under medical supervision. It is used to manage chronic loose or frequent stools in any condition or disease where diarrhea is chronically present, such as in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), recurrent Clostridium difficile-infection associated diarrhea, microscopic colitis or HIV-related enteropathy as well as many other diseases and conditions resulting in chronic diarrhea. EnteraGam is manufactured by Entera Health and distributed by RedHill Biopharma. The overall AE rate (Adverse Events rate) is less than 0.4%. The most common AEs reported by patients administered EnteraGam include mild constipation (23), headache (13), mild diarrhea (11), nausea (8), abdominal pain (8), abdominal distention (7) and hives (7).  Mechanism of Action  Unlike common dietary proteins, SBI contains a concentrated source of ~60 immunoglobulin (>50% IgG, 1% IgA, and 5% IgM), 5% albumin and other proteins and peptides that may aid in the management of chronic diarrhea or loose and frequent stools. Immunoglobulins found in SBI have been shown to bind to microbial components with immune-activating potential from a variety of bacteria, fungi and viruses, including those implicated in human disease. The putative mechanism of action features, this binding of inflammatory antigens may prevent their passage into the lamina propria of the bowel wall, presumably due steric exclusion. The resultant dampening of immune response in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is believed to allow for restoration of intestinal homeostasis, leading to resumption of normal gut function and nutrient absorption. The therapeutic effect of SBI's action on various GI conditions with chronic diarrhea provides a specific nutritional benefit that cannot be provided by normal dietary proteins alone or by increased intake of foods which contain immunoglobulin (i.e., meat, dairy). Medical uses In humans, oral immunoglobulins may improve function in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Conditions like HIV-enteropathy, IBS-D (irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea), SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth), recurrent C. difficile infection-associated diarrhea and post-infectious IBS-D often limit or impair the body's ability to absorb and digest select nutrients including water. Clinical studies have indicated that serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate may help to reduce diarrhea and to restore the ability of the GI tract to properly absorb and utilize those nutrients.Iduru S, Burnett BP.

Poster (P100) Presented at American College of Gastroenterology Annual Meeting, Orlando, FL. October 15, 2017. History Research into bovine- and porcine-associated sources of immunoglobulin began in the field of animal health. Studies examined the health effects of adding immunoglobulins to the feed of early- weaned piglets that had developed intestinal inflammation, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and general malnutrition causing the piglets not to thrive. These issues often manifested in diarrhea, dehydration, and death for young piglets. The addition of immunoglobulin-rich protein isolates to the piglets’ food improved digestion, metabolism, and feed intake, increasing lean muscle mass and protein utilization. Gastric infection and diarrhea were also reduced in the post-weaning phase.

He was born in Michelstadt. He received his talmudic education in Frankfurt, in the yeshiva of Rabbi Nathan Adler, and following in the latter's footsteps, accepted an ascetic way of life and turned to kabbalistic studies. He resided in Frankfurt for a duration of 6 years, during which he married his first wife. About 1790, he returned with his wife to Michelstadt where he maintained a yeshiva for many years (serving as rosh yeshiva and instructing around 70 students in Tanakh, Talmud, and the works of the poskim, as well as secular subjects including German and mathematics) and served, at first unofficially, until 1822 as a recognized district rabbi. About 1810, after his wife's death, he lived for some time in Mannheim. For years, his \\"hasidic\\" behavior and extreme vegetarianism (at age 18 he vowed to abstain from animal products; a promise he kept until his death) created tension between him and the majority of his small community, but his reputation as a Baal Shem spread rapidly and Wormser became known throughout Germany as the Michelstadter Ba'al Shem, or the \\"Ba'al Shem of Michelstadt.\\" He denied any such supernatural power but agreed to receive people who sought his advice and guidance, giving them natural remedies and sometimes amulets. (He often said that whatever he does is done naturally and b'Ezrat HaShem). He became particularly known for his treatment of lunatics. Among the Jews of southern Germany many traditions survived regarding his miraculous cures and other feats. It was in Mannheim that he married his second wife. He studied German philosophy and was particularly attracted by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In 1822, he returned to Michelstadt. In 1825, his house and large library were destroyed by fire. Of his talmudic writings, preserved by his descendants, almost nothing was published. A catalogue of his second library is preserved in Ms. Heidenheim 206, in the Central Library of Zürich.

The film focuses on Maud, the fictional queen of Rumania, who is overthrown by her cousin, Rupert. Maud is thrown into prison after refusing the romantic advances of Rupert. She escapes with the aid of her lady-in-waiting and a priest. A wealthy American named Jack Walton, foils an assassination attempt on Maud and he falls in love with her. Maud is recaptured and set to be executed when the priest comes up with a plan to save her, by marrying Jack and Maud. The ceremony takes place through her cell window, and soon the United States military arrives to save the now wife of an American. Rupert is killed in the ensuing conflict. No known cast or production credits for the film is known. The film was released on November 11, 1910 and was met with neutral to negative reviews by critics. The patriotic element of the film was cited as likely being comical for European audiences and the film was also used as an example of an inappropriate example of American flag-waving. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: \\"Maud, the beautiful queen of Rumania, is deposed through the efforts of her wicked cousin, Rupert, who seizes the throne. He tries to make love to Maud, but when she spurns him he has her thrown into prison. Through the efforts of her faithful lady-in-waiting, and the kindly priest, the young queen escapes. While on a steamer, her cousin's spy locates her and decides to give her poison, but his attempt is detected by Jack Walton, wealthy young American who has seen the queen and fallen in love with her without knowing anything as to her history. A number of noblemen urge the queen to make an effort to regain the throne, and when Jack joins his plea to theirs, she consents. But the queen is only in her country a few hours when she is arrested during the absence of Jack on a mission.\\" \\"Jack prepares to save the queen, but has hit on no definite plan. Then Father Paul proposes a scheme. The queen's prison is on the ground floor; it is possible for her to stretch her hand through the bars. And Jack marries the woman he loves, though a stone wall is between them. The priest, with the bridegroom is outside, and the careless guards do not see them. Rupert then sends for his cousin again, and for the second time he offers to marry her. But she spurns him. Then he orders her execution. The sentence is about to be carried out when Jack arrives with a squad of U.S. troops from a troop ship in the harbor. The queen is entitled to their protection, for she is now the wife of an American. And she gets it. Rupert loses his life and the ensuing combat.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. A reviewer said that the film was a poor take on Anthony Hope, but did not further expand on the nature of this connection. This was likely a reference to Anthony Hope's works like The Prisoner of Zenda and may have been made due to the arrival of a foreigner who resolves a royal conspiracy. Bowers would list this film as being of \\"patriotic\\" character instead of listing it simply as a drama or a comedy production. The patriotic element of the film was heavily promoted in advertising and was likely true given the reaction of viewers to the film. One article in The Moving Picture News referred to the film as an example of a problematic use of the United States flag appearing suddenly with the marines at the climax of the plot, all while on foreign soil. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was \\"[a] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging is ridiculous and so is the resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but this thing is straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke.\\" The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, \\"The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. At least, it was worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit.\\" See also * List of American films of 1910 Notes  References  Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American short films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and- white films Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films Category:American films Category:Films set in Europe Category:Lost drama films Category:1910 lost films ","title":"The American and the Queen"},{"id":"45591533","text":"The Commercial Row–Brickelltown Historic District is a historic district in downtown Truckee, California. Developed from 1870 to 1930, the district includes the significant parts of Truckee's early commercial district. Due to several major fires, the district had several distinct construction and rebuilding periods; the fires also destroyed several significant buildings, including the stagecoach station which established the site of the city's downtown. To protect them from fires, most of the surviving commercial buildings were built with stone or brick. Once the Central Pacific Railroad was completed through Truckee in 1869, it became one of the city's main economic drivers; the Commercial Row district's businesses mainly catered to workers and travelers on the railroad. The Brickelltown district, meanwhile, housed and served workers in Truckee's other main industry, lumber. In the twentieth century, both industries declined due to economic shifts and the Great Depression; the city, and Commercial Row in particular, instead built a tourist economy on visitors to the region's recreational activities. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 2009.

The sheer musical strength of this ensemble is pretty much unparalleled in his career. The trumpeter/leader had backed off—a bit—from some of his outlandish and beautifully excessive use of strange and unconventional time signatures, though there is no lack of pioneering experimentalism in tone, color, arrangement, or style. ...Ultimately, Tears of Joy stands as a singular achievement in a career full of them by a musical auteur whose creativity seemingly knew few if any bounds\\". On All About Jazz, Jim Santella observed \\"Tears of Joy marked a subtle change in the Don Ellis big band. The trumpeter was gradually drifting toward popular music, and he was beginning to use the new electronic technology to its best advantage. However, he continued to load each arrangement with the kinds of musical features that have always left their unique stamp on his undertakings. Ellis and his other soloists stretch out with virtuosity while complex rhythms and dense counterpoint fill the air, and the band's sections taunt each other with adventurous forays. ...Highly recommended, Tears of Joy represents vintage Don Ellis big band excitement at its best\\"Santella, J., All About Jazz Review, September 13, 2005 The Penguin Guide to Jazz said \\"Tears of Joy is regarded by some as the best Don Ellis album.

Biography Bonanno began his coaching career in the 1950s at San Jose State College as an assistant to Bud Winter (1909–1985), regarded as one of the greatest sprint coaches in the world. He was playing racquetball with Winter at the TAC Annual Meeting when Winter suffered his fatal heart attack, one day before his induction into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. At San Jose State, Bonanno led the freshmen team to two national track and field championships. He also recruited hammer thrower national champion Ed Burke, who went on to compete in three Olympics and was the flag-bearer for the United States at the 1984 Olympic Games. From 1964 to 1968, Bonanno was the head coach of the Mexican track and field team. He was one of several foreign coaches—including some from the Eastern Bloc—recruited by the Mexican Olympic Committee to help the host team prepare for the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. At the height of the Cold War, and with the Olympic Games so close to the U.S. border, the suspicious Central Intelligence Agency recruited Bonanno to provide information on the coaches they suspected were undercover agents. Bonanno worked as a liaison between the Mexican officials and 3M in 1968, the year the first artificial track was installed for Olympic competition. \\"It had been red cinder at the Olympic Games up until then. 3M hired Jesse Owens to assist them to convince the Mexican Olympic Committee to put that track in,\\" Bonanno said. In 1969, Bonanno became the head coach at San Jose City College (SJCC), where he established a world-class track and field program. At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, he coached decathlete Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner) and sprinter Millard Hampton to gold medals. Other outstanding athletes training at SJCC were Andre Phillips, 1988 Olympic champion in hurdles, as well as throwers Mac Wilkins, Al Feuerbach and John Powell, all Olympians and world record holders. Bonanno became dean of athletics at SJCC in 1976. From 1973 to 1996, Bonanno served as director of the Bruce Jenner Classic Track and Field Classic, which grew into one of the top international events. He also co-founded the Mercury News 10K Race and served as meet director for the 1984 and 1987 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships held at San Jose City College. He also served as the U.S. coach at the 1981 Pan Pacific Games in Auckland, New Zealand, and the 1989 Indoor World Championships in Athletics in Budapest. He was the head coach for Peru at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, and coached athletes from Hungary, New Zealand and Scotland from the 1970s to 1990s. After 33 years with the college, Bonanno retired from San Jose City College in 2003. Awards In 1980, he was the first recipient of the Bud Winter Sportsman of the Year Award. Bonanno was inducted into the California Community College Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1986 and twenty years later, inducted star pupil Millard Hampton into the hall. He was elected into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. San Jose City College also awards the Bert Bonanno Scholar-Athlete Award each year. Bonanno, whose paternal and maternal grandparents emigrated from Italy, also received the Italian American Heritage Foundation Achievement Award in 2004.

Artistically drawn and well executed, reddish brown murals against white sandblasted backgrounds are the specialties of Kaavi art. Snow white lime, obtained by burning seashells, and washed sand from river beds were mixed with jaggery and allowed to ferment for two weeks. The mixture is then hand-pounded to obtain a homogeneous substance, which hardens when applied to the walls. Technique On the wet walls on which Kaavi pictures are to be etched, a buttery smooth mixture of lime and uramunji is smeared with a steel trowel. To cover larger areas, a wooden float is also employed. After an hour, engraving work commences. A well-trained Kaavi art mason can etch a small mural without any aids. For geometrical designs he employs rulers and compasses. Large and complicated motifs are first drawn on paper, perforated with pinholes and then traced on the wall by dusting the pinholes with dry lime.

The double-span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by J. J. Daniels in 1861 and destroyed by flood waters in 1866. History =Construction= This was the first of three bridges to be built at this location in a fifteen-year span. The second bridge, the Harrison Covered Bridge, would be built five years later and only last ten years before the West Union Covered Bridge would be built, which is still standing as of 2015. Joseph J. Daniels wrote a letter to the Parke County Commissioners in 1859, acting as an agent for his brother, William D. Daniels, seeking the contracts to build two bridges over Sugar Creek. One at Star Mill, north of West Union, and one at west of Rockport, the Jackson Covered Bridge. The Parke County Commissioners called a special meeting on December 28, 1860, on behalf of Dr. Hobbs, who was representing several citizens, to present a petition for a covered bridge at Rockport. John Scott presented a petition and subscriptions at the same meeting for a bridge at Star Mill. On January 1, 1861, another special session was call by the County Commissioners where $8,000 was approved for both location provided that the citizens would provide subscriptions to make up for the total cost. James Johnson and Henry Wolf were appointed to select sutible locations for the bridges along with specifications and costs. By the summer of 1861, the West Union site had raised $2,747 with eight men agreeing to make up the difference to $8,000. The Rockport site had raised $3,037 with six men agreeing to make up the difference to $8,000. William D. Daniels was awarded the contracts for both bridges with the provision that they must be completed by the end of the year, 1861. =Repair and destruction= The bridge was inspected and the rods tightened in 1863 by J.

Early life and education Gordon was born in Arkansas in 1915, and moved to Michigan with her family as a young child. In 1939, Gordon earned a bachelor's degree in home economics and chemistry from what was then called Michigan State College. Following college, she sought a career as a dietitian. She found a job working as a dietitian in a mental institution in Virginia, but, according to a 1999 interview with Gordon by Grand Valley State University history professor Carolyn Shapiro Shapin, Gordon said the doctor treated her poorly and she was given inadequate living quarters. She returned to Grand Rapids to seek work, but she was informed that \\"white male chefs would not want to take orders from a black female dietitian.\\" She was hired by Dr. Kendrick to support pertussis research at the Michigan Department of Health's Grand Rapids lab around 1944. Research In the early 1940s, Gordon tested thousands of culture plates, trying to find the culture that would have sufficient virulence to make the vaccine. The work was conducted at Western Michigan Laboratories, later known as Kent Community Hospital, located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gordon's work focused on pertussis cultures and virulence of the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Gordon's analysis of pertussis cultures led to identification of a powerful strain of the organism, which enabled the development of an effective vaccine. The Michigan Biological Products Division, which was part of the Michigan Health Department, began producing the vaccine for state use in 1938, and then distributed across the United States by 1940. Gordon is attributed with the identification of sheep blood as the key to the process of incubating the culture in petri dishes in the laboratory. Recognition In 1997, the Grand Rapids Public Library had a display on women who made a difference, and it featured Gordon. Michigan House of Representatives Resolution No. 115, sponsored by Representative Lynne Martinez recognized the work of Gordon. The resolution stated, \\"in sincere appreciation and acknowledgment to Loney Gordon for the contribution that she has made to the health of the citizens of our State, our nation, and the world through her work in the development of a vaccine against whooping cough...\\" Gordon was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. Later life and death Gordon worked for the Michigan Department of Health beginning in around 1956 and retiring in 1978. After World War II, Gordon was selected to travel to Europe and the Middle East with the National Council of Christian and Jews to “take the pulse of the people” in the area. Gordon died in 1999.

The fried pastry, slightly crispier and chewier than a doughnut and with no hole, is known as a cuisine of Hawaii. Though Portuguese immigrants brought the malasada to Hawaii at the turn of the 20th century, Leonard's opened in 1952 and brought it to a wider audience. Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known in the continental United States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.  Background and history  Margaret and Frank Leonard Rego Sr. opened Leonard's Bakery in 1952. Rego's mother had encouraged him to sell malasadas, a holeless Portuguese doughnut with a \\"crispier\\" outside and a \\"chewier\\" inside. Portuguese plantation workers brought the dessert to the Hawaiian islands when they immigrated at the turn of the 20th century. Leonard's is known as an \\"old-fashioned, plain-Jane bakery\\" that popularized pastries and desserts in Portuguese cuisine, like Portuguese sweet bread and pão doce meat wraps, sometimes with a Hawaiian cultural borrowing like haupia, coconut, and guava filled malasadas. As of 2011, the bakery remains a family business owned by Leonard Rego Jr. whose own children participate in its operation just as he once did. Andrew McCarthy of the National Geographic Traveler wrote that the bakery is an institution that \\"anchored\\" its neighborhood. In Hawaii, Leonard's is a \\"household name\\". Residents from the other Hawaiian islands often bring home Leonard's malasadas as an omiyage (souvenir gift). The fried doughnut-like item may be unique to Hawaii, but are well known both in the continental United States and internationally. The Honolulu bakery is a point of interest on at least one island tour. In 2012, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that the bakery sold over 15,000 malasadas daily, or over 160 million since its opening. Rego Jr. opened a franchise location in Japan's Yokohama World Quarter Shopping Center in December 2008. The location only sold cinnamon and sugar malasadas at first, but later added malasadas with fillings. Japanese investors Forest Inc. first asked Rego Jr. about licensing the brand in March 2008, and Rego Jr. felt that the timing with the Great Recession \\"couldn't have been more perfect\\". The deal was completed three months prior to the opening, and the owner flew in to train the staff for a week and a half. Rego Jr. plans to open more franchised locations in Japan and on the other islands of Hawaii. In 2009, the company employed 60 people between three stores (two in Oahu and one in Yokohama) and two Oahu food trucks.  Reception  Display case inside the bakery The bakery's malasadas were Foodspotting's top \\"Hawaii food find\\", and USA Today described the doughnuts as having become \\"a Hawaiian icon\\". Sunset recognized Leonard's for making the sweet a \\"Hawaiian classic\\" that is now served at Honolulu restaurants from drive-ins to Chef Mavro, \\"the city's classiest restaurant\\". Vinnee Tong of The New York Sun wrote that Leonard's was \\"a required stop for foodies and ... dessert addicts\\". Frommer's calls it a \\"Honolulu landmark\\", and The Huffington Post lists Leonard's malasadas alongside poke, Spam musubi and shave ice as \\"must try\\" Hawaiian cuisine experiences.

He was Minister Plenipotentiary to Germany, Russia, Chile and Brazil and minister of Foreign Relations. He is known for having led the Peruvian Mission to Chile before the War of the Pacific and for signing Treaty of Ancón. In the Congress, he was member of the Chamber of Deputies (1860 -1864) and the Senate (1874, 1876 - 1878). Biography Lavalle was born at Lima into a prominent family. His father was the soldier and politician Juan Bautista de Lavalle y Zugasti, son of the 1st Count of Premio Real and he himself Count of San Antonio de Vista Alegre, who decided to remain in Peru after the War of Independence and was later Interim President of the Republic. His mother was the youngest daughter of the 1st Count of Casa Saavedra. He was educated at Colegio Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe. After finishing his studies, Lavalle entered the Diplomatic Service in 1851. He was subsequently attaché to the Peruvian legations in Washington, D.C. (1851), Rome (1852) and Madrid (1853), before he was promoted to Second Secretary to the legation in Chile (1854). Then, he retired from the service and married Mariana Pardo y Lavalle, his cousin and a daughter of the writer Felipe Pardo. In 1860, Lavalle was elected Deputy for Lima. In 1866, he and his family moved to Europe living in France, Spain, England, Belgium, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. While he was settled in London, the Government appointed him Minister Plenipotentiary to Berlin and St Petersburg in 1873. In the Russian court, he also headed the delegation who represented the Peruvian claim against the Japanese Emperor for the María Luz impasse, which was finally decided by the Tsar in favor of the Japaneses. Upon his return to Lima in 1874, Lavalle was elected Senator for Loreto. In 1876, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Berlin, where he remained until 1878 when returned to Peru. He was Chairman of the Diplomatic Committee of the Congress when the Chilean-Bolivian conlict broke out in 1879. This year, the Government appointed him Special Envoy to Santiago to mediate in the controversy. During his mission he was informed of a secret treaty signed between his country and Bolivia in 1873 and despite his efforts the war broke out between the three countries. After finishing his mission in 1879, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Rio de Janeiro. Returned to Peru in 1881, Lavalle was first held prisoner during the Chilean occupation of Lima and then sent to Chile. He received the declaration of surrender signed by a part of the Peruvian staff and was required to negotiate the peace. Released in 1883, he returned to Peru and was appointed by an interim government Minister of Foreign Affairs, signing in this capacity the Treaty of Ancón. Retired from public life, Lavalle dedicated himself to academic matters. He participated in several literary circles and was one of the founders of the Peruvian Academy of Language and its first director in 1887.  Family  In 1854, he married his first cousin Mariana Pardo y Lavalle, daughter of the writer Felipe Pardo and sister of the politician Manuel Pardo, later President of Peru. The couple had nine children including José Antonio de Lavalle y Pardo (1858-1918), later Minister of Justice and General Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, and Hernando de Lavalle y Pardo, killed in the Battle of San Juan in 1881.

It was designed by Raymond C Nowland and built from 1938 to 1941 by the Queensland Department of Public Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999.  History  Aerial perspective view showing the proposed Dental Hospital, Art Gallery and Public Library, 1938 Opened in 1941, the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is an imposing two-storey, rendered masonry, neo-Georgian building looming above the corner to Turbot Street and Albert Streets and surrounded by terraced gardens. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was designed to be an integral component of an urban design proposal, The Turbot Street Development Scheme, for the city block bounded by Albert and Turbot Streets, Jacob's Ladder and Wickham Terrace. The Scheme, designed by Raymond Clare Nowland, senior architect in the Queensland Department of Public Works, included a Public Art Gallery, Public Library, the Dental Hospital and College and a beautifying of Wickham Park. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was the only part of the scheme to be realised. The site was part of an earlier Brisbane City Council reserve within Wickham Park which was exchanged in the 1930s for State owned land in Adelaide Street, adjacent to the former Supreme Court, enabling Adelaide Street to continue through to North Quay. From the early twentieth century, there was a general enthusiasm for town planning throughout the British Empire, America, Europe and Australia. Nowland was one of a number of town planning activists in Brisbane advocating the development of a town planning strategy for Brisbane during the 1920s and 1930s. The Turbot Street Development Scheme is one of a number of urban design proposals for Brisbane reflecting this concern. Wickham Park was chosen from among a number of sites as the site for the project. The Scheme excited considerable public interest and comment and there was much discussion about the suitability of the site. It was considered that its central location gave it the advantage of convenience of access to public transport; that the siting of the buildings at a higher level and in a park would ensure a quiet environment and ample natural lighting to the buildings; that it was unlikely that the site would be hemmed in or overshadowed by further development; and that the site lent itself \\"to artistic approaches and aesthetic surroundings\\". The monumentality and civic grandeur given to the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College through its association with a larger urban design proposal in a commanding, inner-city position reflect the importance of the building for the State Government and for the University of Queensland. Speaking at the laying of the foundation stone for the building on 20 March 1938 the Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Edward Hanlon, observed that the building was to harmonise architecturally with its near neighbour, the Brisbane City Hall, making \\"Turbot Street one of the most beautiful streets in any city in the Commonwealth\\". When a Faculty of Dentistry was formed within the University of Queensland in 1935, the Queensland State Government agreed to fund and build a new dental hospital and college. The first public Dental Clinic in Queensland had been established in Brisbane in 1908 and by 1926 the Clinic had been taken over by the Department of Home Affairs and was known as the Brisbane Dental Hospital. The proposed new Dental Hospital was to be the base for the dental services provided by the Brisbane and South Coast Hospitals Board and was part of an overall Government policy to provide public dental services throughout Queensland. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The Forgan Smith Government embarked on a large public works building program designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the State. This building program included: government offices; schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols. Many of the programs have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland including the establishment of a system of public health care administered through a range of new hospitals and clinics. Notable projects undertaken include the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School, Herston; the Women's Hospital at the Brisbane General Hospital; the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College; and the Wilson Ophthalmic Hostel. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was a building of major importance to Queensland and among the most ambitious projects within the Forgan Smith Government's building program. Construction commenced in September 1938 and the building was opened 6 July 1941 with Edward Hanlon declaring that the building was \\"better equipped and finished than any other dental hospital in Australia\\". The building is important in the overall development of the University of Queensland and the development of facilities for the training of medical and dental practitioners. The University embraced the model for training health practitioners promoted by the American Medical Association which advocated increased laboratory training in basic medical sciences and the use of hospitals for clinical training. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College reflects this approach to health care training in its provision of specialist laboratories and a training hospital. During this time the architect responsible for the design of the Hospital and College, Raymond Clare Nowland, was also designing the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School which also reflects the adoption of this teaching model. Raymond Clare Nowland joined the architectural office of the Department of Public Works in November 1932 where he became a senior architect in 1938. He produced the most significant buildings of his career between 1932 and 1942 including the University of Queensland Medical School, Herston (1939); Brisbane Dental Hospital and College (1941); Police Barracks, Petrie Terrace (1942) and the Cairns Court House Complex (1935). Nowland undertook architectural studies at the Sydney Technical College (1911–14) and the Architectural Association School London (1919). In private practice from 1926–32, he undertook a range of domestic and commercial commissions including the Brisbane Clinic, Wickham Terrace, Brisbane (1930). The design of the Brisbane Clinic was influenced by an American medical model, the Mayo Clinic. His preference for designing within a restrained classicism reflects his architectural training, the prevailing professional architectural attitudes and the design direction given by the Chief Architect, A.B. Leven. Along with many British Empire architects of the 1930s both Leven and Nowland shared a respect for simplicity, order and rational planning which in his public work enabled Nowland to make a notable contribution to the architectural fabric of Queensland towns and cities. In an earlier sketch design vertical emphasis was given to the building by recessed spandrels below the windows at each level. The monumental presence of the building was emphasised by rusticated quoins and pilasters framing the end wings. Changes to the building program, availability of materials, budget restrictions and an augmentation of the program to include servicing and air- conditioning resulted in alterations to the earlier sketch design proposal. The building was to have been constructed of sandstone but difficulties with supply and additional budget restrictions resulted in a substitution of brick and cement render and a reduction in the texture and decoration of the elevations. Considerable foundation work was undertaken to bridge the railway tunnel beneath the site to avoid vibration in the building. The ground floor accommodated the Dental Hospital and the first floor and roof housed the Dental College. The ground floor provided offices for the Director and support staff, surgeries and associated facilities, and a reception/waiting room. The first floor provided a waiting room, surgeries and associated facilities, staff offices, two lecture theatres and a museum. The flat roof housed the library, upper part of the large lecture theatre and air-conditioning plant. The building program was augmented to include additional servicing so a mezzanine floor was inserted between the ground and first floors to accommodate air-conditioning and servicing to the College level surgeries. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was the first public building in Queensland to install air-conditioning. Rubber floors were provided in the surgeries and corridors on each floor, terrazzo was applied to the ground floor entrance and waiting room and other floors were linoleum. The waiting rooms featured Queensland maple panelling and purpose built silky oak furniture. Additional roof-top accommodation for laboratories and staff, and staff and student common rooms was constructed in 1949. In the 1960s the University of Queensland erected a freestanding building (design by James Birrell) to the northeast, connecting with a walkway to the College level of the earlier building. A small brick extension was erected in the courtyard in 1985. Aggressive refurbishment of the fabric, furniture, fittings and equipment of the Hospital facilities and College surgeries and teaching areas was undertaken from 1997 to 1999. The integrity of the planning has survived along with some internal fabric including the entrance doors and surrounding panelling, timber casement windows, sills, doors, shelving, corridor finishes and three sets of terrazzo stairs. Servicing of surgeries and work areas continues to be facilitated by the mezzanine service floor. In September 2014, Liberal National Party Minister for Health Lawrence Springborg announced that the buildings would be sold and the dental services relocated to more modern facilities. In January 2015, the University of Queensland relocated its dental college to new premises on the university's Herston campus, and the building was listed for sale. In March 2015, following the Labor victory at the 2015 state election, new Deputy Premier Jackie Trad announced that the building would not be sold, stating that \\"Labor will not progress that sale\\". The offices and laboratories in the 2018 ABC TV series Harrow are set in the building.  Description  Brisbane Dental Hospital and College, June 1940 Approached by a monumental sweep of wide concrete stairs from Turbot Street, the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is an imposing, neo-Georgian, two- storey, rendered masonry building on the corner of Albert and Turbot Streets, Brisbane. The building has a steel frame, concrete floors, stands on a rusticated granite base and has rendered facings to all elevations. A balustraded parapet provides a partial screen to roof top structures. The Dental Hospital occupies the ground floor while the first floor and roof level housed the Dental College of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Queensland. The main elevation to Turbot Street is symmetrical about a projecting entrance porch terminated at each side by slightly projecting wings. Ornamental standard lamps flank the main stairway at the base and at the summit. The entrance porch is defined by fluted Ionic columns and framed by the rusticated pilasters of the enclosing side walls. The internal spatial relationships within the building are expressed by the size and placement of the windows in the elevations. The service mezzanine floor is reflected in the row of small squat timber awning windows between the timber casement windows with arched fanlights of the ground floor and the large rectangular timber casement windows marking the College level on the first floor. A giant order is implied by the rusticated base and the heavy mutuled cornice and imparts a strong and unified character to the building. The other elevations to the building contain a pattern of windows similar to that of the front elevation. The elevation to Albert Street is a single range terminated by slightly projecting wings; the northeast elevation contains a substantial entry stair and doorway to the Wickham Park wing and a service entry to the basement; and the rear elevation contains a subsidiary entrance to the Albert Street wing. The building is organised as perimeter wings about a central square courtyard. Within the main entry porch, there is fine decorated timber panel work to the surrounds of the entry doors and restrained decorative plaster work within the porch. The porch opens on to the main vestibule and into the former waiting room overlooking the internal courtyard. Large surgery spaces and smaller rooms for teaching, service spaces and staff offices are organised about central corridors through each wing. Rooms open off the corridors and have views to the surrounding streets or the inner courtyard. There are stairwells off the corridors to each corner of the building. The stairwells contain terrazzo stairs, terrazzo panelling to dado level, plain and twisted steel balustrading and moulded timber handrails and are top-lit by roof lanterns. The stair to the east corner is now enclosed at ground floor level. The stairwell to the north corner travels from the first floor to the roof level only, does not have terrazzo dado panelling and has sheeting to the balustrade of the top flight of the dogleg stair. A dumb waiter in the north corner services each level but is presently sealed over at ground level. The ground floor and some of the first floor have recently undergone an aggressive refurbishment but the logic of the circulation and the internal spaces remains though fabric has been lost. The former ground floor waiting room, now the reception and administration area, is lit from the courtyard by a bank of full height plain leadlight awning and fixed glass windows which are operated by a manual turning device. The mezzanine between the ground and first floor does not continue over this reception area where the ceiling height is to the level of the mezzanine storey ceiling. The present waiting room occupies the former office suite adjacent to the vestibule. Both the Hospital and College levels have surgeries in the northeast and southwest wings. These are long open rooms subdivided by head height partitioning. The recent refurbishment has removed earlier partitions, equipment, finishes, floor coverings and joinery but the integrity of the spaces has survived. The large timber casement windows with semi-circular fanlights and terrazzo sills remain in the surgeries at the Hospital level and the rectangular timber casement windows survive on the College level. The decorative timber and metal flat arch to the former waiting room and some timber doors remain to the ground floor. The building was finished throughout with decorative plaster ceilings, Queensland maple joinery and panelling, and purpose-built timber furniture. Original fabric survives, particularly on the first floor where the waiting room and the Professor's room contain fine examples of discreet panelling, joinery and shelving in Queensland maple. The waiting room has four sets of fine Queensland maple doors with discreet plain leadlight glass panels and carved Queensland maple architraves beneath a decorative plaster ceiling coffered by ceiling beams. Purpose-built silky oak furniture remains in use in this area. The galleried lecture theatre has been gutted and is now subdivided into two seminar rooms. The smaller lecture theatre has been partitioned into offices and the museum is now a seminar room. Original finishes, floor coverings and joinery to staff offices and corridors is found on this floor. The library on the roof is now a seminar room and contains timber shelving to the long sides of the room. The 1949 timber and fibro clad roof buildings continue to accommodate laboratories, staff offices, staff and student common rooms. Additional airconditioning plant has been located on the roof. Roofing to the south stairwell lantern has rolled ridge flashing. There is a commemorative plaque in the external wall to the east corner of the Turbot Street elevation recording the laying of the foundation stone and a plaque commemorating the opening of the building in the southwest wall of the main entry porch. The concreted courtyard in the centre of the building was to be laid out with gardens and a central fountain and acts as a light well for the building which encircles it. It was accessed from the main waiting room in the Turbot Street wing, the extraction waiting room in the northeast wing and the Junior Common Room in the Wickham Park wing. It is no longer accessed from the northeast wing and the 1985 brick extension projects from the Wickham Park wing at ground level. Air-conditioning and laboratory extraction ducts now encroach into the courtyard area. From a masonry wall at street level, steep, grassed, battered banks rise up to two terraced levels to the Albert and Turbot Streets sides of the building. The upper level terrace has a concrete path and a row of pines marching around the building to the Albert and Turbot Streets elevations. A service lane to the northeast of the building off Turbot Street allows ambulance access to the rear and side. A set of concrete steps from Albert Street arrives to the rear of the building.  Heritage listing  Brisbane Dental Hospital and College was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is important in demonstrating the development of public dental services and the training of dental practitioners in Queensland. The Dental Hospital is an important component in the development of the public health scheme for Queensland initiated by the Forgan Smith Government in the 1930s and continues to provide public dental services. As the first College for the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Queensland, the building is important in demonstrating the development of the University and the training of dentists in Queensland. The Dental Hospital and College is important in the development of the University of Queensland and in the training of medical and dental practitioners. The planning of the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College, with the inclusion of specialist laboratories for teaching and research and proximity to a hospital, is important for demonstrating the adoption of the American teaching model which advocated increased laboratory training in basic medical sciences and the use of hospitals for clinical training. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is important as the only Dental Hospital and College in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is a fine example of a building planned to accommodate highly serviced medical facilities. The layout and commodity of the spaces survives having accommodated the late 1990s aggressive refurbishment work undertaken to comply with contemporary health regulations and advances in technology. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is an important building in the body of public buildings designed by the Department of Public Works in Queensland. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is one of an impressive suite of important government buildings erected throughout Queensland designed in a classical idiom during the 1930s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In a restrained neo-Georgian idiom, the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College has aesthetic and architectural significance. With planar crispness and subtle detailing, it is a robust public building with a monumental street presence. An important component in an unrealised urban design scheme planned for Turbot Street and Wickham Park in the 1930s, The Turbot Street Development Scheme, the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is a landmark building occupying a busy city corner. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is important as the only built work in this ambitious scheme of public buildings. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is important for its fine rare interiors including the entrance porch and decorative timber surrounds and timber doors to the main entrance; the stairwells and roof lanterns; the waiting room and associated furniture on the first floor; the Professor's room on the first floor; corridors and staff offices on the first floor; surviving joinery to the ground floor. The integrity of the spatial relationships within the building are important including the volume of the former ground floor waiting room with the accompanying bank of windows to the courtyard. The courtyard is important to the building. The associated grounds are important to the building including the impressive sweep of concrete stairs with flanking standard lamps from Turbot Street. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. A highly serviced building, the design of the Brisbane Dental Hospital and College demonstrates the focus on the application of technological advances in the delivery of health care prevailing in the 1930s and incorporates innovative technical features. The building is important as the first public building in Brisbane to install a fully integrated air conditioning system. The insertion of a mezzanine floor to accommodate air- conditioning and servicing of surgeries and work areas enabled the Hospital and College to incorporate technological developments and service the building efficiently and effectively. Inclusion of these extensive servicing features has facilitated the incorporation of late twentieth century technological advances introduced in the late 1990s refurbishment. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Brisbane Dental Hospital and College is important for its association with the architect Raymond Clare Nowland. The building is one of the most notable structures designed by Nowland, an architect of considerable talent working in the Department of Public Works during the period of extensive public works building in the 1930s.

His short stories and novels described the grim realities of life in a New York City slum. Often heard to comment that he was \\"born in the gutter\\", he was known as \\"the Mr. Bounderby of American Letters\\" and \\"the Kipling of the Bowery\\".  Early life  Kildare was born on New York's Lower East Side in 1864. His father, an Irish immigrant, died three months before his birth; his mother, a French immigrant, died soon after his birth. He was raised by a foster family until the age of seven when he began life on his own. He then sold newspapers on a crew managed by Timothy Sullivan. He could not read or write until he was 30 years old.  Alternate early biography  During Kildare's life, The New York Times suggested that his name was a pseudonym. Then in one of Kildare's obituaries, The Times printed a conversation with \\"Red\\" Shaughnessy, a regular at \\"The Doctor's Bar\\" in the Bowery, who claimed that Kildare was really Thomas Carroll. According to Shaughnessy, Carroll had been born in Carrollton, Maryland, into a branch of the influential Carroll family. He ran away from home and became a newspaper hawker and fighter, preferring a tough life in the Bowery to that in a comfortable Baltimore suburb. The Literary Digest suggested that the alternate details might be the work of a clever newspaper writer.  Later life  Kildare began earning money as a prize fighter, and later he became a bouncer and a bartender in the Bowery. In 1901 he participated in a failed coup to depose Venezuelan dictator Cipriano Castro, and after returning to New York he wrote short stories for magazines and newspapers. He became an associate editor of Pearson's Magazine and later started the short-lived Kildare Publishing Company. Two women in his life helped Kildare in his writing. A teacher named Marie Rose Deering tutored Kildare while he was learning to read and write. The two became engaged, but Deering died a week before their marriage. Kildare then met Leita Russell Bogartus,Alternate spelling Bogardus a writer who helped him edit and publish some of his work. He later married Bogartus.  Death  Kildare and playwright Walter C. Hackett adapted My Mamie Rose, Kildare's first major work and autobiography, for the stage in 1908, starring actor Arnold Daly. The production was titled Regeneration, and Kildare became angry and despondent after seeing Daly's interpretation of his character. Then after a fall in the subway, Kildare suffered a mental breakdown. He was placed in Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital and later moved to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. From the time of his hospitalization in 1908 until his death, he would not leave the psychiatric hospital system. He died after a seizure in 1911 at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center.

An outstanding sprinter in the mid 1970s, Zephyr Bay retired to stud in 1975 with 9 wins including the VATC Oakleigh Plate, AJC Challenge Stakes and AJC Expressway Stakes. He held the 1000m Randwick course record for 35 years. Breeding Zephyr Bay was bred by Lionel Israel at his Segenhoe Stud near Scone in New South Wales. He was born in 1970 from the first crop of the Star Kingdom stallion Biscay, out of the Pan II mare Heavenly Wind. Zephyr Bay was purchased by horse trainer Bert Lyell on behalf Bob Miller at the Inglis Easter Yearling Sale in 1972 for $16,000.00. Racing career Coal black and brilliantly fast Zephyr Bay became known as the \\"black flash\\" winning top sprinting races and setting numerous course records. He was often ridden throughout his career by Grahame Horselman and Roy Higgins. Zephyr Bay raced as a two-year-old in the 1972/73 season under trainer Bert Lyell. He won twice before coming second to Imagele in the STC Todman Stakes. In the STC Todman Stakes Zephyr Bay suffered from a splint under his knee and was sent out to spell. After spending almost 12 months spelling, Zephyr Bay came back in the care of trainer Cyril Kearns, Bert Lyell having died. The highlights of his three-year-old career were second placings in the STC George Ryder Stakes and the AJC Galaxy. Zephyr Bay's four-year-old season during 1974/75 proved to be the peak of his racing career. He achieved victories in the AJC Challenge Stakes, followed by the AJC Expressway Stakes and culminating in the Group 1 VATC Oakleigh Plate. Setting a course record in each win. The course record Zephyr Bay set winning the AJC Challenge Stakes would last 35 years until 2010. Zephyr Bay's final race was in the AJC Galaxy where he injured a tendon and was retired from racing.

It is also known as Skew Street Cemetery. It was established in 1825 as part of the Moreton Bay penal settlement. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010.  History  The cemetery at Skew Street was established in 1825 with the relocation of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement to Brisbane. It operated until the North Brisbane Burial Ground opened in 1843 in Paddington/Milton. During that time 265 people died in Brisbane and most were buried in the cemetery. The cemetery land was converted to freehold and auctioned in 1875. The Helidon Spa Water Company operated a factory on the land and several cottages were built. The construction of Eagle Terrace and Skew Street in the late 1800s and construction of the Grey Street Bridge in the 1920s had some impact on the site. In May 1825 Lieutenant Henry Miller moved the Moreton Bay Settlement from the Redcliffe Peninsula to its present site on the northern bank of the Brisbane River. This was an elevated location with water holes and cooling breezes. The southern bank (Kangaroo Point Cliffs) was a cliff of rock, suitable for building material, and a fertile flood plain. The settlers faced hardship and privation and the paucity of resources combined with thick sub-tropical vegetation made settlement difficult. Between 1826 and 1829, the number of prisoners in the settlement rose from 200 to 1000 and the plight of the convicts whose labour was to establish the settlement was dire. The site of Brisbane Town was an ongoing cause of disquiet, with Commandant Patrick Logan proposing that the settlement be moved to Stradbroke Island. However, the difficulties of crossing Moreton Bay saw this plan abandoned. Logan continued to seek alternative sites, establishing a number of outstations including Eagle Farm and Oxley Creek. Despite the continued uncertainty about the future of Brisbane Town, building had continued under Commandant Logan, who is given credit for laying out the earliest permanent foundations. Logan was responsible for the building of Brisbane's only surviving convict-constructed buildings, the Commissariat Store and the Tower Mill. Convict numbers fell 75 percent between 1831 and 1838 by which time the area under cultivation shrank from to only . On 10 February 1842 New South Wales Governor George Gipps declared Moreton Bay open for free settlement. The cemetery was established early in the convict period and operated until the opening of the North Brisbane Burial Grounds at Paddington/Milton in 1843. During the 18 years of its operation there were 265 recorded deaths in Brisbane, including 220 convicts. Most of these people were buried in the First Brisbane Burial Ground. Probably the most famous person buried in the cemetery was the surveyor Granville William Chetwynd Stapylton who it was believed was killed by Aborigines near Mount Lindsay in May 1840. Two Aborigines were later hanged for this murder at the Tower Mill. Following the closure of the cemetery in 1843 the area remained as unalienated crown land and in 1848 the Moreton Bay Courier described the cemetery: > \\"It is a disgraceful fact that, notwithstanding the repeated complaints in > this journal of the exposed condition of the old burial ground, it is now as > bad as ever. The temporary fencing which was placed around has almost > entirely disappeared.\\" Four years later it was described: > \\"Six years ago, nearly a hundred tablets, headstones, &c.;, stood in the old > burial ground: now a bare dozen can be counted, and many of these are > dilapidated or overturned. The fence is torn down, carried away or > burnt..What hands have taken so many monumental stones away none can tell.\\" Between 1864 and 1875 Skew Street was constructed through the cemetery land to provide vehicle access between Roma Street and North Quay. It had not been constructed by October 1864 as the Surveyor General wrote to the Secretary of Lands on 21 October 1864 that:Surveyor General 64/2690 > \\"The arrangement of the portion including the cemetery be deferred until > some future time when the relatives and friends of those who have been > interred in the cemetery may be less likely to object to the locality being > appropriated as a public thoroughfare.\\" In October 1875 the cemetery land was divided into 7 town allotments varying in size from and sold at public auction as Section 41. The sale of the land was specifically to raise funds for the provision of drainage facilities within Brisbane. The purchasers were F. Giles, J. Carmody, Dr John Waugh and H. Morwitch. Section 41 was described as: > \\"The triangular reserve (formerly a burial ground) between the North Quay, > Eagle Cliff (or Terrace), and Skew Street (running from opposite the old > entrance to the gaol to the North Quay).\\" Dr John Waugh arrived in Brisbane in the early 1860s and originally practiced in Stanley Street but later moved his practice to the brick cottage he constructed on this newly acquired land. He was president of the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland for many years. In 1881 at least three burials were exhumed from the cemetery and removed with their monuments to the Toowong Cemetery. These were all the remains of children who had died at the convict settlement. They were William Roberts, 5 years 2 months old son of Charles Roberts of the Commissariat Department who died in 1831, Peter Macauley, 15 years and 8 months old son of Private Peter Macauley of the 17th Regiment of Foot who died in 1832, and Jane Pittard the 12 month old daughter of Colour Sergeant John Pittard of the 57th Regiment of Foot who died in 1833. By the 1890s the Helidon Spa Water Company had established a factory on the allotments at the North Quay end of Section 41. Construction of the Grey Street Bridge in the 1920s resulted in resumption of properties and the realignment of roadways at the northern access to the bridge.  Description  Plaque showing a map of the First Brisbane Burial Ground, 2009 The first European burial ground in Queensland is located beneath unnamed open space bounded by and including Skew Street, Eagle Terrace and North Quay, Brisbane. Although there is no surface evidence of the burial ground, the documented history and an understanding of the previous usage of the area, particularly a lack of major development, indicates potential for both human remains and archaeological artefacts to exist within the place. The former burial ground is believed to have comprised the majority of today's Lot 1 on RP177960. In April 2010, this was public open space. None of the installed bollards delineating the open space area, vehicular access barriers or plantings and gardens are of archaeological importance or potential. The physical limits of service easements ARP165780, BRP165780, CRP165780 and DRP165780, which cross the middle of the open space area from near the intersection of North Quay and Skew Street northwest across Eagle Terrace to Quay Street, are excluded due to previous subsurface disturbance, notably in November 2009, which would have destroyed any surviving archaeological remains within the limits of those easements. The site includes parts of Eagle Terrace and Skew Street. Subsurface areas below the base construction layer of the current road surface are of potential archaeological importance.  Heritage listing  First Brisbane Burial Ground was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The First Brisbane Burial Ground is an important aspect of Queensland's history as the first European burial ground in Queensland. At least 220 convicts, soldiers, women and children are known to have been interred in the burial ground, accounting for most of the people who died in the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement between 1825 and 1843. Physical evidence of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement is now rare. Human remains and associated material culture, including personal items, have potential to survive subsurface at the First Brisbane Burial Ground. Development on the site beginning in the 1870s (construction of Skew Street and subdivision has been low impact and unlikely to have had a major detrimental impact on the preservation of human remains and material culture or their potential for survival. The capping of the site by road construction from the 1870s and residential and commercial development (single storey cottages and the Helidon Spa Water Company) in the 1880s is likely to have had a positive effect on site preservation. The archaeological integrity and potential for site preservation of the First Brisbane Burial Ground is high. Excavations at the nearby North Brisbane Burial Ground (1843-1875) in the early 2000s demonstrate that burials and their associated material culture survive in the Brisbane clays close to the river. The First Brisbane Burial Ground has not been subjected to the extreme levels of post-depositional contamination that occurred at the North Brisbane Burial Ground. The site has been assessed in the Brisbane City CBD Archaeological Plan as being \\"exceedingly rare\\" given its association with the penal settlement phase of Brisbane. The level of disturbance has been designated as \\"intact\\" given the minor nature of road and other activities undertaken, and the lack of any major building construction work at the site. This combination of being designated \\"exceedingly rare\\" and \\"intact\\" leads to the categorisation of the site as having \\"Exceptional Research Potential\\" in the Brisbane City CBD Archaeological Plan. Archaeological investigations on the site have the potential to answer important research questions about Queensland's history relating to the importation of materials, decay processes, colonial burial practices, gender, class and denominational differences, differential treatment of officers, soldiers, convicts and civilians, and health, nutrition and causes of death in the early colony.

He was a professor at the Freiburg University Medical Center, Department of Internal Medicine I (Oncology/Hematology). Mertelsmann is known for his scientific works in the fields of hematology, oncology, gene therapy and stem cell transplantation.  Biography  Mertelsmann studied medicine at the University of Göttingen 1966–68. He was a doctoral candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine at Heinrich Matthaei in Göttingen 1966–68. He continued his medical education at the School of Medicine King's College London and at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York 1968–78. After graduating from Hamburg University Medical School and receiving his MD degree, he became Research Fellow at the Department of Developmental Hematopoiesis and received a special fellowship in Hematology and Clinical Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), 1976–78. There he contributed to the isolation of the blood stimulating growth factor G-CSF, which leads to a faster recovery of white blood cells after chemotherapy and radiation therapy protecting patients better against severe infections. From 1978 to 86 he was clinical assistant physician at MSKCC, then assistant attending physician and associate attending physician at the Memorial Hospital of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was promoted from assistant professor of medicine to associate professor of medicine at Cornell University, New York. In 1985, he returned to Germany and was appointed professor and head of the 3rd Medical Clinic Hematology and Oncology at the University of Mainz, Germany, University Medical Center. 1989 he accepted a professorship at the University of Freiburg. At Freiburg University Medical Center he became the director of the Department for Medicine I, Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation. He retired in 2012.Roland Mertelsmann CV During his career Mertelsmann recruited and promoted young scientists. Several leading positions at universities and in the industry were occupied with former team members of Mertelsmann. In 2008 he founded the International Master Program in Biomedical Sciences,IMBS a cooperation of the universities of Freiburg and Buenos Aires, educating and training international master students in biomedicine. In 2014 he initiated the foundation of the journal JOSHA,JOSHA a novel internet platform to access the broad diversity of important discoveries and creativity in the fields of science, humanities and arts. Mertelsmann published more than 400 articles in medical journals. Scientific contribution Mertelsmann's experimental, translational and clinical work has focused on understanding the pathogenesis and pathobiology of malignant diseases and, based on these insights, to develop novel strategies to treat cancer and leukemia. =Molecular and cellular mechanisms of malignancy- First description of a human RNA polymerase= After discovery of the genetic code by Heinrich Matthaei und Marshall Nirenberg (1962), Mertelsmann began his research for his medical doctorate as a medical student in Heinrich Matthaei's Laboratory at the Max-Planck-Institute for experimental Medicine in Göttingen, Germany, demonstrating and characterizing for the first time a human RNA-Polymerase.R.

She was one of the few women who performed in the corrido style. She created the Institute of Folklore in Michoacan and was one of the first collectors of folklore and preservers of the traditions of the Mexican people. She was a cultural icon having relationships with two presidents, and a broad range of Mexico's most prominent artists including Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Guadalupe Marín, Tina Modotti, Elena Poniatowska, Anita Brenner and others. Early life Concepción Michel was born in 1899 in Villa Purificación, Jalisco, Mexico. Her grandfather, Louis Michel, was one of the feudal lords of the Jaliscan Coast where Concha was born. After her birth, the family moved to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca where her father was engaged in trade with seafaring ships. She was a precocious child and her parents sent her at the age of seven to school at the Convento de San Ignacio de Loyola, which her grandfather had built in the village of Ejutla, Jalisco. She stayed four years and learned to sing and play the guitar, but after organizing the other novices to run away and trying to set fire to one of the saints, Concha was expelled. Orphaned young, Michel's sister, Albina, who was 15 years older, was the primary person raising Concha, when she accepted a stipend to study opera at the Guadalajara conservatory. Dates of events during this period, according to Jocelyn Olcott are difficult to pinpoint, but Concha had a daughter before her 15th birthday; lived briefly in New York; returned to Mexico; married, had a son, and divorced. Activism In 1918 Michel joined the Communist Party (PCM) and began a life partnership with Hernán Laborde, General Secretary and first Deputy of the PCM. By 1925 she had interested the government in her project to document indigenous songs and from 1925 to 1926 Concha traveled the country collecting examples of folklore and songs for the Secretary of Education (SEP). In 1932, Michel decided to move to New York, where she attended the School of Social Sciences for about a year. While in New York, she sang at a birthday party for John D. Rockefeller in his home and attended an opening held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York where she won $1200. She used her winnings to travel to Europe and the Soviet Union. Her goal of going to Russia was to study the conditions of women in a socialist country and while there, she met Alexandra Kollontai, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and Clara Zetkin and saw her friend Tina Modotti. Near the end of 1933, Michel returned from the Soviet Union and re-signed with SEP's Cultural Missions program as a \\"rural organizer\\". Her plans were to help women gain land independently from their fathers or husbands, so that women's collectives could farm them for subsistence. She was not a feminist, though later activists would claim her as a proto-feminist, as she believed in working within the system of Mexican gender. She felt that men's endorsement and collaboration with women's projects were vital to their success. In any case, her vocal disagreement with the communist party on women's issues led to her expulsion from the party in 1933. Concha's response was to publish a pamphlet Marxistas y “marxistas,” explaining her views on \\"the woman question\\". In 1936, Michel led a group of about 250 women to invade one of President Plutarco Elías Calles’s estates, claiming it should be made into a woman's training center, since the revolution had given rural women nothing. Calles's guards removed the women while Concha was negotiating with him. While unsuccessful, it gained her support of policymakers and Calles's successor, Lázaro Cárdenas sent her a reply that he would grant her another hacienda for founding a training center. The next several years were devoted to women's issues, as Concha helped reorganize the defunct Women's Revolutionary Institute, began serving as secretary for the Confederación Campesina Mexicana (Mexican Peasant Confederation) and was heavily involved in federal policy-making. Revolutionary art The appointment of José Vasconcelos in 1921 as Secretary of State for Public Education was one of the pivotal moments in the Mexican art world. Vasconcelos proposed that the best artists in the country be used to promote the philosophy and ideals of the Mexican Revolution to the largely uneducated public. Leftist artists saw this encouragement as a means of producing art heavily reflecting communist ideology. Michel provided the vocal accompaniment to the visual records left by the Mexican mural movement photography of Tina Modotti, Aurora Reyes, Frida Kahlo and others. The themes running throughout the art in this period exalt socialism and communism, workers, and allusions to indigenous culture like bandoliers, flags, guitars, hands, machetes, peasants and opposing classism. On December 3, 1929, Modotti opened a show at the Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico and Concha Michel performed. Michel traveled throughout Mexico with President Cardenas attending rallies and mass organizational meetings,Olcott (2005), pp 109–110 using her music to agitate for her political ideals and tell the stories of the revolution. Michel introduced Diego Rivera to his future wife, Lupe Marín and Marín Modotti and Michel served as his models for various works. At Kahlo's last exhibit in 1953, Michel was by her side. In addition to her own song- writing, Concha wrote ten plays. As Michel traveled the country with Cardenas, she gathered indigenous songs and collected some 5,000 works, though she struggled to find interest in publishing them. In 1951, part of her collection Cantos indígenas de México was published. Views on women Throughout her life, Concha worked to improve the life of women. Her vision focused on the duality of humankind, and she saw that there was a need for men and women to work together recognizing equal importance of their roles. In the 1980s, Concha, along with eight other women, including Aurora Reyes, Natalia Moguel and Antonieta Rascón, signed a document they called La Dualidad (The Duality). It was a document calling for world action to recognize the duality of both male and female and calling for the inclusion of women and men in the fight against patriarchy. Personal life At around the age of fifteen, Concha had a child named Yolia with a law student from Chihuahua named Fernando Cásares. Michel placed the child in a foundling home so that she could work. Her daughter contracted bronchial pneumonia and died when she was seventeen months old. While still in mourning, Concha married a German-Austrian man who was twenty years her senior, Pablo Rieder, with whom she had a son, Godofredo. She and Rieder divorced shortly after the birth of her son. In 1918, Michel began a relationship with her life partner, Hernán Laborde. Concha Michel died on December 27, 1990 in Morelia, Michoacán at the age of 93.

Early life and farming Distin arrived in the Cape in 1846 when his family's ship was sailing past on its return from New Zealand. He jumped overboard from his ship and swam ashore in Table Bay. He found work as a soldier and then as a trader of the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. He later became a farmer in Hantam, in the Middelburg District, Eastern Cape in the 1860s, and made his fortune in Ostrich farming. With his new fortune he built up his estate, Tafelberg Hall. (However, later when the Ostrich boom ended, his business declined.) In Cradock in 1831 he married Selina White (1830-1900), daughter of John and Mary White of Grahamstown. The couple had 11 children. Political career 1869\\\\. William Porter (left) and Distin (right) as \\"exeter hall\\" liberal reformers. 1874\\\\. Distin caricatured facing down a minority of conservative critics in his constituency who had objected to his support for liberal measures in Parliament. He was elected as Member of the Cape Parliament, for the Middelburg and Fort Colesberg district. He was notable in the 1860s for his liberal and inclusive policies, and for his support of humane measures (together with William Porter) such as opposition to the death penalty. He was also one of the first of a group of Eastern Province MPs who converted to the movement for democratic self-rule (or \\"Responsible Government\\") in the Cape Colony, and he fought for it up until it was introduced in 1872. He later gained the nickname \\"the Lion of Colesberg\\" - partly because of his enormous beard, and partly as a joke, on account of his friendship with the elderly leader of the responsible government movement John Molteno, who had a very similar mane-like beard which had long earned him the nickname, the \\"lion of beaufort\\". Once self-rule was instituted in 1872, Distin became one of the most passionate supporters of the new Cape government, as it began extensive infrastructure projects whilst under growing pressure from the London Colonial Office which was desiring to reassert imperial control in southern Africa. Distin's blunt and informal language in the General Assembly made him relatively famous during this period. In parliament Distin was described as a small man, with a most characterful nose and accent; but also with a most genial and straightforward personality, \\"rough-and-ready\\" and friendly.The Zingari. Cape Town. 14 July 1871.The Zingari. Cape Town. 7 August 1874. Vol.IV.

The term \\"microtransplantation\\" comes from its mechanism of reaching donor cell microchimerism. Chemotherapy is used by lower doses only to destroy cancer and partially suppress patient’s immune system, which will be reinitiated by donor’s stem cells soon after transplantation, and will play a role as recipient-versus-tumor (RVT) effect combining donor cells’ graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect. Donor’s stem cells, which have been processed, will also accelerate functional recovery of recipient’s hematopoietic stem cells, greatly reducing infections and transplant-related mortality. Practices of microtransplantation has shown none graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) till present, thus immunosuppressive drugs for relieving GVHD wouldn't be necessary. Possible mechanisms of the successful avoidance of GVHD include donor cell microchimerism, less-toxic cells processed prior to transplantation, and the preservation of host immune system that is capable of resisting the GVH alloresponse. Moreover, as HLA- mismatched stem cells are employed, donor availability is extremely extended. Medical Uses = Indications = Indications for microtransplantation are as follows: Hematologic Malignancies Tumors * Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) * chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) * Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) * Intermediate- or high-risk Non-Hodgkin lymphoma * High-risk Hodgkin lymphoma * Multiplemyeloma (MM) * Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) = Stem cell sources = The cells employed are allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells. Matched HLA between donor and recipient is not necessary. The stem cells are collected from donor’s blood through a process known as apheresis after a certain period of daily subcutaneous injections of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation. Fresh cells are infused to recipient for the first time, and then stored in a controlled-rate freezer. Donor’s Requirements: * Mismatched HLA with recipient * Age between 18 and 60 years old * Good overall state of health * No major heart or lung surgical history * No infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis or syphilis, etc. * No bone marrow disorder, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, cardiopulmonary insufficiency, hematological disorder or tumor * Not allergic to G-CSF * Not pregnant or lactating Clinical Studies In a randomized controlled trial from 2004 to 2009, 58 AML patients aged 60–88 years were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (control group; n=28) or it plus HLA-mismatched G-CSF–mobilized donor peripheral blood stem cell (G-PBSC) (G-PBSC group/ Microtransplantation; n = 30). The complete remission rate was significantly higher in the G-PBSC group than in the control group (80.0% vs 42.8%); The median recovery times of neutrophils and platelets were 11 days and 14.5 days, respectively, in the G-PBSC group and 16 days and 20 days, respectively, in the control group after chemotherapy; The 2-year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly higher in the G-PBSC group than in the control group (38.9% vs 10.0%). No graft-versus-host disease was observed in any patient. Persistent donor microchimerism was successfully detected in all of the 4 female patients. In another long-term research from 2004–2011, 101 patients with AML-CR1 (9 to 65 years old) received Microtransplantation regimen. The 6-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 84.4% and 89.5%, respectively, in the low-risk group, which were similar to the rates in the intermediate-risk group (59.2% and 65.2%, respectively); The 6-year LFS and OS were 76.4% and 82.1%, respectively, in patients who received a high dose of donor CD3+ T cells, which were significantly higher than the LFS and OS in patients who received a lower dose of donor CD3+ T cells (49.5% and 55.3%, respectively). No GVHD was observed in any of the patients. The positive results have also been verified by healthcare centers in Italy, America, Spain, etc. Led by Dr. Huisheng Ai and his medical team at MST International Clinic for Leukemia in the 307th Hospital of Chinese People’s Liberation Army located in Beijing, multicenter collaborative study on Microtransplantation has started since 2013 in 9 authoritative blood institutes from China, Duke University and Keck School of Medicine-University of Southern California in United States, University of Sydney in Australia and University of Montreal in Canada.  History  To overcome the intolerable severe reactions of high-dose chemotherapy and GVHD, as well as the challenge to find HLA-matched donors for conventional hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Dr Huisheng Ai, Guo Mei, etc. developed a new regimen of reduced-intensity chemotherapy plus G-CSF mobilized HLA-mismatched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell infusion, which was firstly employed for a 75-year-old patient in 2002 and later named as Microtransplantation.

He was the leader of the opposition Group 24. He was shot and killed on 5 March 2015 in Istanbul, Turkey.  Private life  Umarali Izatovich Quvvatov was born on 21 November 1968 in the city of Dushanbe. He was married and had children.  Political positions  Kuvvatov was a critic of Tajikistani president Emomalii Rahmon, accusing him of nepotism and corruption. He was a leader of the opposition Group 24, which he founded after going into exile in 2012. In October 2014 he publicly called on Tajikistanis to gather for a political protest on 10 October. However, no one showed up to the protests after Tajikistani authorities had blocked websites and deployed armored vehicles. The Supreme Court of Tajikistan ruled that Kuvvatov's Group 24 was an extremist movement and banned publications by it. Tajik authorities had blocked hundreds of websites after Group 24 used social media to call for an antigovernment protest in Dushanbe on 10 October 2014. Besides, a court in Dushanbe has sentenced Umedjon Solehov to 17 1/2 years in jail for his being a member of this opposition movement.Tajik Activist Sentenced To More Than 17 Years In Jail by RFE/RL's Tajik Service 04 March 2015 Eurasianet reported that Kuvvatov was not widely known or liked before the failed protests, but that he became much more known afterwards. Exile In 2012 Kuvvatov went into exile to first Russia and later the United Arab Emirates after Tajikistan asked for his extradition. He was arrested in Dubai in September 2012 at the behest of Tajikistan. He was released in September 2013 after obtaining a pardon. Kuvvatov went to Turkey, where he was arrested on 20 December 2014 on an alleged visa violation. His extradition was once more sought by Tajikistan, for extremism, economic crimes and hostage-taking. Turkey however refused extradition.  Death  According to Turkish media reports, conspirators planned his murder for three months. At first they wanted to poison Kuvvatov at the joint dinner on the night of 5 to 6 March 2015 in Istanbul. Then the killers used weapons and Kuvvatov was shot dead with a single bullet to his head when he got outside trying to reach the nearest hospital. Rahmatullo Zoyirov, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan, told RFE/RL's Tajik Service that Quvvatov's killing had been pre-planned. Quvvatov's wife, Kumriniso Hafizova, told RFE/RL on 8 March that she, her husband and their two sons had been invited for dinner at the house of Sulaimon Qayumov, a 30-year-old Tajik citizen. Qayumov has been living in Turkey for three months and positioned himself as a Quvvatov sympathizer. After dinner, Quvvatov and his family members felt sick and rushed out for fresh air. When they were outside, an unidentified Tajik-speaking man approached Quvvatov from behind, fired a single shot to his head and immediately fled the scene. The 47-year-old entrepreneur was already dead when medics arrived at the scene and police searched the area for evidence. Turkish media also reported that Mr Kuvatov's wife and children had symptoms of poisoning. Some observers have drawn parallels between the murder of Umarali Quvvatov and the late February assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. Speaking to journalists on 6 March, Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader of the opposition Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, compared the killing to the recent deaths of Nemtsov and Rakhat Aliyev, the former son-in- law of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Rajabi Mirzo, an independent political analyst, described Quvvatov's death as a \\"shameful and terrible event\\" that could be compared with Nemtsov's killing. \\"Nemtsov was killed the day before the announced rally, and Quvatov after the announcement of the [parliamentary] election results,\\" he wrote.

In Australia, it is commonly known as the mouth almighty. Description G. aprion has a creamy-brown background colour and six to eight irregularly shaped, broken markings which are similar to bars; these are darker olive- brown in colour and they reach the ventral side. They also have many irregular, darker brown spots and blotches, which vary in size, and a dark bar which runs from the eye to gills. The first dorsal fin is sooty in colour, with the outer half much darker than the inner part, as are the pelvic and the inner parts of second dorsal and anal fins. Also, dark spots and marbling are on these fins. This species grows to a maximum standard length of , although standard lengths of are normal. Distribution G. aprion is widespread in northern Australia, where its occurs in rivers, creeks, and lagoons from the Fitzroy River in the West Kimberley region of Western Australia to the Burnett River in Queensland. It is found in similar habitats in New Guinea. Habitat and ecology G. aprion is native to still or slowly flowing fresh waters, where it shelters in aquatic vegetation growing in the shallows near the edges. It is a nocturnal species which ambushes its prey, mainly small crustaceans, insects, and smaller fish. The female lays a relatively small number of large eggs. These are brooded by the male in his mouth, and the larvae hatch at a quite advanced stage.

History  Originally named after SS. Constantine and Helen, the church was part of the now disappeared Michael the Brave \\"gymnasium\\" for boys, built between 1898 and 1902 by the architect Mihail Seroținski. The church was not built at the same time as other buildings of the gymnasium. Its construction completely relied on the initiative of the protector of the establishment, the public figure and philanthropist Constantin A. Namestnik. He sought by any means to achieve the construction of the monument, to such a point that he engaged his responsibility for the good progress of the works on his own fortune. Construction began in 1899 under the authority of Seroținski. The church was consecrated on 19 May 1902. During the Cold War the space race was raging between United States and USSR. After the success of Yuri Gagarin in 1961 a great propaganda campaign was initiated across the Soviet Union and many planetaria began to appear. Churches, useless as the gospel was generally forbidden, were sometimes transformed into planetaria because of their domes. This was the fate of the Transfiguration Church from 1962 until a fire ravaged it in 1990. The devices for the planetarium were too expensive to make the rebuilding profitable and the attraction closed for good on 24 October 1991. The wrecked building was eventually handed back to the Orthodox Church. After several refurbishment works during the post-Soviet years, the church is now completely renovated and open to the public.

History According to Coxeter, in 1926 John Flinders Petrie generalized the concept of regular skew polygons (nonplanar polygons) to finite regular skew polyhedra in 4-dimensions, and infinite regular skew apeirohedra in 3-dimensions (described here). Coxeter identified 3 forms, with planar faces and skew vertex figures, two are complements of each other. They are all named with a modified Schläfli symbol {l,mn}, where there are l-gonal faces, m faces around each vertex, with holes identified as n-gonal missing faces. Coxeter offered a modified Schläfli symbol {l,mn} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the vertex figure, m l-gons around a vertex, and n-gonal holes. Their vertex figures are skew polygons, zig-zagging between two planes. The regular skew polyhedra, represented by {l,mn}, follow this equation: * 2 sin(/l) · sin(/m) = cos(/n) Regular skew apeirohedra of Euclidean 3-space The three Euclidean solutions in 3-space are {4,64}, {6,44}, and {6,63}. John Conway named them mucube, muoctahedron, and mutetrahedron respectively for multiple cube, octahedron, and tetrahedron.The Symmetry of Things, 2008, Chapter 23 Objects with Primary Symmetry, Infinite Platonic Polyhedra, pp. 333–335 #Mucube: {4,64}: 6 squares on a vertex (related to cubic honeycomb, constructed by cubic cells, removing two opposite faces from each, and linking sets of six together around a faceless cube.) #Muoctahedron: {6,44}: 4 hexagons on a vertex (related to bitruncated cubic honeycomb, constructed by truncated octahedron with their square faces removed and linking hole pairs of holes together.) #Mutetrahedron: {6,63}: 6 hexagons on a vertex (related to quarter cubic honeycomb, constructed by truncated tetrahedron cells, removing triangle faces, and linking sets of four around a faceless tetrahedron.) Coxeter gives these regular skew apeirohedra {2q,2rp} with extended chiral symmetry (p,q,p,r)]+] which he says is isomorphic to his abstract group (2q,2r2,p).

Regular Skew Polyhedra in Hyperbolic Three- Space. Can. J. Math. 19, 1179–1186, 1967. Note: His paper says there are 32, but one is self-dual, leaving 31. These represent 14 compact and 17 paracompact regular skew polyhedra in hyperbolic space, constructed from the symmetry of a subset of linear and cyclic Coxeter groups graphs of the form (p,q,p,r), These define regular skew polyhedra {2q,2rp} and dual {2r,2qp}. For the special case of linear graph groups r = 2, this represents the Coxeter group [p,q,p]. It generates regular skews {2q,4p} and {4,2qp}. All of these exist as a subset of faces of the convex uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space.

The Spanish Revolution ended the moderate decade (Década moderada) (1844-1854) and started the progressive biennium (Bienio progresista) (1854-1856).

Aiton, belonging to the family of Asteraceae, is a Southern African woody shrub or small tree endemic to the West Coast and found from Saldanha Bay in the south across the Gariep into the south-west corner of Namibia. Growing 2–3 m tall and drought-resistant, its preferred habitat is on dry, rocky slopes. This species was introduced to Europe by Thunberg and Masson.'Encyclopaedia Londinensis', Volume 5 Leaves are opposite, shiny, oval to elliptic with margins rolled under (revolute) with irregular spine-tipped teeth - young leaves and twigs somewhat felted; flowers with an outer row of unusually large and leaf-like bracts with mucronate apices, and which become membranous with age; fruits in spine-fringed cells. Flowering takes place from midwinter to early spring. There are only 2 species in this genus, the other being Didelta carnosa (L.f.) Aiton.http://treeatlas.biodiversity.org.na/viewspec.php?nr=201 Recent phylogeny studies have placed the genus Didelta and Berkheya spinosissima on the same clade. The beetle Julodis viridipes Laporte has been recorded feeding on the foliage of D. spinosa, whereas the nematodes Scutellonema brachyurus, Paratrichodorus meyeri and Xiphinema loteni have a close association with the tree. History thumb The two currently recognised species of Didelta were first described in 1781 by Carl Linnaeus the Younger and placed in the genus Polymnia, an American genus to which they were ill-suited. In 1785 a detailed colour plate by Buc'hoz was published in Grand Jardin de l'Univers of a plant that had been cultivated at Trianon and named Breteuillia trianensis by him - the plant clearly being Linnaeus' Polymnia carnosa. The genus Didelta was based on this same plant and published in L'Heritier's Stirpes novae in 1786 as Didelta tetragoniifolia. The genus Breteuillia thus predates Didelta but Burtt recommended that the name Didelta should be conserved because of its wide usage. Didelta tetragoniifolia was later shown to be Linnaeus the Younger's Polymnia carnosa, and this species, together with its sibling Polymnia spinosa, was transferred to Didelta. Joseph Gaertner in his monumental work \\"De frvctibvs et seminibvs plantarvm\\" of 1788-1792 published the species as Favonium spinosum (see illustration). Thunberg in his 1800 work Prodromus Plantarum Capensium v2 p163 placed both species in a new genus Choristea.

Gurdwara Nanak Jhira Sahib was built in the year 1948 and is dedicated to the first Sikh guru Guru Nanak. Bidar has a very long association with Sikhism as this is the home town of Bhai Sahib Singh, one of the Panj Pyare (five beloved ones), who offered to sacrifice their heads and were later baptised as the first members of the Khalsa. Gurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib at Bidar, Karnataka Description The Gurudwara is established in a nice valley, surrounded by laterite hills on three sides. The shrine comprises Darbar Sahib, Diwan Hall and Langar Hall. In the sukhaasan room, Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikh is placed. There is a separate room called the Likhari Room, where donations are accepted and receipts are issued. Inside Gurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib A beautiful Gurdwara has been constructed after the independence of India in 1948 by the side of the spring. The water from the spring is collected in a small Amrit Kund (a holy water tank) built opposite to the front stairs of the Gurudwara . It is believed that a holy dip is enough to cleanse the body as well as the soul. There is a free community kitchen (Guru Ka Langar) where free food is given to pilgrims 24 hours night and day. A Sikh museum has been built in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur, depicting the important events of Sikh history through pictures and paintings. History During his second udasi (missionary tour) of south India between 1510-1514 A.D., Guru Nanak after sojourning through Nagpur and Khandwa visited the ancient Hindu temple of Omkareshwar on the Narmada and reached Nanded (where 200 years later Guru Gobind Singh spent his last days). From Nanded he proceeded towards Hyderabad and Golconda where he met Muslim saints and then arrived at Bidar to meet Pir Jalaluddin and Yakoob Ali. According to the Janamsakhis, the Guru accompanied by his companion Mardana stayed in the outskirts of the Bidar. Nearby were the huts of Muslim fakirs, who took keen interest in the sermons and teachings of the great guru. The news soon spread throughout Bidar and its surrounding areas about the holy saint of the north and large number of people started coming to him to have his darshan and seek his blessings. There used to be acute shortage of drinking water in Bidar. All efforts of the people to dig wells were of no avail. Even when wells produced water the water was found to be unfit for drinking. The guru was greatly moved by the miserable condition of the people, and while uttering Sat Kartar, shifted a stone and removed some rubble from the place with his wooden sandal. To the utter surprise of all, a spring of cool and fresh water that has flowed to this day. This is how the place soon came to be known as Nanak Jhira (Jhira=Stream). The crystal clear stream that still flows out of a rock near the Gurudwara is believed to be God's answer to the Guru's prayers. Another version of Guru Nanak's visit to Bidar has him visiting a Sufi saint who lived with his family and followers here amidst a source of fresh, sweet water and that is where the Gurudwara eventually came to be. Geology Though Bidar is at an elevation, the gurdwara is at a lower level. It is located amidst the slopes of the hilly terrain. The lateritic rock formation under the plateau enables percolation of surface water. Bidar urban plateau is of irregular shape, land stretching about 35.4 km in length and 19.3 km in width. The plateau consists of red laterite rocky crust, of a depth varying from 30.5 m to 152.4 m supported on impervious trap base. This has resulted in springs at the cleavages between trap and laterite rocks. Such water springs can be observed in Bidar also at Narasimha Jharni, Papanasha Shiva Temple etc. Significance It may be recalled that Bhai Sahib Singh, one of The Panj Piaras (five beloved of Guru Gobind Singh), hailed from Bidar where he was once a barber. He was the son of Gurunarayana and Ankamma from Bidar. The spring is flowing since more than 500 years and has never dried out. Devotees throng to the Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwara especially during Guru Nanak Jayanti. Volunteers make elaborate preparations to celebrate the Guru Nanak Jayanti, which is one of the major festivals of the Sikhs. Preparations include cleaning the gurudwara, guarding the shoes of visitors and helping out in the kitchen. The gurudwara is especially adorned with flags, banners and lights for this occasion. In respect of Gurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Sahib, It will not be out of place to mention that this Gurudwara is second super natural occurrences of Guru Nanak, whereas, the first one was Sri Punja Sahib (Now in Pakistan & strictly prohibited for free visits), Hence Gurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib is Second Punja Sahib of India. Nearly four to five lakh pilgrims visit this gurudwara every year. Part of the towns business comes from these crowds who gather at the spot built around water. It stands to reason therefore that special attention is paid to the spring and great care taken of this water resource. The Gurudwara itself has organized the tunnel and the point where the spring emerges very well. A glass panel enables viewing, yet protects the spring from desecration. Visitors and Pilgrims carry the \\"holy\\" water from the spring in bottles and water-cans. Concerns The recharge zone of the spring, the surrounding hills are being built upon at an unprecedented rate. Septic tanks and soak pits are sending the waste-water generated into the ground. The surface is being crusted up with roads and buildings preventing the seepage of water into the ground. It is likely that the sacred ‘Jhira’ will first be contaminated by the bad water and if steps are not taken quickly, may also run dry due to lack of recharge of waters in the hills. Nearby Pilgrim Centre * Gurudwara of Mai Bhagoji at Janawada village of Bidar taluk, 10 km away from Bidar city. It is said that when Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji came to Nanded in Maharashtra from Punjab, Mai Bhagoji had accompanied Guruji. During her stay at Janwada at the residence of Rustam Rao and Bala Rao, land lords of the region, Mata Mai Bhagoji popularised the message of Sikhism. As a mark of respect, a gurudwara in her name of Mai Bhagoji had been built at Janwada village and was managed by Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee of Sri Nank Jhira Saheb, Bidar.

Archeologists found in 1958 in Vlaardingen, a city near Rotterdam, objects from the period between 3500 BC and 2500 BC which justify the designation as a separate culture. Utensils were made of wood and bone, and polished small stone axes were found, which appear to originate from Belgium. Also needles and the remains of a primitive canoe were found. This hunting and fishing culture was sedentary and semi-nomadic. In the old dunes at the then much further east lying coastline the remains of some peasant settlements were found. From these findings it can be deduced that animal husbandry (sheep and goats) and agriculture (wheat and barley) had been practised on a small scale. Vlaardingen culture had also traits of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer society because agriculture in much of the Wadden Sea area and the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta was difficult. Hunting and fishing were important means of livelihood. Bones found near the settlements of deer, bears, otters and sturgeon support that. Vlaardingen culture co-existed with the more land inward Funnel beaker culture to which it shows similarities and differences. Based on the pottery and the occupied environment, the Vlaardingen culture and the Funnel beaker culture seem clearly distinguishable from one another. When the Funnel beaker culture ceased to exist, the Corded Ware culture succeeded it. The Vlaardingen culture, however, endures in the west (3400–2500 BC), until it was finally succeeded by the Corded Ware culture as well.

He plays at wing and full back. He has recently moved to Harlequins. Previously he had dual-registration with Saracens F.C. and Bedford Blues. Earle played for a young England XV against the Barbarians, scoring his first try on debut. Earle was called up to the senior England squad by Eddie Jones for their 2017 summer tour of Argentina. Domestic Performance =Saracens= Earle joined the junior academy of Saracens at the age of 14, in 2011, while still at Cranbrook's. In order to get additional training time with them he chose to move to Oaklands college during his sixth form years. He notes former super-star Richard Hill as being particularly crucial to his time in the academy. While in the senior academy at the age of 17 he would play in the Saracens' team against the Asian Barbarians. This included a notable try where he defeated renowned All Black full-back, Mils Muliaina. Earle himself said this was less due to a particular physical or skill level of his but instead \\"I’d say he was so hungover in that game, and I was fresh as a daisy – I in-outed him, and then put the afterburners on\\". His first-team debut occurred in 2012, against Worcester Warriors in the Anglo- Welsh tournament. However, in the 2013/14 season, Earle would only participate in 3 first-team games. Between injury and lack of opportunities Earle also received few chances to perform at first-team level in both the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons. However, in the 2016/17 season, due to injury and suspensions among other Saracens' wingers, Earle received a number of chances to perform. This included 7 Premiership games, 3 Anglo-Welsh and 3 European (ECC) games. It was these performances that would lead to additional England interest. The 2017/18 season was anticipated to also have a higher rate of winger rotation, due to multiple international call-ups, and Earle participated in 14 Aviva Premiership games alone, scoring 7 tries - placing him in the top 5 try scorers for Saracens in the tournament. Earle ended his season by coming on as a replacement and scoring one of Saracens' tries in the Premiership final as they defeated Exeter 27-10. =Old Albanians= Towards the halfway point of the 2013/14 season, in order to enable more play, Earle was dual-registered with Old Albanians, then in National League 1, where he would play 8 games over the remainder of the season. =Bedford Blues= After a season of minimal first-team play with Saracens, Earle was dual-registered with Bedford Blues, and participated well against Saracens in a pre-season game. However, in the first game of the season Earle suffered a major injury to his Achilles tendon. There was significant consideration that the damage was so severe that Earle would have to leave his rugby career. However medical reconstruction and very long term physio-therapy allowed him to return to play within 9 months, although Earle stated that the injury \\"did not feel normal for 18 months\\". =London Scottish= In the 2015/16 season following the injury and recovery, due to a lack of junior player potential game-time (due to the absence of an Anglo-Welsh competition) played five times for London Scottish, between the British & Irish Cup and the Championship. =Sumner Rugby & Canterbury= In May 2016, after again having had relatively little first team play, Mark McCall suggested he spend 6 months in Christchurch, New Zealand, playing southern hemisphere rugby. Earles originally played for the amateur/semi-pro side Sumner Rugby which plays in the Christchurch league. Already known by then Canterbury coach Scott Robertson (rugby union), as well as Scott's assistant, former Saracen Joe Maddock (rugby union) his performances for the club would get him invited to play with Canterbury for the remainder of his six months in New Zealand. Earles would be selected for 10 of Canterbury's games, including participating in both the team that would win the Mitre 10 cup, where he scored a try, and the side that won the Ranfurly shield. As a side note, he received his only yellow card of all his performances as of September 2018. After his return, Earle stated the time with the Southern Hemisphere team was particularly beneficial, especially his training with Joe Maddock. Earle cited several specific areas that he found improved while at Canterbury. He said the focus was on on-pitch training as opposed to gym work, with a corresponding focus on those skills. He also enjoyed the looser, faster-flowing, form of rugby as suited to his own style of play, particularly with Maddock's passing on expertise in quicker reading of the game. Finally he noted that the New Zealand club side had an enormous focus on \\"micro-skills\\" which targets extremely fine details such as foot placement. =Harlequins= Towards the end of the 2017/18 season it was announced that Earle would join Harlequins, with a heavy indication that the move was to enable additional game time.

Rather than using a big band, the trumpeter is well showcased while backed by a large string section on ten moody originals ...much of the music is quite mellow. A definite change of pace\\". On All About Jazz, John Kelman observed \\"Haiku finds Ellis in largely lyrical territory with a core quintet and varying configurations of a 12-piece string orchestra. Some tracks work better than others, but all point to a musical mind unencumbered by convention, even as he aimed, on other albums, for greater commercial success ...A tad inconsistent, perhaps, but Haiku still possesses more charm than syrup; an alternate, lyrical, and more deeply introspective view of the usually more boisterous Ellis—signaling, perhaps, a new direction that, sadly, he'd not be around long enough to explore further..\\"Kelman, J., All About Jazz Review, March 30, 2010 The Guardian's John Fordham noted \\"This 1973 recording with a strings ensemble is very different from his adventurous work with mind- boggling time signatures in the 60s. But an Ellis venture is never without surprises. All the segments are inspired by haiku, and they reflect that form's brevity. ...The leader's unique brass sound embraced technical security, classical purity and an old jazz-brass swagger, and if some of the music gets a little Disney, it's an object lesson in orchestral writing for improvisers.\\" Fordham, J., The Guardian Review, June 4, 2010  Track listing  All compositions by Don Ellis # \\"Children\\" - 3:30 # \\"Blossoming\\" - 3:52 # \\"Water Jewel\\" - 5:23 # \\"Cherry Petals\\" - 2:47 # \\"Forest\\" - 3:30 # \\"Summer Rain\\" - 2:20 # \\"Two Autumns\\" - 4:57 # \\"Mirror-Pond of Stars\\" - 3:25 # \\"Parting\\" - 6:18 # \\"Dew\\" - 1:28  Personnel  *Don Ellis – trumpet and arranger *Milcho Leviev – keyboards *Larry Carlton (tracks 2 & 7), David Cohen (tracks 1, 3, 6 & 8), Tommy Tedesco (tracks 4, 9 & 10) – guitar *Ray Brown – bass *John Guerin – drums *Israel Baker, Erno Neufeld, Jacob Krachmalnik, George Kast, George Berres, Gerald Vinci, Shirley Cornell, Marcia van Dyck & Marvin Limonick – violin *Samuel Voghossian, Alfred Barr & Dan Neufeld (tracks 1-3 & 5-8), Allan Harshman, David Schwarz & Myra Kestenbaum (tracks 4, 9 & 10) – viola *Raphael Kramer, Frederick Seykora, Ronald Cooper & Catherine Gotthofer – cello  References  Category:Don Ellis albums Category:1974 albums Category:MPS Records albums ","title":"Haiku (Don Ellis album)"},{"id":"45593998","text":"Ballinrobe GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the town of Ballinrobe in south County Mayo, Ireland.

Although generally the \\"juice\\" is sweetened and chilled, it is technically an infusion and when served hot can also be referred to as hibiscus tea. Overview Roselle juice, often taken refrigerated, is a cool drink found in many West African countries and the Caribbean. It is a dark red-purple coloured juice. The Burkinabes, Senegalese, and Ivorians call it bissap while the Ghanaians and Nigerians call it sobolo. It tastes a bit grapey and a little like cranberry juice and can be served with mint leaves. It can also be served with any flavouring of one's choice — sometimes with orange essence or ginger, pineapple juice, tea grass, vanilla, and many others. In Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal, roselle juice is served cold, while in Egypt, it is served warm. Preparation Roselle juice is prepared with water, bissap flowers, sugar and sometimes other flavouring ingredients such as ginger. *Wash your bissap flowers in clean water. *Either pour boiling water over the flowers, or put flowers into water and allow to boil, or soak in water overnight. *If mixing with tea grass, you can boil together with the leaves. *If using boiling method, remove from fire. *Drain with a strainer to separate flowers from flavoured water. *Sweeten to taste with sugar (if not using pineapple juice). *Allow to cool before adding other ingredients. *You may add pineapple juice and other ingredients at this point. *Allow to cool if it is still hot, then refrigerate and serve. = Health benefits = Roselle juice, which acts as a diuretic, has been shown to regulate blood pressure and reduce hypertension. It also has high levels of vitamin C, so is used to treat the common cold and otherwise boost the immune system. Some studies have also shown antimicrobial activity.
