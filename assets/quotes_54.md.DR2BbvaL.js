They were not designed as vases for a cut bloom, as is sometimes supposed, though they could also be used for this. The boughpot and flower brick were types of vase for this.  History  While fairly uncommon in modernity, during the 17th century tulipieres were used to grow tulip bulbs indoors and were common pieces of decorative art that could often be found in the houses of European elites. After the advent of large-scale global trade in the 17th century, numerous flower bulbs from Asia such as the tulip, crocus, and hyacinth became luxury items in Europe and these bulbs remained an exotic novelty until the end of the 17th century. Large floor-standing pyramid-shaped tulipieres were particularly ornate and were used as a status symbol to indicate the owner's wealth.

She was one of the first southern white women to speak out and work publicly against lynching of African Americans, murders which white men claimed to commit in an effort to protect women's \\"virtue.\\" Despite risks to her personal safety, Ames stood up to these men and led organized efforts by white women to protest lynchings. She gained 40,000 signatures of southern women to oppose lynching, helping change attitudes and bring about a decline in these murders in the 1930s and 1940s.Dickson D. Bruce, Jr. \\"Antilynching Campaign\\" excerpted from The Oxford Companion to Women’s Writing in the United States. Accessed 15 January 2008.  Biography  Ames was born Jessie Harriet Daniel in Palestine, Texas on November 2, 1883. Her mother was Laura Maria Leonard and her father was James Malcolm Daniel. In 1893, the family moved to Georgetown, Texas.Jon D. Swartz, “Jessie Harriet Daniel Ames” in Jessica Brannon-Wranosky, ed. Texas Women and the Vote. Austin: Texas State Historical Association, 2019, pp. 13-14. Ames was admitted to the Ladies Annex of Southwestern University at the age of 13 and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1902. After graduation, she moved with her family to Laredo, Texas. Ames followed her mother and sister and converted to Methodism despite her father's objection as a nonbeliever. She had joined them in church activities from an early age.Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, Revolt Against Chivalry. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993. In 1905, Ames married Roger Post Ames, a surgeon in the United States Army, who had worked with Walter Reed in Cuba to prove that mosquitoes caused malaria. During much of their unhappy marriage, Roger Ames lived in Central America where he worked as a physician to the American Consul and the United Fruit Company. Roger Ames died in 1914 in Guatemala from blackwater fever. Ames had a son and two daughters, the last of whom was born in 1914 after her husband's death. After the death of her father in 1911, Ames helped her mother run the family's telephone company in Georgetown. She also became involved with several Methodist women's groups. This led to her initial participation in the women's suffrage movement.  Suffrage movement and League of Women Voters  In 1916, Ames organized the Georgetown Equal Suffrage League and became its first president. She also wrote a weekly suffrage article in the Williamson County Sun newspaper called \\"Woman Suffrage Notes.\\" Ames became a protégé of Minnie Fisher Cunningham, the president of the Texas Equal Suffrage Association (TESA). In 1918, Ames was elected treasurer of the TESA. Texas became the first southern state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment in June 1919. In October 1919, Ames founded the Texas League of Women Voters and served as its first president until 1923.Dorothy Brown, “Sixty Five Going on Fifty: A History of the League of Women Voters of Texas, 1903-1969.” MS. League of Women Voters Files. Austin, Texas. 1969. Accessed on April 13, 2019. www.my.lwv.org/texas/history. In 1923, she represented the national League of Women Voters at the Pan American Congress. She also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1920, 1924, and 1928. Ames served in several other organizations including the Texas branch of the American Association of University Women, Texas Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor, and the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. She was an officer of the Joint Legislative Council in Texas, also known as the Petticoat Lobby, and was on the Board of Education of the Women's Division of the Methodist Church. In 1924, Ames became the director of the Texas Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC) based in Atlanta. In 1929, she moved to Atlanta to become the national director of the CIC Woman's Committee.  Crockett State School  The project to create a home and training school for delinquent African American girls was one of the few instances of interracial cooperation among Texas women. Between 1916 and 1945, the Texas Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (TACWC) campaigned for the creation of the institution and offered to donate the land.“Texas Association of Women’s Clubs,” Texas Woman’s University: Woman’s Collection. www.twudigital.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16283coll10. Accessed April 19, 2019. In 1923, the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs and the Joint Legislative Council, both white women's organizations, endorsed the concept. That year, the TACWC raised $2,000 for the down payment on a home. The organization bought land in San Antonio and was able to offer $5,500 as a downpayment. In 1926, Ames toured the state speaking on behalf of the project to white women's organizations. The Texas legislature passed a bill in 1927 creating the home and school for delinquent black girls but made no appropriations. It took 18 years before the Texas legislature approved funding. In 1945, the legislature appropriated $60,000 to establish the Brady State School for Negro Girls located in a former prisoner of war camp near Brady, Texas. In 1950, the school relocated to Crockett, Texas and was renamed the Crockett State School for Girls.  Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching  In 1930, Ames, with the CIC's financial help, founded the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching (ASWPL) with headquarters in Atlanta.Ruthe Winegarten, Black Texas Women: 150 Years of Trial and Triumph. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1995. The organization excluded African American women and appealed directly to white southern women to stop lynching. The ASWPL secured the signatures of 40,000 southern women on its 'Pledge Against Lynching' (see below). Despite encountering hostile opposition and threats of violence, the women conducted petition drives, lobbying and fundraising across the South to work against lynching.Angela Y. Davis, Women, Race & Class. New York: Vintage Books, 1983, p.194 By 1940, more than 100 women's organizations had joined the movement against lynching. Pledge: > We declare lynching is an indefensible crime, destructive of all principles > of government, hateful and hostile to every ideal of religion and humanity, > debasing and degrading to every person involved...[P]ublic opinion has > accepted too easily the claim of lynchers and mobsters that they are acting > solely in defense of womanhood.

Davis, Women, Race & > Class. New York: Vintage Books, 1983, pp. 194-195 Ames opposed a federal anti-lynching law and advocated instead for individual state laws outlawing lynching. Senators from the South filibustered the proposed federal Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which was advocated by an African American women's group called the Anti-Lynching Crusaders. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had created the Anti-Lynching Crusaders in 1922 to mobilize support for the Dyer Bill. White Democrats from the Solid South commanded powerful congressional positions due to the disenfranchisement of African Americans across the South. Senator Tom Connally of Texas used a letter written to him from Ames to show widespread southern opposition to the federal bill. Ames intended the letter to be private in order to allow her to speak out in opposition to lynching when the bill failed. Ames served as the director of the ASWPL until 1942. By February 1937, 81 state, regional and national organizations had endorsed the anti- lynching platform of the ASWPL. That year, the CIC was replaced by the Southern Regional Council. The number of lynchings decreased as the Great Depression came to an end, although notable lynchings took place in the postwar era, including of black men in uniform.  Death and legacy  Ames retired to Tryon, North Carolina before returning to Texas in 1968 to live with her younger daughter. Jessie Daniel Ames died of pneumonia on February 21, 1972 in Austin, Texas. She is buried in the family plot in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery in Georgetown, Texas. In 1985, the Jessie Daniel Ames Lecture Series began at Southwestern University. Her career as an activist for suffrage and against lynching was the subject of the Freshman Symposium at Southwestern University in 1985 and the Brown Symposium at the university in 1986.

In 697, he was accused of plotting to falsely accuse Wu Zetian's sons and other family members of treason, and he was executed.  Background  It is not known when Lai Junchen was born, but it is known that he was from Wannian County (), one of the two counties making up the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. His father was one Lai Cao () -- who was said to have won Lai Junchen's mother, then the wife of his friend Cai Ben (), after winning in gambling with Cai. Lai Junchen was said to be a thug who did not work, who was investigated for thievery while he was at He Prefecture (和州, roughly modern Chaohu, Anhui) and who then made false accusations against others to the prefect, Li Xu () the Prince of Dongping, a cousin of then- reigning Emperor Ruizong. Li Xu had him caned 100 times and thrown out. In 689, in the aftermath of rebellions against Emperor Ruizong's mother and regent Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) by Emperor Ruizong's uncle Li Zhen the Prince of Yue and Li Chong the Prince of Langye, Li Xu, along with many other imperial Li clan members, was executed by Empress Dowager Wu. Lai again made a secret report, this time directly to Empress Dowager Wu, who encouraged such reports from anyone. When she met with him, he claimed that what he was reporting earlier dealt with Li Zhen's and Li Chong's rebellions, and that Li Xu had improperly suppressed them. Empress Dowager Wu believed him and thought he was faithful to her, and therefore made him a secret police official, rising to the rank of deputy imperial censor (御史中丞, Yushi Zhongcheng).  First stint as secret police official  It was said that Lai Junchen personally retained a staff of several hundred men who were previously thugs, with the intent to have them make reports. If he decided to falsely implicate someone in a crime, then he had the men submit false reports that corroborate each other. Lai and his assistant Wan Guojun () even authored a text known as the Classic of Accusation (), teaching their subordinates how to accuse people of crimes and how to create details that make the alleged plot appear logical and likely. Lai and the other secret police officials were also said to have created a number of torture methods and equipments to get the accused to confess, and further, each time he knew that a general pardon was set to be issued, he had the jailers kill important prisoners first before the general pardon would be declared. Lai's authorities continued to grow, particularly after Empress Dowager Wu herself took the throne in 690 as \\"emperor\\" of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang and reducing Emperor Ruizong to the rank of crown prince. In 691, the official Liu Xinggan () was accused of treason. Wu Zetian had the chancellor Shi Wuzi investigate along with Lai. After Liu Xinggan and his brothers were executed for treason, Lai further reported to Wu Zetian that Shi had good relations with Liu Xinggan and had tried to hide evidence of Liu Xinggan's guilt. Wu Zetian had Lai investigate Shi as well and Shi, in fear, committed suicide. That year, a famous incident involving Lai and fellow secret police official Zhou Xing occurred. Earlier that year, the general Qiu Shenji () had been accused of crime and executed, and subsequently, there were secret reports that Zhou was involved with Qiu's crimes. Wu Zetian had Lai investigate, without Zhou's knowledge. One day, Lai and Zhou sat down to lunch, and Lai asked Zhou the question of, \\"Many of the accused are not willing to confess. Do you have an idea on how to get them to confess?\\" Zhou responded, \\"That is easy. Take a big urn and set a fire under it. Put the accused in it, and surely he will confess everything.\\" Lai had a big urn brought and a fire set underneath, in accordance with Zhou's instructions, and then rose and stated to Zhou, \\"I had received secret instructions from Her Imperial Majesty with regard to you, my brother. Please enter the urn.\\" Zhou, in fear, knelt and confessed. Wu Zetian did not execute Zhou but exiled him, and on the way to his place of exile, Zhou was killed by his enemies. (This incident inspired the Chinese proverb \\"invite the gentleman into the urn\\" (請君入甕, qing jun ru weng), now used for the concept of putting a person into a trap that he himself or she herself had set.) Later that year, when investigating the general Zhang Qianxu (), Lai interrogated Zhang and tortured him severely. Zhang, unable to stand the torture, yelled out to another official in charge of investigations, Xu Yougong (), who was known for being merciful. Angry that Zhang was yelling out to Xu, Lai had his guards slash Zhang to death with their swords and then beheaded him. When he subsequently investigated the prefect Yun Hongsi (), he did not bother interrogating Yun—he just beheaded Yun and then forged a confession from Yun. Yet later that year, the chancellors Cen Changqian and Ge Fuyuan offended Wu Zetian by strenuously opposing the proposal to elevate her powerful nephew Wu Chengsi to be crown prince, and she had them arrested. Lai coerced Cen's son the county magistrate of Lingyuan into implicating another chancellor, Ouyang Tong, whom Lai subsequently arrested and tortured. However, he was unable to get Ouyang to admit to treason, and so he forged a confession from Ouyang. Cen, Ge, and Ouyang were all executed. Lai also killed the general Li Anjing (). In 692, Lai falsely accused the chancellors Ren Zhigu, Di Renjie, and Pei Xingben, along with other officials Cui Xuanli (), Lu Xian (), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen () of treason. Lai tried to induce them to confess by citing an imperial edict that stated that those who confessed would be spared their lives, and Di confessed and was not tortured. He then wrote a petition on his blanket and hid it inside cotton clothes, and then had his family members take the clothes home to be changed into summer clothes. Wu Zetian thereafter became suspicious and inquired with Lai, who responded by forging, in the names of Di and the other officials, submissions thanking Wu Zetian for preparing to execute them. However, the young son of another chancellor who had been executed, Le Sihui, who was seized to be a servant at the ministry of agriculture, made a petition to Wu Zetian and told her that Lai was so skillful at manufacturing charges that even the most honest and faithful individuals would be forced into confessions by Lai. Wu Zetian thereafter summoned the seven accused officials and personally interrogated them, and after they disavowed the forged confessions, released but exiled them. Later that year, Lai demanded a bribe from the general Quan Xiancheng (), the grandson of the former Goguryeo regent Yeon Gaesomun and, when Quan refused, falsely accused Quan of treason and had him strangled. In 693, the officials Pei Feigong () and Fan Yunxian () were accused of secretly meeting with the crown prince Li Dan (the former emperor), and when Fan tried to speak on his own behalf, Lai had his tongue cut off, and then had Pei and Fan both executed by being cut in half at the waist. Wu Zetian decreed that officials would not be allowed to meet with Li Dan. When, subsequently, there were secret accusations that Li Dan was plotting to overthrow her, she had Lai investigate Li Dan's associates, whom Lai arrested and tortured. One of them, An Jinzang, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own abdomen, causing the organs to fall out. When Wu Zetian heard this, she was touched, and she had the imperial physicians treat An, barely saving his life, and on account of An's assurance that Li Dan was not plotting against her, ordered Lai to end his investigations against Li Dan. Meanwhile, Lai falsely accused the minister of public works, Su Gan (), of having been a co-conspirator of Li Chong's, and had him executed. Either in 693 or 694, Lai was accused by the imperial censor JI Lüzhong () of five crimes, including corruption, and initially, Lai was sentenced to death, but Wu Zetian, believing him to have accomplished much for her, spared his life and reduced him to commoner rank—and soon thereafter reinstated him as secretary general of palace affairs (殿中丞, Dianzhong Cheng). Lai was, however, thereafter again accused of corruption, and he was demoted to be a military officer at Tong Prefecture (同州, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi), interrupting his career as a secret police official.  Second stint as secret police official  In 696, Lai Junchen was recalled to then-capital Luoyang to serve as the sheriff of Hegong County (), one of the two counties making up Luoyang. In late 696, the sheriff of Mingtang County (明堂, one of the counties making up Chang'an), Ji Xu, heard about a treasonous plot by the officials Liu Sili (), Qilian Yao (), and Wang Ju () -- as the conspirators believed that Qilian was fated to be emperor one day. Ji relayed the plot to Lai, and had Lai submit a secret report of it. Wu Zetian had Wu Yizong () the Prince of Henan, the grandson of her uncle Wu Shiyi (), investigate. Liu implicated some 36 officials into the plot, and they and their families were executed. Lai, wanting to monopolize the rewards for reporting this plot, was prepared to falsely accuse Ji of crimes as well, but Ji found this out and submitted a secret petition; he was able to meet Wu Zetian, who promoted him, while Lai was further restored to good graces in Wu Zetian's eyes and was promoted to be the deputy minister of husbandry (司僕少卿, Sipu Shaoqing). It was said that, particularly after this restoration to power, Lai did what he could to seize beautiful women for his gratification, finding ways to implicate and execute their husbands and then seize them. (He had been planning to seize a beautiful servant girl of Western Tujue's Jiezhongshizhu Khan Ashina Huseluo, then at Luoyang, and he therefore accused Ashina Huseluo of treason, but Ashina Huseluo escaped death when the chiefs of his subordinate tribes pleaded in front of the palace and cut their own faces to vouch for Ashina Huseluo.) It was further said that he created a book of the officials' names and then randomly chose whom to accuse by drawing lots, and that he compared himself to Shi Le, the founder of Later Zhao. As he had an inimical relationship with the censor Li Zhaode, he and another enemy of Li Zhaode's, Huangfu Wenbei (), falsely accused Li Zhaode of treason, and Li Zhaode was arrested later in 697. Meanwhile, Lai was said to be ready for something much more major—falsely accusing Li Dan, his older brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling (also a former emperor), the Wu clan imperial princes, and Wu Zetian's powerful daughter Princess Taiping, of treason as well, to wipe them out gradually to give himself a chance to start a coup to seize the throne himself. His friend Wei Suizhong (), publicly reported the plot, and the Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping responded by submitting accusations against Lai. Wu Zetian arrested Lai, and Lai was sentenced to death—but Wu Zetian, still believing that he was faithful to her, did not approve the execution order for three days. Only at Ji's urging did she approve the execution, and Lai and Li Zhaode were executed on the same day. It was said that the people mourned Li Zhaode while celebrating Lai's death—with his enemies cutting out his flesh and organs, consuming much of it in anger.

The neighbourhood overlooks the North Saskatchewan River valley. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by Victoria Trail, on the south by Yellowhead Trail, and on the north by Kennedale Ravine. To the east is the North Saskatchewan River valley. Residents have access to the Edmonton LRT system at Belvedere station to the west of the neighbourhood. The LRT provides access to the downtown core, the University of Alberta, Northlands, the Coliseum, and Commonwealth Stadium.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Canon Ridge had a population of living in dwellings, a 17.8% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Residential development  The residential development of the neighbourhood began during the 1960s. According to the 2001 federal census, 6.5% of the residences in the neighbourhood were built during the 1960s and 10.9% were built during the 1970s. Most of the development, however, dates to the 1980s. During the 1980s, four out of every five (78.2%) of all residences were constructed. While a small proportion of residences were built during the early 1990s, residential construction in the neighbourhood was substantially complete by 1991.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/DD23/FEDERAL%202001/Neighbourhood/CANON%20RIDGE.pdf The most common type or residence, according to the 2005 municipal census, is the apartment style condominium in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories.

Most houses in the area are found in cul- de-sacs, except for those on the few main roads Freshbrook has. The suburb is served by a \\"village centre\\" known colloquially as Freshbrook Shops. Adjacent areas are Grange Park to the north, Toothill to the east, Blagrove Industrial Estate to the south, and Windmill Hill Business Park to the west. A new housing development, Wichelstowe, was built southeast of Freshbrook, commencing in 2009. However, this is separated from Freshbrook by Great Western Way and the main railway line. The Swindon ward is called Freshbrook and Grange Park. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 9,889.  History  Freshbrook was built during the early 1980s as part of the 'West Swindon' urban extension of Swindon.  Transport  Main roads are Gainsborough Way, Worsley Road, Rowton Heath Way, and Liskeard Way. Freshbrook is served by Stagecoach West bus service 10 which goes in two directions around Freshbrook: one way to the nearby Link Centre at West Swindon, and the other direction towards Toothill, town centre, Gorse Hill and Kingsdown. Since November 2016, it runs every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 minutes Sundays. Since April 2017, there has been a reduced evening service, with the last 10 bus leaving the town centre at 10:20pm. Prior to this date there was a secondary route, service 55A, which diverted from the main 55 route to Chippenham to serve Freshbrook in the evenings and on Sundays. Prior to service 10, Freshbrook's buses were 8: to Link Centre, town centre, Great Western Hospital and Chiseldon and 9/9A/9B: to Link Centre, town centre, Wroughton and Thorney Park. Together these routes provided the 10 minute frequency (each was every 20 minutes). This was a popular service and as a result, punctuality became poor, resulting in a need to change the service. From early 2007 until 2010, a 54 service also ran through Freshbrook from Wootton Bassett through the town centre and on to Wroughton, every 20 minutes. However this was stopped due to Council cutbacks. Freshbrook is also served by Swindon's Bus Company operating a service for schoolchildren to travel to Ridgeway School in Wroughton. This is the No.154 which has one journey in each direction on school days.  Education  The area has one school, Millbrook Primary School. Freshbrook had two primary schools, Freshbrook and Windmill Hill, but due to an ageing population these were merged to form Millbrook (an amalgamation of the two previous school names), on the site of Freshbrook School. For secondary education, pupils from Freshbrook can attend Lydiard Park Academy, Bradon Forest, or Ridgeway School & Sixth Form College.  Leisure and recreation  The Link Centre lies to one side of Freshbrook and provides entertainment such as a library, ice rink and wall climbing facilities. On the same complex are several local shops and an Asda supermarket.  Representatives  Freshbrook, along with Grange Park and part of Toothill, is served by three local councillors in the Lydiard & Freshbrook ward. At present one councillor is a member of the Labour Party and two councillors are members of the Conservative Party. It forms part of the parliamentary constituency of South Swindon.

In 1997, it was adapted as the pilot of Midsomer Murders, a popular ITV television series based on Graham's books. Plot summary In the fictional village of \\"Badger's Drift\\", the elderly Miss Bellringer insists that her friend, Emily Simpson, did not die of a heart attack as her doctor claims, but was in fact murdered. An autopsy soon proves her right, as a mix of red wine and hemlock is found in the dead woman's system. While the village descends into panic, the murderer strikes again, claiming the life of Mrs. Rainbird. She is discovered by her son Denis, a local undertaker. As Barnaby investigates, aided by Sgt. Gavin Troy, he uncovers a connection between an older crime and the current killings at Badger's Drift. Television series The book was adapted for British television as the first episode of Midsomer Murders, and its broadcast on 23 March 1997 was an enormous ratings success. The episode made its debut in the United States on the A&E; cable network with two showings on the night of 28 June 1998. =Differences= On the screen, Emily Simpson's murder is made more violent.

The concept of a CTQW is believed to have been first considered for quantum computation by Edward Farhi and Sam Gutmann; since many classical algorithms are based on (classical) random walks, the concept of CTQWs were originally considered to see if there could be quantum analogues of these algorithms with e.g. better time-complexity than their classical counterparts. In recent times, problems such as deciding what graphs admit properties such as perfect state transfer with respect to their CTQWs have been of particular interest. Definitions Suppose that G is a graph on n vertices, and that t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. = Continuous-time quantum walks = The continuous-time quantum walk U(t) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Mat}_{n \\\\times n}(\\\\mathbb{C}) on G at time t is defined as:U(t) := e^{itA}letting A denote the adjacency matrix of G. It is also possible to similarly define a continuous-time quantum walk on G relative to its Laplacian matrix; although, unless stated otherwise, a CTQW on a graph will mean a CTQW relative to its adjacency matrix for the remainder of this article. = Mixing matrices = The mixing matrix M(t) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Mat}_{n \\\\times n}(\\\\mathbb{R}) of G at time t is defined as M(t) := U(t) \\\\circ U(-t). Mixing matrices are symmetric doubly-stochastic matrices obtained from CTQWs on graphs: {M(t)}_{u,v} gives the probability of u transitioning to v at time t for any vertices u and v on G. = Periodic vertices = A vertex u on G is said to periodic at time t if {M(t)}_{u,u} = 1. = Perfect state transfer = Distinct vertices u and v on G are said to admit perfect state transfer at time t if M(t)_{u, v} = 1. If a pair of vertices on G admit perfect state transfer at time t, then G itself is said to admit perfect state transfer (at time t). A set S of pairs of distinct vertices on G is said to admit perfect state transfer (at time t) if each pair of vertices in S admits perfect state transfer at time t. A set S of vertices on G is said to admit perfect state transfer (at time t) if for all u \\\\in S there is a v \\\\in S such that u and v admit perfect state transfer at time t.  Periodic graphs  A graph G itself is said to be periodic if there is a time t eq 0 such that all of its vertices are periodic at time t. A graph is periodic if and only if its (non- zero) eigenvalues are all rational multiples of each other. Moreover, a regular graph is periodic if and only if it is an integral graph.  Perfect state transfer  = Necessary conditions = If a pair of vertices u and v on a graph G admit perfect state transfer at time t, then both u and v are periodic at time 2t. = Perfect state transfer on products of graphs = Consider graphs G and H. If both G and H admit perfect state transfer at time t, then their Cartesian product G \\\\, \\\\square \\\\, H admits perfect state transfer at time t. If either G or H admits perfect state transfer at time t, then their disjoint union G \\\\sqcup H admits perfect state transfer at time t. = Perfect state transfer on walk-regular graphs = If a walk-regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then all of its eigenvalues are integers. If G is a graph in a homogeneous coherent algebra that admits perfect state transfer at time t, such as e.g. a vertex-transitive graph or a graph in an association scheme, then all of the vertices on G admit perfect state transfer at time t. Moreover, a graph G must have a perfect matching that admits perfect state transfer if it admits perfect state transfer between a pair of adjacent vertices and is a graph in a homogeneous coherent algebra. A regular edge-transitive graph G cannot admit perfect state transfer between a pair of adjacent vertices, unless it is a disjoint union of copies of the complete graph K_2. A strongly regular graph admits perfect state transfer if and only if it is the complement of the disjoint union of an even number of copies of K_2. The only cubic distance-regular graph that admits perfect state transfer is the cubical graph.

There are also numerous works of which only a photographic record remains. The critics have always been intrigued by his incomparable technical skill and by the poetic pathos of his works, always predisposed to sense or share the sometimes metaphorical lofty meanings that at times interact in many of Vio’s works, inevitably kindling irrepressible intellectual forays. Vio was neither the first nor the only person to perceive that “classic” is and remains one of the fundamental problems of modern culture, where the artist’s dilemma is to break away from or commit to tradition. Vio was aware of this, continues classicism but has the ability to break away from the logical dualism of reality. He no longer appears interested in the gnoseological content of classic but rather in the human side; therefore Vio is an ethical figurative leading artist and as such forms part of the great Italian tradition, from Donatello to Canova. He has the knowledge to reform that tradition in a difficult and contradictory century to bring us to a unique concept of beauty but he surpasses classic classicism in the sense that art is immune to stylistic pre-conditions. His art becomes a testimony understood as awareness of the value and order of events, sublimely demonstrated in the Giordano works in Foggia.

Terminology The term PDV is defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters, section 6.2. In computer networking, although not in electronics, usage of the term jitter may cause confusion. From RFC 3393 (section 1.1): > The variation in packet delay is sometimes called \\"jitter\\". This term, > however, causes confusion because it is used in different ways by different > groups of people. ... In this document we will avoid the term \\"jitter\\" > whenever possible and stick to delay variation which is more precise. Measurement of packet delay variation The means of packet selection for measurement is not specified in RFC 3393, but could, for example, be the packets which had the largest variation in delay in a selected time period. The delay is specified from the start of the packet being transmitted at the source to the start of the packet being received at the destination. A component of the delay which does not vary from packet to packet can be ignored, hence if the packet sizes are the same and packets always take the same time to be processed at the destination then the packet arrival time at the destination could be used instead of the time the end of the packet is received. Instantaneous packet delay variation is the difference between successive packets—here RFC 3393 does specify the selection criteria—and this is usually what is loosely termed \\"jitter\\", although jitter is also sometimes the term used for the variance of the packet delay. As an example, say packets are transmitted every 20 ms. If the 2nd packet is received 30 ms after the 1st packet, IPDV = −10 ms. This is referred to as dispersion. If the 2nd packet is received 10 ms after the 1st packet, IPDV = +10 ms. This is referred to as clumping. Limiting PDV or its effects For interactive real-time applications, e.g., voice over IP (VoIP), PDV can be a serious issue and hence VoIP transmissions may need quality of service-enabled networks to provide a high quality channel. The effects of PDV in multimedia streams can be mitigated by a properly sized buffer at the receiver. As long as the bandwidth can support the stream, and the buffer size is sufficient, buffering only causes a detectable delay before the start of media playback.

Background For the second time in his career Alain Resnais turned to an Alan Ayckbourn play for his source material (having previously adapted another play for Smoking/No Smoking), and remained close to the original structure while transferring the setting and milieu from provincial England to the 13th arrondissement of Paris (contrary to his usual preference). The film consists of over 50 short scenes, usually featuring two characters - occasionally three or just one. Scenes are linked by dissolves featuring falling snow, a device similar to one which Resnais previously used in L'Amour à mort (1984). Several of Resnais's regular actors appear in the film (Arditi, Azéma, Dussollier, Wilson), and he was joined by his longstanding technical collaborators in design and editing, but he worked for the first time with cinematographer Éric Gautier. The fictional TV programmes called \\"Ces chansons qui ont changé ma vie\\" which feature in the film were directed by Bruno Podalydès. Synopsis In contemporary Paris, six characters individually confront their emotional solitude as their lives intertwine. Dan (Lambert Wilson) is unemployed after being sacked from the army and spends his time drinking in a bar and telling his troubles to the longsuffering barman Lionel (Pierre Arditi). Dan's relationship with Nicole (Laura Morante) is disintegrating and through a newspaper advertisement he meets Gaëlle (Isabelle Carré), an attractive but insecure young woman who lives with her older brother Thierry (André Dussollier). Thierry is an estate agent who has been trying to find a new apartment for Nicole and Dan. He works with Charlotte (Sabine Azéma), a middle-aged spinster and an ardent Christian, who lends him a video of an evangelical TV programme to give him inspiration. At the end of the video, Thierry discovers some unerased footage of erotic dancing by a woman he suspects to be Charlotte, and, taking this as an invitation, one day he tries to force her to kiss him in their office. Charlotte in her spare time works as a carer, and is assigned to look after the bed-ridden and foul-mouthed Arthur (the voice of Claude Rich) in the evenings so that his dutiful son, who is Lionel the barman, can go to work. After enduring repeated vicious tantrums from Arthur, Charlotte one evening dons a leather porno outfit and silences him with a striptease performance, before resuming her usual pious demeanour. Arthur is hospitalised next day. Gaëlle witnesses a farewell meeting between Dan and Nicole, and interpreting it as a betrayal by Dan, she flees back home to her brother. Lionel and Nicole both pack up to begin new lives. Dan resumes his place at the bar. Reception On its release, Private Fears in Public Places received an overwhelmingly positive response in the French press, whereas the enthusiasm of the public was more measured although respectably reflected at the box- office. Allocine.fr British and American critics were widely sympathetic towards the film, but showed more reservations about the significance of the work.See the conspectus of reviews at Rotten Tomatoes Comments by reviewers ranged from \\"disappointing\\"Ginette Vincendeau, in Sight & Sound, August 2007, p.74. and \\"inconsequential\\",Peter Bradshaw, in The Guardian, 20 July 2007 to \\"exquisite comedy-drama\\",Jim Ridley, in The Village Voice, 3 April 2007 and \\"a masterpiece by any measure\\".Kevin Thomas, in LA Times, 4 May 2007. One of the aspects noted by Anglo-American reviewers was the deliberate theatricality in the style of filming: \\"The film is entirely shot on sets that advertise their staginess - for example by the absence of ceilings revealed by the overhead shots, or their striking pastel colours (pinks, oranges and whites) and the repetition of frames filled with seemingly shifting partitions: etched glass, beads, ironwork, veils and so on.\\" \\"...The superbly sustained aura of delicate artifice – this is a Paris where it’s always silently snowing, even, at one point, indoors – lends the characters’ repeated attempts to break free of their boxed-in lives the ritualistic magic of a fairy tale.\\"Geoff Andrew, in Time Out (London), issue 1926: July 18-24 2007. This mise-en-scène was also linked to the themes of loneliness and separation: \\"Resnais is far more interested in the divisions that set us apart - whether it is the ill- constructed inner wall that bisects the first apartment visited by Nicole, the curtain that splits Lionel's bar in two, the partition that separates Thierry's office from Charlotte's, or the thematic oppositions of heaven and hell, men and women, piety and temptation.\\"Anton Bitel at Channel 4. \\"All of [the characters] are in search of love and companionship. They're deeply lonely, though none is a natural loner, and their individual backgrounds, and in some cases the nature of their sexuality, are only hinted at. They live in a sort of emotional and social blur...\\"Philip French, in The Observer, 22 July 2007. Another aspect of the film which was widely appreciated was the quality of the acting: \\"These consummate stage and film actors are one of the main reasons Resnais' work combines so effortlessly the cinematic with the theatrical.\\" Accolades Alain Resnais won a Silver Lion award for best direction at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, as well as the 2007 Étoile d'Or for best director and a FIPRESCI Prize at the 2007 European Film Awards. The film received seven nominations for the 2007 Césars but did not win any of the categories.

Its application is mainly in the area of electronic warfare, by way of interfering with electronic equipment such as radars or radio equipment. Vircator schematic A typical vircator is built inside an evacuated resonant cavity or waveguide. An electrode, a cold cathode, at one end injects an intense electron beam, such as from a Marx generator or a flux compression generator, optionally with a suitable pulse forming network, e.g. a Blumlein. The pulse has magnitude in the range of hundred or more kilovolts and duration of about 50-150 nanoseconds. The electrons are attracted to a thin anode, such as an aluminized PET film or a stainless steel mesh, that is connected to the grounded waveguide body. The unit is surrounded by a magnet. Due to the intensity of the electron beam, many electrons pass through the anode into the region beyond it, forming a virtual cathode. The electron beam must be so intense as to exceed the space charge limiting current in that region, causing oscillations that generate microwaves. The frequency, efficiency and other characteristics of the emitted beam depend on the precise physical configuration and operating parameters. A coaxial design exists where the cathode forms an outer ring surrounding the anode cylinder, with the virtual cathode forming along the cylinder's axis. Such design can be directly integrated with a waveguide. The frequencies are usually in the region of 0.5-1.5, 2-6, 3, or 5-18 GHz. Other frequencies are also possible. Lower frequencies are usable for jamming communications, higher frequencies can be harnessed for their destructive effects on electronics.Portable E-Bomb to Be Tested - IEEE Spectrum Vircators have been used as electromagnetic pulse generators and for generating X-rays. Power levels on the order of 1010 to 1012 watts are possible. A design successor of a vircator is a reditron, which has higher efficiency and narrower bandwidth. Function The massive short pulse of high voltage causes the cathode to emit an intense burst of electrons by the field electron emission mechanism. The electrons are attracted to the anode. A large proportion of the electrons passes through the anode and forms a cloud behind it, forming the virtual cathode. However, the electrons are still attracted by the anode (and repulsed by each other), so they change direction and fly back towards the anode, only to pass through again and be repulsed by the cathode and attracted towards the anode. The rapidly accelerating and decelerating electrons, as they oscillate back and forth between the real and virtual cathode through the mesh anode at microwave frequencies, then produce electromagnetic radiation.

Set in winter in Switzerland, it is about the making of an ambitious art film that uses re-creations of classical European paintings as tableaux vivants, set to classical European music. Only incomplete scenes of the film within the film are shown, because it has no settled plot and never gets finished. While making it, the crew become involved in various ways with the locals, some of whom are recruited as extras.  Plot  Jerzy is a Polish director, making a film at a studio in Switzerland which contains a series of tableaux vivants. His producer László is impatient because there is no apparent story to the film and Jerzy keeps delaying and cancelling shoots, repeatedly citing difficulties with the lighting. During the filming, Jerzy gets involved with two local women: Isabelle, an earnest young factory worker with a stutter, and Hanna, the worldly German owner of the motel where the crew are staying. Hanna is married to Michel, a difficult man with a chronic cough who owns the factory where Isabelle works. Isabelle is fired from her job and attempts to organize her fellow workers to strike – not for her sake, but for their own. The film crew is meanwhile recruiting factory workers as extras for the tableaux that Jerzy is shooting. Jerzy continues to search for the right lighting in the studio and to try to manage an increasingly unruly group of extras. At the same time he is trying to continue his relationship with Hanna, with whom he has shot some test footage that the two review together while discussing the intersection of love and work. Jerzy is also taken with Isabelle, who also wants to merge love and work. She tries to get Jerzy involved with her cause and to make meaningful connections with the film crew, asking them why films never show people working. Finally, Isabelle and Jerzy have an intimate encounter and Isabelle gives up her virginity. She accepts a payoff from Michel, her fellow workers having abandoned their half-hearted attempt at a strike. László secures more money for the film but Jerzy feels the tug of the dramatic events of the Solidarity movement in Poland and of his family back there. Feeling unable to complete the project, he leaves for Poland without either Isabelle or Hanna but instead with a waitress from the motel. Isabelle and Hanna connect up with each other and also decide to go to Poland.  Cast  *Jerzy Radziwilowicz - Jerzy *Isabelle Huppert - Isabelle *Hanna Schygulla - Hanna *Michel Piccoli - Michel *László Szabó – László *Myriem Roussel – One of the nude models *Sophie Loucachevsky - Sophie The tableaux vivants The Night Watch Though the original paintings which the tableaux vivants portray are frozen in space and time and can be studied at leisure in two dimensions, in silence, the film makes them three-dimensional. The camera moves around the actors, who move in and out of position, the lighting varies and recorded classical music plays. However, viewers are given no chance to appreciate any of the tableaux in any depth because only partial views are shown for relatively brief moments. = Rembrandt = The Night Watch is intercut with views of Isabelle working in the factory. There is discussion over what story the painting is telling, or whether it has no story at all, over its intricate construction, and over the source and intensity of its lighting. These three themes echo throughout Passion, which has continuing arguments over the significance of plot, the relationships between characters, and the inadequacies of artificial light (symbolising the artificiality of cinema itself). = Goya = File:El Quitasol (Goya).jpgThe Parasol File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpgThe Third of May 1808 File:Goya Maja naga2.jpgLa Maja Desnuda File:La familia de Carlos IV, por Francisco de Goya.jpgThe Family of Charles IV Accompanied by the Introitus of Mozart's Requiem, elements of four Goya paintings are shown. At first only the woman from the apparently innocent pastoral scene of The Parasol can be seen, who then walks towards the firing squad in Third of May 1808 and is enmeshed in the horrors of war. In the background can be glimpsed La Maja Desnuda, exuding sexual allure, while actors are getting ready for Charles IV of Spain and His Family. Inserted are shots of Isabelle asleep in her apartment. = Ingres = File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - La Baigneuse Valpinçon.jpgThe Valpinçon Bather File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpgThe Turkish Bath Paintings of nude women in Turkish baths, such as The Valpinçon Bather and The Turkish Bath, are only recreated in fragments, interrupted by episodes in the motel and in the factory. The naked actresses in the studio continue the theme of desire, typified by the Naked Maja, while the outside scenes reprise the world of work.Paech(1989): p.19. When Jerzy is not content with the lighting, as usual, the producer asks him what is «the right light». He responds by plunging the studio into darkness, to show that it is a place where lighting can never match reality, and draws a comparison between Hanna, a woman open to the light, and Isabelle who is opaque. However, Jerzy does persuade Isabelle to be one of the naked models. = Delacroix = File:Eugène_Ferdinand_Victor_Delacroix_012.jpgThe Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople File:Lutte de Jacob avec l'Ange.jpgJacob wrestling with the Angel In these tableaux, which recreate the Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople and Jacob wrestling with the Angel, there is a high degree of movement. Knights on horseback circle restlesly around the set of the Greek city, while Jerzy himself becomes part of the scene when he begins a wrestling match with the actor playing the Angel. = El Greco = The Assumption of the Virgin Set to Fauré’s Requiem, the tableau of the Assumption of the Virgin has parallel scenes in the motel involving Jerzy and Isabelle, who admits she is still a virgin.Paech (1994): p.25. = Watteau = The Embarkation for Cythera The Embarkation for Cythera is only shown in disjointed fragments, after it becomes evident that the film is never going to be completed, and the camera stays far away, giving a dispassionate documentary air to the empty ship and isolated couples. Significantly, it is the only tableau in the open air exploiting natural light. Themes =Art and Life= In several ways, the film looks back to Godard's 1963 film Contempt, about the tensions among a multinational team on location making a film that will never be completed. That film also had Michel Piccoli as one of the male leads and was shot by Raoul Coutard. It too oscillated between the demands of art, in that case a debased commercial version of an immortal work, and of life. In Passion, the contrast between the two is clear. The world of the tableaux vivants is that of high art, of rich colours and forms embodied in costumes and props of beauty and accompanied by a soundtrack of masterpieces. That of people outside, both those making the film and those at the motel and the factory, is one where, though they may have ideals, they cannot escape everyday issues of survival, particularly sex and money. It is a world that is grey, wintry and often dull. The artistic interludes in the film have no dialogue, just as the paintings they represent speak silently to viewers by means of form and colour. But the life of the film makers and townspeople suffers from lack of communication, with often incoherent conversations that are sometimes in different unsubtitled languages. One character has a stutter, another a hacking cough, one is mute, and the producer tries to talk to the director through a closed window. Links are made between the world of imagination that is being created in the studio and the quotidian world of the characters. The characters playing the producer and the backer keep complaining that there is no plot. To which the director Jerzy replies that life does not have coherent plots, that things just happen, but it is art that can escape this grim cycle and is necessary for that reason. Specific links between art and reality are seen at moments: the armed crusaders entering Constantinople are parallelled by the police suppressing the factory strike; the ship due to sail for Cythera is paired with a jet trail in the sky; the close-ups of Hanna in the motel are matched by zooms on to faces by Goya. Though life can be drab, full of tensions and misunderstandings, art can soar above it because it can convey pure emotion.de Baecque: p. 609. As Godard said in 1982: «Sometimes one has to film emotion, to fill the screen with pure emotion. Only painting and music can achieve that.»Jean-Luc Godard, Cahiers du Cinéma no. 336, May 1982 = Light and Dark = The opposition of light and dark first appears in the Night Watch, the first of the tableaux vivants, in the context of how light is distributed in the painting. Later on, during the Ingres episode, the two women Isabelle and Hanna are described by Jerzy as the opposition of night and day. According to him, Hanna is like the day, as she is opened towards everything, while Isabelle is like the night because she is difficult to reach. The studio is the place governed by man-made light, whereas the places outside the studio are often shot in inadequate natural light. Yet the lighting of the tableaux vivants in the studio can never reach the qualities of pure natural light outside, and therefore remains artificial. = Love and Work = The life of the characters is bound by the needs of love and of work, and the ways in which the two get mixed. Jerzy starts an affair with Hanna, owner of the motel where he is staying, and after a screen test wants her to be in his film as well. The industrial nature of the film studio is contrasted with the factory owned by Hanna's husband, at which Isabelle works. Isabelle even suggests that the repetitive movements of manufacturing mirror those of lovemaking. Production Outdoor shooting began at the end of November 1981 beside Lake Geneva at Nyon, followed by indoor shooting from January 1982 at Billancourt Studios in Paris. For both crew and cast, the director was extremely demanding. Sophie Loucachevsky, who played the production secretary, recalled: In the frost and the snow we waited outside in underclothes and nightdresses while Godard sat alone in a car and wept, clutching a teddy bear.de Baecque: p. 608. Godard had met the German actress Hanna Schygulla in Hollywood when she was shooting One from the Heart with Francis Ford Coppola and asked her to participate, sending her a three-page synopsis in English titled Passion: Work and Love. For the role of the director, his alter ego, Godard chose the Polish actor Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, well known from his work with Andrzej Wajda. To the French actress Isabelle Huppert he gave her the role of an unglamorous factory worker who is still a virgin, and added to her difficulties by requiring her to stutter.de Baecque: p. 606. Like most of Godard's work from this period, Passion is shot in colour with a 1.37 aspect ratio. Cinematographer Raoul Coutard, collaborating with Godard for the first time since 1967, won the Technical Grand Prize for cinematography at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival.

Replay Baseball  Replay Baseball is played using three dice (red, white, and blue), and a Chart Book. Play is controlled by rolling three dice (red/white/blue), and using the numbers to obtain results by referencing the pitcher and batter cards, as well as the chart book. The Chart Book is offered in two formats, the Current Chart Book being valid for the new yearbook format and for original seasons produced after 1987, and the White/Classic Chart Book being valid for original seasons produced before 1987. Playtime can be as little as 15–20 minutes per game, according to TableTop-Sports administrator Jeff Downey. Replay fans are known to play co-op games that are coordinated in their online forum, which builds a sense of community around the game. In an interview with The Stateline Observer, player Craig Pillow noted: Replay Baseball offers a number of past seasons, in both a yearbook (precut cards) and team book (eBook only) format. In addition, there are still copies of the original game (Replay Classic) and seasons available. Replay Baseball has been mentioned in two books to-date,Guzzo, Glenn (2005).

Second Season Game Book  Second Season Pro Football  Originally the creation of Keith Avallone of Plaay Games (Plaay Games), the right to publish Second Season was granted to Replay Publishing. The game is played using two dice (one black, one white) and a game book. Play begins by selecting two teams, which will face one another in the simulated game. Following kickoff, the offensive team selects a play and a target player, while the defense is chosen by a roll of a die (for solo play). Once the play and defense are determined, the two dice are rolled, and read together.Second Season How-To For example, a black 4 and a white 3 would be read as '43' (similar to other games, such as APBA Football). This number is then used to reference the game book, which will produce a result for the play called by the offensive coach. An example of the game book can be seen at right. Second Season has a number of past season sets available, offered in the yearbook format. In addition, a How-To guide is also produced which allows players to create their own teams from past football seasons. On January 20, 2010, Pete Ventura of Replay Publishing announced that Second Season Football was returning to the Plaay Games fold, who would be publishing the game beginning Summer 2010.

A small Polish–Lithuanian force of about 6,000–7,000 under Great Lithuanian Hetman Janusz Radziwiłł surprised a numerically superior Russian force (of 40,000; some estimates speak of 70,000, but they are likely too high) under knyaz Yakov Cherkassky near Shklow (). The battle took place during a solar eclipse. The Russian forces, due to their surprise, were engaged by the Poles unprepared and in smaller portions, which were defeated in turn. Eventually the Poles forced the entire Russian army to retreat; the losses are estimated at about 700 for the Poles and 7,000 for the Russians (although they may be overestimated for both sides). Prelude The conflict was triggered by the Khmelnytsky Rebellion of Ukrainian Cossacks against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, derived his main foreign support from Alexis of Russia and promised his allegiance in recompense. Although the Zemsky Sobor of 1651 was poised to accept the Cossacks into the Moscow sphere of influence and to enter the war against Poland on their side, the Tsar waited until 1653, when a new popular assembly eventually authorized the unification of Ukraine with Tsardom of Russia. After the Cossacks ratified this agreement at the Pereyaslav Rada the Russo-Polish War became inevitable. In July 1654 the Russian army of 40,000 (nominally under the Tsar, but in fact commanded by Princes Yakov Cherkassky, Nikita Odoevsky and Andrey Khovansky) captured the border forts of Bely and Dorogobuzh and laid siege to Smolensk. The Russian position at Smolensk was endangered as long as Great Lithuanian Hetman, Prince Janusz Radziwiłł with 10,000 men held Orsha, slightly to the west. Cherkassky decided to seek out Radziwiłł and defeat him. The Russian army which besieged Smolensk didn't risk a storm of the city as long as a Lithuanian army of Janusz Radziwiłł operated in the east. It was decided to send an army towards Radziwiłł which was supposed to block him. The army led by Yakov Cherkassky took Orsha and faced the Lithuanian forces. Battle Solar eclipse of August 12, 1654 passed right through Ukraine The battle is described quite differently in Polish and Russian accounts, each side claiming it as their victory. According to Polish account, Radziwiłł became aware that the Russian army would be crossing the Dniepr river; he had about 2,000 cavalry and some few thousands of infantry (including the more mobile dragoons; about 4,000–5,000). Around 2 pm he was informed that the Russians were close and their first units had started to cross the river; his main force also had the benefit of not being seen by the Russians. In the meantime, a solar eclipse began, creating confusion. Polish cavalry, including the Winged Hussars, launched repeated attacks on the Russian forces that had crossed the river, pushing them back. Russian attempts to cross the river were repeatedly forced back into the water, and attempts to outflank the Polish forces were stopped by the infantry, which took positions along the river and fired at the Russian forces which attempted to cross the river elsewhere. After five or so hours, both sides attempted a major push, and the Poles again were victorious; the Russians, having sustained much higher casualties than the Poles (about 7,000 compared to 700), were demoralized and abandoned attempts to cross the river. The same source claims that among their dead was knyaz Yury Baryatinsky which is obviously wrong. Russian sources give a different account. According to them, after having discovered the Lithuanian army, a detachment under Prince Yury Baryatinsky was involved in the fighting with the Lithuanians while the voivodes of the main army led by Cherkassky sent Baryatinski their cavalry as reinforcement. The rest of the army which consisted of infantry, reiters and supply wagons, also began to move to the battle site. Baryatinsky conducted several attacks on the army of the Great Hetman. Having learned about the approach of the main army of Cherkassky, Radziwiłł decided to retreat. Cherkassky didn't pursue the Lithuanians. Significance Szkłów was the last (if dubious) victory of Janusz Radziwiłł, a powerful and ambitious magnate. Cherkassky retreated temporarily but only to merge with another Russian army under Aleksey Trubetskoy; later that month Radziwiłł would face defeat at the battle of Szepielewicze (Shepeleviche). That battle would mark Russian victory in Lithuania. Shklov was taken by the Russians in September 1654. The besieged Polish–Lithuanian garrison of Smolensk found itself in an isolated situation and lost its hopes to hold out until reinforcements could arrive. This forced the garrison to surrender (see Siege of Smolensk (1654)). A few months later Janusz Radziwiłł would defect from Polish side to that of the invading Swedes, and would eventually die fighting for them, remembered as a traitor in Polish historiography.

C. DeRhodes House was built for newlyweds Laura Caskey Bowsher DeRhodes and Kersey C. DeRhodes in 1906 by Frank Lloyd Wright. It is a Prairie style home located at 715 West Washington Street in South Bend, Indiana. The home has been carefully restored by its current owners over more than two decades and remains in private ownership. It is one of two Wright homes in South Bend, the other being the Herman T. Mossberg Residence. The house First and second floor plan In plan, the DeRhodes house is a mirror image of the 1904 Barton House in Buffalo, New York. Oriented south to north, the main floor is one large rectangular space subdivided by piers and low bookcases with light screens into three spaces: a reception area, a large living room with fireplace toward the south (front) and a large dining room with Wright's customary built-in china cabinets toward the (north) rear. An entry/foyer to the east and the stairway and kitchen wing to the west extend the plan into a cruciform shape. Terraces protected by low walls at the north and south ends of the house extend the living space into the surrounding landscape. The exterior of the DeRhodes house exhibits many of the features associated with Wright's Prairie School architecture: the stucco exterior with wood trim, the strong water table, the pronounced horizontal lines of the continuous window sills and terrace parapets, the leaded glass \\"light screens\\" of the windows, the grouping of the windows into continuous bands, and the low-profile hip roof. The celebrated rendering of the DeRhodes house by Wright's assistant Marion Mahony Griffin is considered by scholars to be among the best to emerge from the Oak Park Studio, and was thought so by Wright himself, who inscribed it \\"Drawn by Mahony after FLLW and Hiroshige\\".Williams Digital Collections CISOROOT=/slidelib&CISOPTR;=20213&CISOBOX;=1&REC;=9 The clients * Laura Caskey Bowsher DeRhodes (November 5, 1864 – May 27, 1952)U.

He also served as the treasurer of the Williams-Forrest Machine Company. His residence before his marriage to Laura C. Bowsher was at 329 West Colfax Avenue, now the site of the First Presbyterian Church of South Bend. From a prior marriage, he had one daughter, Hazel M. DeRhodes (July 10, 1888 - January 1975), who lived with Kersey and Laura DeRhodes in their Wright designed home before moving to Detroit, Michigan, as an adult.South Bend Tribune March 27, 1944 “De Rhodes Rites Will Be Tuesday” Funeral notice, page 5 In early 1906, Laura C. Bowsher visited with her South Bend friend Isabel Roberts (of the Isabel Roberts House) in Berwyn, Illinois. Isabel was an architectural designer and draughtsman in Wright's Oak Park Studio and through Isabel, Laura met architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who was at the peak of his acclaim with the success of his prairie houses. She commissioned Wright's Oak Park studio to design a house for her to be located at 715 West Washington Street, which was to be completed in time to move into it with her new husband.Dalles, John, \\"The Pathbreaking Legacy of Ryan and Roberts\\", in Reflections, the journal of the Historical Society of Central Florida, Summer 2009; pages 8 and 9.

The airline operated sightseeing charters. The airline was based at Windhoek Eros Airport. History The predecessor airline of NCA was Hire and Fly, which was founded in 1977. Chris Schutte, a former station engineer with South African Airways, founded Hire and Fly, which operated single and twin-engine Cessna aircraft.History In 1989, Hire and Fly expanded by taking over the Cessna fleet of Namib Air (now Air Namibia). By 1992, the airline was operating seven Cessna 210s and up to eight twin-engined Cessna 310s when the company changed its name to Namibia Commercial Aviation. =Acquiring the Douglas DC-6A= In December 1990, the company received a contract from the United Nations to provide airlift to war- torn Angola. The company acquired a Douglas DC-6A, which it registered as V5-NCB and started to fly it by June 1991. A second DC-6A was acquired in September 1991. Both of these were leased to a Zairean airline in October 1993, though one was repossessed the following year and sold. =Historic Douglas DC-6B aircraft acquired= V5-NCF at Eros Airport in 1995 In September 1992, NCA purchased 40 tons of spare DC-6 parts from the Zambian Air Force. The sale was contingent on purchasing two DC-6B which had been parked for 15 years. These two were eventually registered in Namibia as V5-NCF and V5-NCG. V5-NCF had a manufacturer’s serial number of 45563, the second to last DC-6B serial number although it was the fourth to last DC-6B delivery, which took place in January 1958. It served as the presidential plane to then Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito, who used it on a state visit to India in January 1959. Later, it served as the personal transport for then Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.Wegg, p. 39 V5-NCF’s first revenue flight after restoration took place on March 20, 1995.Figgen, p. 38 V5-NCF is no longer operated by NCA having been sold to pay for the restoration of V5-NCG. The aircraft formerly registered as V5-NCF is now based in Austria sporting the Red Bull livery. V5-NCG was restored by NCA and was first operated on a revenue flight on March 31, 2001.

Logistics officers can be stationary on military bases or deployed as an active part of a field army, air wing, naval force or coast guard fleet. The responsibilities of Logistics Officers vary, depending on where they are deployed and what tasks they are assigned. In addition, different countries, have different roles for Logistics Officers. The main role of these officers remains the same regardless of where they are stationed; to ensure that the force is supplied with enough food, water, fuel, ammunition and other goods and services to complete the task at hand. Australia In Australia each of the three independent Services of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have different definitions for a 'Logistics Officer'. Logistics officers lead and coordinate planning and execution of the operations support components of the military effects which include the administrative (1) and logistics (4) functions, as well as major enabling support in the capability support dimension of force generation. Royal Australian Navy (RAN) logisticians are called a Supply Officer, the commissioned element of the Supply Branch. RAN \\"Loggies\\" conduct the non- technical component of 1/4 support effects. Australian Army logisticians are commissioned officers in the Australian Regular Army (ARA) or Army Reserve (ARES) normally drawn from the Ordnance (RAAOC), Transport (RACT), Catering (RAACC), Engineer (RAE), Electrical and Mechanical Engineer (RAEME), or Medical (RAAMC) corps. Army defines engineering as a subset of logistics. Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) logisticians are called Logistics Officers (LOG), the commissioned element of the Logistics Employment Group (LEG). As in the RAF they are generally focused on the maintenance of the supply chain (in both Joint and Air environments), equipment governance, catering, movements and transport, the non-technical logistics disciplines. Unlike the Army RAAF \\"Loggies\\" work in parallel to RAAF engineers (Aeronautical [AERO], both Ground and Air Electrical [ELECTR], Armament [ARM] and Airfield [AFENG]) who comprise the specialist technical engineering and maintenance components of the RAAF integrated logistics workforce. LOG and ENG personnel (except AFENG) are managed by Logistics Branch - Air Force within Air Force Headquarters (AFHQ). AFENG are managed by the RAAF's Headquarters Combat Support Group. Additionally unlike their Navy and Army counterparts RAAF \\"Loggies\\" don't manage administrative, personnel or finance functions which are provided by Administrative Officers (ADMIN) who perform the 1 shop functions of the 1/4 support environment leaving \\"Loggies\\" to perform the 4 shop function. Belgium In Belgium, the army has its own logistics branch. This branch is responsible for supporting the army in the wide logistics spectrum: supply, maintenance and contracting. Canada Logistics officers with the Canadian Coast Guard are responsible for a wide variety of duties that help maintain the operation of a vessel. They work closely with the commanding officer to coordinate the administration of the ship's financial resources. Logistics officers are responsible for purchasing, receiving, storing and issuing of all materials for the ship and any other offshore military establishment. This includes professional training in techniques and practices of accounting, budgeting, forecasting, cost/benefit and risk analysis. Furthermore, logistics officers with the Department of National Defence work in five main disciplines: Human Resource Management, Supply Chain Management, Finance, Food Services and Transportation and have the opportunity to specialize as movement, postal or ammunition technical officers. Logistics Officers in the Canadian Armed Forces are assigned to one of the three services branches, and while each branch requires specialized knowledge unique to the particular operational environment, Logistics Officers are expected to be capable of serving in any operational role when required. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, a logistics officer in the Royal Air Force is colloquially known as a 'Stacker' (which is an abbreviation of 'Blanket Stacker') or simply as a 'loggie'. This is a reference to the traditionally-held perception of the role of the logistics officer. In the Royal Navy a Logistics Officer is known colloquially as a \\"Pusser\\", derived from the term \\"Purser\\". In the Army the logistics officer is often referred to as the Quartermaster. United States In the United States, the work of the logistics officer includes providing strategic, operational, or tactical level logistical support and managing the overall logistic processes in support of mission objectives; leveraging existing networks and expanding others; anticipating mission requirements and operational requirements and offering alternatives and advice; and evaluating, redesigning and implementing logistics processes for mission support. The National Logistics Officer Association, while founded by United States Air Force maintenance officers, now serves as the primary professional organization dedicated to the professional development of logistics officers from all United States armed forces.

Aspiring actors place hopes in classified ads. Chicago Sun-Times Rosner moved to New York City and wrote for MTV. When his wife accepted a job offer in California, they moved west.  Intelligence tests  In 1985, he scored 44 of 48 on Ron Hoeflin's Mega Test, a test described in a history of IQ testing as \\"a nonstandardized test put out by an obscure group known as Mega, supposedly the world's most selective organization of geniuses.\\" A score of 44 of 48 represents an IQ of about 180. In 1991 he retook the test and achieved 47 of 48 (IQ 190). From 1991 to 1997, Rosner was editor of Noesis, the journal of the Mega Society. Rick completed Hoeflin's Titan Test and is the first individual to have answered all 48 questions correctly, with a 15-year-old C. Minor later having done the same, thereby becoming the only individual to match Rosner's Titan and surpass his Mega scores in a single attempt. He achieved an IQ score of 192 in the high-range IQ test Mathema by answering 13 of 16 questions correctly,http://www.psiq.org/lux/ as well as 190 on the CIT - Form 3E by answering 76 of 78 questions correctly, ranking him second in the United States and third globally behind Minor, as well as Dr. Katsioulis of Greece - even without inclusion of either age corrections or any additional IQ 200+ results, of which Minor is the singular global proprietor in any data stratum. http://www.iq-tests-for-the-high-range.com/cooijmans_intelligence_test.html No professionally designed and validated IQ test claims to distinguish test- takers at a one-in-a-million level of rarity of score. The standard score range of most currently normed IQ tests is from IQ 40 to IQ 160. A score of 160 corresponds to a rarity of about 1 person in 30,000 (leaving aside the issue of error of measurement common to all IQ tests), which falls short of the Mega Society's 1 in a million requirement. IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. High IQ scores are less reliable than IQ scores nearer to the population median. Rosner has argued that \\"the whole idea of IQ is a little wobbly\\" due to its attempt to measure linearly what he views as a property with many different aspects. Media activity and appearances Rosner began writing for quiz shows in 1987 on the MTV series Remote Control. He then scripted a number of clip shows, countdowns, and outtake programs in the 1990s. Rosner's 2000 appearance on the quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire led to a lawsuit over an allegedly flawed question he missed on the elevation of various country capitals. Rosner was asked, \\"What capital city is located at the highest altitude above sea level?\\" and given four answer choices: Mexico City, Quito, Bogota, and Kathmandu. Rosner answered Kathmandu, which is at about half the altitude of Quito.The Daily Show's Moment of Zen for July 12, 2001: Rosner loses on Millionaire Nonetheless, Rosner sued..

Through degrees of articulation, each part is united with the whole work by means of a joint in such a way that the joined parts are put together in styles ranging from exceptionally distinct jointing to the opposite of high articulation--fluidity and continuity of joining. In highly articulated works, each part is defined precisely and stands out clearly. The articulation of a building reveals how the parts fit into the whole by emphasizing each part separately. Continuity and fusion The opposite of distinct articulation is continuity and fusion which reduces the separateness of the parts. Distinct articulation emphasizes the \\"strategic break\\" while the articulation of continuity concentrates on smooth transitions. Continuity (or fusion) reduces the independence of the elements and focuses on the largest element of the whole, while reducing focus on the other independent elements. Articulation and space Architecture is said to be the art of the articulation of spaces. And geometry is the architect's basic tool, but it is not the architect's system of communication. That system is the defining of object in the surrounding space. Articulation is the geometry of form and space. Examples Mainz Cathedral - three internal wall elevations =Romanesque architecture= Vertical wall articulation set Romanesque churches apart from their predecessors. Dividing the church height into bays using pilasters gave the interior space a new vertical unity. It also added a new three-dimensional vision by using the horizontal line of the arcade and clerestory. The use of the compound pier allowed the wall columns to rise together with other shafts supporting walls such those supporting arches and aisle vaults into three or more levels. =Sydney Opera House= Ribs under the \\"wings\\" of Sydney Opera House This structure is a combination of both articulation and fusion styles. Although the \\"wings\\" of the opera house stand articulated from the whole, within the wings the ribs of the structure have been fused, or made continuous, by covering the structure with a smooth surface. The smooth covering creates in the process other, larger symbolic forms in rhythmic succession on the roof. (See photo of completed structure in the gallery below.) The result here is sensuous, related to both earth and sky, as the fused forms are more natural in form than are sharp angles with strong definition. The sharper forms, the result of the smooth surface fusion, intrude with sharp articulation into the sky. =Casa da Música= Continuity in design for exuberance - Casa da Música The design of Casa da Música in Portugal produced a building in which the formal intellectual underpinning is equalled by the continuity, the fusion of forms, in its attempt to achieve sensual beauty. Its emotionality comes through in its exuberant external design where articulation in structure has been overwhelmed by continuity and fusion. =Guggenheim Museum Bilbao= Guggenheim Museum Bilbao In this structure, fusion and continuity dominate over articulation. The organically shaped curves on the building have been designed to appear random. According to the architect, \\"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\\". Thus there is an interaction between space (environment) and form. =Articulation vs. continuity= The articulated form emphasizes the building's distinct parts. Articulation accentuates the visible aspect of the different parts of a building. Sometimes the effect completely obscures the sense of the whole, breaking it down into too many pieces, but in most cases the articulation expresses a balance between the two. The result is often a potential sensuality, as the fused forms are closer to the form of the human body than are sharp angles with strong definition. A highly articulated art form expresses its culture's sense of it place in the world. In architecture spatial organization or articulation shows the following uses: Uses of articulation # Movement and circulation # Uses and accessibility # Sequence and succession # Symbolism and meaning Image:TelstraDomeDocklands.jpgArticulation of movement and circulation - Telstra Dome Image:Forbidden city 07.jpgArticulation of uses and accessibility - Forbidden Palace Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpgArticulation of sequence and succession - Moorish architecture - Mezquita Image:Sydney Opera House Sails edit02.jpgArticulation of symbolism and meaning - Sydney Opera House Highly articulated buildings *Seagram Building *Centre Georges Pompidou The Fuji Television building, Tokyo (architectural style- Structural Expressionism) which was designed by Architect Kenzo Tange is more of an articulated structure.

Specific language design objectives include: * Constraint representation * Heterogeneous system representation and specification composability * Well-defined formal semantics and support for formal analysis * Scalability to large designs Rosetta was undergoing standardization at various times.  History  The Rosetta effort emerged from a meeting in of the Semiconductor Industry Council's System-Level Design Language committee in 1996. The objective of the meeting was to define requirements for a next-generation design language that would address perceived shortcomings in existing languages such as VHDL and Verilog. Specific concerns included inability to represent constraints, lack of a formal semantics, inability to represent heterogeneous systems, and heavy reliance on computer simulation for analysis. In response to these requirements, three major approaches were pursued: # Extending hardware description languages including VHDL and Verilog # Extending programming languages including C and C++ # Defining new languages The first approach ultimately resulted in SystemVerilog and extensions to VHDL while the second resulted in SystemC, all of which became Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards for the semiconductor industry. Rosetta's original application domain was system on a chip semiconductor systems. Rosetta resulted from the third approach with development beginning under the auspices of the Semiconductor Industry Council and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Originally developed by Perry Alexander and others at the University of Kansas, it was known simply as System-Level Design Language. Standardization was transferred to VHDL International by 2000 and renamed Rosetta (after the Rosetta Stone) to reflect the heterogeneous nature of its specifications. Eventually, VHDL International and the Open Verilog Initiative merged to form Accellera, an industry sponsored consortium for electronic design automation (EDA) standards. A draft standard of Rosetta was published in November 2003 through Accellera. Standardization was transferred to IEEE Design Automation Standards Committee (DASC) where it was developed by the Rosetta Working Group under IEEE project P1699 starting in March 2007. A draft of a language reference manual was published in April 2008, with editor Peter Ashenden of Australia. The project was withdrawn in June 2013.  Structure  Rosetta is structured around three sub-languages that support defining various specification elements. The expression language defines basic functions and expressions used as terms and values in specifications. The expression language is a non-strict, purely functional, typed language in the spirit of Haskell. Functions are referentially transparent, encapsulated expressions and cannot have side effects. All Rosetta expressions have types that are determined statically. The type system is based on lifted sets where each type contains at least the bottom or undefined value. Any set can be used to define a type and any function that returns a set can be used to define a type former. Because type definitions can contain general Rosetta expressions, the type system is dependent. The facet language defines individual specifications and specification composition to define systems. Facets and components define system models from one engineering perspective. Each facet is written by extending a domain that provides vocabulary and semantics for the model. Facets are defined by declaring items and defining properties for those items. As such, Rosetta is a declarative language and constructs cannot be guaranteed to evaluate to a value, although some facets can be evaluated. Using the design abstractions provided by its domain, a facet describes requirements, behavior, constraints, or function of a system. Facets are heterogeneous and may be defined using any of the predefined or user defined domains. The Rosetta semantics denotes each facet to a coalgebra that defines its model-of- computation. Because Rosetta is reflective, facets can be composed and transformed to define complex systems. A common specification technique is to write facets for different aspects of a system and then compose those aspects using product and sum operations to define the complete system. The domain language defines specification domains otherwise known as specification types. The collection of domains forms a complete lattice ordered by homomorphism with the empty or null domain as its top element and the inconsistent or bottom domain as its bottom. There are three primary domain types. Units-of- semantics domains define basic units of specification. For example, the state_based domain defines the concept of state and next state without constraining the values or properties. Model-of-computation domains extend unit-of-semantics domains to define general computational models such as finite_state, continuous_time, discrete_time and frequency. Engineering domains extend model-of-computation domains to provide specification capabilities for specific engineering domains. Since its early days, Rosetta expanded to include design domains such as hydraulic and mechanical systems, networking systems, security and trust, and software defined radios. Further reading Rosetta was influenced heavily by the non-strict, purely functional language Haskell, the Larch family of specification languages, and Prototype Verification System (PVS). A book devoted to the language was published in November 2006.

It was first published in 2003 and an updated edition followed in 2007. The book explores the definition of a social entrepreneur in the modern world, and provides examples of ordinary people who formed organizations centered on making a difference. Bornstein's purpose is \\"to call attention to the role of a particular type of actor who propels social change.\\" Bornstein also discusses the rising global trend towards social entrepreneurialism, arguing that barriers to social change in southern and central Europe, Latin America and Africa are weaker than in previous generations. Case studies = Bill Drayton = Bill Drayton, a graduate of Yale Law School, chose to study economics, law, and management because he was inspired to be a part of social change. He founded Ashoka; Innovators for the Public, an organization designed to inspire social change. Ashoka is the name of one of his heroes, an Indian emperor who unified much of South Asia. He used an oak tree as the logo because it reminded him of the proverb; “From little acorns do great trees grow”. Drayton dreamed of a day when each citizen could be inspired to use their strengths to contribute towards the solution to a social issue. Bill Drayton traveled extensively to interview other innovators and kept the information on little cards. He then decided to start an office in Delhi, India and later established the second office in Indonesia. He collaborated with key individuals who were already involved in exercising their passions on social issues, such as a woman named Gloria De Souza whose dream was to transform elementary education in India. This connection then gave rise to other kew individuals who helped create a multi-disciplinary approach to social change. Ashoka has worked to combine the strengths of social entrepreneurs and business entrepreneurs at the highest levels. Drayton's vision gave him the ability to see synergy and connection where many of us see only divisions or pieces. He saw value and hope for societal change in the faces of social entrepreneurs who he felt were too disconnected and underfunded. Ashoka focused on social issues such as child mortality, disability rights, Aids patients, and college access. They also worked on reforming health care and access to electricity in Brazil and child protection in India. In 2005 Drayton received the Yale Law School award of merit, the highest honor award, and was also selected as one of America’s 25 best leaders. The overarching mission of Ashoka is to see “Everyone as a Change maker” and this has been done by connecting with individuals who are inspiring real change and networking together to become stronger influencers. Drayton’s ability to inspire these key players to collaborate and support each other was the key to the tremendous growth and social change that Ashoka has contributed. =Gloria de Souza= Gloria de Souza’s inspiring story begins when, in 1981, she becomes the first fellow (social entrepreneur) elected to Ashoka: Innovators for the Public, an organization founded by Bill Drayton specializing in collecting information about and supporting local reformers across the world. Ashoka’s vision sought to answer the question, “Was it possible to create a system that would, with high reliability, spot major pattern-changing ideas and first-class entrepreneurs before either were born?” Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.16 As an elementary school teacher in Bombay with big aspirations, Gloria de Souza could be thought of as Ashoka’s “guinea pig,” for India was the organization’s first targeted country in the search for genuine social entrepreneurism. Her dream was to “transform education across India”.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.17 After teaching for twenty years, she could no longer put up with the Indian schools’ traditional ways of teaching. Author David Bornstein notes, “Nothing pained her more than to walk through a school hallway and hear students repeating in unison, ‘Here we go ‘round the mulberry bush.’ To her, this rote learning—a holdover from the colonial era—was the very sound of minds being deadened”. She knew she must do something. After attending a workshop on experiential and environmental education in 1971, she was inspired. With great excitement and vision, de Souza presented these revolutionary ideas to her colleagues, but to no avail; they continually turned her down. So, “she set aside her textbooks with their references to robins, bluebirds, and willow trees and took her students outside to learn about local birds and plants and explore questions such as: ‘Why do monsoons come and go?’” Though other teachers criticized her, her students responded enthusiastically.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.18 She tried and failed many times over next five years to get the school to adopt her methods. When she met Drayton, she had finally made progress in persuading the teaching staff at her school and was working on spreading the ideas to a second school. However, she knew that the real obstacle would be extending the methods of experiential education to the entire public school system in Bombay--and beyond.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.18-19 Gloria de Souza saw a problem and wanted to fix it - more than that, she felt as though she must fix it. In conversation with Drayton, she said, “Something is deeply wrong in our society. And I think I can do something very important with this idea. If we can help children grow up learning to think rather than memorize and repeat, learning to problem solve, learning to be creative, learning to be actors rather than acted upon, we can create a generation that will be very different. And India will be different. And that’s a revolution.”Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.19 Though the concept of experiential education was nothing new to many major countries at the time, it was new to India. Drayton took interest in de Souza not merely for her teaching ideas, but for “her ability to adapt them to India’s specific circumstances--then market them.” Success in this sphere would require not mere giftedness, but “salesmanship and resourcefulness and thick skin and a level of commitment bordering on obsession.” Ashoka was looking for people who possessed these types of qualities, and Drayton knew that he had found this kind of person in Gloria de Souza. Support from Ashoka allowed de Souza to stop teaching full time and concentrate on her newfound passion. The next year, she founded her own organization, Parisar Asha (meaning “hope in the environment” in Sanskrit), and began working on building up a team of idea-spreaders. Within several years, she was able to show other teachers and schools that her methods, called Environmental Studies (EVS), “significantly increased students’ performance”.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.19-20 They did indeed—one evaluation showed that students studying with EVS scored and mastered subjects twice to three times higher and faster than students involved in rote learning. Because of de Souza’s influence, over the following decade, EVS was introduced in a million schools through a pilot program, taught to almost a million students, and was incorporated into the Indian government’s national curriculum.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg.20 Gloria de Souza was the embodiment of social entrepreneurialism in that she used what she loved the most (i.e., teaching children) to fix what she hated the most (i.e., rote learning and minds being deadened). Though de Souza passed away in 2013, her legacy still lives on—in the organization in which she invested so much of herself and in the ideas she left behind that have bolstered change in the world of education. =Erzsebet Szekeres= One indication of a successful Entrepreneur, according to David Bornstein, is a, “Willingness to Break Free of Established Structures.” Such willingness is demonstrated in the life and work of Erzsebet Szekeres, of Hungary. Szekeres created an entirely new procedure to manage the mentally disabled in her country; this is because her son, Tibor, had microcephalus , which is a condition that includes, “abnormal smallness of the head and severe mental retardation.” To many, the simple solution to dealing with the disabled was to send them to institutions for their lives, this was not an option for Szekeres. Many of the institutions that Szekeres could have placed Tibor in were merely there to keep the patients out of trouble, and did not take anything beyond their barest needs into account; she wanted to change that. Szerkeres created her own place for the mentally and physically disabled to live and work, called the Alliance Industrial Union, or Alliance for short. While in state-run institutions the residents were often locked up and/or tranquilized, the higher-functioning residents of Alliance lived in their own apartments with little supervision, those who could not live on their own share a house with other residents and staff members, called helpers. Residents at Alliance were also given jobs that they were paid for, many of which were in manufacturing, according to their abilities. While institutions were generally structured in a manner similar to prisons, Alliance was structured much like an ordinary town, complete with its own restaurant. Also unlike many other institutions that treated their adult residents as children and regulated nearly every aspect of their lives; Alliance residents could act like autonomous beings, and adhered only to rules that were nearly the same as those one might encounter in any other town. Another nontraditional aspect of Alliance was that they encouraged and assisted their residents to move out of Alliance and into towns and support themselves (if they were able, of course). =The entrepreneurship of Erzsebet Szekeres= In chapter 9 of his book, “How to Change the World”, David Bornstein gives us a picture of the impact Erzsebet Szekeres made in Hungary. The standard for the way care was provided for the disabled was forever changed. Because of the vision she had of a better future for her mentally and physically disabled son, Tibor, love and compassion became her motivation. She wanted to see a world in which Tibor could successfully live in society. She began to understand that there is only a quantitative difference between the disabled and the non-disabled. And it does not change their quality in society. As Szekeres began to visit the horrible institutions for the disabled, she saw an urgent need for change, and she engaged in it. It was very difficult to start a private organization at first, since Hungary was a communist country. So she started with a small group of disabled individuals and taught them simple skills that they could use to work a job, and that grew larger and changed over the years. It eventually became a functional and beautiful community where disabled individuals could come and take up a residency, learn a skill and make a living, and learn how to live independently if possible. There were many times where she failed, or her efforts seemed to be going nowhere. But she never gave up, she persevered. There were times where she became depressed from her failed attempts, but she would remember her son and find the strength to persevere. It was her empathy and compassion for the disabled that truly drove her and made her relentless in her pursuits. =Veronica Khosa= Veronica Khosa is a South African nurse who created an AIDS home care organization called Tateni to fill a gap in the healthcare system of Pretoria and the nearby township of Mamelodi. In her work with Tateni, Khosa displayed an entrepreneurial trait that David Bornstein calls “Willingness to Work Quietly” as she focused on serving the community's needs, running the organization out of an old shed and using her own retirement savings when the government and philanthropic organizations would not financially support her work. Khosa was raised by her grandmother in the township of Mamelodi, near Pretoria in the province of Gauteng in South Africa. From a young age she was interested in nursing, watching her grandmother, a midwife, deliver babies. After completing school, she began training as a nurse at a missionary hospital, where she learned to improvise treatment and teach family members to care for rural patients. In 1991, while working in a Pretoria AIDS testing center, she encountered the problem of hospitals sending home AIDS patients with neither medications nor instructions for home care. Realizing that lack of both correct information about AIDS and home care for AIDS patients was a serious problem in Mamelodi, Khosa enlisted the help of several retired nurses in making home visits to patients who could not afford to visit an AIDS center. Shortly after watching one of her patients die because he was locked in his house with no water, Khosa talked with a group of young prostitutes who wanted different jobs to avoid getting AIDS. She realized that the lack of AIDS home care and lack of jobs for young people could be connected to alleviate both problems. Since no organization existed to provide training for home care of AIDS patients, Khosa designed her own curriculum and held classes in an old shed. In 1995, Veronica Khosa retired from working with the Pretoria City Council and started Tateni Home Care Services. From their first office in the old tin shed where classes were held to a larger building where supplies were often stolen, Tateni faced financial difficulties. Early on, Khosa found that patients did not want their neighbors to know that they were receiving help from an AIDS care organization, because this would make it obvious that they had AIDS. However, after publicly changing Tateni’s focus to general home care in response to a community survey, she found that potential donors were reluctant to give to the organization, since it was not specifically focused on AIDS. Because of Tateni’s financial difficulties, Khosa ended up using her retirement savings to run the organization. Finally, in the late 1990s, UN attention to AIDS home care and to the work of Tateni caused the government of the province of Gauteng to seek change in the healthcare system. Their approach was modeled on Tateni, and they implemented as policy some of Khosa’s main suggestions to them. The government began supporting several AIDS care organizations, including Tateni, and continued to increase its support as more home care organizations were formed. =Fabio Rosa= According to Ashoka, “Social entrepreneurs are individuals with innovative solutions to society’s most pressing social problems. They are ambitious and persistent, tackling major social issues and offering new ideas for wide-scale change.” Entrepreneurs are consumed with ideas. They aren't happy to simply express their idea; they need their idea to make a change in society. Another quality about entrepreneurs is the ability to be realistic. \\"A real entrepreneur has to listen to the environment very well. You cannot cause major social change unless you really understand what's going on.\\" All of these qualities were displayed in Fabio Rosa, a man with the desire to spread electricity to poor sections in Brazil. In 1982 Ney Azevedo, the new mayor of Palmares, got Rosa connected in hopes of improving the lives of the people living in that region. Rosa initially started working on solving the problem of irrigation for the farmers. The price of water was high for them, and the only good solution for this problem was to use electricity to get the water out of the ground. In his research, Rosa heard about Ennio Amaral, a professor who had devised an effective yet relatively low-cost electrification system. Rosa was able to gain permission to experiment with Amaral’s system, and then using water pumps he was able to start solving the irrigation problem for the citizens of Palmares. After that Rosa experienced many difficulties. He found it hard to gain financial support so that he could continue to spread electricity and irrigation systems to areas outside of Palmares, and changes in government officials caused his work to almost come to a complete halt. Rosa continued to persevere despite this though, and he was able to get electricity to 25,000 farmers in the early 1990s. His work was slowed again though, and he changed his method of action. After starting his own company, Agroelectric Adequate Technology Systems in 1992, Rosa began selling low-cost products that converted solar energy into electricity. He knew that the lack of fencing in Brazil was causing there to be overgrazing by the livestock, so he started distributing electric fences to solve this problem. Rosa acquired national recognition through this process, because his method was so successful. By this point he had distributed solar electric systems across Brazil. After this Rosa developed more projects, including the Quiron Project which saved poor families money while using various methods to protect the environment, and The Sun Shines for All which provided families with solar panels using a rental system. All of these accomplishments could have caused Rosa to acquire an inflated ego, but instead he refused to receive all the honor. He displayed what David Borenstein has called “Willingness to Share Credit”, which is one of the qualities of a social entrepreneur. =Jeroo Billimoria= Jeroo Billimoria is the founder of Childline, which is a twenty-four-hour helpline for children needing help. Billimoria did post graduate work in New York City, becoming involved in a project called “Coalition for the Homeless”, a nonprofit that assists the homeless. “I was very moved by the spirit of survival among the homeless,” Billimoria said. She found herself drawn to the children back home in Bombay, India, and discovered that they needed to be acknowledged, that they were “proud”.Bornstein, David (2007). How to change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 77 The children began calling Billimoria, “Didi”, which means “big sister”. Soon, Billimoria realized that it could take days for a street child to receive help in an emergency, and her idea for Childline was born. Billimoria wanted to network the various organizations that give assistance to children together. Ultimately, Billimoria was inspired to start a twenty-four-hour hotline that could provide immediate response to the needs of Bombay’s street children. Since then, Childline has expanded into forty-two cities, 120 organizations implement the service, and as of October 2002, Childline has fielded over 2.7 million calls.Bornstein, David (2007). How to change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 90 Childline is an organization that deeply cares for the rights of a child, and goes to great lengths to demonstrate respect and curtesy for each individual they work with. Despite all this, Billimoria is humble and acknowledges her weaknesses. Since resigning from Childline, she stated, “I was a lousy administrator”.Bornstein, David (2007). How to change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg 91 Billimoria’s genius for setting up a thriving organization that assists children lies in her ability to synthesize available resources by linking various programs together, seeing a problem, and envisioning a bold, simple solution. = James P. Grant = During his time of leadership at UNICEF, James P. Grant demonstrated the social entrepreneurial characteristic of a “Strong Ethical Impetus”. Simply, the entrepreneurial trait of a strong ethical impetus means to be motivated by a desire for justice, not wealth or power. Grant demonstrated this quality by his constant, energetic motivation to put an end to the premature deaths of easily cured, sick children around the world. In 1980, James P. Grant became the leader of UNICEF. When he acquired this leadership position, Grant had already perceived a strong vision of where he wanted UNICEF to make its mark on the world. Although the specific strategies had not yet been evaluated, Grant knew that he wanted to put an end to the easily curable, premature deaths of unvaccinated, malnourished, and severely dehydrated children. Although seen as slightly crazy by co-workers and the public alike, Grant initiated UNICEF’s core strategy: GOBI-FFF. This acronym, which addresses the specific areas that Grant desired to reform, stands for Growth monitoring, Oral Rehydration Therapy, Breastfeeding, Immunization, Food supplements, Family planning, and Female education. Establishing this new foundation attracted many prominent supporters, such as William Foege and Audrey Hepburn; however, it also attracted quite a few cynics, such as Halfdan Mahler. Due to his integrity and hard work, Grant was finally able to gain the support of the president of Columbia for a vaccination campaign. This campaign consisted of three days of vaccinating the children of Columbia. Because of this campaign, more vaccination campaigns were able to be established in other countries. Another a huge accomplishment Grant achieved was the World Summit for Children, which consisted of seventy-one world state leaders meeting together to discuss UNICEF and its mission of saving the sick children. Amazingly, the World Summit for Children was the biggest collection of world leaders who had come together to discuss one specific concern. Despite having to go against the very grain of society, James P. Grant radically changed the lives of children everywhere. = Florence Nightingale = Though no one believed in her, even her own parents, Florence Nightingale proved to be one of history's greatest example of a social entrepreneur: an individual with innovative solutions to social issues. In her time, nursing was considered a very negative term which generally implied a woman of a rough nature who was often drunk or involved in illegitimate sexual activities. However, as is evident now, Nightingale transformed nursing into a highly respected vocation. How did she perform such a monumental accomplishment against all odds? Not through gentle charm or merely giving her time and resources, \\"it was by strict method, by stern discipline, by rigid attention to detail, by ceaseless labor, by the fixed determination of an indomitable will.\\" She knew she had the ability to make an extremely beneficial impact, and even though it reversed society's norm, she succeeded in fulfilling her dreams. Florence Nightingale will forever be remembered as a great social entrepreneur for her heroic work in the field of nursing. Nightingale's \\"indomitable will\\" may have been her most instrumental trait in accomplishing her radical ideas and plans. Beginning with strong resistance from her parents, and continuing to the point of defying army officers, her calling was a constant struggle against society's standards. Like Nightingale, every social entrepreneur will face opposition at some point in their career. It comes with the very definition of an entrepreneur. Their job is to defy cultural norms to find revolutionary, though often seemingly insane, ideas to solve the problems of life. \\"It takes concentrated focus, practical creativity, and a long-term source of energy to advance a system change and to ensure that the change becomes well rooted in institutions and cultures.\\" Social entrepreneurs must have the courage and indomitable will of Florence Nightingale to succeed in a world so resistant to change. = J.B. Schramm = J.B. Schramm, the founder of College Summit, used his high-school and college experiences to create revolutionary college assistance for under-average teens. As a social entrepreneur in David Bornstein’s book, How to Change the World, Schramm undertakes the challenge of reforming not only the way schools equip students for college, but also how students view their own strengths in lieu of what test scores might tell them. Charismatic and friendly, Schramm traveled through his years of primary and secondary school with the same group of buddies. When the time came for him to graduate from high-school, he had no doubt of his friends attending college. “We all had our strengths. And I just assumed that we’d all go on to the next stage in life together. College was a given,”Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 168 explains Schramm. Although he was accepted to Yale University, Schramm was shocked to find that most of them were not continuing to higher education. “It lodged in me,” says Schramm, “It profoundly didn’t make sense. And the difference was not that they were less college capable than I was” From that time on, Schramm had a desire to see other students succeed to higher education. Schramm started working with teens who attended an after-school program with Good Shephard Ministries in 1991. He quickly realized that many of the kids had potential talents and strengths, but were not confident in their own college ability. Also, their middle ranged grades did not attract college admissions. Starting with only four students, Schramm created an intensive essay workshop, teaching and equipping the students with tools to write an essay that would help them be accepted into college. All four were admitted into schools. Schramm experimented again with four more students, and procured the same results. Students that Schramm worked with had college potential; they just needed some guidance and counsel “beyond what their test scores reveal”.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 173 Soon after the experimental attempts, Schramm founded College Summit in 1995.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 169-170 It composed of a four day student preparatory college intensive that trained students how to write essays that will assist with admission into colleges. Schramm instilled coaches who worked alongside the kids, helping them apply to schools, and conducting follow-ups during their years in college. College Summit works alongside other universities, partnering with them and running workshops on campus. Schramm took the opportunity to work with several high-schools in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, “Senior Year Navigator Curriculum” was introduced by College Summit to help equip teachers with the tools to equip students for college. In 2000, Schramm was elected by Ashoka, and was given an annual award by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. By 2003, College Summit had worked with nearly 5,000 students, 95% of them minorities. Today J.B. Schramm is still working to implant College Summit into cities, colleges, and high- schools, all across the U.S.Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 164-182 = Vera Cordeiro = Vera Cordeiro is a physician as well as a social entrepreneur. She founded Asociação Saúde Criança Renascer (Rebirth: Association for Children's Health), which is a network of orghi kids kfkffklkoklklofdls that continues giving health care to children after they are dismissed from public hospitals. In Brazil millions of children suffer from chronic malnutrition. When Cordeiro founded Renascer in 1991 she was working in the public ward of Hospital da la Lagoa, which was a public hospital in Rio. Seeing the children get discharged from the hospital and returning sick again weeks later broke her heart. She said, “I could not stand to go one more day seeing children locked in this cycle of hospitalization, re-hospitalization, and death.” She founded Renascer so that sick children would not return straight to the slums after being dismissed from the hospital only to get sick again. By 2007 Cordeiro opened sixteen public hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Recife, helping more than 20,000 children. In 1999 the director of Lagoa's pediatrics unit, Odilo Arantes, reported that, between 1991 and 1997, Renascer had brought a 60% drop in readmissions to the unit. Arantes is quoted as saying, “Before Renascer, we used to spend lots of effort and money in the emergency room or ICU on treatment knowing that there was a high probability that kids might die afterward from lack of assistance and followup at home. Now when we discharge a poor child, we can feel at peace. And this makes our work more meaningful and rewarding.” In Renascer's headquarters there is a framed quotation from Goethe that says,”Whatever you can do or dream, you can begin it now. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.” Vera Cordeiro certainly lived up to that quotation in her life. Cordeiro displays an amazing determination and love for the children and their families that lived in the slums. She is someone who was able to put her city in order and benefit thousands of children and families around her. Bornstein, David (2007). How to Change the World. New York: Oxford University Press. pg. 130-150 = Erzsebet Szekeres = Erzsbet Szekeres is from Hungary and is a disability rights activist and social entrepreneur. Erzsebet's son, Tibor, was born with mental and physical disabilities, microcephalus and mental retardation. When Erzsebet had learned the chances of her son living into adulthood she felt led to help other individuals facing similar problems as her son. Erzsebet has contributed to the rights of disabled individuals, mainly adults, in Hungary by eliminating three big issues that they face; \\"lack of job training, few employment opportunities, and a housing shortage.\\". While solving these issues she has helped disabled individuals gain more independence, she has also replaced the outdated equipment and resources that her community had provided for these individuals. Erzsebet took a unique approach to this issue. Instead taking after other programs that were provided for disabled individuals in her community, Erzsebet used a \\"macro-approach\\", she didn't just focus on one area of the issue, she focused on the issue as a whole. \\"Her approach addresses all of the fundamental components for a happy and productive life.\\" She provides educational and training opportunities for young adults, then she works to place them in work environments where they are able to apply what they have learned. She also is focused on the issue of housing, she has helped develop special housing designed to provide disabled individuals with the greatest amount of independence possible. Lastly, she is providing complete psychological counseling for the disabled individual and their families. Erzsebet said that her desire to work in this area was based on her experiences with her son. Her work requires her to think of new and different ways to solve problems and issues. Erzsebet says that she checks every decision she makes against the statement \\"Would this be a good solution for my own son?\\". = Javed Abidi = Javed Abidi was sick of seeing the disabled in India being treated horribly by its citizens and government. As the executive director of the National Center for the Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), he constantly strived to help improve the situation in his country, but to no avail. Part of the reason he was so passionate about this issue is that he himself was born disabled, and had been struggling with it for his whole life. While he didn’t let it get the best of him, he could see how many others who were disabled in India were being neglected, and his goal became doing something about that. For years, he and his colleagues pushed for the government to do something about this massive problem that plagued India, but still didn’t receive the attention they needed. Finally, during an important government meeting, he gathered a big crowd of protestors to help fight for the cause, and it worked. One of the officials came to talk to them about their concerns, and the bill they wanted to pass. The official brought it before the government parties, and the bill was passed in 1995. After years and years of fighting on this important issue, Javed finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. While there is still much work to be done in India to help fully solve this issue, Javed has already made a big impact, and continues to do so by working through various organizations that make a difference in the lives of the disabled.

It is a film essay, narrated by Godard and Miéville, on the limitations and artificiality of cinema in attempting to portray reality. It is additionally a critique of the Dziga Vertov Group, the partnership of Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin who together made a number of political, pro- Marxist films between 1968 and 1972. Here and Elsewhere incorporates footage of Palestinian fedayeen (resistance fighters) taken for Jusqu'à la victoire, an aborted 1970 pro-Palestinian Dziga Vertov Group film. Jusqu'à la victoire had been abandoned after most of its subjects were killed by Jordanian forces as part of the 1970 Black September conflict several months after filming. Here and Elsewhere takes its name from the contrasting footage it shows of the fedayeen and of a French family watching television at home. Among the film's critiques is a specific criticism of the trickery that was sometimes employed by the Dziga Vertov Group for propaganda purposes. The film shows footage that was taken of a Lebanese woman who states that she is pregnant with a future fighter for the Palestinians; Godard states in a voiceover that she was in fact not pregnant at the time. Ici et Ailleurs marks the beginning of Godard's transitional period, which found him experimenting with video and moving from political polemics to an examination of the way people perceive themselves and others; as such, it shares many of the traits of both his radical-era films and the video-centered work that followed. It is also one of his first projects with Miéville, who has remained the major collaborator in his life and work since.

He also served in the U.S. Air Force. He was one of the pioneers of the Nuyorican Movement and was involved in the Nuyorican Poets Café. Life Bittman (Bimbo) Rivas got his nickname from a cartoon he saw of an elephant named \\"Bimbo\\". The name lasted, as he was from that point on known to everyone as Bimbo Rivas. But that is where the similarities to a flying elephant stop, because Bimbo Rivas was much more down to Earth and his journey led him to NYC's Lower East Side where he spent the rest of his life. In the Lower East Side, Bimbo found affordable housing, in one of the top locations in New York and in the 1970s moved there with his family. He soon noticed the place was in a continual stage of deterioration, not just because of the crumbling and empty buildings around him, but also due to the declining morale of its people. Some faced horrible living conditions, with people squatting buildings and others warming up by 55 gallons on the sidewalk or empty lots. Yet others were being swept into or by the crime wave prevalent in most of New York in those days. From his experiences, Bimbo was moved to write the \\"Loisaida\\" poem that today gives the Lower East Side its nickname. Bimbo also recognized an opportunity to turn things around and improve quality of life for Loisaida's residents, whom he considered his family whether by blood or association. Bimbo leveraged his position as a teacher to reach more people personally in the community. He tackled the quality of life issue by reconciling the needs of the residents with available government programs to improve communities. He helped people that had lived in buildings for years finally get a title to their property, and guided others to work with authorities to force landlords to maintain their properties and make them livable so they could collect their rents and the residents had better apartments they could feel proud of. These and other activities helped give momentum to a tremendous transformation of the Lower East Side that by the turn of the 20th century, had turned \\"Loisaida\\", into the tree-lined, bohemian, and ultra-chic East Village. On May 21, 1992, while teaching bilingual lessons, he suffered a heart attack in the classroom and soon after died. He was 52 years old, and left behind his 6 children. Legacy Bimbo Rivas was a community activist, who gave the Lower East Side the name \\"Loisaida\\" in a 1974 poem. He was a committed artist, whose talent enriched not only the Puerto Rican culture, but other cultures as well. Bimbo's spirit and influence lives on in Loisaida today. Among his students was the actor Luis Guzmán, who was trained at Charas/El Bohio in New York City. On May 27, 1992, Avenue C became known as Loisaida Avenue. It was a token of appreciation for his contributions to the Lower East Side, his home, and for his people. Affiliations *The Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre Co., Inc.

History  Heugh Battery was one of three erected in 1860 to protect the fast- growing port of Hartlepool. Heugh and Lighthouse Battery were placed close by the lighthouse and armed with four and two 68pr smoothbore guns respectively. The third battery, Fairy Cove mounted three of the same weapons and was slightly further to the north at the end of the town moor. The original battery was modified for three 64pr Rifled Muzzle Loading guns in the 1880s and then fell out of use with the introduction of breech loaders on hydropneumatic mounts in 1893. The lighthouse battery was reconstructed for one of these guns, a 6-inch Mk VI and a further two were placed in Cemetery Battery north of the town. Plaque commemorating the events of 16 December 1914. © Copyright Andrew Curtis and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence In 1900 Heugh was completely reworked for two 6-inch Mk VII guns using the standard configuration of two emplacements with underground magazine between. The defences were further modified in 1907 when the Lighthouse gun was replaced with a 6inch Mk VII and the Cemetery Battery closed. Manned by the Territorial Force gunners of the Durham Royal Garrison Artillery, these were the three guns that were to see action in the Bombardment of Hartlepool on 16 December 1914. During the bombardment (at 08:10), the leading German battle cruiser fired a shell which struck aground less than 100 metres from the battery.Litchfield, Appendix 1. This marked the first death in action of a soldier on British soil in World War I. A plaque commemorating the event is found on the coastal walkway just outside the battery. In 1936 the No 1 gun was removed and the Lighthouse Battery integrated into Heugh Battery so that the Lighthouse gun became Heugh No 1. A Barr and Stroud rangefinder was also introduced. In 1939 the Territorial Army was mobilised and the battery was manned by men of the Durham Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery.Col K W Maurice-Jones, 1959. The History of Coast Artillery in the British Army, Royal Artillery Institution, London, p220 During the early part of the Second World War new rangefinding and fire control equipment was introduced, paving the way to conversion to the Coast Defence / Anti Aircraft role in 1942. The Lighthouse and remaining Heugh emplacement were reworked for turret mounted 6inch Mk 24 guns and an emplacement for a third (No 3) was built a hundred yards to the north though it seems unlikely that a gun was ever mounted here. Present-day view inside the battery compound Heugh Battery was mothballed in 1944 to be reopened in 1947 and shortly after QF 3.7 inch AA guns were introduced. The battery closed in 1956 with the closing of coast defence. The battery is now in the care of the Heugh Gun Battery Trust and is home to a museum and artillery collection.

Assassin bugs, sometimes known as kissing bugs, are one of the largest and morphologically diverse families of true bugs feeding on crickets, caterpillars and other insects. Some assassin bug species are bloodsucking parasites of mammals, even feed on humans. They can be commonly found throughout most of the world and their size varies from a few millimeters to as much as 3 or 4 centimeters. The toxic saliva of the predatory assassin bugs contains a complex mixture of small and large peptides for diverse uses such as immobilizing and pre-digesting their prey, as well as defense against competitors and predators. Assassin bug toxins are small peptides with disulfide connectivity that target ion channels. They are relatively homologous to the calcium channel blockers omega-conotoxins from marine cone snails and belong to the four-loop cysteine scaffold structural class. One of these small proteins, Ptu1, blocks reversibly the N-type calcium channels, but at the same time is less specific for the L- or P/Q-type calcium channels. Ptu1 is 34 amino acid residues long and is cross-linked by 3 disulfide bridges. Ptu1 contains a beta-sheet region made of 2 antiparallel beta-strands and consists of a compact disulfide-bonded core from which four loops emerge as well as N- and C-termini.

After graduating from the Suwa Women’s Higher School in 1922, she moved to Tokyo and began living with an anarchist named Torazo Yamamoto. They went to Korea together but returned after only one month.

She eventually moved to Manchuria and was to give birth in a hospital in Dalian but the child lived for only twenty-four days, dying of malnutrition. Based on this personal experience, she wrote the short story In the Charity Hospital, which established her as a writer of proletarian literature. She married the novelist and critic in 1927, but divorced him in 1955 after discovering that he had an illegitimate child. In 1946 she won the inaugural with Kou iu onna. After the war, she became a writer of \\"Tenko Bungaku\\" (\\"Conversion Literature\\", a controversial genre dealing with the renunciation of leftist beliefs) and showed conservative, anti-communist tendencies.

It is located in Chitral District in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan beside the Chitral River, at a distance of two hours drive from Chitral town. The park is also known as Chitral National Park. Legal status Up until 1983, Chitral Gol was considered to be the private property of the former Mehtar of Chitral. The status of the park has been in dispute since and has become the issue of ongoing litigation between heirs of the former Mehtar and the Government of Pakistan. Parameters The way leading to the park is quite narrow and dangerous, yet more risky during the rainy days. It is located between 1450 metre and about 5000 metre above sea level. It has an area of 7750 hectares. Fauna This park includes three valleys. Several glaciers also lie in the park through which several springs make their way and ultimately form a stream which runs 18 kilometres. The cold water of this stream flows towards the east, into the River Chitral. The park is rich in trees particularly cedar trees. The park also serves to provide shelter to a vast bio-diversity, especially markhor, an endangered wild goat species.Markhor The subspecies, which are found in the park include the astor markhor. Despite a decline from over 500 to only around 200 individuals in the park during the 1980s, Chitral National Park still holds the largest population of the astor markhor in the world. Also present in the park in small numbers are the siberian ibex, ladakh urial, as well as the asian black bear. The snow leopard does not appear to be a permanent resident of the park, but is sometimes seen there. The tibetan wolf, red fox, yellow-throated marten and himalayan otter are all found in the park. Common birds in the park include, the bearded vulture, himalayan vulture, golden eagle, demoiselle crane, peregrine falcon, himalayan snowcock, himalayan monal, snow partridge and rock partridge. Weather The annual rainfall in its region is estimated to be 462 ml. In September, it rains more on the spectacular peaks surrounding the park. However, in November, the rainfall is more in the valleys and on the lower peaks. There is also snowfall during the winter season. The snow-covered white peaks enhance the beauty till June. The general weather is cold and dry. The temperature ranges from −12.2 to 43.3 °C.  Birmoghlasht  The Birmoghlasht part of the park is where the former Mehtar’s Summer Fort is located. At the time of existence of the Chitral State, the Mehtar and his family use to move here in the summer and hold court. The fort was constructed in such a way that it overlooked the entire city. It stands at an elevation of over 2800 meters above sea level. Besides the fort Birmoghlasht also houses a wildlife hut and is a great tourist spot in a few kilometres drive from Chitral town.

It was recorded by Owsley Stanley at the Fillmore East in Manhattan on February 11, 13, and 14, 1970. It was released on CD in 1996, and went out of print soon thereafter. In 2018, the album was remastered and rereleased by the Owsley Stanley Foundation, with the title Bear's Sonic Journals: Fillmore East, February 1970. There are two different versions of this release. One contains the same material as the original album. The other is the Deluxe Edition, on three CDs, with two discs of additional music from the same run of concerts. The February 1970 concerts On February 11, 13, and 14, 1970, the Allman Brothers Band, along with the Grateful Dead and Love, played at Bill Graham's Fillmore East auditorium in New York City. The performances were taped by the Grateful Dead's sound engineer, Owsley (\\"Bear\\") Stanley. Fillmore East, February 1970 is composed of selections from those concerts. The album was produced by Stanley, who also wrote the liner notes. It was mastered by the Dead's recording engineer, Jeffrey Norman. It was released on the Grateful Dead label, in cooperation with the Allman Brothers' record company at the time, PolyGram Records. Performances by the Grateful Dead from the same set of shows have been released on two albums – Bear's Choice, and Dick's Picks Volume 4. Critical reception On AllMusic, Lindsay Planer wrote, \\"There is no mistaking the unbridled fervor of the original line-up of the band. Rising to the challenge of exploratory psychedelia – while remaining ever faithful to their Southern blues roots... Likewise, the Allman Brothers were beginning to ascend as not only premier interpreters, but purveyors of a revolutionary new electric guitar-driven blues movement\\". In The Music Box, John Metzger said, \\"... the disc opens with a scorching rendition of \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" that simply grooves. Dickey Betts and Duane Allman are magnificent, as they play with reckless abandon, yet tightly in synch. The highlight of this album, however, is the nearly 31-minute \\"Mountain Jam\\" that drips with a colorfully electrified intensity.\\" In Glide Magazine, Doug Collette wrote, \\"Almost a year after the formation of the seminal Southern rock band... the original sextet was homing in on the sound that would lend itself to At Fillmore East, the epic recordings done thirteen months later at the same venue. Yet even as the group... was honing the influential style that would make them famous, they were stretching themselves as well, shuffling novel and well-established material in and out of their repertoire.\\" Track listing =Original album= #\\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" (Dickey Betts) – 9:19 #\\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" (Willie Dixon) – 6:01 #\\"Statesboro Blues\\" (Will McTell) – 4:18 #\\"Trouble No More\\" (McKinley Morganfield) – 4:12 #\\"Outskirts of Town\\" (William Weldon, Roy Jordan) – 8:28 #\\"Whipping Post\\" (Gregg Allman) – 8:12 #\\"Mountain Jam\\" (Donovan Leitch, Duane Allman, Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Berry Oakley, Jai Johanny Johanson, Butch Trucks) – 30:48 =Deluxe Edition= Disc 1 :February 11, 13, and 14, 1970: #\\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" (Betts) #\\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" (Dixon) #\\"Statesboro Blues\\" (McTell) #\\"Trouble No More\\" (Morganfield) #\\"Outskirts of Town\\" (Weldon, Jordan) #\\"Whipping Post\\" (G.

Prevention efforts may focus on the individual or their surroundings. A concept known as \\"environmental prevention\\" focuses on changing community conditions or policies so that the availability of substances is reduced as well as the demand. Substance abuse prevention efforts typically focus on minors – children and teens especially 15-35 years of age. Substances typically targeted by preventive efforts include alcohol (including binge drinking, drunkenness and driving under the influence), tobacco (including cigarettes and various forms of smokeless tobacco), marijuana, inhalants (volatile solvents including among other things glue, gasoline, aerosols, ether, fumes from correction fluid and marking pens), cocaine, methamphetamine, steroids, club drugs (such as MDMA), and opioids. Community advocacy against substance abuse is imperative due to the significant increase in opioid overdoses in the United States alone. It has been estimated that about one hundred and thirty individuals continue to lose their lives daily due to opioid overdoses alone.  Protective and risk factors  Environmental and internal are two main factors that contribute to the likelihood of substance abuse. Environmental factors in the individual's adolescence include: child abuse, exposure to drugs, lack of supervision, media influence, and peer pressure. Drug activity in an individual's community may normalize the usage of drugs.Futures Of Palm Beach. (2014). Contributing Factors of Drug Abuse. Retrieved from http://www.futuresofpalmbeach.com/drug- abuse/contributing-factors/ Similarly, if an individual is placed through treatment and then placed back into the same environment that they left, there is a great chance that person will relapse to their previous behavior. Internal factors that are within the child or personality-based are self- esteem, poor social skills, stress, attitudes about drugs, mental disorder and many others. A few more factors that contribute to teen drug abuse are lack of or poor parent to child communication, unsupervised accessibility of alcohol at home, having too much freedom and being left alone for long periods of time.http://cdac.info/portfolio-view/underlying-causes-of-teen-drug-abuse Additionally, there is evidence that gender moderates the effect of family, school and peer factors on adolescent substance use and abuse. For example, some studies report that not living with both biological parents or having poor parent-adolescent communication is associated with substance use, especially in female adolescents. Main risk periods for drug abuse occur during major transitions in a child's life. Some of these transitional periods that could increase the possibility of youth using drugs are puberty, moving, divorce, leaving the security of the home and entering school. School transitions such as those from elementary to middle school or middle school to high school can be times that children and teenagers make new friends and are more susceptible to fall into environments where there are drugs available. One recent study examined that by the time are seniors in high school, \\"almost 70 percent will have tried alcohol, half will have taken an illegal drug, nearly 40 percent will have smoked a cigarette, and more than 20 percent will have used a prescription drug for a nonmedical purpose” (Johnston et al., 2013).Johnston, L.D.; O’Malley, P.M.; Bachman, J.G.; and Schulenberg, J.E. Monitoring the Future National Results on Adolescent Drug Use: Overview of Key Findings, 2013. Bethesda, MD: National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2013. Binge drinking has also, been shown to increase once an individual leaves the home to attend college or live on their own. Most youth do not progress towards abusing other drugs after experimentation. Research has shown, when drug use begins at an early age, there is a greater possibility for addiction to occur.Lynskey MT, Heath AC, Bucholz KK, Slutske WS, Madden PAF, Nelson EC, Statham DJ, Martin NG. Escalation of drug use in early-onset cannabis users vs co-twin controls. JAMA 289:427-33, 2003. Three exacerbating factors that can influence drug use to become drug abuse are social approval, lack of perceived risks, and availability of drugs in the community. Youths from certain demographics are also at higher risk for abuse and addiction. These groups include those suffering from a mental illness and come from a family history of addiction. Yet, some teens living with dual diagnosis prove that there is not always a causal relationship between mental illness and a substance abuse problem. Moreover, when addiction occurs, youth are more likely to require teen rehab as a form of treatment.. Most young adults have a false perception that they may be invincible. These individuals believe changes won't be made until an extreme event happens i.e. a friend overdoses, a car accident or even death. Even then it is not likely that they will see the correlation between use and trauma. Plans on preventing substance abuse = Family based prevention programs = \\"Prevention programs can strengthen protective factors among young children by teaching parents better family communication skills, appropriate discipline styles, firm and consistent rule enforcement, and other family management approaches. Research confirms the benefits of parents providing consistent rules and discipline, talking to children about drugs, monitoring their activities, getting to know their friends, understanding their problems and concerns, and being involved in their learning. The importance of the parent-child relationship continues through adolescence and beyond\\" (National Institute of Drug Abuse, 2003). Smit, Verdurmen, Monshouwer, and Smil conducted research analysis to measure the effectiveness of family interventions about teen and adolescence drug and alcohol use. According to their data alcohol and drug use is very common in Western societies. For example, 18% of the young adults between the ages of 12-14 year old in US have indulged in binge drinking. According to quantities in 2006, 73% of 16-year- old US students were reported having used alcohol; In Northern Europe this is 90%. Since early use of alcohol and other substances may cause serious health, immediate solutions to these problem are required . = School-based prevention programs = US Navy Master-at-Arms 1st Class Michael Turner of Mobile Security Squadron Two (MSS-2) collects information at the Substance Abuse Prevention Summit Drama based education to motivate participation in substance abuse prevention. (media from BioMed Central) There are a number of community-based prevention programs and classes that aim to educate children and families about the harms of substance abuse. Schools began introducing substance abuse oriented classes for their students in grades as low as preschool. The inclusion of prevention studies into classroom curriculums at a young age have been shown to help to break early behaviors that could be signs drug abuse in the future. Around 40% of children have tried alcohol by the time that they are ten. There are organizations that educates, advocates, and collaborates to reduce drug and alcohol problems in the state. Some programs may begin by allowing students to be interactive and learn skills such as how to refuse drugs. This is proven to be a more effective method than strictly educational or non-interactive ones. When direct influences (e.g., peers) and indirect influences (e.g., media influence) are addressed, the program is better able to cover broad social influences that most programs do not consider. Programs that encourage a social commitment to abstaining from drugs show lower rates of drug use. Getting the community outside of the school to participate and also using peer leaders to facilitate the interactions tend to be an effective facet of these programs. Lastly, teaching youth and adolescents skills that increase resistance skills in social situations may increase protective factors in that population. = Community prevention programs = Prevention programs work at the community level with civic, religious, law enforcement, and other government organizations to enhance anti-drug norms and pro-social behaviors. Many programs help with prevention efforts across settings to help send messages through school, work, religious institutions, and the media. Research has shown that programs that reach youth through multiple settings can remarkably influence community norms. Community- based programs also typically include development of policies or enforcement of regulations, mass media efforts, and community-wide awareness programs. Increasing health education in the community also plays a role in helping to decrease the consequences of substance abuse. On a community level, established safe injection sites that provide a hygienic space supervised by licensed healthcare professionals allow for safe monitoring of participants and provide health education and care to prevent overdose and abuse. Another way to help prevent overdose and abuse, especially regarding opioids, is the increased access and knowledge of naloxone. Naloxone is the standard opioid overdose reversal agent. Studies show Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) programs decrease the rate of rate of deaths from opioid overdose. Naloxone comes in different routes of administration such as, an injection that's administered intravenously, intramuscular, or subcutaneously and a nasal spray. Naloxone injection and the nasal spray are both commonly used in adults and children who are going through drug overdose because it is successful in reversing the overdose effects As a safety precaution, patients taking opioids are recommended to always carry naloxone with them and should replace the naloxone regularly, via reference to the expiration date.  National recognition of substance abuse prevention  In 2011 President Obama issued October as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. It pays tribute to all people working hard to prevent abuse in communities and working hard to make a safer drug-free country. Millions of Americans currently participate in Red Ribbon Week activities, according to the National Family Partnership (NFP)—the Red Ribbon campaign’s national organizer. The Drug Enforcement Administration, a Federal partner in Red Ribbon Week, describes it as “the most far-reaching and well-known drug prevention event in America.” Through the efforts of the NFP, other national organizations, Federal and State agencies, and communities, Red Ribbon Week has become more than a call to action. It has grown to be a unifying symbol of family and community dedication to preventing the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs among youth. In 2017, the FDA created the Opioid Policy Steering Committee (OPSC) to help guide FDA efforts in fighting this opioid epidemic specifically focusing on topics of new addiction, treatment support and development, assessment of risk over benefit and overall enforcement. In the United States, there is a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that provides a free 365 days per year 24 hour phone service. Their purpose is providing information or therapy referrals to anyone experiencing substance use disorders or mental health issues. This national helpline number's is (1800-662-HELP (4357)). The NIH on drug abuse has made available research- based guides with the goal of preventing drug abuse and addiction in the youth. One guide speaks on prevention for early childhood. Another talks about prevention in children and adolescents.

The novel mixes alternate history with science fiction elements, in particular, with alternative physics and logic. English language rights to Ice have been acquired by London-based publisher Head of Zeus in 2017. The publication date will be announced once the novel is translated. Universe The story of the book takes place in an alternate universe where the First World War never occurred and Poland is still under Russian rule. Following the Tunguska event, the Ice, a mysterious form of matter, has covered parts of Siberia in Russia and started expanding outwards, reaching Warsaw. The appearance of Ice results in extreme decrease of temperature, putting the whole continent under constant winter, and is accompanied by Lute, angels of Frost, a strange form of being which seems to be a native inhabitant of Ice. Under the influence of the Ice, iron turns into zimnazo (cold iron), a material with extraordinary physical properties, which results in the creation of a new branch of industry, zimnazo mining and processing, giving birth to large fortunes and new industrial empires.

Plot The protagonist of the novel is Benedykt Gierosławski, a Polish mathematician and notorious gambler, collaborating with Alfred Tarski on his work on many-valued logics. The Ministry of Winter's officials visit Gierosławski and make him embark on a Transsiberian journey to find his lost father, who is said to be able to communicate with Lute. During his journey Gieroslawski finds out that he is caught in a political intrigue, brought about by rivalry between two palace factions, liedniacy (conservatives and Siberian entrepreneurs backing the idea of \\"frozen Russia\\") and ottiepelnicy (mostly revolutionaries aiming for a literal and political \\"thaw\\"), supported also by the Tsar. He also meets Nikola Tesla in disguise, who has conceived a technology for manipulating and eventually destroying the Ice and has been hired by the Tsar to relieve Russia from the Winter. During the journey and upon his arrival in Irkutsk Gierosławski discovers that various political forces, including Followers of St. Marcyn, a sect worshiping the Ice led by Rasputin, followers of Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, who strive for assuring human immortality, and Siberian industrial potentates, are interested in his person and that Józef Piłsudski, in this reality leading a group of Sybiraks and Siberian separatists fighting for Polish independence, may possess knowledge about his father.

In the book, Goldberg argues that fascist movements were and are left-wing, in contrast to the mainstream view among historians and political scientists that maintains fascism is a far-right ideology. Published in January 2008, it reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list of hardcover non-fiction in its seventh week on the list.  Summary of contents  In the book, Goldberg argues that both social liberalism and fascism descended from progressivism. According to Goldberg, before World War II \\"fascism was widely viewed as a progressive social movement with many liberal and left-wing adherents in Europe and the United States\\".. Goldberg writes that there was more to fascism than bigotry and genocide and argues that those characteristics were not so much a feature of Italian fascism, but rather of German Nazism which was allegedly forced upon the Italian fascists \\"after the Nazis had invaded northern Italy and created a puppet government in Salò\\". He argues that over time the term fascism has lost its original meaning and has descended to the level of being \\"a modern word for 'heretic', branding an individual worthy of excommunication from the body politic\\", noting that in 1946 the anti-fascist writer George Orwell described the word as no longer having any meaning except to signify \\"something not desirable\\".\\"Politics and the English Language\\" George Orwell, 1946.  Origin of title and cover  Goldberg has said in interviews that the title Liberal Fascism was taken from a 1932 speech by science fiction pioneer and socialist\\"H. G. Wells: A Political Life\\", Journal article by John S. Partington; Utopian Studies, Vol. 19, 2008. H. G. Wells at Oxford... Goldberg quotes Wells as stating that he wanted to \\"assist in a kind of phoenix rebirth\\" of liberalism as an \\"enlightened Nazism\\".

Plot Kung Fu Soccer is about the soccer world intertwined with talented people from the world of Kung Fu. Each character has a special Kung Fu talent that they use to play soccer. Lam Chung Fu (Anthony Wong) was once a great soccer player in China. While at the top of his soccer-playing career, his brother Pau set him up and he was forced to give up soccer. One day, Fu meets a young man named Shun/Little Sun (Dicky Cheung) and is impressed by his kung-fu and kicking skills. Shun has a disease that causes him to have a really bad memory and he can not remember people. The only thing he can remember is everything relating to soccer (for example soccer players, soccer teams and soccer matches). Fu comes up with the idea to form a Kung-Fu soccer team and apply martial arts skills to the game of soccer. They lose their first game with 16-2. However after being trained really hard by Lam Chung Fu the team becomes better and soon wins most of its games. Then Shun meets a traditional Chinese doctor that has a new medication that can help him. However this new medication has a huge risk, if it goes wrong the medication can kill him. Shun's sister (Sandra Ng), who also has many kung fu skills, gives Shun the choice and he chooses to take the new medication. Shun survives, his memory becomes normal and he is soon elected as captain of the team. The story continues with the team winning many matches and having many sponsors. Near the end, Lam Chung Fu's brother, the evil Lam Chung Pau wants their team to lose, so he creates another Kung Fu soccer team to compete against them. Pau has many evil people working for him and even kills 2 people from Fu's soccer team (a goal keeper who tried to save his team mates while they were trapped in a building by Pau and a defence player who tried to save another player from his team by donating his kidney because Pau's player kicked Fu's player really hard during a soccer match). The defence player is unlucky and dies after the operation but the player who he tried to save, survives. At last (and thanks to Lam Chung Fu's hard work), the players succeed in defeating Pau's team and become world famous.

Located in a green, silent locality on the banks of the river Bharatapuzha, Sadanam has groomed several artistes who have gained acclaim in the field as actor-dancers, musicians, percussionists, make-up men and greenroom assistants. Among them are Sadanam Krishnankutty, Balakrishnan, Ramankutty, Narippatta Narayanan Namboodiri, Pariyanampatta Divakaran, Sadanam K. Harikumaran, Bhasi, Manikantan, Sreenathan, Rahul and Kiran (all actor- dancers), besides musicians like Sadanam Jyothi Radhakrishnan, Rajagopalan, Shyamalan and Sivadas; chenda artistes like Sadanam Vasu, Mattannur Sankarankutty Marar, Sadanam Divakaran, Gopalakrishnan, Ramakrishnan, Sivakumar and Sreekumar; maddalam artistes like Cherpulasseri Sivan, Sadanam Sreedharan, Ramachandran, Murukajyothi, Rajan, Devadas and Bharatharajan; make-up (chutti) artistes Sadanam Sreenivasan and Saju; and greenroom artistes Kunjan and Govindan. Not far away from its main campus, the academy has an impressive indoor-cum-outdoor auditorium that plays the venue for Sadanam's functions during special occasions like anniversary celebrations and the Pattikkamthodi Jayanti (28 September). Sadanam has been listed in the official tourism sites of the Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala, India.Official website, Kerala Tourism, God's Own Country, Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala, India, Asia Details of the courses offered by the traditional Kathakali training centre can be accessed at http://trainingcentres.keralatourism.org/centre_details.php?id=19.

Its long-standing reputation and contributions to the traditional art form has also earned it recognition as an institution of higher learning by the Government of India.http://www.indiaeducation.ernet.in/insitutions/profile.asp?no=U01634) Gandhi Seva Sadan also runs a teachers training institute, a senior secondary school (affiliated to the CBSE) and a computer training center under its management. Life profile of founder K. Kumaran Gandhi Seva Sadan was founded by Kollaikal Kumaran, son of Madathil Narayanan Nair and Kollaikal Devakiamma. He finished his schooling from the government high school in his native Thiruvilwamala and joined Government Victoria college, Palakkad, in the year 1941 for his intermediate. While in college, Kumaran followed Mahatma Gandhi's call for fight against the British for India's independence and took part in Quit India Movement. Quite expectedly, he was expelled from the college for this action. He then joined the freedom struggle and was jailed in Alippuram, Bellary, for his activities against the \\"British Raj\\". Inspired by the Mahatma's call to \\"Do or Die\\", Kumaran managed to escape from Allipuram Jail in 1943. He was arrested in Madras, but he managed to escape again from police custody. His uncle Madathil Vasudevan Nair whom he lovingly called \\"Vasuetta\\" supported him. During a second conviction in Bellary jail, Kumaran was subjected to torture and put in iron fetters under the order of Col. Howe. He was released in 1944. Soon after this, he went to Bombay (now Mumbai) as a full-time congress worker and captained the volunteer team for the 1945 AICC session. During this session, he came into contact with Gandhiji and several senior Congress leaders. Heeding to Mahatma Gandhi's call to youngsters to live and die in the villages of India, Kumaran set forth and put in the place the first modest steps for what was to become a big institution in his Perur. With the help of a small sum donated by few village elders he bought 12 charkhas (cotton-spinning machines which were at that time the symbol of the aspirations of an independent India). He established a school, a teacher training Institution,a Vocational centre, and a Kathakali Centre and Bharatanatyam Institute. Throughout his lifetime he wore Khadhi cloth and followed Gandhiji. He weathered difficult times, but eventually built Sadanam as a renowned institution. Kumaran died in 2005. Gurus at Sadanam Sadanam has a tradition of inviting the greatest of gurus of Kathakali and Rasa Abhinaya as its trainers. The stalwarts of yesteryear include Guru Kunchu Kurup for Kathakali and Kutiyattam maestro Natyacharya Mani Madhava Chakyar for Rasaabhinaya and Netraabhinaya (both Padma Shri awardees). Sadanam has had several prominent exponents in its faculty, the longest-serving among them includes the late Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair. The students have earlier also had training under veteran gurus like the late Thekkinkattil Ramunni Nair, Padma Bhushan Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair, the late Kalamandalam Padmanabhan Nair and Kottakkal Krishnankutty Nair, besides late masters like Kadathanattu Govindan Nambisan, Kalamandalam Neelakantan Nambisan, Kalamandalam Unnikrishna Kurup, Kalamandalam Krishnankutty Poduval, Kalamandalam Chandra Mannadiyar, Tirur Nambissan and Kalamandalam Appukutty Poduval. Currently, Kumaran's son and versatile artiste Sadanam K. Harikumaran is the principal of Sadanam. Kathakali master Narippatta Narayanan Namboodiri is its director. Kalanilayam Balakrishnan, Paara Narayanan Namboodiri and Kalamandalam Satheesan are among the senior instructors.

The short was released on May 4, 1957, and is the second of three McKimson cartoons parodying television's The Honeymooners (the others being The Honey-Mousers and Mice Follies). Plot Ralph comes home to prepare a surprise birthday for his wife Alice. What prevents Ralph from getting the birthday cake is a cat in the kitchen. Ralph goes to the kitchen sink to ask Ned Morton for help. Ned gets Ralph to ride a clockwork armored car with a cannon. As Ralph prepares to fire the cannon on the cat, the cat backfires the cannon on Ralph, forcing Ralph to retreat. Next, Ralph paints so-called invisible ink (actually water) on Ned, convincing him that he is invisible. Ned confidently walks past the cat, even honking his nose and plucking a whisker. When Ned returns, he has eaten the cake he was supposed to bring. Ralph, getting impatient, has Ned paint him with the \\"invisible ink\\" and Ralph goes to the fridge, only to be massacred by the cat. Next, Ned launches Ralph from a champagne bottle cork right into the cat's mouth and through his tail right over to the fridge, but the cat forces Ralph to retreat again. Both mice then lure the cat onto the sink so that they can put his tail down the plughole. Then they activate the garbage disposal, causing the cat to lose much of his fur and giving the mice the chance to take a cupcake from the fridge. Ralph and Ned finally have everything ready for Alice. Alice is flattered by Ralph's surprise. Unfortunately, Ned put firecrackers instead of candles on the cupcake. After passing it to and fro, Ralph and Ned push the cupcake in the cat's face through Ralph's front door, causing the cat to fly on to the ceiling light, leaving him dazed.

One of his sons, George Lister-Kaye (1803–1871), made a single first-class cricket appearance for Sussex in 1828.  Early life John Lister-Kaye was born at Denby Grange between Wakefield and Huddersfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The illegitimate son of Sir John Lister-Kay, 5th Baronet of Denby Grange, he was the sole heir to both the Lister and Kaye families, ancient Yorkshire pedigrees stretching back to the middle ages. One son of Kaye married into the Tory Squires family, Danby knights of Masham. On 4 February 1641, Sir John of Woodsome rode out in support of King Charles I and was created a baronet for his services to the Royalist army. He died unmarried in 1789, leaving his estates to his natural son, while the title devolved to his younger half-brother, Sir Richard Kaye, 6th Baronet who was Dean of Lincoln Cathedral. Having no legitimate children, the baronetcy expired on the sixth baronet's death on Christmas Day 1809. =Yorkshire gentry = Sir John's acquisition of the landed estates devised on him was the cause for entitlement for a baronetcy, when George III created a new title by patent on 28 December 1812. His land included the Manors of Burton (or Kirkburton), Woodsham, Shelley and other lands in Yorkshire. The country was at war with France and under very serious threat of invasion. The Yorkshire squirearchy was designated responsibility for being officers of the local militia mobilised to keep law and order and police the coasts of England, as nightwatchmen. Their powers had been created by parliament in the Militia Act 1757, which remained in force for a century. Personal life On 18 October 1800, Sir John was married to Lady Amelia Grey at Bowden Church in Cheshire. Lady Amelia was the sixth daughter of George Grey, Earl of Stamford and Warrington. The society marriage strengthened his entitlement. The couple had four sons and six daughters:The Baronetage of England. Volume 24 Publisher F.C. and J.

Johnson won 6 of 16 events.Chevrolet 1998 Season Review, December 8, 1998; motorsport.com; Retrieved February 15, 2008 Busch Series =Breeding of champions= HJM debuted in 2000 as Herzog Motorsports with SODA and American Speed Association driver Jimmie Johnson, who had previously worked with them in SODA. Sponsored by wireless company Alltel, Johnson would finish 10th in the points and place third in the 2000 Rookie of the Year points, behind Ron Hornaday and Kevin Harvick. Johnson's rookie year was notable for a crash at Watkins Glen International, where his brakes failed heading into turn 1 and he slammed the barrier head on. He was not injured and even pumped his fists after exiting the car. After Alltel left for Penske Racing, Johnson remained with the team for 2001, sponsored by Excedrin. Johnson gave the team its first ever win at the inaugural race at Chicagoland Speedway. Herzog's plans were to field a Cup team with Johnson, but he had already signed a deal with Hendrick Motorsports for 2002. Herzog then turned to Todd Bodine. Bodine would take the team's second win at Kentucky Speedway and finished 23rd in points. After Excedrin's departure, Herzog Motorsports joined with former baseball player Reggie Jackson to form Herzog–Jackson Motorsports in 2003. With Bodine back at the wheel, the team took its third and final victory at Darlington Raceway. Despite the added presence of fame, the team had sponsors for a few races, but could not attract a major sponsor to pay the bills, despite Bodine leading the points. Troubles were evident when the team skipped the Chicago race and Bodine was released. HJM returned at Kansas with Jeff Green, who finished 11th. They only ran one more race at Homestead, also with Green, finishing 27th before shutting down.

Design and development The Fleetster received Approved Type Certificate Number 369 on 29 September 1930. It was designed to meet a requirement of the New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line (NYRBA) for an aircraft to serve the coastal routes in South America. The Fleetster had a streamlined all-metal monocoque fuselage with a wooden wing. The powerplant was a 575 hp (429 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1860 Hornet B radial engine. It was available as a landplane or seaplane and could accommodate up to eight passengers, although the three NYRBA aircraft were fitted with two full-width seats each for three passengers. A parasol- wing version (the Model 20 Fleetster) was also developed with the wing supported by four short struts. The open cockpit was moved behind the passenger cabin and the resultant space was used as a cargo compartment. Three aircraft were built for NYRBA and a private Canadian customer. In 1932 a carrier-borne dive bomber version (Model 18) was evaluated by the United States Navy as the XBY-1, it was not ordered but was the first stressed-skin aircraft, and the first aircraft with so-called \\"wet wing\\" integral fuel tanks in the wings operated by the Navy.

It was built by Avro as the Avro Type 620. It proved to be the most successful and widely produced of the early de la Cierva designs. Development De la Cierva's first successful autogyro, the Cierva C.6, used an Avro 504 fuselage, and this led to a long and close collaboration between de la Cierva and Avro from 1926 onwards, with de la Cierva providing the rotor design, and Avro the airframe from designs that often appeared as both fixed- wing and rotary aircraft. There was a long series of such autogyros, developing the rotary wing concept. However the 1929 C.19A.J. Jackson. British Civil Aircraft since 1919 Volume II, 1974. p.16-20 London:Putnam and Company. ,Jackson, A.J. Avro Aircraft since 1908. (1965) London: Putnam Aeronautical Books pages 433–5 was a de la Cierva design, owing nothing to existing Avro aircraft, though it was built by Avro at Hamble. Like the earlier aircraft, the C.19 had a conventional airframe, a two-seat fuselage carrying a small- span wing with ailerons (to relieve rotor loads in level forward flight), and a single radial engine in the nose. The unpowered, free-spinning rotor had four wire-braced blades, or three cantilever blades in the Mk IV, and was mounted on four struts over the forward cockpit which met together to form a pyramid. The C.19 Mk I – IV did not have the tilting rotor head and associated hanging control column of later autogyros like the Cierva C.30. Instead, control was by the ailerons, elevators and rudder via a conventional column, a system that only worked effectively when the airspeed was high enough. A major engineering refinement in the C.19 was the means to mechanically start the main rotor spinning; in earlier de la Cierva designs, the rotor had to be turned by hand or by pulling a rope, unless there was space for a takeoff run. In the C.19 Mk I, this was done aerodynamically. The tail unit of this mark was a biplane structure with endplate fins and rudders. To start the rotor, elevators and tailplanes were fixed in a near vertical position and the engine started. The wash from the propeller was deflected upwards by the tail unit through the rotor, rotating it. For the first time, this made the autogyro independent of ground crew when starting, and private ownership was a practical proposition. The 80 hp (60 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet II made the Mk I machine underpowered, and it was replaced in the C.19 Mk II by a 105 hp (78 kW) Genet Major I. The C.19 Mk IIA, introduced in 1930, had a longer undercarriage and improved rotor head. Landings were often made at high angles of attack, so the rudders of the C.19 Mk III were reshaped to slope sharply upwards to avoid damage; this variant also had a 5 ft (1.52 m) increase in rotor diameter. In the C.19 Mk IV, the rotor was started directly from the engine via a clutch mechanism, as in all future autogyros. This allowed the elaborate biplane empennage to be replaced by a more conventional monoplane tailplane. The single central fin was low and of correspondingly deep chord, to avoid being struck by the rotor. The C.19 Mk IV had a three-bladed, cantilever rotor. The designation C.19 Mk IVP was also used, the \\"P\\" standing for production, that started in 1931. The final variant was the solitary C.19 Mk V, G-ABXP.Jackson, A.J., British Civil Aircraft 1919–72: Volume II, (1973). p.21, C.30 section London: Putnam and Company. The aircraft-style controls of earlier autogyros depended on airflow past ailerons, rudders and elevators; during the slow forward speed phases of takeoff and landing, these were ineffective, and accidents resulted. The C.19 Mk V lacked the small wing and all-moving control surfaces, relying instead on a tilting rotor head. Using a long control arm that reached to the rear cockpit, the pilot could direct the aircraft by tilting the plane of rotation of the rotor. After a period of experimentation, the C.19 Mk V flew with a small fixed tailplane and a two- bladed rotor. This control system was adopted for the Cierva C.30. Operational history Some thirty examples were built in England, with licences acquired by Focke-Wulf to produce it in Germany (as the C.20) and by Lioré et Olivier in France (as the C.21), although no actual French production took place. Initially, all fifteen C.19 Mk IVPs appeared on the British civil register. One was used in an attempted flight to South Africa, although it only reached Tunis. Later, it flew with Alan Cobham's Circus. Another went to an autogyro flying school at London Air Park, Hanworth. Several machines were reregistered abroad: in Australia, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain (one for the Spanish Air Force) and Sweden. During the early 1930s, the Royal Air Force operated two C.19 Mk IIIs for evaluation of the autogyro concept (serials K1696 and K1948).A.J. Jackson.

De Jarnatt is perhaps best known for writing and directing the nuclear-apocalypse thriller Miracle Mile (1988) and directing the sci-fi film Cherry 2000 (1987). In 1983 Miracle Mile was chosen by American Film magazine as one of the ten best unproduced screenplays circulating in Hollywood. That same year De Jarnatt received his first screen credit as one of the writers of Strange Brew, a comedy starring Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as their respective SCTV characters Bob & Doug McKenzie. De Jarnatt has also directed episodic television, including Lizzie McGuire, Flight 29 Down, ER, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. His short story \\"Rubiaux Rising\\" appeared in the 2009 edition of The Best American Short Stories, as selected by author Alice Sebold. A collection of De Jarnatt's stories, Grace for Grace, was published in 2020.  Background and education  De Jarnatt grew up in Longview, Washington. His father, Arlie De Jarnatt, was a teacher and public representative who taught history and civics at Monticello Middle School and later R.A. Long High School, as well as serving five terms as a Democratic Party member of the Washington House of Representatives and six years as a state senator. De Jarnatt's mother, Donna, was an artist who also taught at St. Helens Elementary School and Monticello Middle. De Jarnatt himself attended R.A. Long, graduating in 1970. Although he was a successful sprinter at high school (where he set several records), he chose Occidental College in Los Angeles, rather than take a track scholarship to a local public university, because he preferred the Southern Californian climate and environment. De Jarnatt first took an interest in film during his time at Occidental; attracted by \\"access to good film equipment,\\" he subsequently attended The Evergreen State College, from which he graduated in 1974. He later studied at the American Film Institute.

Established in 2007, it was owned and operated by now-defunct Equity Media Holdings. Retro Jams was formerly carried full-time as a free-to-air TV channel on Galaxy 18 (Ku band DVB-S, 123°W) and on various Equity-owned terrestrial low-power television stations nationwide. The \\"Retro Jams\\" name and branding have also been used by Retro Television Network to refer to two individual programming blocks, \\"Retro Jams\\" and \\"Retro Jams by Request\\".  History  Retro Jams was established in December 2007 by Equity Media Holdings to provide music video programming to a few individual, local Equity-owned stations which lacked a conventional television network affiliation. Programming consisted primarily of music videos from the 1980s and early 1990s. On most of these stations, Equity replaced Retro Jams with the Retro Television Network in mid-2008. As Equity had founded RTN and owned the network until 2008, the \\"Retro Jams\\" name was moved to individual RTN programming blocks \\"Retro Jams\\" and \\"Retro Jams by Request\\" when the full- channel music video format was dropped. While most affected stations (such as KCBU and KEGS-LP) simply replaced Retro Jams with RTN, a few stations went to other networks. WEVU-CA switched to Univision affiliation and K25DM was operated as an independent station.

She hires Hudson to marry her so that she can regain entry to the United States in time to give a benefit performance, stipulating that he must divorce her within six months to receive his final payment. Hudson agrees only because he sees something special in her, but thinks she has lost her way both personally and artistically in fame, her entourage, and her career.

Following an uproar across South Africa against Clicks and TRESemmé, protest action, damage to some Clicks stores by members of the South African political party Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and a call by Minister of Small Business Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni to remove all TRESemmé products, Clicks issued an apology, temporarily closed a number of its stores, suspended staff responsible for approving the advert, pulled all TRESemmé products, and pledged to fill the gap with locally sourced hair care brands.. National retail chains Shoprite/Checkers, Pick n Pay, Makro, Dis-Chem and Woolworths also announced their intention to remove all TRESemmé products from their shelves. On 10 September, the EFF released a joint statement with Unilever South Africa on Twitter where they announced Unilever's decision to remove all its TRESemmé products from all retailers for 10 days as a show of remorse, conduct an internal investigation into the campaign, and take disciplinary action on those involved. The statement also said that the director involved in the campaign left the company and country The intent behind the damaging advertisement is not universally regarded as purposely malicious and neither Clicks nor TRESemmé consider its racial undertone to be intentional. TRESemmé issued an apology in September 2020, stating that \\"the campaign set out to celebrate the beauty of all hair types and the range of solutions that TRESemmé offers\\" and that \\"we got it wrong\\". Commenting on the controversy, black television personality Somizi Mhlongo said that there may be some truth in the TRESemmé ad, noting \\"The hair that they showed is the hair that looks like what happens when we relax our hair. My hair right now is not natural, it has chemicals, it’s damaged.\\" Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week TRESemmé was the official hair care sponsor of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2014 in New York in February, and had been since 2006.

Furthermore photographing in a place where people would reasonably expect to be afforded privacy such as in a public restroom may also be illegal. = Private property = While you can generally photograph private property and the people within it if you are not within the bounds of the private property and can't be asked to stop or delete the images, the owner can restrict recording whilst you are on the private property. Failure to comply with orders to stop recording on the private property is not a criminal offence although it may be against the terms or policy of entrance and you many be asked to leave, if you refuse to leave you may be liable for trespassing. = Publishing and rights = The photographer generally has full rights of the images meaning they can also publish it to something like social media without permission from the people in the image.

Persistent and aggressive photography of a single individual may come under the legal definition of harassment.Linda Macpherson LL.B, Dip.L.P., LL.M – The UK Photographers Rights Guide It is contempt of court, a criminal offence, to take a photograph in any court of law of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal, or to publish such a photograph. This includes photographs taken in a court building or the precincts of the court.Criminal Justice Act 1925 (c.86) s.41 Taking a photograph in a court can be seen as a serious offence, leading to a prison sentence.Mobile court photo sentence upheld – news.bbc.co.ukRegina v Vincent D No. 2004/01739/A7 [2004] EWCA Crim 1271 The prohibition on taking photographs in the precincts is vague. It was designed to prevent the undermining of the dignity of the court, through the exploitation of images in low brow \\"picture papers\\".Rubin, G. \\"Seddon, Dell and rock n' roll: investigating alleged breaches of the ban on publishing photographs taken within courts or their precincts, 1925–1967\\" Crim. L.R. 874 Photography of certain subject matter is restricted in the United Kingdom. In particular, the Protection of Children Act 1978 restricts making or possessing pornography of children under 18, or what looks like pornography of under-18s. There is no law prohibiting photographing children in public spaces. It is an offence under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 to publish or communicate a photograph of a constable (not including PCSOs), a member of the armed forces, or a member of the security services, which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. There is a defence of acting with a reasonable excuse; however, the burden of proof is on the defence, under section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000. A PCSO in 2009 cited Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent a member of the public photographing him. Section 44 actually concerns stop and search powers. However, in January 2010 the stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights. Following a prolonged campaign, including a series of demonstrations by photographers dealt with by police officers and PCSOs, the Metropolitan Police was forced to issue updated legal advice which confirms that \\"Members of the public and the media do not need a permit to film or photograph in public places and police have no power to stop them filming or photographing incidents or police personnel\\" and that \\"The power to stop and search someone under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 no longer exists.\\" It is an offence under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to take a photograph of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, or possessing such a photograph. There is an identical defence of reasonable excuse. This offence (and possibly, but not necessarily the offence) covers only a photograph as described in of the Terrorism Act 2006. As such, it must be of a kind likely to provide practical assistance to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Whether the photograph in question is such is a matter for a jury, which is not required to look at the surrounding circumstances. The photograph must contain information of such a nature as to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to assist in the preparation or commission of an act of terrorism. It must call for an explanation. A photograph which is innocuous on its face will not fall foul of the provision if the prosecution adduces evidence that it was intended to be used for the purpose of committing or preparing a terrorist act. The defence may prove a reasonable excuse simply by showing that the photograph is possessed for a purpose other than to assist in the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism, even if the purpose of possession is otherwise unlawful.R v K [2008] EWCA Crim 185 =Copyright= Copyright can subsist in an original photograph, i.e. a recording of light or other radiation on any medium on which an image is produced or from which an image by any means be produced, and which is not part of a film.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 1(1)(a) and s 4(2) Whilst photographs are classified as artistic works, the subsistence of copyright does not depend on artistic merit. The owner of the copyright in the photograph is the photographer – the person who creates it,Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 9(1) by default.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 11(1) However, where a photograph is taken by an employee in the course of employment, the first owner of the copyright is the employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 11(3) Copyright which subsists in a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his/her work, but also from indirect copying to reproduce his/her work, where a substantial part of his/her work has been copied. Copyright in a photograph lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the photographer dies.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 12 A consequence of this lengthy period of existence of the copyright is that many family photographs which have no market value, but significant emotional value, remain subject to copyright, even when the original photographer cannot be traced (a problem known as copyright orphan), has given up photography, or died. In the absence of a licence, it will be an infringement of copyright in the photographs to copy them.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 16(2) When someone dies the rights will have transferred to someone else, perhaps through testamentary deposition (a will) or by inheritance. If there was no will, or if the photographer has not specified where the rights in the material should go, then the normal rules of inheritance will apply (although these rules are not specific to copyright and legal advice should be sought). Scanning old family photographs, without permission, to a digital file for personal use is prima facie an infringement of copyright. Certain photographs may not be protected by copyright. Section 171(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 gives courts jurisdiction to refrain from enforcing the copyright which subsists in works on the grounds of public interest. For example, patent diagrams are held to be in the public domain, and are thus not subject to copyright. Infringement \\"No photographs\\" sticker. Designed for persons at conferences who do not want any digital likeness of them taken, including video, photography, audio, etc. Infringement of the copyright which subsists in a photograph can be performed through copying the photograph. This is because the owner of the copyright in the photograph has the exclusive right to copy the photograph.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 16(1) For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part of the photograph.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s16(3) A photograph can also be a mechanism of infringement of the copyright which subsists in another work. For example, a photograph which copies a substantial part of an artistic work, such as a sculpture, painting or another photograph (without permission) would infringe the copyright which subsists in those works. However, the subject matter of a photograph is not necessarily subject to an independent copyright. For example, in the Creation Records case,Creation Records Ltd v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1997] EMLR 444 (Ch) a photographer, attempting to create a photograph for an album cover, set up an elaborate and artificial scene. A photographer from a newspaper covertly photographed the scene and published it in the newspaper. The court held that the newspaper photographer did not infringe the official photographer's copyright. Copyright did not subsist in the scene itself – it was too temporary to be a collage, and could not be categorised as any other form of artistic work. Richard Arnold has criticized the protection of photographs in this manner on two grounds.Richard Arnold, “Copyright in Photographs: A Case for Reform” [2005] European Intellectual Property Review 303 Firstly, it is argued that photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected in a manner similar to that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken.Illustrated in the Norowzian v Arks case. In this case, it was noted that the copyright in a film would be infringed only though photographic copying of a substantial part, as opposed to mere recreation of the film. It was, however, also held that a film could be protected by copyright both as a film and as a dramatic work, provided, of course, that it fulfilled the requirements of protection of a dramatic work, on the facts. The claimant, was eventually unsuccessful. It was held that whilst the film in question in fact had copyright subsist in it both as a film and as a dramatic work, this copyright was not infringed, because there was no copying of a substantial part. It is argued that protection of photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound, recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, Michael Reichmann described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the protection of photographs as artistic works leads to bizarre results. Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment. That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection. It is possible to say with a high degree of confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright. It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.See Sawkins v Hyperion Records [2005] EWCA Civ 565 at [79]-[84] =Photography and privacy= A right to privacy came into existence in UK law as a consequence of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.Human Rights Act 1998 sections 2 & 3Human Rights Act 1998 Schedule 1, Part 1, Article 8Mosley v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB)Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd [2004] UKHL 22Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446 Whether this right is caused by horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 or is judicially created is a matter of some controversy.J. Morgan, \\"Privacy in the House of Lords, Again\\" (2004), 120 Law Quarterly Review 563, 565 The right to privacy is protected by Article 8 of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of proportionality. A very limited statutory right to privacy exists in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This right is held, for example, by someone who hires a photographer to photograph their wedding. The commissioner,Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 2 irrespective of any copyright which he does or does not hold in the photograph, of a photograph which was commissioned for private and domestic purposes, where copyright subsists in the photograph, has the right not to have copies of the work issued to the public,Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 85(1)a the work exhibited in publicCopyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 85(1)a Paragraph B or the work communicated to the public.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 85(1)a Paragraph C However, this right will not be infringed if the rightholder gives permission. It will not be infringed if the photograph is incidentally included in an artistic work, film, or broadcast.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 s 85(2)(a) United States Local, state, and national laws govern still and motion photography. Laws vary between jurisdictions, and what is not illegal in one place may be illegal in another. Typical laws in the United States are as follows: =Public property= Some museums do not allow photography. *It is legal to photograph or videotape anything and anyone on any public property, within reasonable community standards. *Photographing or videotaping a tourist attraction, whether publicly or privately owned, is generally considered legal, unless explicitly prohibited by a specific law or statute. =Private property= *Photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property. However, a property owner generally cannot restrict the photographing of the property by individuals who are not within the bounds of the property. *Photography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both. =Outer space= *Remote sensing of the earth from outer space is regulated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which requires that a license be issued in advance. =Privacy issues= * Photographing private property from within the public domain is not illegal, with the exception of an area that is generally regarded as private, such as a bedroom, bathroom, or hotel room. In some states there is no definition of \\"private,\\" in which case, there is a general expectation of privacy.Wright, Brittany. 2015. “Big Brother Watching Mother Nature: Conservation Drones and Their International and Domestic Privacy Implications.” Vermont Journal of Environmental Law17(1):138–59. Retrieved March 4, 2019 tr(https://www.jstor.org/stable/vermjenvilaw.17.1.138). Should the subjects not attempt to conceal their private affairs, their actions immediately become public to a photographer using normal photographic equipment. * In the US, there are multiple laws prohibiting photographing a person's genitalia without that person's permission. This also applies to any filming of another within a public restroom or locker room. Some jurisdictions have banned the use of a telephone with camera functionality within a restroom or locker room in order to prevent this. The United States enacted the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's genitalia without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy. State laws have also been passed addressing this issue. =Commercial photography= *In certain locations, such as California State Parks, commercial photography requires a permit and sometimes proof of insurance. California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 4316, Commercial Filming. Retrieved 2010-12-18. In places such as the city of Hermosa Beach in California, commercial photography on both public property and private property is subject to permit regulations and possibly also insurance requirements. *At the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, commercial photography requires a permit under certain circumstances. For photography that involves the advertising of a commercial product or service, or photography that involves sets or props or models, a permit is required. In addition, if the photography has aspects that may be disruptive to others, such as additional equipment or a significant number of personnel or the use of public areas for more than four hours, it is necessary to obtain a permit. If a photographer or related personnel need to access an area during a time when the area is normally closed, or if access to a restricted area is involved, the photography requires a permit. For commercial portrait photographers, there is a streamlined process for photography permits. In the case of National Park system units, commercial filming or audio recording requires a permit and liability insurance. Still photography that uses models or props for the purpose of commercial advertising requires a permit and proof of insurance. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 5.5(b), Commercial photography. Retrieved 2010-12-18. *If a photograph shows private property in such a manner that a viewer of the photograph can identify the owner of the property, the ASMP (American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.) recommends that a property release should be used if the photograph is to be used for advertising or commercial purposes. According to the ASMP, a property release may be a requirement in such a situation. =Other issues= *Photographing accident scenes and law enforcement activities is usually legal. At the same time, one must not hinder the operations of law enforcement, medical, emergency, or security personnel by filming. *Any filming with the intent of doing unlawful harm against a subject may be a violation of the law in itself. Canada Federal legislation governs the questions of copyright and criminal offences with respect to photography. Otherwise, the common law (except, in the case of Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec), generally determines when photography can take place. :* The Copyright Act provides that the duration of copyright for a photograph is the life of the author plus 50 years. Freedom of panorama is also allowed, with respect to photographs of sculptures and architectural works, and there is also protection for those who \\"incidentally and not deliberately include a work or other subject-matter in another work or other subject-matter.\\" :* The Criminal Code provides for punishment of various offences, including voyeurism, child pornography, trespassing at night, and paparazzi behaviour. :* The law of defamation, trespass and privacy is governed at the provincial level. ::* The common-law provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario and Saskatchewan have enacted privacy legislation dealing with personality rights, which supplement the law of trespass. ::* In Quebec, the Civil Code goes further by specifying that \\"keeping ... private life under observation by any means\\" constitutes an additional ground of invasion of privacy. In Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, because of that, supplemented by Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish them unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion.

Hungary In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 when the long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated what had been normal practice, namely, that a person had the right to refuse being photographed. However, implied consent exists: it is not illegal to photograph a person who does not actively object. Macau In Macau, a photographer must not take or publish any photographs of a person against his/her will without legal justification, even in a public place. Besides, everyone has a right to Personality Rights. People are not to be photographed, photographs of them displayed or reproduced without their prior consent. Criminal penalties include imprisonment. Additionally, photography of police officers in Macau is illegal. South Africa In South Africa photographing people in public is legal. Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration. During the media coverage of the Nkandla controversy it emerged that there exists a law, the National Key Points Act, 1980, prohibiting the photographing of any \\"national key points.\\" National key points are buildings or structures that serve a strategic or military purpose. Though it wasn't revealed what these are as part of state secrecy it was claimed that the presidential residence is one of them and should thus not be shown in media. Subsequent court action resulted in it being ruled that a list of all key points be made public. Although not currently or previously enforced the law is still in effect even after calls for it to be repealed as a relic of apartheid-era secrecy legislation.

Accessed 27 September 2016 Spain Taking pictures of police officers in many circumstances was made illegal by a 2015 \\"Citizens' Security Law\\" with the stated purpose of protecting police officers and their families from harassment.

Through these principles and assessment of behavior, OBM seeks to analyze and employ antecedent, influencing actions of an individual before the action occurs, and consequence, what happens as a result of someone’s actions, interventions which influence behaviors linked to the mission and key objectives of the organization and its workers. Such interventions have proven effective through research in improving common organizational areas including employee productivity, delivery of feedback, safety, and overall morale of said organization.  History  OBM is a subdiscipline of ABA, thus its emergence stems from the foundations of behavior analysis developed by B.F. Skinner. Skinner’s book Science and Human Behavior, published in 1953, served as the foundation for OBM by highlighting the use of money to increase desired behaviors, wage schedules, and higher levels of praise for desired behaviors as opposed to undesired behaviors. Skinner’s greatest contributions to the emergence of OBM however was introducing programmed instruction to the educational system. Aspects of programmed instruction proved beneficial in organizational settings, particularly training. This later became the first application of behavioral principles in the organizational settings. Emergence of research in OBM sparked in the 1960s with publication of Owen Aldis’ paper “Of Pigeons and Men” in which he proposes using reinforcement schedules in industries as the first OBM article published in the 1961 Harvard Business Review. = Journal of Organizational Behavior Management = Founded in 1977, the Journal of Organizational Behavior Management (JOBM) served as a milestone in the field of Organizational Behavior Management. With Aubrey Daniels as editor and Larry Miller as manager editor, the first board of editors for JOBM was composed of twenty-five individuals. Various names were used to describe the application of behavioral principles in organizational settings but the birth of JOBM solidified the use of the term Organizational Behavior Management to describe such applications in such settings. JOBM is periodical journal which seeks to publish research and review articles which apply principles of ABA to improve organizations through behavior change. Areas addressed throughout JOBM include performance measurement, performance level interventions, goal setting, feedback, incentive programs, and evidence-based management. In 2003, the ISI Impact Factor of JOBM was ranked third in the Journal Citation Reports ranking of journals in applied psychology further establishing JOBM as a high-quality journal. Presently, the editorial board of JOBM consist of 72 members with Dr. Ramona Houmanfar serving as editor. =History of educational advancements in OBM= The first university to offer a graduate program in OBM and systems analysis was Western Michigan University, under the instruction of Dick Malott. Another early program in OBM was initiated at the University of Notre Dame in 1975 with the arrival of Martin Wikoff, the first graduate student in the program. Prior to attending Notre Dame, Wikoff, with University of Washington professors, Bob Kohlenberg (Psychology) and Terrance Mitchell (Foster School of Business) conducted one of the first controlled studies of applied behavior analysis in business; in this case, to improve grocery clerk performance. This study was presented at the 1976 MABA Convention in Chicago. Its application to business was so novel that the research was assigned to the topic category of \\"Experimental Living Arrangements\\", confirming its status as one of the pioneering OBM documented applications. The Wikoff-Crowell-Anderson Notre Dame OBM research team was born.  Interventions in OBM  = Antecedent interventions = Antecedents in OBM are simply defined as triggers that evoke behavior by presenting something in the workers environment that will increase the likelihood the behavior will occur. These interventions can be used to address an array of behaviors which ultimately benefit the organization and workers of the organization. The intervention used is determined by the behavior(s) being targeted and whether or not the organization has a desire for the behavior to be exhibited in the work setting or not. The interventions are categorized by what is done to influence behavior. More commonly used antecedent interventions involve combining task clarification, job aids, and goal setting. Task clarification interventions are used and designed to provide specific job requirements for employees by clarifying and prompting employee behavior. Previous studies which implement task clarification involve using items such as memos and checklists to ensure tasks are completed. Job aids interventions involve prompts, or addition of items in the work environment such as signs, remind workers whether or not a behavior should occur. When combined, goal setting is can then be introduced to establish a standard to how well workers must perform within a given time frame. While the use of antecedent interventions one of the most common strategies, the strategies set the occasion for behavior, but do not maintain them. That aspect of OBM falls to consequence interventions. = Consequence interventions = Consequence is defined as a change in the environment that follow a worker’s behavior which increases the likelihood the behavior will continue to be exhibited in the future. Consequences interventions in OBM play a primary role in maintaining behavior are seen as the one of the most important aspects of OBM. In OBM, feedback is a common and successful intervention method used in organizational settings. A study in 2012 found that feedback was the research of interest in over 70% of studies published in JOBM. This is due to the various types of feedback delivery which can be tailored to the organization and its goals in addition to having numerous research articles which provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness. Such types include feedback on individual performance, group performance, previous individual performance, previous group performance, and different group’s performance. Regardless of the which consequence intervention used, an important element of the OBM intervention involves using one of the principles of ABA known as reinforcement. This is due to the fact that when a behavior is reinforced, it is likely to continue to be exhibited in similar conditions to which the behavior was reinforced. Behaviors which will be reinforced it determined by the organizational setting and its goals.  Management  =Scientific management= OBM might be seen as one of the distant branches of scientific management, originally inspired by Taylor.For example, Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management is listed on the OBM Network recommended books page The principal difference between scientific management and OBM might be on the conceptual underpinnings: OBM is based on B.F. Skinner's science of human behavior. Because different people behave differently in the same situation, studies from multiple disciplines using multiple research methods create confusion, hindering a unified concept of organizational behavior.Michael Beer. Organizational Behavior and Development. Harvard Business School Working Paper, No. 98-115, June 1998. =Quality management= The parallel between OBM tools and the process and procedures common to the so-called Quality Movement (SPC, Deming, Quality Circles, ISO, etc.) was documented by Wikoff in his ISPI Article of the Year, the quality movement meets performance technology,.Performance + Instruction, Volume 33, Issue 8, pages 41–45, September 1994,  Relationship with industrial and organizational psychology  While OBM and industrial and organizational (IO) psychology both take place in organizational setting, the two areas differ in ways such as theoretical basis, areas of interest/research, research methods, and publication of research. IO is seen as its own field and is described as the scientific study of working and applying the science to the workplace to address issues of relevance on the individual and organizational level, many of which use on self-report. OBM is seen as a subdiscipline of ABA thus deriving the principles from the field as opposed to IO. While the areas of interest for both fields work to improve organizations, IO psychology primary areas of interest are among worker personnel selection and placement, cognitive processes, attitudes, and leadership qualities. OBM areas of interest focus on observable behavior such as goal setting, feedback, job aids, improving safe behaviors in the workforce. Research in IO psychology primarily consist of between-group statistical designs and analyses while using surveys and laboratory simulations. OBM research primarily practices within-subject research methods and designs with visual inspection of research through graphs. Research in IO psychology is published through the Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology (SIOP) while research in OBM is published in the JOBM.

Geography Minamisōma is located in northeastern Fukushima Prefecture, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Abukuma Plateau to the west. =Neighboring municipalities= *Fukushima Prefecture  Sōma  Iitate  Namie Climate Minamisōma has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa). The average annual temperature in Minamisōma is 12.4 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1285 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 1.7 °C.Minamisōma climate data Demographics Per Japanese census data,Sōma population statistics the population of Minamisōma peaked in the 1950s. History The area of present-day Minamisōma was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. Numerous Kofun period remains have been found in the area. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Sōma Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, it was organized as part of Iwaki Province. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1896, the area was organized into a number of towns and villages within Sōma District, including the town of Hara on September 1, 1897. Hara was raised to city status on March 20, 1954, becoming the city of Haramachi. The present city of Minamisōma was established on January 1, 2006, from the merger of Haramachi with the towns of Kashima and Odaka (both from Sōma District). =2011 earthquake and tsunami= Minamisōma was partially inundated by the tsunami which resulted from the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, and suffered heavy damage. As of April 9, 2011, 400 residents were confirmed dead, with 1,100 missing. Radiation monitor showing radiation at Minamisoma: 0.532 μSv/h. This equates to an annual radiation dose of 4.66 millisieverts, compared to the government's criteria for return of 20 millisieverts per year. Minamisōma is about north of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, the site of the nuclear accident that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Much of the city lies within the 30 kilometer mandated evacuation zone near the plant, and thus most of the residents were forced to leave. Approximately a week after the earthquake Minamisōma was in the news again as the town's mayor Katsunobu Sakarai asserted that his people had been \\"abandoned\\" in the wake of orders for all remaining residents to stay in their homes inside the exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In July, beef from Minamisōma was found to be contaminated with radioactive cesium above the legal limit, according to the Daily Yomiuri. In March 2012, the city was divided into three zones: in the first, people were free to go in and out but not allowed to stay overnight; in the second, access was limited to short visits; and in the third area, all entry was forbidden because of elevated radiation levels that were not expected to go down within five years after the accident. On April 15, 2012 some of people of Minamisōma were able to return to their homes when the evacuation zone was reduced from 30 kilometers to 20 kilometers from the reactors, with the exception of a wide area on the western border of the city with the town of Namiie. At the time the evacuation order was lifted the centre of city was still scattered with ruins and lacked electricity and running water, while schools and hospitals remained closed. On July 12, 2016 the evacuation order was lifted for all areas of the city except the western border region with Namiie; this permitted all of the remaining evacuees (with the exception of one household) to return home. In August of the same year, elementary schools and junior high schools, which has been closed since 2011, were allowed to reopen. Government Minamisōma has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 24 members. Minamisōma, together with Sōma District contributes two members to the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Fukushima 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Education Minamisōma has 16 public elementary schools and six public junior high schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education.

DNAPLs tends to sink below the water table when spilled in significant quantities and only stop when they reach impermeable bedrock. Their penetration into an aquifer makes them difficult to locate and remediate. Examples of materials that are DNAPLs when spilled include: * chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride * coal tar * creosote * polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) * mercury * extra heavy crude oil, with an API gravity of less than 10 When spilled into the environment, chlorinated solvents are frequently present as DNAPL and the DNAPL can provide a long term secondary source of the chlorinated solvent to dissolved groundwater plumes. Chlorinated solvents are typically immiscible in water, having low solubility in water by definition, yet still have a solubility above the concentrations allowed by drinking water protections. Therefore, DNAPL which is a chlorinated solvent can act as an ongoing pathway for constituents to dissolve into groundwater. Common use of chlorinated solvents in manufacturing operations began during World War II, with the rate of usage for most solvents increasing into the 1970s. By the early 1980s, chemical analyses becoming available that documented widespread contamination of groundwater with chlorinated solvents.Pankow, James F., Stan Feenstra, John A. Cherry and M. Cathryn Ryan, \\"Dense Chlorinated Solvents in Groundwater: Background and History of the Problem\\" in Dense Chlorinated Solvents and Other DNAPLs in Groundwater ed.

DNAPLs that are not viscous, such as chlorinated solvents, tend to sink into aquifer materials below the water table and become much more difficult to locate and remediate than non aqueous phase liquids that are lighter than water (LNAPLs) which tend to float at the water table when spilled into natural soils. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has focused considerable attention on the remediation of DNAPL which can be costly. Removal or in situ destruction of DNAPLs eliminates the potential exposure to the compounds in the environment and can be an effective method for remediation; however, at some DNAPL sites remediation of DNAPL may not be practicable, and containment may be the only viable remedial action.USEPA, 2003. \\"The DNAPL Remediation Challenge: Is There a Case for Source Depletion?\\" EPA/600/R-03/143. http://www.clu- in.org/download/remed/600R03143.pdf The USEPA has a program to address sites where DNAPL removal is not practicable for remediation projects under CERCLA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery ActU.S. EPA, 1993. \\"Guidance for Evaluating the Technical Impracticability of Groundwater Restoration\\" Directive 9234.2-25 Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), have low solubility and are with viscosity markedly lower and density higher than water-asphalt, heavy oils, lubricants and also chlorinated solvents-penetrate the full depth of the aquifer and accumulate on its bottom. \\"DNAPL movement follows the slope of the impermeable strata underlying the aquifer and can move in the opposite direction to the groundwater gradient.\\" Groundwater remediation technologies have been developed that can address DNAPL in some settings. Excavation is not always practicable due to the depths of the DNAPL, the dispersed nature of the residual DNAPL, mobility caused during excavation, and complexities with near-by structures. Technologies that are emerging for treatment include the following * in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO)ITRC, 2000. \\"Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs): Review of Emerging Characterization and Remediation Technologies\\" http://www.itrcweb.org/Documents/DNAPLs-1.pdfRuth M Davison, Gary P Weathhall and David N Lerner, 2002.

However, when the DNAPL is a more complex mixture, the density of the mixture can change over time as the mixture interacts with the natural environment. As an example, a mixture of trichloroethene and cutting oil may be released and originally be denser than water—a DNAPL. As the mixture of trichloroethene and oil is leached by groundwater, the trichloroethene may preferentially leach out of the oil and the mixture may become less dense than water and become buoyant (e.g. the liquid may become an LNAPL). Similarly changes can be seen at some coal gasification plants or manufactured gas plants where the tar mixtures can be denser than water, be neutrally buoyant or be less dense then water and the densities can change with time.[ITRC, 2002. \\"DNAPL Source Reduction: Facing the Challenge\\" http://www.itrcweb.org/Documents/DNAPLs-2.pdf]  See also  * NAPL * LNAPLs (light non-aqueous phase liquids) - water immiscible liquids that are lighter than water.

It was the first indoor shopping mall in the West Ashley area of Charleston when the complex was fully completed in 1972. The center, located at 1401 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard (S.C. Highway 7) at the fork of Old Towne Road (S.C. Highway 171) was developed by Gate City Realty Company of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Ground was broken for the complex in 1962 with Ashley Plaza opening on April 16, 1964. At its opening the shopping center consisted of J.M. Fields Department Stores joined to a Pantry Pride supermarket, built at a cost of $1.75 million and owned by Sumar Corporation of South Carolina. The locally owned Condon's Department Store, constructed adjacent to Pantry Pride as a freestanding building, became the third tenant when it opened in 1970. The center, originally known as \\"Ashley Plaza\\" was noted for its large red and white neon pylon \\"Ashley Plaza\\" sign in the center of the parking lot that remained until 1989 when it was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo. Expansion and mall addition In April 1972 an indoor shopping mall that was created by adding on to the shopping plaza and enclosing the area between Pantry Pride and Condon's Department Store opened. The mall featured a number of local retailers as well as nationally known retailers and specialty shops and a dual screen General Cinemas (which was later expanded to three screens). A third department store, the locally owned Edward's was also added at this time. With the completion of the enclosed mall came a new name, Ashley Plaza Mall. Turbulent 1970s and 1980s The mall thrived for many years during the 1970s, but was dealt several blows beginning in the late 1970s. Perhaps the most devastating was the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of J.M. Fields and Pantry Pride leaving one entire wing of the shopping complex vacant. Locally owned Edward's, on the opposite end of the mall, was purchased by the Kuhn's-Big K Corporation who renamed the store \\"Big K-Edwards.\\" The changes were in name only as the merchandise mix was not altered with the sale. Big K was subsequently sold to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. who closed the Big K-Edwards store as it was not large enough to operate as a Wal-Mart. This left another large vacancy on the other end of the shopping center. The mall's owners worked diligently to secure replacement anchor tenants for the vacant buildings and were successful in leasing the vacant J.M. Fields building to the F.W. Woolworth Company which opened a Woolco Department Store in the building. The Pantry Pride store was leased to a local businessman who opened Jameson's Red & White Supermarket in the vacated space. The former Edward's store remained vacant for a number of years before finally being subdivided and leased to a mattress shop and an unfinished furniture store. While all appeared to be on the upswing for the newly invigorated mall, change was again in store and would deal another devastating blow to the mall. Woolco closure and Citadel Mall opening The early 1980s brought a surprising announcement when the F.W. Woolworth Company announced that it was closing all Woolco stores in the United States in 1983. The big box store would again be left vacant which made a tremendous impact on traffic at the mall. Two years before Woolco closed, the new 100-store Citadel Mall opened less than three miles (5 km) away from Ashley Plaza Mall. Many of the major national retailers pulled out of Ashley Plaza Mall and opened new locations in the much larger, more modern Citadel Mall. The mall struggled to survive as occupancy rates fell significantly. The supermarket space that formerly housed Pantry Pride and later Jameson's Red & White was leased to another locally based supermarket retailer known as The Big W Food Warehouse and ultimately closed. This space would later temporarily become a locally operated fruit and vegetable retailer for a short time. A large portion of the mall, including the space formerly occupied by Edward's, was closed in the late 1980s and vacant stores were combined and reconfigured for a Burlington Coat Factory store leaving only one small wing of the indoor mall operating with a handful of merchants. Hurricane Hugo On September 22, 1989, the mall was dealt another tremendous blow with the arrival of Hurricane Hugo which caused severe roof and water damage to many of the stores and destroyed some of the exterior facades. It would be several months before the majority of the stores could be repaired and reopened. The exterior was given a fresh new look with synthetic stucco and paint and redesigned storefronts and the remaining interior mall wing was updated with lighter floors and decor. The mall was renamed Ashley Landing (complete with new signage) to honor its close proximity to the nearby Charles Towne Landing state historic site, and \\"mall\\" was officially dropped from the name. The remaining indoor mall wing was closed within a short period of time and the individual store spaces combined and converted into space for another discount retailer, 50-Off Stores, which also ultimately closed, thus ending the mall's classification as a true indoor mall. Conversion to a strip shopping center With the mall's two concourses now combined to make space for big box retailers, the shopping center returned to its original roots as a strip shopping center. The former Woolco space had been subdivided into two smaller spaces and a portion was leased to Brendle's Catalog Showroom and the remaining space to a regionally owned clothing store, United Clothing Company. The clothing store closed within a year of opening although Brendle's, which had opened in the late 1980s, was rebuilt after Hurricane Hugo and reopened a newly designed store. The store remained at Ashley Landing until the company's subsequent bankruptcy in the mid-1990s. Discount retailer Big Lots leased the former grocery store space and remains there today. Upon Brendle's departure, the subdivided space that originally housed J.M. Fields and later Woolco was once again converted back into a single building and leased in 1997 to Carolina Pottery, a large regionally based importer of pottery, housewares and china. Carolina Pottery remained at the center until 2001 when they suddenly broke their lease and departed resulting in a lawsuit filed by the center's owner, Ashley Plaza Mall Associates. The Carolina Pottery space was once again subdivided - this time into 3 separate buildings, with portions being leased to Dollar Tree and Pivotal Fitness, with a remaining space leased to NAPA Auto Parts. Another dispute emerged between original anchor, Condon's Department Stores, and Ashley Plaza Mall Associates over the center's construction of a new Publix Super Market addition that left large piles of dirt in the parking area, which Condon's claimed blocked customer access to their store and created a dangerous situation for customers. The dispute ultimately led to the Condon's store closing after their lease was not renewed. Ashley Landing today The center still suffered from an identity crisis in 2000 when the City of Charleston, in conjunction with the adjoining residential neighborhoods conducted a design charrette for the Ashley Landing site and recommended a number of improvements to the shopping center's owners for revitalization. The city proposed an extensive overhaul of the property in an attempt to make it a neighborhood gathering place, complete with redesigned buildings that would include retail, offices and residences. Design elements such as new store facades, extensive landscaping and brick pedestrian crosswalks were proposed. Representatives from The Cordish Company indicated that they were interested in the city's plans but could not commit to any revitalization efforts due to existing store leases. It was announced on February 5, 2014 that Faison Enterprises Inc. of Charlotte, NC acquired Ashley Landing for $19.2 million. Faison is currently undertaking an extensive renovation, revitalization and expansion of the property and adding new tenants that are better suited to the area. While initial and substantial improvements are underway, Faison has indicated that this is a long-term redevelopment project. In conjunction with the redevelopment plans, Faison also acquired the adjacent vacant former Piggly Wiggly building and adjoining property located on Sumar Street, which was later sold to the City of Charleston. Faison Enterprises spun off a majority of its retail holdings in 2017, including Ashley Landing, to a newly formed sister company, Wintergreen Capital.

The task of these squadrons, which had only been formed three months previously, was to clear exits through the defences at the top of the beach so that the largely Canadian forces landed there could breakout into the country beyond. One exit \\"N7\\" was opened as planned but one troop of AVRE armoured vehicles was landed some distance away from their intended position, and this, combined with a very high-tide, delayed the opening of exit \\"N6\\". Simpson managed to reorganise his available forces to open this exit, and some additional ones which were not in the original plans.

The mystery thriller is a fictionalized account of gungnyeo, court maids during South Korea's Joseon era. This is Kim Mee-jung's first feature film. She previously worked as part of the directing staff in King and the Clown (2005) and Shadows in the Palace was filmed on the same set. Plot The film is set amongst a group of gungnyeo, or palace women in Korea during the time of the Joseon dynasty, and is primarily about the hidden dynamics that unfold between them. Sworn into secrecy, submission, and celibacy, the women of the palace officially devote their lives to the well-being of the royal family. Currently, the kingdom has no heir to the throne, and at such a time, the royal concubine Hee-bin (Yoon Se-ah) has given birth to a son. The queen mother wishes for the queen to adopt the child as her own, but Hee-bin hesitates proceeding with this, fearing she will be disposed of once the adoption is official. One morning, as the court maids go about their work, one of them, Wol-ryung (Seo Young-hee), also Hee-bin's most trusted maid, is found dead, hanging from the rafters of the palace roof. Initially assuming it to be suicide, Chun-ryung (Park Jin- hee), the royal medic, discovers as she proceeds with the autopsy that Wol- ryung was actually strangled. She also discovers that there are signs that the maid had given birth at some time in the past, which would have been absolutely forbidden under palace rules. Ignoring orders from her superiors to wrap up the case quickly, Chun-ryung sets off in search of answers. Amidst a tangled web involving suspicion of Wol-ryung's involvement in an affair with a teacher at the nearby school, the torture of a mute court maid, a beheading, and finally the records of the king's nightly visits to his concubine, an elaborate scheme spearheaded by Hee-bin's advisor transpires, where Wol-ryung was chosen to bear the crown prince, and later murdered to hide the truth of the baby's origin. When exposed, the advisor imprisons Chun-ryung, overpowers Hee-bin and makes off with the baby. She is however intercepted in the forest by the ghost of Wol-ryung, and is murdered. The ghost later also visits the royal palace, and kills the queen mother, thus removing the last obstacle between the crown prince and the throne. The baby is later discovered in the forest by Chun-ryung. The next day, as the palace women mourn the death of the queen mother in white robes, they simultaneously also witness the coronation of the new prince in the arms of Hee-bin and the transfer of power to new hands.

Battle A small Polish–Lithuanian force of about 5,000 under Great Lithuanian Hetman Janusz Radziwiłł stopped the Russian force under knyaz Yakov Cherkassky at Shklow and camped at Hołowczyn. He learned that a Russian force under knyaz Aleksey Trubetskoy crossed Drut River near Ciecierzyn on 23 August.

After the demerging of Weingarten the district is made up out of the boroughs 611 Haslach-Egerten, 612 Haslach- Gartenstadt, 613 Haslach-Schildacker and 614 Haslach-Haid.  Geography  In the North Haslach is bordered by the Dreisam opposite the neighbouring district Stühlinger, in the east by the Rheintal-railway (Karlsruhe-Basel) opposite the district Wiehre. Westward it is bordered by freight train railway and Opfingerstraße opposite Weingarten as well as by Besançonallee. In the South the district borders at Sankt Georgen through Guildfordallee and Wiesentalstraße. Etymology The name “Haslach” comes from the Old German words “Hasala” meaning hazel bush and “Aha” meaning stream. However, hazel bushes have nowadays become rare at the village creek.  History  Haslach was first mentioned in a document in the year 786. The document, a deed of donation, transferred ownership of some land from Heimo and his daughter Svanahilt to the Abbey of Saint Gall, including Haslach (then called Haslaha). Because there are no earlier mentions in records there is no way of telling how old Haslach really is, but it is clear that it was established sometime before 786. In 1120 the city of Freiburg was established close by. This influenced the development of Haslach a lot. Especially the market in Freiburg advanced the economic situation of Haslach. The parish of Haslach was first mentioned in records in 1261. Today’s parish church St. Michael was built in 1909 and was extended several times. During the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) Haslach was destroyed completely in 1633. The extension of Haslach consisting of residential subdivisions for workers began under the Lord Mayor of Freiburg Otto Winterer (term in office from 1888–1913) after the annexation of Haslach in 1890. During that time the garden city of Haslach which was inspired by the Garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard came into existence. This neighbourhood with its terraced houses and the appendant large gardens which were intended for the self-sufficiency of the inhabitants nowadays has a landmark status. This development influences Haslach up to the present day. Since the 1960s, Haslach has developed into a residential area, a development that started in the 1960s. Today Haslach has several schools, a swimming centre, Kindergarten, several shops and other amenities. Haslach is also served by busses and trams. The Haslacher Dorfbrunnen (Haslach’s village well) was donated by the city of Freiburg in 1892 as a reminder of the annexation of Haslach. The well has three sides because at that point three roads from Freiburg, St. Georgen and Opfingen met. On the well column there is the crest of Haslach as well as an eagle. Below the basin there are three inscriptions: * “Vereinigung Haslach mit Freiburg 1890” (Annexation of Haslach to Freiburg 1890) * “Errichtung des Brunnens 1892” (Construction of the Well 1892) * “Zuführung der Wasserleitung 1894” (Construction of the water supply line 1894) The cobbled area around the well was originally in the shape of a triangle, but was rounded to the side of Gutleutstraße in 1908 due to the increasing traffic. In 1969 the well was moved to its present position at the crossing of Carl-Kistner-Straße and Uffhauserstraße because it stood in the way of the broadening of Carl-Kistner-Straße and Markgrafenstraße. file:Carl- Kistner-Straße Freiburg-Haslach.JPGCarl-Kistner-Straße: The center of Haslach file:Dorfbach in Freiburg-Haslach.JPGAm Dorfbach file:Freiburg Haslach Brunnen 2542 3.jpgThe village fountain, founded after the connection Haslach to the water network of Freiburg  External links  * Jubiläum 100 Jahre Gartenstadt - Jubilee 100 years Garden City Category:Geography of Freiburg im Breisgau ","title":"Haslach (Freiburg)"},{"id":"14872194","text":"The year 1523 in science and technology included many events, some of which are listed here.

It takes its name from the Embarras River. 'Embarrass' is French for 'barrier', probably in reference to the piles of driftwood that often clog the shallow, winding river. History Embarras was founded in 1913 by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) when that company built the Alberta Coal Branch line south from Edson on the Edmonton-Prince Rupert mainline. The Coal Branch line was constructed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company (GTPRBL) from the mainline at Bickerdike south to Coalspur and Lovett. Coal mines were opened by GTP subsidiaries at Mercoal, Cadomin and Mountain Park. Embarras, along with other sidings on the Coal Branch Line such as McLeod River, Erith, Weald, and Oke were all ghost towns by the 1960s with the decline in coal mining as railways converted to diesel locomotives. The Embarras siding housed a GTP type \\"E\\" station house on the north side of the tracks that was common on the Coal Branch Line. The station house was removed in 1968 and the railbed regraded, removing all traces of the station. Prest Creek flows into the Embarras River near the station. E. B. Johnson and Son operated a sawmill on the site between 1940 and 1963. Remnants of several buildings can still be found on site today. There are no permanent residents but the site is still popular with users who can access the multitude of recreational activities in the area.

It is located in the western part of the city and borders the nature reserve Freiburger Rieselfeld in the west, right next to a little zoo called Tiergehege Mundenhof, Opfinger Straße in the south and Besançonallee in the east. The industrial area Haid is part of the Sankt Georgen district and is located to the south of Rieselfeld, while the district Weingarten is situated to the east of Rieselfeld.  History  The word Rieselfeld means leach field in German and refers to how the area started. To ensure wastewater disposal for the city, which had grown to a population number of over 50,000 inhabitants, Freiburg acquired an area spanning 500 hectares from the University of Freiburg in 1891. After Nazism had ended, Sinti, among them some who had survived the Holocaust, settled in the area of Haid, an district adjacent to today's Rieselfeld. The Opfinger Siedlung, home of alleged outlaws and criminals, was also very close by.Peter Widmann: Auszug aus den Baracken. Der Aufstieg der Sozialpädagogik und die deutsche Kommunalpolitik gegenüber „Zigeunern“ seit 1945. In: Michael Zimmermann (Hrsg.): Zwischen Erziehung und Vernichtung. Zigeunerpolitik und Zigeunerforschung im Europa des 20. Jahrhunderts. Stuttgart 2007, S. 36. Living in these areas, which were not yet situated in the city, meant societal exclusion for the inhabitants. In 1985, the sewage plant had to be shut down due to insufficient capacity to deal with wastewater. The amount of wastewater had increased to 90,00 m³ per day and the disposal could not be handled without preparing the soil of the area beforehand, which caused additional legal problems. The Rieselfeld district was established in 1992 when a competition to design city districts was initiated. The group \\"Süd-West\\" from Lörrach won the competition together with the architectural firm Böwer Eith Murken Spiecker, the architect Manfred Morlock and the landscaper Bernd Meier. The overall management was assigned to Hans Rudolf Güdemann.deutscherwerkbund- nw.de After several soil analyses and the subsequent soil stripping, all requirements were fulfilled to build on the former wastewater disposal area. In 1993, work started in the first segment. In 1994, the first apartments were being built and only two years later, the first apartments were finished and given over to the new inhabitants. The next year, the Clara-Grunwald primary school was opened and the Kepler Gymnasium, which already existed at this point, was moved into the newly built complex. Additionally, the Sepp-Glaser gym was dedicated and the initial work for the second and third segments of project “Rieselfeld” were started. To ensure public transportation to Freiburg's city centre, tram line 5 was also installed in 1997. In 2000, work for the fourth and last segment of “Rieselfeld” was started. One year later, a park was added as well as a church and a community centre. In July 2006, work to expand the Kepler Gymnasium was started.  Funding  Rieselfeld (October 2007) Since the site was owned by the city funding for planning and development costs was raised through the sale of the site itself. The initial costs currently amount to 145 million euros, of which 85 million were offset by the sale of the site. The Rieselfeld Project was coordinated by the building department, specifically the newly founded group called “Projektgruppe Rieselfeld”. The development of the site was undertaken by commercial building contractors as well as private property developers, that is to say a collaborative association. In order to prevent an area of homogenous buildings, each investor was only allowed to build 40 housing units in one area, which equals three building plots.  Architecture  Maria- Magdalena-Kirche Almost all the apartments in Rieselfeld are arranged in rows of houses along the street with green spaces and gardens in between and in back. Urban style buildings, with no space in between, were, however, built along the Rieselfeldallee which functioned as a principal axis for the area and accommodated the tram line. In order to ensure a heterogenous social structure, rental and owner-occupied apartments as well as single family homes and blocks of flats were not separated from each other. With regards to environmental sustainability the entire development is constructed to be energy saving, mostly using renewable power sources. In addition, the district is both entirely wheelchair and buggy friendly. The Maria-Magdalena Church is a compact concrete building designed by Susanne Gross, an architect from Cologne. The fact that it is a church is not immediately obvious, especially as it is missing a tower. It is located in the centre of Rieselfeld and is, somewhat unusually, home to both a Catholic and Lutheran Church which are both named after Mary Magdalene. The two Churches are separated by a large foyer with a side wall which can be moved to make a large joint room out of the two sacred spaces.  Demography  Kepler-Gymnasium (a High School in Rieselfeld) The demographic of Rieselfeld is characterised by two striking factors: * Of the 6000 residents living in the district midway through 2004, 75% were from the city of Freiburg or from nearby areas. * Around one third of the residents are under 18. With regards to the second point, three schools - a primary school, a secondary school (which was relocated there from the city centre) and the third Waldorf School in Freiburg - as well as several nurseries have been built.  Job market  Among other things, the district was designed to enable residents to find a job in Rieselfeld or in the immediate vicinity (e.g. the industrial area Haid). After construction in the district was completed in 2013, around 1,000 new jobs in kindergartens, schools, restaurants and doctor's surgeries have since been created.  Traffic regulations  All streets in the district have a speed limit of 30 kmh (approximately 18,6 mph) in order to keep individual traffic low and make the district quiet and family-friendly. The tram line 5, leading through the main street of the district, has connected Rieselfeld with the city centre since 1997 and enables people to reach it within 15 to 20 minutes by getting on the tram at one of the three stops Maria-von-Rudloff-PLatz, Geschwister-Scholl- Platz and Bollerstaudenstraße. Rieselfeld is also served by several bus lines.  Parks  A small park was built right next to the secondary school Kepler- Gymnasium in the north of Rieselfeld, including a lawn for sunbathing and a playground for children. The primary school Clara-Grundwald-Grundschule is opposite the Kepler-Gymnasium. The green roof of the primary school's gym is accessible and connects the park with the Maria-von-Rudloff-Patz. There is also a sports field north of Mundenhofer Straße. The second park is located in the southwest of the district. It is a wetland biotope that is watered only with rainwater from the surrounding rooftops. Wild carrot (Queen Anne's lace) is the host plant for the caterpillars of the Old World swallowtail and grows at the border of the park. The nature reserve Freiburger Rieselfeld borders the district to the west and functions as a local recreation area for its residents.

Section 121 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (P.L. 109-248) is named the \\"Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Notification Program\\" after her and another victim. Massachusetts' Sexually Dangerous Persons Law is informally called the \\"Ally Zapp\\" Law.  The murder  Zapp was on her way home to Newport, Rhode Island from a charity event in Boston when she stopped at the rest area on Massachusetts Route 24 in Bridgewater around midnight. Burger King employee and repeat sex offender Paul Leahy, 40, watched and waited as Ally entered the women's bathroom. According to police reports and a later confession by the killer, when Ally opened the door to leave the restroom, Paul Leahy stood in the doorway with a knife in his right hand and shoved Ally back inside the women's room. Ally pleaded with Leahy, and then fought for her life as he repeatedly stabbed her. In the nearby men's room, off-duty state police lieutenant Stephen O'Reilly heard Ally's last muffled scream. As he approached the women's room door, he saw red puddles. With his gun drawn, he stepped inside to find Paul Leahy standing next to the sink covered in blood.Gretchen Voss. The Last Exit , Boston Magazine, October 2002.  Trial  Leahy was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and armed assault with intent to rob. Prosecutor Frank Middleton said the evidence was overwhelming, thanks mostly to the testimony of Lt. Stephen O'Reilly, the trooper who caught Leahy in the act of cleaning up after the murder. Also key to the prosecution's case was a statement Leahy made to police, in which he confessed that he intentionally stabbed the young woman. After initially conceding that he had only stabbed Zapp twice in the arm, he admitted to stabbing her in the chest when he was confronted with autopsy results. Leahy's criminal history dates back to 1981, with a history of sexual offenses beginning in 1984. Some of his victims were as young as 13 years old. With a mountain of evidence facing his client, defense lawyer Frank Spillane did not make a case to get his client acquitted of all charges, but instead concentrated his efforts on proving Zapp's death was not an intentional act of murder. Spillane argued that his client's actions were in response to the circumstances confronting him. He said that his client did not plan, plot or lie in wait for Alexandra Zapp. When Leahy was waiting for Zapp to come out of the restroom, Spillane said, he was deciding whether or not to rob her. Spillane said his client did not intend to hurt Zapp, and that the battle in the bathroom erupted spontaneously. He alleged the defendant was simply reacting to a situation that had spiraled out of control.Court TV. Mass v. Paul Leahy: Rest Stop Murder: Background .

On March 20, 1973, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Grace Church parish was founded in 1871. The current building was constructed in 1876. Grace Church has a long history of social activism. In the late 1900s, the church baptized and ordained David Pendleton Oakerhater, a Cheyenne warrior and political prisoner. Oakerhater devoted his life to serving his people and the Episcopal Church. In 1992, Oakerhater was elevated to sainthood within the Episcopal Church. Grace Church is a national shrine for Saint Oakerhater - the first Native Episcopal saint. In 2004, windows were installed in his honor and in 2005, a celebration with Saint Oakerhater's descendants was held at Grace.

In the book, Schwartz argues that eliminating consumer choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers. Schwartz's thesis Schwartz assembles his argument from a variety of fields of modern psychology that study how happiness is affected by success or failure of goal achievement. =When we choose= Schwartz compares the various choices that Americans face in their daily lives by comparing the selection of choices at a supermarket to the variety of classes at an Ivy League college. Schwartz maintains that it is precisely so that we can focus on our own wants that all of these choices emerged in the first place. =How we choose= Schwartz describes that a consumer's strategy for most good decisions will involve these steps: # Figure out your goal or goals. The process of goal-setting and decision making begins with the question: \\"What do I want?\\" When faced with the choice to pick a restaurant, a CD, or a movie, one makes their choice based upon how one would expect the experience to make them feel, expected utility. Once they have experienced that particular restaurant, CD or movie, their choice will be based upon a remembered utility. To say that you know what you want, therefore, means that these utilities align. Nobel Prize- winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues have shown that what we remember about the pleasurable quality of our past experiences is almost entirely determined by two things: how the experiences felt when they were at their peak (best or worst), and how they felt when they ended. # Evaluate the importance of each goal. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have researched how people make decisions and found a variety of rules of thumb that often lead us astray. Most people give substantial weight to anecdotal evidence, perhaps so much so that it cancels out expert evidence. The researchers called it the availability heuristic describing how we assume that the more available some piece of information is to memory, the more frequently we must have encountered it in the past. Salience will influence the weight we give any particular piece of information. # Array the options. Kahneman and Tversky found that personal \\"psychological accounts\\" will produce the effect of framing the choice and determining what options are considered as subjects to factor. For example, an evening at a concert could be just one entry in a much larger account, of say a \\"meeting a potential mate\\" account. Or it could be part of a more general account such as \\"ways to spend a Friday night\\". Just how much an evening at a concert is worth will depend on which account it is a part of. # Evaluate how likely each of the options is to meet your goals. People often talk about how \\"creative accountants can make a corporate balance sheet look as good or bad as they want it to look.\\" In many ways Schwartz views most people as creative accountants when it comes to keeping their own psychological balance sheet. # Pick the winning option. Schwartz argues that options are already attached to choices being considered. When the options are not already attached, they are not part of the endowment and choosing them is perceived as a gain. Economist Richard Thaler provides a helpful term sunk costs. # Modify goals. Schwartz points out that later, one uses the consequences of their choice to modify their goals, the importance assigned to them, and the way future possibilities are evaluated. Schwartz relates the ideas of psychologist Herbert A. Simon from the 1950s to the psychological stress that most consumers face today. He notes some important distinctions between, what Simon termed, maximizers and satisficers. A maximizer is like a perfectionist, someone who needs to be assured that their every purchase or decision was the best that could be made. The way a maximizer knows for certain is to consider all the alternatives they can imagine. This creates a psychologically daunting task, which can become even more daunting as the number of options increases. The alternative to maximizing is to be a satisficer. A satisficer has criteria and standards, but a satisficer is not worried about the possibility that there might be something better. Ultimately, Schwartz agrees with Simon's conclusion, that satisficing is, in fact, the maximizing strategy. =Why we suffer= Schwartz integrates various psychological models for happiness showing how the problem of choice can be addressed by different strategies. What is important to note is that each of these strategies comes with its own bundle of psychological complication. * Choice and happiness. Schwartz discusses the significance of common research methods that utilize a happiness scale. He sides with the opinion of psychologists David Myers and Robert Lane, who independently conclude that the current abundance of choice often leads to depression and feelings of loneliness. Schwartz draws particular attention to Lane's assertion that Americans are paying for increased affluence and freedom with a substantial decrease in the quality and quantity of community. What was once given by family, neighborhood and workplace now must be achieved and actively cultivated on an individual basis. The social fabric is no longer a birthright but has become a series of deliberated and demanding choices. Schwartz also discusses happiness with specific products. For example, he cites a study by Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University and Mark Lepper of Stanford University who found that when participants were faced with a smaller rather than larger array of jam, they were actually more satisfied with their tasting. * Freedom or commitment. Schwartz connects this issue to economist Albert Hirschman's research into how populations respond to unhappiness: they can exit the situation, or they can protest and voice their concerns. While free-market governments give citizens the right to express their displeasure by exit, as in switching brands, Schwartz maintains that social relations are different. Instead, we usually give voice to displeasure, hoping to project influence on the situation. * Second-order decisions. Law professor Cass Sunstein uses the term \\"second-order decisions\\" for decisions that follow a rule. Having the discipline to live \\"by the rules\\" eliminates countless troublesome choices in one's daily life. Schwartz shows that these second-order decisions can be divided into general categories of effectiveness for different situations: presumptions, standards, and cultural codes. Each of these methods are useful ways people use to parse the vast array of choices they confront. * Missed opportunities. Schwartz finds that when people are faced with having to choose one option out of many desirable choices, they will begin to consider hypothetical trade-offs. Their options are evaluated in terms of missed opportunities instead of the opportunity's potential. In other words, after choosing an alternative with a plurality but not a majority of utility, people remember the sum of the lost utility rather than that they made the utility- maximizing choice. Schwartz maintains that one of the downsides of making trade-offs is it alters how we feel about the decisions we face; afterwards, it affects the level of satisfaction we experience from our decision. While psychologists have known for years about the harmful effects of negative emotion on decision making, Schwartz points to recent evidence showing how positive emotion has the opposite effect: in general, subjects are inclined to consider more possibilities when they are feeling happy. =Criticism= Attempts to duplicate the paradox of choice in other studies have had mixed success. A meta-analysis incorporating research from 50 independent studies found no meaningful connection between choice and anxiety, but speculated that the variance in the studies left open the possibility that choice overload could be tied to certain highly specific and as yet poorly understood pre- conditions. A new meta-analysis, conducted in 2015 and incorporating 99 studies, was able to isolate when reducing choices for your customers is most likely to boost sales. The study identified four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. It also documented that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is significant—a finding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.

The war began as part of a succession crisis in the Fatimid Caliphate, which began to crumble under the pressure of Muslim Syria and the Christian Crusader states. While one side called for help from the emir of Syria, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the other called for Crusader assistance. As the war progressed, however, it became a war of conquest. A number of Syrian campaigns into Egypt were stopped short of total victory by the aggressive campaigning of Amalric I of Jerusalem. Even so, the Crusaders generally speaking did not have things go their way, despite several sackings. A combined Byzantine-Crusader siege of Damietta failed in 1169, the same year that Saladin took power in Egypt as vizier. In 1171 Saladin became sultan of Egypt and the crusaders thereafter turned their attention to the defence of their kingdom, which, despite being surrounded by Syria and Egypt, held for another 16 years. Later crusades tried to support the Kingdom of Jerusalem by targeting the danger that was Egypt, but to no avail.  Background  Following the capture of Jerusalem by the forces of the First Crusade, the Fatimids of Egypt launched regular raids into Palestine against the Crusaders, while Zengi of Syria launched a series of successful attacks against the Principality of Antioch. The Second Crusade aimed to reverse the gains of Zengi, ironically with an assault on Damascus, Zengi's most powerful rival. The siege failed and forced the Kingdom to turn south for better fortunes. The Fatimid Caliphate in the 12th century was riddled with internal squabbles. In the 1160s, power lay not in the hands of the Fatimid caliph Al-'Āḍid, but in the hands of the vizier of Egypt, Shawar. The situation in Egypt made it ripe for conquest, either by crusaders or by the forces of Zengi's successor, Nur ad-Din. The first Crusader invasion of Egypt culminated in the siege of Ascalon, resulting in the capture of the city in 1154. This meant that the kingdom was now at war in two fronts, but Egypt now had an enemy supply base close at hand.  Intervention of Nur ad-Din, 1163–1164  In 1163, Shawar, the ousted Fatimid vizier, called Nur ad-Din for support in reinstating him to his former position as the de facto ruler of Egypt against the new vizier, Dirgham. Nur ad-Din agreed to support his cause—an alliance between Syria and Egypt would ensure the demise of the Crusaders. Little did Nur ad-Din realize that, while his plan would succeed, it would not be he who would enjoy such unity. On May 1164 Shawar became vizier of Egypt. He was, however, a mere figurehead to Nur ad-Din, who had installed his general Shirkuh as ruler of Egypt. Shawar became unsatisfied with this and called upon the enemy of the Sunni Muslims, King Amalric I of Jerusalem. = Amalric invades; Second Crusader invasion, 1164 = thumb Amalric had his own designs on Egypt. Therefore, when Shawar invited him into Egypt, he could not turn down such an offer. At Bilbeis, Amalric together with Shawar his Shi'ite ally, besieged Shirkuh. However, Nur ad-Din moved his forces against the Crusader state of Antioch and despite being a Byzantine protectorate (Manuel was in the Balkans) defeated and captured Bohemond III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli at the Battle of Harim. Amalric immediately raced north to rescue his vassal. Even so, Shirkuh evacuated Egypt too so it was a victory for Shawar who retained Egypt.  Shirkuh returns and third Crusader invasion, 1166–1167  thumb Shawar's rule in Egypt did not last long before Shirkuh returned in 1166 to take back Egypt. Shawar played his crusader card again and this time Amalric believed an open battle would be able to settle the scores. Unlike Shirkuh, Amalric had naval supremacy in the Mediterranean (though to be fair there were few Syrian ports to the Mediterranean under Nur ad-Din) and took a quick coastal route to Egypt, allowing him to link up with his ally Shawar just as Nur ad-Din's deputy Shirkuh arrived. At Cairo, the combined Fatimid-crusader army contemplated the next move while Shirkuh, outside the pyramids of Giza made an unexpected move for the south. The Fatimid-crusader army followed to the Battle of al-Babein, where fighting was bloody but inconclusive. Even so, the crusader-Fatimids pursued the Syrians, whose plan to use Alexandria as a port came to nothing when the crusader fleet arrived. At Alexandria, the besieged Shirkuh agreed to leave Egypt alone in return for a crusader withdrawal. Amalric left with a favorable treaty resulting in Egyptian tribute to Jerusalem and a friendly Shawar in control. = Fourth Crusader invasion, 1168–1169 = thumb At this point in time the crusaders should have focused on strengthening their position against Syria, but instead Amalric was tempted by Gilbert of Assailly, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, to attack Egypt and take it. Manuel Komnenos received the idea well. The alliance was still being finalized when Amalric launched a quick attack against Bilbeis in 1168, massacring the population. Shawar appealed to Damascus and Shirkuh returned. When faced with an imminent attack by Amalric, Shawar ordered the burning of his own capital city, Fustat. Shirkuh then fought off Amalric, killed the untrustworthy Shawar, and seized power. Shirkuh himself died two months later and his nephew, Saladin, took power as regent. At Damietta, the Byzantine- Crusader alliance materialized into a siege of the port. The crusaders attacked late, while the Byzantines abandoned the siege after three months. In 1171, after the death of Caliph Al-Adid, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan while the crusaders under Amalric were forced to retreat, having lost many men due to disease and warfare. The Knights Hospitaller became bankrupt after the operation but made a quick recovery financially. The same could not be said for the kingdom.  Aftermath  The Kingdom of Jerusalem, surrounded by enemies, now faced inevitable defeat. Saladin could raise armies potentially numbering 100,000 or more with Syria and Egypt under his control. Nur ad-Din however was still alive until 1174 and Saladin's power in Egypt was seen as a rebellion against his vassalage to Nur ad-Din. After the latter's death Syria and Egypt remained united. A few crusader victories, notably at Montgisard and a failed Ayyubid siege of Tiberias allowed the crusaders to stave off defeat until 1187. By 1189 the crusader realm had been diminished beyond all strength and relied increasingly on politically motivated and inexperienced western reinforcements. However, after the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the focus of the crusaders shifted decisively towards Egypt and less so towards the Levant. This can be seen in the Third Crusade, where Richard the Lionheart recognized the importance of Egypt and twice suggested an invasion of the region. An assault against the Levant could not succeed without the resources and manpower of Egypt, which currently gave the Islamic powers in the region a decisive advantage. The Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Alexandrian crusades all had Egypt as the intended target. During the Fifth Crusade (1218–1221) a large force of crusaders led by the papal legate Pelagio Galvani and John of Brienne took Damietta. The expeditionary force included French, German, Flemish and Austrian crusaders and a Frisian fleet. The army marched on Cairo but was cut off by flooding of the Nile and the campaign ended in disaster with Pelagio forced to surrender with what remained of his army. During the Seventh Crusade King Louis IX of France invaded Egypt (1249–1250) and after occupying Damietta he marched towards Cairo. However the forces led by Robert I, Count of Artois were defeated at the Battle of Al Mansurah and then King Louis and his main army were defeated at the Battle of Fariskur where his entire army was either killed or captured. The king suffered the humiliation of having to pay an enormous ransom for his freedom. The temporary victories were followed by defeats, evacuations or negotiations—ultimately amounting to nothing. By 1291, Acre, the last major crusader fortress in the Holy Land, fell to the forces of the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, and any remaining territories on the mainland were lost over the next decade.

This book detailed how, over several decades, Israel had served U.S. interests both through espionage operations in the former Soviet Union, as well as covert operations in Central America and other third world regions where the U.S. was loath to intervene directly. The book also detailed Israeli nuclear activities, including U.S, assistance to its bomb-making program and Israeli cooperation with the South African apartheid regime's nuclear weapons program.

It is the second part of Kalashnikov's historical, geopolitical and economical series of novels (the sequel to The Broken Sword of the Empire). The Battle for Skies is essentially the big missing part of The Broken Sword of the Empire—what the author meant to write about the Cold War but didn't include into the first book. A few changes can yet be seen. Kalashnikov was deeply touched by the Yugoslavian crisis (Operation Allied Force) in 1999. As a result, he wrote the introduction of the second book by exposing his thoughts about this war. Notably, the author draw a distinct parallel between the events in Yugoslavia and the state of affairs in Russia. Kalashnikov was convinced that it was only an exercise for the \\"Westerners\\" (NATO country-members), and that the same destiny would await Russia in the close future.The Battle for Skies Structure The Battle for Skies is larger than its predecessor. It is divided into four parts : *\\"Part I: World War IV-the wolf hour\\". It is essentially a large introduction, which explains the important points of what the author calls \\"the Fourth World War\\" (1999-....), using an argumentation structured as a discussion between Maxim Kalashnikov and the Russian economist Mikhail Delyagin. According to the author, NATO had started World War IV with the Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. Like the Cold War, it is based on local conflicts (e.g., Iraq), but it also includes a full scale financial and media global war. *\\"Part II: The glory of our fathers\\".

However, Two Tribes continues development of the Nintendo Switch version of Rive, as well as supporting older games. History Two Tribes originally specialized in portable games and later developed games for consoles due to the popularity of the Wii and Xbox 360. Two Tribes has focused on developing games for Windows and Macintosh, including online distribution. The company started by porting its franchises, Toki Tori and RUSH, to Windows and Mac OS through Steam and the Mac App Store. The company has started to work with other developers to port their games to other platforms, such as Swords & Soldiers, by Ronimo Games to iOS and Edge by Mobigame to Windows and Macintosh. Two Tribes has worked with major video game companies including Capcom, Nokia, Team17, and THQ. In January 2014, Two Tribes B.V. filed for bankruptcy, mainly due to disappointing sales of Toki Tori 2. However, Two Tribes Publishing B.V., which owns and publishes all Two Tribes B.V. games and handles all contracts, remained unaffected. A new daughter company was formed to handle the development of future titles. One working title was RE:Wind, later announced as Rive.

These requirements vary widely from country to country. While some countries allow only state-appointed translators to produce such translations, others will accept those carried out by any competent bilingual individual. Between these two extremes are countries where a certified translation can be carried out by any professional translator with the correct credentials (which may include membership of specific translation associations or the holding of certain qualifications). English speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, the USA, Australia and New Zealand fall on the more relaxed end of the spectrum, and simply require certified translations to include a statement made by the translator attesting to its accuracy, along with the date, the translator's credentials and contact details. This is the type of certification that is required by UK government bodies such as the Home Office and the UK Border Agency, as well as by universities and most foreign embassies. European countries other than the UK tend to have much stricter laws regarding who can produce a certified translation, with most appointing official certified translators based on them having obtained the local state-regulated qualification. Legal requirements For legal and official purposes, evidentiary documents and other official documentation are usually required in the official language(s) of a jurisdiction. In some countries, it is a requirement for translations of such documents that a translator swear an oath to attest that it is the legal equivalent of the source text. Often, only translators of a special class are authorized to swear such oaths. In some cases, the translation is only accepted as a legal equivalent if it is accompanied by the original or a sworn or certified copy of it. Even if a translator specializes in legal translation or is a lawyer in their country, this does not necessarily make them a sworn translator. The procedure for translating to legal equivalence differs from country to country. =Argentina= In compliance with Law #20,305, all public documents (including personal papers and some commercial contracts) have to be translated and signed by a certified \\"public translator\\" (traductor público), whose seal and signature have to be legalized on each document by the relevant jurisdiction of the translator's professional body. All private persons, companies, the judiciary, and other government departments are subject to this law regarding documents or depositions in a foreign language. In order to be certified as a public translator for a major European language, candidates have to attend university courses leading to the professional degree of traductor público. =Austria= Pursuant to section 14 of the Sworn and Certified Experts, Interpreters and Translators Act #137/1995 (SDG) as amended,https://www.gerichts-sv.at/sdg.html regional courts are entitled to appoint sworn translators for translations between German and any language (including sign language), who have sworn an oath at court after having passed an official exam. To be admitted to the exam, candidates must present evidence of at least 5 years of professional experience as a translator or interpreter or of at least 2 years of professional experience if they have graduated in translation studies at a University. Although mostly referred to as \\"Gerichtsdolmetscher\\", the correct name of their status is \\"allgemein beeidete/r und gerichtlich zertifizierte/r Dolmetscher/in\\". Sworn translators are entitled to create public instruments by signing and sealing of translations attached to originals. No further notarization of their signature on translations is needed, and sworn translators can apply at court for the adding of an apostille. Police are advised to involve sworn interpreters to overcome language barriers whenever this is possible. Most public authorities in Austria accept translations of documents as legally equivalent only when sealed and signed by a sworn interpreter for the given language. The authorization will lapse if a sworn interpreter will not attend regular professional training. =Belgium= \\"Sworn Translators\\" (singular Dutch: beëdigd vertaler, French: traducteur assermenté) or \\"Sworn Interpreter\\" (singular Dutch: beëdigd tolk, French: interprète assermenté) swear an oath before the President of the tribunal of the first instance of the judicial district in which they have their place of residence. In the past translators and interpreters in all judicial districts aspiring to \\"sworn\\" status were screened for suitability by the Crown Prosecutor. The candidate has to state the language combinations for he or she wishes to be sworn. A diploma of translator/interpreter is usually regarded as adequate proof of competence. There is no limitation on the language combinations which can be recognized. However, following a scandal involving an illegal immigrant who obtained sworn translator status, The president of the tribunal of the first instance at Antwerp, launched an experimental scheme whereby aspiring sworn translators and interpreters have to undergo training organized by the Ministry of Justice and submit to examination. The same President, based on his interpretation of the language laws, also ruled that the only language combinations that could be recognized for a sworn translator/interpreter status were those in which Dutch was either the original language or the target language. This view has not yet been adopted by other judicial districts in Belgium. =Brazil= Official documents can only be translated by Public Sworn Translators and Interpreters, who are certified and accredited by the registry of commerce of each state. The applicants must pass highly demanding oral and written examinations for specific language pairs. They undergo background checks before receiving a registration number, which must be informed in the heading of every translation. Ad hoc (temporary) translators can also be appointed by the Registry of Commerce to do a single translation job when there is no Public Translator registered for that specific language pair. The registry of commerce of each state also sets the translation fees. Although the public sworn translator/interpreter must reside in the state of registration, his translations are valid in the entire country. Institutions and government agencies in cities and states different from those of residence of the public sworn translator may require the notarial verification of the translator's signature. Foreign documents must be verified by a Brazilian consulate or embassy in the country they were issued before translation. Official documents translated into a foreign language need to have the public sworn translator's signature verified by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs if the institution or government agency of the foreign country so requires. = Canada = Official translation of documents can be produced in one of two ways. Certified translations are those completed by a certified translator and accompanied by the translator's declaration, signature, and seal. The title of \\"certified translator\\" is a protected title in Canada, and only those individuals who are members in good standing of a provincial translators' association and have passed a certification exam can use this title and produce certified translations. An alternative method for producing official translations in Canada is by attaching a sworn affidavit signed by the translator in the presence of a notary public or commissioner for taking affidavits to the translation. =Germany= German regional courts (Landgerichte) have the power to appoint \\"sworn translators\\". The specific title and the appointment procedure are different in each state. In most cases, the candidates are required to pass an examination. Germany maintains an official database online at www.justiz-uebersetzer.de that lists all translators sworn-in in all federal states. =Hungary= There are five qualification types for translators and interpreters in Hungary: technical translator, technical translator-proofreader, interpreter, technical interpreter, and conference interpreter. These qualifications can be acquired in BA and MA programs, postgraduate courses, and in institutions accredited by the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice. Anyone regardless of age and qualification may apply for a qualifying examination in interpretation. Qualifications for technical translation, technical translation proofreading, technical interpretation, and conference interpretation can be obtained in the following fields: social science, natural science, technology, and economics. Anyone with a degree in one of the above fields may apply for a qualifying examination in technical translation and technical interpretation in the given field. Qualified technical interpreters and technical translators may be further qualified for conference interpretation and technical translation proofreading, respectively. The National Office for Translation and Attestation (Országos Fordító és Fordításhitelesítő Iroda, OFFI) is a company in Hungary that has the exclusive right to certify translations both from and to Hungarian created by the office itself or a third party, and to make certified copies of documents written in a foreign language. Interpretation in courts of Budapest is provided by OFFI. If the Office cannot provide an interpreter, and for courts outside Budapest, an interpreter registered by the local authorities will be appointed. If no official interpreter is available, a suitable person with a good command of the required language will be appointed. =India= There are less documentation and sources known. A sworn-in Interpreter or Translator as per Maharashtra Courts Civil Law Chapter 26 of OATHS AND AFFIDAVITS prescribed under section 6 of the Oaths Act, 1969 (point 515) may with help of Form No.3 make an affidavit that he shall well and truly interpret pieces of evidence given by witnesses and translate correctly and accurately all documents given to him or her for translation. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, sworn translators are persons having attended and passed legal translation examinations organized by the School of Linguistics and Cultural Sciences, University of Indonesia (FIB, UI). After passing the exam, they will be sworn in by the Governor of DKI Jakarta, provided that they have a Jakarta ID card. For other regions, each has to write to their respective Governor to take an oath by their governor, thus obtain the status 'sworn'. Alternatively, the Association of Indonesian Translators or HPI also has exams for members who want to have a certification as a competent, professional translator or interpreter. Upon passing, the certification will expire in 5 years.Sertifikasi HPI, Information available in Indonesian. =Italy= Both Italian courts and consulates have the power to appoint as \\"official translators\\" (traduttori giurati or ufficiali) candidates who pass an examination or show proof of language proficiency (usually a university degree). =Mexico= There are, in Mexico, two certifications for sworn translators: the local certification granted by the Superior Court of Justice corresponding to each of the 32 states and the one of the Superior Court of Justice corresponding to the federation. Both institutions establish that a written and oral examination shall be passed for a translator to be recognized as an expert or \\"sworn\\" (certified) translator (perito traductor); this type of translator does not swear before the court to be authorized. Although the local certification is officially valid for only one of the 32 states, a translator from any of the states may work for a client from any of the states, provided that the client accepts the translator.peritos =Netherlands= The Bureau for Sworn Interpreters and Translators, a department of the Dutch Legal Aid Council that has been entrusted by the Ministry of Justice with various implementation tasks in respect of the Sworn Interpreters and Translators Act. They have two levels of accreditation however only the highest level has legal validity. =Norway= Candidates are certified by the Association of Government Authorized Translators, after they pass a very demanding examination. Successful candidates are then authorized by the Norwegian government to sign their translations, after the phrase \\"True Translation Certified.\\" The Association was founded in 1913. =Poland= The standards of translation in Poland are regulated by a relevant department of the Ministry of Justice, and every translator wishing to provide such services must pass a state examination. Afterward such a person is entered on an official list, issued with a stamp, and recognized as a sworn translator. However, for ordinary translations (business, administration, correspondence) it is enough to have an independent expert in the field. =South Africa= In South Africa, the translator must be authorized by the High Court and must use an original (or a sworn copy of an original) in his physical presence as his source text. The translator may only swear by his own translation. There is no requirement for an additional witness (such as a notary) to attest to the authenticity of the translation. =Spain= In Spain, a sworn translation is a translation by a translator appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation. To become a sworn translator in Spain for a combination of Castilian and another language, the candidate has to be certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation as a \\"sworn translator and interpreter\\" (traductor-intérprete jurado). Then, the translator is required to register their stamp and signature with the Ministry, who includes the translator's data in a public list of sworn interpreters. Sworn translators are professional translators (normally individuals who hold a degree in translation and interpretation) who have passed an exam given by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and are therefore authorized to translate from Spanish into another language and vice versa. Eligibility can be achieved either through a state exam or by completing the degree studies of Translation and Interpretation in a Spanish University, provided that the translator has passed certain law-related subjects. Sworn translators for combinations including the other three co-official languages of Spain (Basque, Catalan and Galician) are certified by regional authorities following a similar procedure as the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a rule, all documents submitted in Spain must be translated by a translator certified by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; however, in many cases, documents translated internationally and submitted to various consulates and embassies can be translated within the respective country by translators certified within the country of submission. In other words, a certified translator in the United States is able to translate documents for one of the Spanish Consulates located in the United States, but not if the documents are to be presented in Spain. =Sweden= The Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency is an official agency that authorizes interpreters and translators, who must pass a stringent examination arranged by the organization. Authorized translators hold a protected professional title, and their translations are considered legal and binding for all legal purposes. =United Kingdom= In the UK, a certified translation is simply one which comes with a statement made by the translator or translation agency guaranteeing its accuracy, along with the date, the translator's credentials, and contact details. They are often signed and stamped and should be proofread for an added guarantee of accuracy. This is the type of certification that is required by UK government bodies such as the Home Office, Passport Office, and the UK Border Agency, as well as by universities and most foreign embassies in the UK. A certified translation guarantees its accuracy and contains the name and contact number of the translator or project manager, who can vouch for that accuracy and may be contacted by the requesting organization in order to do so. =United States of America= The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics states: \\"There is currently no universal form of certification required of interpreters and translators in the United States, but there are a variety of different tests that workers can take to demonstrate proficiency.\\" Interpreters and Translators =United Arab Emirates= In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a certified translation is synonymous with legal translation. legal Translation can be only done by a Ministry of Justice of UAE licensed translator. Every translator has to qualify in the examination held by the Ministry of Justice, UAE for each language pair. A language pair consists of Arabic & a Foreign language. There are legal translators for only 9 foreign languages available in the United Arab Emirates viz. English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Farsi( also known as Persian), & Turkish. Only legal translations can be notarized, attested, & legalized from the Notary Public of UAE, Ministry of Justice of UAE, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation, UAE. All Embassies & Consulates located in the United Arab Emirates legalize only legal translations attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation, UAE. For legal translations to be legalized from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation, UAE it must be at first legalized from the Ministry of Justice of UAE or Notary Public of the UAE. The Ministry of Justice of UAE legalizes only translations made by their licensed translators.

A trusted lieutenant to Cuchillo Negro and Mangas Coloradas, in the 1850s and 1860s he was one of the best known leaders of the Chihenne (Tchiende), along with Tudeevia (Dudeevia, better known as Delgadito - \\"Little Thin\\", \\"Skinny\\"),Fort Sill Apache Tribal Leaders Ponce and Loco (\\"crazy\\", \\"mad\\"). He was a nephew of Delgadito, and married a sister of Geronimo. Description Captain John Gregory Bourke described Nana as having \\"a strong face marked with intelligence, courage and good nature, but with an under stratum of cruelty and vindictiveness\\". Charles Fletcher Lummis claimed that Nana wore gold watch chains in each ear lobe, presumably taken from dead victims.  Early Fights  He fought alongside Mangas Coloradas and his mixed Tchihende-Bedonkohe band until Mangas Coloradas was killed while in the custody of the California Column in January 1863. In Mexico he undertook many joint raids with the Nednhi of Juh and Natiza against the Mexicans. After Ponce, Cuchillo Negro and Delgadito were killed too, Victorio took over the Tchihende leadership, joined by the leaderless Bedonkohe (Taklishim, old Mahko's son, had not been able to save his father's leadership in front of his competitors Mano Mocha and Luis). Nana, although at least 20 years older than Victorio, married the latter's elder sister, cementing his position as a leader.  Victorio's War  After several failed attempts to peacefully live on a reservation in their own country, Victorio and Nana gave up trying and fought back against the Americans and Mexicans. The Bedonkohe and Chihenne were joined by more than 80 warriors of the Mescalero Apache under their old chief Caballero. Victorio and Nana therefore had about 200 warriors. During the Apache Wars and especially Victorio's War Nana raided areas of Texas and Mexico with Victorio. While Nana and a small group was away on a scouting mission, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army under Joaquin Terrazas at the Battle of Tres Castillos in October 1880. 68 women and children were captured by the Mexicans and sold as slaves in Mexico.  Nana's Raids  After Victorio's death, Nana and his followers hid in the Sierra Madre. Several prestigious leaders and warriors, such as Fun (Yiy-gholl, Yiy-joll, Yiy-zholl, also known as Larry Fun), Ka-ya-ten-nae (Ka-e-te-nay, Kadhateni or Kieta - \\"Fights Without Arrows\\", \\"Cartridges All Gone\\") took the leadership of the Tchihende, Bedonkohe, Tsokanende and Nednhi bands beside the already established Apache band leaders Nana, Loco, Mangas, Naiche, Geronimo and Juh. Nana, now almost 80 years old (according to some reports, nearly 90-years), formed his own war party with the Chihenne (Warm Springs Apache), enlisting loitering warriors in the reservations. His band joined by 15 Tsokanende, 12 Mescalero warriors and a couple of Navajo, plus women and children, began raiding Army supply trains and isolated settlers. In less than a month Nana fought seven or eight battles stretching over the course of 1,000 miles and killed 30-40 Americans, at least as many Mexicans, captured about 200 horses to replace 100 ridden to death and then fled back to Mexico. He and his small force, evaded more than 1,000 soldiers, 300-400 civilian militia volunteers and Apache and Navajo Indian Scouts.Nana's Raid — Apaches in Socorro County  Nana's Death  Nana survived the Apache Wars. Upon surrender in March 1886 he, other Apache warriors and Apache Scouts were sent as prisoners of war to Florida and Alabama. In 1894, they were relocated to Fort Sill in the Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. Nana died of natural causes in 1896.  Legacy  Nana has a special reputation among Apache war chiefs. He was still an active warrior well into his eighties. He had tenacity, stamina, courage and an uncanny ability to improvise in a fight to minimize his losses. He showed no mercy in battle, yet could be considerate when dealing with civilians. When Nana was executing guerrilla tactics in the 1880s, he was half blind, crooked from arthritis, but once he sat in the saddle, he rode \\"like the devil.\\" References Bibliography *Nana's Raid: Apache Warfare in Southern New Mexico, 1881 (Lekson, 1987) External links *Nana, Apache Chief at the Arizona Memory Project *Nana (Kas-tziden) from the Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography, via Google Books *Nana in photograph of the Council between General Crook and Geronimo from the U.S. Library of Congress *Warm Springs Apache Leader Nana: The 80-Year-Old Warrior Turned the Tables at the Weider History Group's historynet.com *Tracking Nana - Nana’s raid Category:1896 deaths Category:Chiricahua Category:Native American leaders Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Apache people Category:Native Americans imprisoned at Fort Marion ","title":"Nana (chief)"},{"id":"14872745","text":"Frederic Crosby Bartter (September 10, 1914 – May 5, 1983) was an American endocrinologist best known for his work on hormones affecting the kidney and his discovery of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone reproduced in and Bartter syndrome. Reproduced in He had a separate interest in mushroom poisoning. Early life He was born to an English Anglican minister and his American wife in Manila, Philippines, and grew up in the mountain village of Baguio. At the age of 13 he was sent, together with his brother, to attend the Lenox School until 1930. After teaching in the Philippines for a year, he enrolled at Harvard where he obtained a BA in 1935. After a year at Harvard School of Public Health he entered Harvard Medical School, graduating there in 1940. Internships took place at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City in 1941 and 1942. Army service led to academic work on blood products and onchocerciasis (river blindness, a tropical disease). Boston He became a research fellow to Fuller Albright at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1946, and joined the clinical staff in 1950. Albright influenced Bartter significantly in several ways: research was mainly conducted on patients, who were observed very closely for long periods of time, and his interests encompassed many fields. Particular interests were calcium metabolism, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, blood volume and electrolyte physiology, and the actions of sex steroids. Significant observations were made in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Bethesda From 1951 to 1978 Bartter served as Chief of the National Institutes of Health Endocrine-Hypertension Branch. Much of his work here was on aldosterone and its effects on the cardiovascular system. He collaborated with numerous researchers, including Grant Liddle (eponymised in Liddle's syndrome). Investigations in 1957 led to the recognition of SIADH, and his work on aldosterone and the kidney handling of electrolytes led to his description in 1963 of the syndrome that would later bear his name - Bartter syndrome. Texas In 1978 he moved, this time to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Here he continued his work on hypertension (high blood pressure) started at Bethesda, and his own hypertension was discovered during the research. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979, already having received honours by the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Endocrine Society, and numerous other bodies. He collapsed suddenly due to a cerebral hemorrhage at an NAS conference, and died soon afterwards. He was married to Jane Lillard and left three children, two sons and a daughter.

The word fale (pronounced fah-leh) is the Samoan word for any type of building. A similar word is used in other Polynesian languages, similar to whare in the Maori language. In Samoan architecture, these simple huts are called faleo'o in the Samoan language. They are common in villages where they provide extra storage or space for dragon boats.

Laurent made two translations of the Boccaccio work, the second considerably more free. A large percentage of surviving manuscripts are carefully written and illuminated with illustrations. Biography Laurent was born in Premierfait, a small village near Troyes. He lived at the papal court at Avignon for a while and came shoulder-to-shoulder with other humanists while being employed by the Papal Court. Laurent was well known for translating Aristotle,For Aristotle he worked from a Latin translation. Cicero, and Livy. He was also the first French translator of Giovanni Boccaccio's works.The French Translators of BoccaccioLaurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustribus He states in one of his works that he, like his interlocutor Jean de Montreuil, was a clerc du diocèse de Troyes and secretary-notary to Jean-Allarmet de Brogny, Cardinal of Saluces. Laurent worked as well for Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, Jean Chanteprime, contrôleur général des finances, and for king Charles VI. He made a living as a translator for such nobles as Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège and the great collector-connoisseur, Jean, Duke of Berry,The Rothschild MS. in the British Museum of Les Cas des Malheureux Nobles Hommes et Femmes; Laurent wrote a third prologue to Jean, duc de Berry (Gathercole 1955:15). both being relatives to Charles VI.'Jhesu Nichil Est Commune Ligurgo': A French Humanist Debate of ca. 1405 by Grover C.

He may have died of the Black Death that wiped out about half of the European population recurring repeatedly from the mid fourteenth century. There is a possibility, however, that he was murdered during the invasion of Paris by the Burgundians in 1418, a result of the Armagnac-Burgundian civil war that raged in France after John the Fearless, Duc de Bourgogne, murdered the king's brother Louis d'Orléans in 1407.Henri Hauvette, De Laurentio de Primofato (Paris, Hachette, 1903) A portrait of Laurent, considered to be an authentic representation, figures among the illuminations in the manuscript of Du cas des nobles hommes et femmes that was dedicated to the duc de Berry and has come with the former royal library to the Bibliothèque Nationale.B.N. fr. 226.

This area was selected due to its similarity to the mountainous terrain of Italy and other areas within the European Theater of Operations. History of the WVMA Army maneuvers commenced within the WVMA in August 1943 under the command of the 13th Army Corps. The local command was headquartered at Elkins and included a signal battalion, quartermaster detachment, military police unit, a special services company, engineers, ordnance and other support elements. Training activities were confined to Randolph and four adjacent counties including mostly land of the Monongahela National Forest, but also some private land. Tent cities were erected in Elkins and other local communities to house large numbers of troops; the number swelled to 16,000 by early 1944 as classes cycled though 8-week rotations. Artillery training utilized a area in the eastern portion of the WVMA, including parts of Dolly Sods (e.g., Blackbird Knob*Keating, Steve (2010), A Dolly Sods North - Blackwater Companion: A Guide to Hiking Through the History, Geology and Ecology of the Region; Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing, pg 316.) and Canaan Valley, for practice firing with 105mm and 155mm howitzers. Notices in the local newspaper warned local hunters and others to avoid this area during maneuvers. Improvised river crossings were conducted at the Blackwater and Dry Fork Rivers, among others. Both Seneca Rocks and the Blackwater Canyon were utilized for mountain climbing instruction. In July 1943 a detachment from Camp Hale, Colorado, instituted high-angle rock and assault climbing instruction at Seneca Rocks. Approximately 180 soldiers cycled through this course every 2 weeks. Instruction ranged from simple rock scrambling to tension cable work with pitons, including rigging skills and use of assault ropes with pulleys. Each class concluded with two tactical night climbs on unfamiliar rocks. Pack mule techniques were taught at a mule school set up near Gladwin. Between July 1943 and July 1944 when training ended, more than 100,000 soldiers were trained in the WVMA, among them the 94th Signal Battalion which fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Ordnance in the WVMA today For such a large operation, the maneuvers in the WVMA left relatively few permanent changes. Indeed, many of the areas, such as Dolly Sods, are now protected areas that pass as modern \\"wildernesses\\", untouched by the hand of man. Nevertheless, old ordnance (artillery and mortar shells) is still occasionally found in these areas. A WVMA project was authorized under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) that was established by section 211 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 and is codified in Sections 2701-2707 of Title 10 of the United States Code. DERP addresses the removal and remedial clean-up activities at active sites under the Installation Restoration Program (IRP) and at Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). In 1997, a highly trained ordnance disposal crew surveyed the trail locations and known campsites at Dolly Sods for shells. Fifteen were found, some of them still live. All were exploded on site. Many more may still exist.

History Originally propounding Tory views, and costing a shilling, Cobbett changed his editorial line to embrace radicalism, such as advocating widening the suffrage. It had a large circulation for that time of 6,000 copies. The government was alarmed by its radicalism and tried to prevent mass circulation by adding stamp duty on all newspapers putting them out of reach of all but the wealthiest. From November 1816 Cobbett also published the Register in a cheap 2d. pamphlet, which kept political comment but evaded stamp duty by excising news.Altick, Richard D., The English Common Reader, 2nd ed., 1998, p. 325 The price of the paper gave it the nickname \\"Tuppenny Trash\\",Stewart, R.

Cobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809. In 1812, with his business suffering, Cobbett sold the Debates section to Hansard.

Private prosecutions are allowed in many jurisdictions under common law, but have become less frequent in modern times as most prosecutions are now handled by professional public prosecutors instead of private individuals who retain (or are themselves) barristers. Australia A private criminal prosecution for contempt of court can be commenced against a party in Australia in the Federal Circuit Court, the Family Court (and the Family Court of Western Australia – the only jurisdiction with a state based family court) or the supreme court of a state or territory. In the Family Court of Western Australia, an on-line form exists to commence such proceedings which can be downloaded, completed and filed.http://www.familycourt.wa.gov.au/_files/Form19.pdf In the Supreme Court of Western Australia, either an originating summons (Form No.75 as is an ex-parte application) or originating motion (Form No.64) must be filed specifying the alleged contempt, and personally served on the alleged contemptor before a hearing before a judge sitting in chambers unless the court orders otherwise. If the alleged contempt occurred in relation to any specific case, the forms are required to be filed under the heading of the parties for that specific case; or if it is not alleged to have been committed with reference to a particular proceeding, shall be entitled “The State of Western Australia against” the contemnor (naming him) ex parte the applicant. Belize Belize is another jurisdiction where private prosecutions can be undertaken. In 2014, the private prosecution of politician Elvin Penner by a grass-roots citizens organization (COLA) over issuance of fraudulent passports was unsuccessful because the defense succeed in arguing that the private prosecutor did not have the power to subpoena police records on the case. An attorney for COLA indicated that the government didn't want prosecution of Penner undertaken, and acted to block its success. Canada Canada is a federation and therefore has both federal and provincial offences which can be privately prosecuted. Federally, there are criminal and statutory offences, and provincially there are provincial and municipal non-criminal offences. Under Canada's constitution, all criminal offences in Canada are under federal jurisdiction. The seditious conspirators in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 were tried by state-funded private prosecutors. The funds were disbursed from the War Appropriation Act and are evidenced in the Auditor-General's reports of 1921 and 1922.'Labour / Le Travail' Journal of the Canadian Committee on Labour History: \\"Legal Gentlemen Appointed by the Federal Government: the Canadian State, the Citizens' Committee of 1000, and Winnipeg's Seditious Conspiracy Trials of 1919-1920\\" (Mitchell, 2004) A committee chaired by Mr. Justice Allen Linden of the Law Reform Commission of Canada produced a Working Paper on Private Prosecutions in 1986.

Swaigen, Koehl and Hatt in 2013 summarised efforts to prosecute privately torts in the environmental domain.Environmental Education for Judges and Court Practitioners: \\"PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS REVISITED: THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE OF PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\\" (A Symposium on Environment in the Courtroom (II): Environmental Prosecutions March 18-19, 2013, University of Ottawa) =Criminal offence procedure for private charges= Very basically, a citizen or organisation approaches a justice of the peace to present evidence on each element of the alleged offence. The justice then sets up a hearing with a judge to determine whether there is evidence on each element of the offence, and if approved, and if the Crown does not intervene and terminate the charge (called staying the charge) then it is allowed to proceed to and go through court via the criminal procedure. =Provincial offence procedure for private prosecution= Each province in Canada deals with private prosecutions of provincial offences in their own way. Ontario In Ontario, the procedure for commencing a private prosecution for a provincial offence is governed by Part III of the Provincial Offences Act, ss. 23(1) of which provides that, \\"Any person who, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that one or more persons have committed an offence, may lay an information in the prescribed form and under oath before a justice alleging the offence and the justice shall receive the information.\\" The laying of an information as described in Part III of the Act allows anyone to commence a prosecution for a provincial offence, whereas Parts I and II of the Act may only be used by a provincial offences officer.  France  There are three types of criminal offences in France: *Felonies (crimes), punishable by up to imprisonment for life; *Misdemeanours (délits), punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment (20 years for recidivists); *Petty offences (contraventions), punishable by criminal fine up to € (€ for recidivists). In France private prosecution is called citation directe, and is possible only for misdemeanours and petty offences, if the victim has evidence of the offence. The court sits with either one or three judges, without jury (a jury is present only for felonies, see cour d'assises). In court, the private prosecutor sits alongside the public prosecutor as an accessory, and is merely called the \\"civil plaintiff\\" (partie civile), as French criminal courts also rule on tort claims during the same proceeding. Trials take place in this way even when the prosecution was initiated by the public prosecution office (which is far more usual than a private prosecution). The plaintiff and the accused are both represented by normal attorneys, sitting at the ground-level of the courtroom, while the public prosecutor, considered by French law as a magistrate, sits on a platform as the court, although he does not participate in their deliberations. The public prosecutor gives the court his opinion about the case after the plaintiff and before the defense. Eventually, the defendant may be convicted even if the public prosecutor requested acquittal. In France, appeal courts retry both facts and law. The accused may appeal a conviction and sentence, but the plaintiff can only appeal damages. He cannot appeal an acquittal or a more lenient criminal punishment, contrary to the public prosecutor, who can do this even if the prosecution was private. For felonies or when the plaintiff has insufficient evidence, he may refer to an investigating judge (juge d'instruction) who will investigate the case, and refer it to the trial court (in which he does not sit) if he discovers sufficient evidence of guilt. The investigating judge is independent from the public prosecutor's office, and may refer the case to the trial court even if the public prosecutor requested non-suit. Indeed, French law allows some associations to instigate private prosecutions (similar to American private attorney generals), but only for some few offences such as racist speech. In 2013, this possibility has been added for some white-collar crimes.Articles 2-1 to 2-23 of the French Code of criminal procedure (article 2-23 for white collar crimes). If the defendant is convicted, the criminal court can sentence him to pay damages to the plaintiff for the criminal offence, and to reimburse his legal costs, in addition to the criminal punishment. But if the private prosecution or the referral to the investigating judge is regarded as abusive, the plaintiff may be sentenced to pay damages to the accused and a civil fine to the state by the criminal court. The civil fine may even be inflicted by the investigating judge ordering the non-suit.  Ireland  Private prosecutions remain possible in the Republic of Ireland, though only at the District Court level where less serious offences are heard before a judge only. The continuing existence of the right to private prosecution was confirmed in 2013 in the decision of the case Kelly & anor -v- Ryan ([2013] IEHC 321).  New Zealand  Private prosecutions remain legal in New Zealand. Philippines Private prosecutors in the Philippines are private attorneys that work with police and public prosecutors to help bring criminal cases. They often work to get the location of a trial moved to more neutral court, outside of the influence of local power brokers, and to prepare needed legal petitions and other documents. They also help to keep up the spirits of the victim's family and to keep media and public attention focused on the case. Private prosecutors can be involved in cases in front of the national anti- corruption court the Sandiganbayan.  Singapore  A private prosecution is brought by a private individual if want to seek redress for a wrong they believe has been done to them. That individual would have to first file a complaint with a Magistrate at the State Courts. If the person does not have a lawyer, it can be that individual may conduct the prosecution themselves. Examples: * Prince Abdul Hakeem Jefri Bolkiah - On 8 September 2012 it was reported, the prince being sued by 9 investors because of a disagreement over the transfer of some 80 million shares in the Singapore-listed Elektromotive Group to those shareholders. It was reported that among those who were suing was Citi's Chief Singapore and Malaysia Economist, and former government scholar, Kit Wei Zheng (who in 2009 had _incorrectly_ forecast that Singapore would experience \\"the most severe recession in Singapore’s history\\"), Ms Eileen Ong and Mr Chan Kwai Sum. Eventually the Prince agreed to pay the full amount demanded by the investors of S$890,000 as well as legal costing amounting to $50,000. The prince suggested that he had been used as a \\"figurehead\\" to gain the trust of investors. However, Elektromotive Group was struggling financially and the same shareholders who were suing him, erroneously believed that having the prince on board would actually make them wealthy. South Africa =NSPCA South Africa= The NSPCA had its victory in the Constitutional Court of South Africa on 8 December 2016 when the organisation won its case it brought before the Court to institute Private Prosecutions in terms of Section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977. This after the organisation lost its cases it brought before the North Gauteng High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa on the same matter of Private Prosecutions. The reason the NSPCA brought the case before the Courts is because despite “overwhelming” evidence of animal cruelty or abuse‚ the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa (NPA) declined to prosecute the cases brought by the organisation, resulting in animal abusers not being charged on charges of animal cruelty. The Constitutional Court of South Africa also ruled that the Respondents, The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development and the National Director of Public Prosecutions, were to pay the organisations costs in all three applications. =Duduzane Zuma= =Nomgcobo Jiba= United Kingdom Private prosecutions are permitted in the United Kingdom. They are governed by different rules in the different jurisdictions. =England and Wales= Private prosecution is allowed in English law. In the early history of England, the victim of a crime and his family had the right to hire a private lawyer to prosecute criminal charges against the person alleged to have injured the victim. In the 18th century, prosecution was private for almost all criminal offences against the person, usually by the victim. One reason for this was that prosecution had never been conceived of as a public matter. The English system was based on the principles of individual and local prosecution in which the right of the private citizen was paramount.\\"The Prosecution Process in England and Wales\\", 1970 Crim. L. Rev. 668 The exception to this norm was in offences where the victim was the Crown, and the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General represented the prosecution at state trials; for an example, see the 1637 ship money tax protest case of John Hampden. As detailed above, a route to prosecution had been by victims at their own expense or lawyers acting on their behalf. From the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 onwards, as the police forces began their present form, they began to take on the burden of bringing prosecutions against suspected criminals. In 1880, Sir John Maule was appointed to be the first Director of Public Prosecutions, operating as a part of the Home Office. The jurisdiction was only for the decision as to whether to prosecute, and just for a very small number of difficult or important cases. Once prosecution had been authorised, the matter was turned over to the Treasury Solicitor. Police forces continued to be responsible for the bulk of cases, sometimes referring difficult ones to the Director. Prior to its termination in 1933, criminal prosecution required a true bill of indictment from the grand jury, and so frivolous and vexatious proceedings were designed to be avoided at this stage (although this did not turn out to be the case in practice). In 1962, the Royal Commission on the Police recommended that police forces set up independent prosecution departments so as to avoid having the same officers investigate and prosecute cases. Technically, though, the prosecuting police officers did so as private citizens. The Royal Commission's recommendation was not implemented by all police forces, and so in 1978 another Royal Commission was struck, this time headed by Sir Cyril Philips. It reported in 1981, recommending that a single unified Crown Prosecution Service with responsibility for all public prosecutions in England and Wales be set up. A White Paper was released in 1983, becoming the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, which established the Crown Prosecution Service under the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, consisting of a merger of his old department with the existing police prosecution departments. It started operating in 1986. The CPS can also prevent a private prosecution from continuing by taking it over and then discontinuing it. The CPS supposedly will do this only where there is not enough evidence to make a proper case, or where a prosecution is against the public interest or could cause an injustice. In reaching this decision, it must balance the public good against a duty to preserve an individual's right to prosecute under the 1985 act. When taking over any private prosecution, the CPS may direct the police to conduct further investigations. The intention of this was to ensure the best available evidence was placed before the court, as further trials were generally excluded until 2003 by the double jeopardy rule. The latter rule was abrogated in certain circumstances of \\"new and compelling evidence\\", and for a limited range of the most serious offences such as rape, armed robbery and murder, by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Recommended by Blunkett, Irvine and Goldsmith, Also available from The Stationery Office this change is permitted by the optional Article 4 of the Seventh Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, although the United Kingdom is not a party to it. =Scotland= Private prosecutions are rare in Scots law and require special circumstances surrounding the crime to be evident. Leave to prosecute must be obtained by granting of a bill of criminal letters by the High Court of Justiciary. Within the 20th century, only two such prosecutions were made. United States In colonial America, because of Dutch (and possibly French) practice and the expansion of the office of attorney general, public officials came to dominate the prosecution of crimes. However, privately funded prosecutors constituted a significant element of the state criminal justice system throughout the nineteenth century.[49 Fordham L. Rev. 26 (1980-1981) \\"Criminal Procedure in England and the United States: Comparisons in Initiating Prosecutions\\", Irving R. Kaufman The right to private prosecution in federal cases was removed following the 1981 Supreme Court decision in Leeke v. Timmerman, affirming an earlier decision in Linda R. S. v. Richard D.. However, a federal prosecutor may appoint a private attorney to prosecute a case. Elsewhere, private prosecution is governed by state laws. = California = Prosecutions are implicitly limited to district attorneys per California Penal Code § 739, which describes the \\"duty\\" of district attorneys to file charges after a judge finds grounds that an offense has been committed. = Colorado = In 1974, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that private prosecutions were improper and prejudicial to the defendant. = Georgia = In Georgia, criminal proceedings may be initiated at the request of a private citizen, but only after the defendant is given an opportunity to argue why he or she should not be charged. = Idaho = Idaho allows private citizens to file criminal complaints to a magistrate; the magistrate can issue an arrest warrant upon satisfaction that a crime has occurred. = Kentucky = Kentucky allows a private citizen to initiate criminal cases by filing criminal complaints, although it is up to the county attorney or Commonwealth's attorney to decide whether to proceed with the case. = Maryland = Maryland allows private citizens to file affidavits against another citizen. = Massachusetts = Private prosecutions in Massachusetts were declared void in 1849 and formally outlawed in 1855.http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/public_contract_law_journal/pclj_vol40_no4_grove.authcheckdam.pdf = Michigan = Michigan banned private prosecutions in 1875. = Minnesota = The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in 1977 in State ex rel. Wild v. Otis that a private citizen does not have a right to prosecute an alleged crime. = Missouri = The right to private prosecution in Missouri was removed in 1976 following the decision in State v. Harrington. = New Hampshire = New Hampshire allows private prosecution of any crime that does not carry incarceration as a possible penalty. However, prosecutors have the right to dismiss private criminal charges. = New Jersey = New Jersey continues to allow private prosecutions in its Municipal Courts. However, the 1995 decision of State v. Storm prohibited private prosecutions if the party intending to prosecute has a conflict of interest with the defendants or a financial interest in the case. Furthermore, state law states that all private prosecutions require approval of the county prosecutor and the court.http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r3-23.htm = New York = In 2002, a federal district court concluded in Kampfer v. Vonderheide that private prosecutions were barred under New York law as a violation of the defendant's due process rights. However, in Kampfer the court distinguished, in dicta, private prosecutions where there is an \\"underlying civil cause of action\\" in relation to the events which gave rise to the prosecution. = North Carolina = Private prosecutors were used in North Carolina as late as 1975. The court ruled in State v. Best in 1974 that an elected prosecutor must be in charge of all prosecutions.http://famguardian.org/publishedauthors/media/antishyster/V07N1-PrivateProsecutions.pdf = Ohio = Ohio state law allows private citizens to file an affidavit alleging a crime. However, the actual prosecution is limited to the state. = Pennsylvania = Private prosecutions in Pennsylvania require approval from a state prosecutor. = Rhode Island = In 2001, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled in Diane S. Cronan ex rel. State v. John J. Cronan that a private citizen could file criminal complaints for misdemeanors. However, prosecution of felonies remains limited to the state. Private prosecutors also cannot seek penalties of greater than one year of incarceration or a fine of greater than $1,000.http://www.courts.ri.gov/Courts/SupremeCourt/OpinionsOrders/pdf- files/99-378.pdf = South Carolina = The right was removed from South Carolina law in the nineteenth century. However, private citizens may still initiate a criminal case by filing a request with a magistrate, although magistrates can only issue summonses in response to private criminal complaints. = Texas = Texas allows a private citizen to contact a grand jury to seek an indictment.http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context;=lawreview = Virginia = The use of a private prosecutor was incorporated into the common law of Virginia and is still permitted there. = Wisconsin = Private prosecutions in Wisconsin were outlawed following the decision of Biemel v. State in 1855. In 1890, the court ruled that a private attorney can assist in a prosecution as long as there is no conflict of interest.http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1444&context;=wlucdj Controversy Bruce L. Benson's To Serve and Protect lauds the role of private prosecutors, often employed by prosecution associations, in serving the needs of crime victims in England. There have been calls for restoring the practice of private prosecution, especially in cases of official misconduct, where judges, public prosecutors, and the police act in concert to violate the law. Some libertarian theorists hold that public prosecutors should not exist, but that crimes should instead be treated as civil torts. Murray Rothbard writes, \\"In a libertarian world, there would be no crimes against an ill- defined 'society,' and therefore no such person as a 'district attorney' who decides on a charge and then presses those charges against an alleged criminal.\\" Private prosecution is sometimes regarded with suspicion as a potential avenue for vexatious or malicious prosecution. Okagbue writes that the most useful control against such abuses is the power of the court to refuse to allow the case to proceed where it is of the opinion that there is not enough evidence to support the charge. The cost of private prosecution, including potential civil liability for malicious prosecution, can also deter frivolous prosecutions. Notable private prosecutions *Oscar Wilde initiated an unsuccessful private prosecution for libel against the Marquess of Queensberry when the latter publicly accused Wilde of sodomy, which was then a crime. This was unsuccessful, and Wilde himself ended up convicted of gross indecency, with a punishment of five years at hard labor. *Whitehouse v. Lemon (1977) was the last successful blasphemy prosecution in the United Kingdom. *In 1995 Women Against Rape, together with Legal Action for Women and the English Collective of Prostitutes, helped two women bring the first private prosecution for rape in England and Wales after the prosecuting authority refused to prosecute.4\\\\.

Boucherville =Carrefour de la Rive- Sud= Carrefour de la Rive-Sud is a power centre inaugurated in 2002 in Boucherville, Quebec at the corner of highways 20 and 30. It is and managed by Centrecorp of Markham, Ontario. The major tenants are IKEA, Costco, Rona le Rénovateur, Super C, Winners, Homesense, Marshalls, Bureau en Gros, Deco Decouverte, and Linen Chest. Other tenants include Sports Experts, Tommy Hilfiger, Bouclair, L'Equipeur and Archambault. Among popular boutiques, there is Reitmans, BCBG Maxazria, Aldo and Garage. Although Carrefour de la Rive-Sud does occupy a large territory, its number of tenants is no more than 60. Carrefour de la Rive Sud houses one of the three Adidas warehouse stores in Quebec that sells the Adidas Performance collection, Adidas' sub-brand which specializes in sport clothes and running shoes.https://adidasstorelocator.ca/ Along with Quartier DIX30 in Brossard, Carrefour de la Rive Sud constitute the major unenclosed malls of Greater Longueuil, although smaller power centers can be found in the cities of Longueuil and Saint-Bruno. =Promenades Montarville= Promenades Montarville is one of the smallest indoor malls in Greater Longueuil. It is situated at the corner of de Montarville and de Mortagne boulevards in the city of Boucherville. It was opened in 1979 and has approximately 45 tenants.http://promenadesmontarville.com/en/about- us/http://urbanisme.boucherville.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fiche_Fonction- commerciale_201503.pdf The majors tenants are Provigo, Canadian Tire, Go Sport and Jean Coutu. Many of the tenants are small business, but the mall also has a number of retailing chains such as Dollarama, La Source, Greiche & Scaff, Ardène, Le Naturiste and Panda. The bank in the mall is Banque de Montreal (BMO) and its restaurants are Tim Hortons and Subway. Promenades Montarville is less than 5 km (3 miles) away from the much larger (but not enclosed) Carrefour de le Rive-Sud. Brossard =Champlain Mall= =Place Portobello= Former Zellers at Place Portobello, one of the largest stores in the province for that chain. Place Portobello is a shopping mall located in Brossard, Quebec along Taschereau Boulevard near the Autoroute 10-Taschereau Interchange. Some major tenants include Linen Chest, Maxi and Jean Coutu. Since March 2011, Place Portobello is operated by First Capital Realty. Place Portobello was previously operated by Cogir Management Corporation. Although it no longer manages the mall, Cogir still has its corporate headquarters in the office building of Place Portobello. There is a building in the middle of the mall with second and third floors serving as commercial office spaces. There is a nearby Reno-Depot hardware store which is a tenant of Place Portobello despite not sharing any indoor or outdoor boundary with the rest of the mall. It inaugurated on September 21, 1966 with Woolco, Dominion and 20 stores. It expanded with the opening of new anchor Beaver Lumber on May 1, 1974 and the addition of new stores in 1975. Dominion became Provigo in 1981. Beaver Lumber closed on December 24, 1987 and reopened in February 1988 as a Brico Centre hardware store. In 1991, Provigo rebranded to the current Maxi. It was the second supermarket to carry the Maxi banner in the South Shore (the first being the location at Chambly Road in Longueuil) . Walmart acquired the Woolco location in 1994. Walmart left the mall in January 2008 to relocate to a larger stand alone building in Quartier DIX30. It was replaced by Zellers from December 2008 to December 2012. The Zellers was renovated and converted into a Target store, which opened its doors to the public on September 17, 2013, which later closed in 2015. The former Target is now a Renaissance, a Buffet des Continents, a Surplus RD, a Party Mania and a Klub Athletik. =Quartier DIX30= Longueuil =Greenfield Park= 5000 Taschereau 5000 Taschereau is a shopping mall located in the borough of Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada located on Taschereau Boulevard, near Greenfield Park's borough limit with neighbouring Brossard. It inaugurated around the same time as its original tenant Super Carnaval which opened on January 23, 1985. From the late 1980s and up until 2010, the mall was called Mail Carnaval and was named after Super Carnaval (today Super C). Mail Carnaval was once an indoor shopping centre. A Jean Coutu pharmacy was one of the first tenants in the 1980s, but soon moved out. Beginning in December 1988, Mail Carnaval featured a mini indoor attraction park open every week- ends in the heart of the mall. Tenants that once made business at Mail Carnaval include a Do it Center hardware store, American fitness chain Gold's Gym, a Famous Players movie theatre, the National Bank of Canada and a Zellers department store. For a number of years and up until 2009, Mail Carnaval was the headquarters of fitness chain Nautilus Plus which was located right next to the branch of competitor Energie Cardio. However, Nautilus Plus never operated an actual branch in the mall. As of 2002, Mail Carnaval gradually began losing its small tenants and was on its way to become a dead mall. In the summer of 2007, the last small tenants left the mall. The mall's indoor corridor was demolished in 2009 and turned into a parking lot for Super C. Shortly after Zellers closed in May 2010, the name of the mall was changed from Mail Carnaval to 5000 Taschereau. As of 2018, only Super C, Energie Cardio, Michaels and a relocated L'Equipeur store from nearby Place Greenfield Park are in operation at 5000 Taschereau. Due to the demolition of the indoor mall section in 2009, Super C's building is physically separated from the rest of the tenants. Galeries Taschereau Galeries Taschereau is a strip mall that was an enclosed mall until 2002. Previously managed by Cambridge Leaseholds, it is now operated by Sandalwood Management Canada, a subsidiary of Sandalwood Management of Austin, Texas. The mall served as the city council of the city of Greenfield Park until the late 1990s. The major tenants are Fruiterie 440, Hart, L'Aubainerie, Marché du Store, and warehouses of both Pennington and Taylor. Joining them are two are restaurants (Amir and Subway), a Buzzfit Gym as well as a few smaller enterprises including a hairdresser (P&J; Coiffure), a cellular phone repair enterprise (UBreakIFix), and a marijuana market selling [pot-culture] paraphernalia Galeries Taschereau was anchored at its opening in late 1973 by A&P; Canada, Greenberg and Horizon. In early 1979, Eaton's changed the vocation of the Horizon location by turning it into a Foyerama furniture store. An expansion in 1983 increased the size of the mall to 220 000 square feet and tripled its number of tenants to 60 anchors and boutiques including a new Zellers store which replaced the Eaton's (Foyerama) store. It was a significantly smaller than typical Zellers stores and it closed in 1987. Hart, Le Chateau warehouse occupy and a recently vacated Village des Valeurs occupy the space where this Zellers stood. It had no connection to the Zellers store that later opened in 1990 at Mail Carnaval. In February 2020, Village des Valeurs left its location at Galeries Tachereau it had occupied since 1991, to relocate to other side the street on Auguste Avenue.https://www.lecourrierdusud.ca/un-nouvel-emplacement-pour-le-village- des-valeurs-de-greenfield-park/ Other past tenants of mall include Provigo (which replaced A&P; in 1984 and is now the Fruiterie 440), Future Shop, Bouclair and Bank of Montreal. Place Greenfield Park Place Greenfield Park (also called Riocan Greenfield Park) is a large strip mall located in Greenfield Park, Quebec. It is located on Taschereau Boulevard, extending from Gladstone Street to Margaret Street. It is owned and operated by RioCan. Place Greenfield was once the first enclosed shopping centre in the South Shore but was converted to the strip format in 2001 after its remaining boutiques closed. For 40 years, the shopping centre was under the management of Ivanhoe Corporation (today Ivanhoe Cambridge). In 2002, Ivanhoe Cambridge sold the mall to Riocan. It started in 1962 with only a Steinberg's supermarket and a Woodward Steinberg (Miracle Mart) department store. A Pascal's hardware store was added in the first half of 1964. The mall itself and its boutiques opened in 1965 with, among others, anchor tenant Wise. Toyville, a large-sized toy retailer, inaugurated on October 22, 1981. The store was located on the end side of the shopping center that intersects Gladstone Avenue. It closed on December 29, 1990. Its space was occupied by a Club Biz office supply store from October 29, 1992 until the chain ceased operations in early 1996. Like the rest of Club Biz locations, the lease was acquired by Bureau en Gros which opened its Place Greenfield Park store on June 1, 1996. Leon's opened a store on January 6, 1988. It replaced the Miracle Mart store that had closed in 1986. In October 2007, Leon's left its location in the mall and moved to the intersection of Chambly Road and Autoroute 30 in the St-Hubert borough of Longueuil. After being a Ha Bay furniture store for much of the 2010s, the space was subdivided in 2017 by Jysk, Univers Kids Dépôt and a portion of Giant Tiger. Jysk opened on June 3, 2017. Univers Kids Dépôt, a second-hand shop which launched its very first store, took 5000 square of the former Leon's/Ha Bay emplacement. Giant Tiger inaugurated on November 4, 2017. Pascal closed in 1991. Goineau-Bousquet, a hardware retailer from Laval, opened in the former Pascal space in early 1992. Goineau-Bousquet filed for bankruptcy protection on June 3, 1996 and, in the process, announced the closing of its Greenfield Park location, effective for the end of July. In 1998, Cinémas Guzzo took the space to open what was, at the time, the biggest movie theater in Quebec history.http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/bs25017 In mid-1992, the Steinberg grocery store rebranded as Provigo which in turn was converted to the current Maxi within the year. Winners opened on August 23, 1995 its first store in Greater Longueuil and its sixth in the province. At 23 000 square feet, it replaced the majority of the Wise store which had closed only mere weeks before and was the mall's last original anchor. =Saint- Hubert= Centre Cousineau Centre Cousineau (also called Centre Cousineau Point-Zero since 2010) is located at the intersection of Cousineau Blvd and Montee Saint-Hubert. It is managed and owned by Enterprises Point- Zero, a company best known for its clothing lineup Point-Zero. The majors tenants are Jean Coutu, Metro Plus and Le SuperClub Vidéotron. From 1997 to 2010, the mall housed the public library of Saint-Hubert. Centre Cousineau has its origins in the 1960s as a nameless strip mall that corresponds today to the section of the mall that faces Montee Saint-Hubert. In 1978, the strip mall was converted into the current indoor mall. It was first named Galeries Cousineau in 1978, then renamed Complexe Cousineau in 1987, and finally Centre Cousineau in 2006. The mall was at its peak in the 1980s, with a total of 75 stores including anchors Rona, Greenberg, Sports Experts, Croteau, Jean Coutu and Metro. Its office building was home to a CLSC and many Saint-Hubert municipal services. Centre Cousineau began to lose ground in the 1990s. By the mid-2000, it had all but been turned into a dead mall, with retailing chains such as La Source, Société des alcools du Québec and Petland having closed in addition to the small businesses. To add to the injury, a fire in 2007 destroyed La Crémière, a fast food and ice cream store, and the Jean-Coutu pharmacy, causing the permanent closure of the former and relocation of the latter. Lack of proper insurance coverage caused the mall to be partially barricaded for a number of years without renovation. In 2009, Entreprises Point Zero acquired Centre Cousineau. It made significant improvements to the anchor stores, including renovating extensively their exterior facades. The rest of the centre however continued to be deserted. As of late September 2018, the few indoors tenants that were left relocated to the outdoor section on Montee Saint-Hubert. The mall's doors have all been permanently locked with the lights turned off. Only its anchors on Cousineau Blvd. and a handful of small tenants on the strip mall section facing Montee Sain-Hubert survive. =Le Vieux-Longueuil= Centre Jacques-Cartier Centre Jacques-Cartier is a small shopping mall located in Le Vieux-Longueuil borough of Longueuil, Quebec. It is located at the intersection of Chambly Road and Ste-Foy Boulevard. Some of its current major tenants are IGA, Cinémas Guzzo, Village des Valeurs, Pharmaprix and Rossy.https://strathallen.com/property/centre_jacques-cartier The mall is made of approximately 45 stores occupying square feet of rentable space. Since its opening in 1957, Centre Jacques-Cartier has been the oldest shopping centre in the South Shore, if not the entire Montérégie. Like other early shopping centres in Quebec, it was developed by Ivanhoe, the real estate company of Sam Steinberg. Its original anchors in 1957 were Steinberg's, Wise, Woolworth's and United Stores. In the year 1970, the mall went from strip mall to enclosed mall. The mall is named after Ville Jacques-Cartier which was the name of the city at the time the mall was constructed. It was originally known simply as the Ville Jacques-Cartier shopping centre. After the municipality of Jacques- Cartier was dissolved, the mall took on the name of Place Jacques-Cartier throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It was renamed to its current moniker in the mid-1990s, presumably to avoid confusion with the attraction of the same name. It is now operated and owned by Toronto-based Strathallen Capital who also manages Dorval Gardens, another mall built in the 1950s by Ivanhoe. Place Desormeaux Place Desormeaux is a shopping mall located in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada. Its major tenants are Super C and Walmart. The mall is made of approximately 45 stores occupying of rentable space. The mall has two banks: Banque de Montreal and Banque Nationale. The mall first opened on May 19, 1971 with Bonimart, Steinberg and Zellers as anchors with approximately 50 stores.http://www.marigot.ca/html/p.pdf At its opening, Place Desormeaux was the largest mall in the South Shore. Only Zellers had an outdoor entrance; Bonimart and Steinberg could only be accessed from inside the mall. Notable tenants in the 1970s included the Bank of Montreal, Banque Canadienne Nationale, Reitmans, J B Lefebvre and Laura Secord Chocolates. Place Desormeaux began a renovation project in spring 1986 which was completed in the fall within the same year. A notable consequence of this renovation was the reduction of the Bonimart store whose remaining anchor space was converted into a mall section for 15 to 20 new boutiques. This increased Place Desormeaux's number of tenants to 70 even if its total area size remained the same. On April 15, 1991, Zellers announced the rebranding into its nameplate of 46 Towers/Bonimart stores. Since there was already a Zellers store in the mall, the Bonimart at Place Desormeaux was closed. Its closing greatly lowered consumer traffic in the section of the mall it was located to the point that by the mid-1990s, there was not a single boutique left around where Bonimart was. In 1997, that part of Place Desormeaux (which had been Bonimart's anchor space from 1971 to 1986) was demolished and rebuilt with a complete new design to welcome the current Super C. The Steinberg grocery chain went bankrupt in 1992. Unlike most Steinberg locations, the one at Place Desormeaux was not sold and was closed outright instead. A small grocery chain Esposito took over the lease. Esposito in turn closed in 1996, opening the way for department store Winners to install itself in the mall on August 22, 1996. After operating for some 10 years, Winners closed around late 2006/early 2007. The space is now home to a branch of the SAAQ and the Longueuil Local Employment Centre, both of which are part of the Government of Quebec. After 40 years in operation, Zellers permanently closed its doors in June 2012. Walmart assumed the lease of the former Zellers store and opened its store in October of the same year.http://www.newswire.ca/fr/story/1049553/walmart-canada-embarks-on- biggest-month-of-grand-openings Place Longueuil Place Longueuil is a shopping mall located in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada. It is located near the Longueuil Metro station. The major stores are IGA Extra, Winners/HomeSense and, to a lesser extent, St-Hubert and Sports Experts. Place Longueuil was built in 1966 with 65 stores anchored by Steinberg and Miracle Mart. Though not the oldest shopping centre in present-day Longueuil, it was nonetheless the first mall in what was then the city of Longueuil in 1966. Place Longueuil and its 65 boutiques were destroyed on October 6, 1979 by a major fire started by a 9-year-old boy. It was the worst fire in Longueuil history, even requiring the help of firefighters from Boucherville, Greenfield Park, Saint- Lambert, Ville Lemoyne, Saint-Hubert and Varennes to extinguish it. Steinberg and Miracle Mart were not destroyed by the fire but they both suffered damages from it. The mall was rebuilt and reopened in April 1981 with 85 stores. It underwent an expansion in 1987. Miracle Mart was renamed M in 1986 and finally closed in 1992. After M closed, Zellers took the location of M and remained there until its own closure in 2012 and its subsequent replacement by Target the following year. Half of the space then became a Winners/HomeSense on July 31, 2018 after the closure of Target in 2015. There has been little change in the supermarket tenantship of Place Longueuil. In 1992, Steinberg was changed to an IGA which has been in the mall ever since, albeit with an upgrade to the IGA Extra banner in the 2000s. On February 18, 2011, it was announced that Homburg Canada would succeed over Cogir as manager of Place Longueuil. The transaction took effect a couple of days later. As of 2017, Place Longueuil is owned and operated by Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust. Saint-Bruno-de- Montarville =Promenades Saint-Bruno= Saint-Lambert =Carré Saint- Lambert= Carré Saint- Lamberthttp://sgi.st/properties/main.cfm?p=220&l;=en&Ville;=3 is a small strip mall located on Sir Wilfrid Laurier Boulevard near Victoria Avenue in St. Lambert, Quebec, Canada. The property is owned and operated by SGI Properties, a Quebec-based real estate company. Built in 1958, it is located just off the Victoria Bridge and near the Lemoyne neighbourhood of Longueuil. Its major tenants include IGA, Familiprix, Le SuperClub Vidéotron,Société des alcools du Québec. Former tenants include headquarters of the Riverside School Board.

The film was honored in a cycle of film classics by Jean Renoir, Marcel Carné, and Jean Vigo at the Museum Ludwig (Cologne, Germany) in September 2007.In Balthus or Time Suspended: Paintings and Drawings (1932-1960). Cologne: Museum Ludwig Catalogue, 2007.  Plot  The feature length documentary highlights the painter's complex creative process with rare footage of the artist at work in his studio in the Swiss mountain village of Rossinière. Conversations with Balthus and his wife Setsuko, his daughter Harumi, his sons Stanislaus and Thadée, interviews with art critics Jean Leymarie, Jean Clair, Pierre Rosenberg, and James Lord, and with French painter François Rouan (who often assisted Balthus during his tenure at the Villa Medici), contribute to form a psychological portrait of a secretive and controversial artist. Also featured are photographs by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Irving Penn, and much unpublished material. The film was shot in Super 16 over a 12-month period in Switzerland, Italy, France, and the Moors of England.  Reception  The French weekly magazine Télérama described the film as \\"a beautiful portrait, vibrant, varied and, beyond the magnificent images, tender, respectful, and compelling.\\"Céna, Olivier, Télérama, No. 2448, 14–20 December 1996, p. 34. \\"Along with his habits and customs preserved on film,\\" wrote Hervé Gaumont, art critic for Libération, \\"the master's slowness is admirably rendered.\\"Gaumont, Hervé, Libération, 16 December 1996, p. 22. Le Journal des Arts praised the \\"subtle approach, neither didactic nor pedagogical, that succeeds in capturing the painter's intimate world.\\"Tauss, Céline, 'Balthus intime', Le Journal des Arts, December 1996, p. 37. Art critic Florence Couturiau reviewed the film in Muséart as one \\"photographed with precision and magic, from Paris to Rome by way of Balthus's Italian castle. The geometry of the compositions and the subtlety of the painter's palette shine through each frame of film.\\"Couturiau, Florence, Muséart, No. 78, January 1998, p. 26. Le Figaro regretted the artist's legendary reserve but admired \\"a visually stunning documentary that transforms an indiscreet visit into a poetic and analytical portrait... The film examines the cruelty and isolation of Balthus in the light of his close friendship with Artaud who, describing the painter as his double, descended into madness while his twin fled with his sanity still intact. In counterpoint, Philippe Noiret sees in Balthus a surrogate father offering a reassuring affection.\\"Borde, Dominique, Le Figaro, 16 January 1997, p. 36. Film critic Michel Parmentier of TéléCable Satellite applauded its intimate approach: \\"Near-definitive, the portrait examines the key moments of the painter's life and, more importantly, plunges the viewer into his strange and haunting universe... Balthus reveals various secrets. The level of intimacy is such that Pettigrew's documentary becomes an exceptional work.\\"Parmentier, Michel, TéléCable Satellite, 14–20 December 1996, p. 31. Le Nouvel Observateur reviewed it as \\"a successful and moving portrait.\\"Le Nouvel Observateur, 12–18 January 1997, p. 33. The French on-line DVD magazine, Dvdrama, reported that \\"the interviews, particularly those conducted with the artist's sons, are filled with fascinating anecdotes. There is real pleasure in watching the film as the director of Fellini: I'm a Born Liar skilfully marries erudition with emotion, allowing us to penetrate the painter's austere and complex personality devoted entirely to his art.\\"Dvdrama Review Retrieved 4 March 2013 File:BalthusinGarden.jpgBalthus and his wife Setsuko during filming.

Quotes from the film  François Rouan: \\"The piss that one cherishes when it streams from the beloved... The central question of painting, and particularly in Balthus's work, is the sexual dimension. If Balthus were here, he'd light up a cigarette, yet another one, and assume a humorous air, naturally he would let me have my say, and then he'd conclude by telling me that the young women he paints are angels.\\" Jean Leymarie: \\"Angels, as Rilke noted, are terrifying. And beauty itself is terrifying.\\" Jean Clair: \\"Perhaps his greatest moments are when his cruelty explodes onto the canvas. Balthus possesses a Sadean element.\\" Balthus: \\"The quickest way to become famous during the 1930s was by causing a scandal.\\"  Awards  *1996: Grand Prize - XXIst UNESCO International Festival of Art Films *1996: Best Photography Prize - Lausanne International Art Film Festival *1996: Official Selection - 8th International VUE SUR LES DOCS Marseille  DVD  The feature documentary is available in an international DVD edition released by Arte Vidéo in October 2007 (NTSC / All zones format).

Viticulture and winemaking has existed in this region since the time of the Celts and Illyrians tribes, long before the Romans would introduce winemaking to the lands of France, Spain and Germany. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 632–633 Oxford University Press 2006 Today Slovenia has more than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres annually from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million l a year being exported--mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the Drava Wine-Growing Region, the Lower Sava Wine-Growing Region, and the Littoral Wine-Growing Region. In 2016, a research study based on DNA profiling and historical ampelographic sources showed that two international varieties of red grape, the Blaufränkisch and the Blauer Portugieser, with a high likelihood originate from the territory of nowadays Slovenia (today's Slovenian Styria). History Unlike many of the major European wine regions, Slovenia's viticultural history predates Roman influences and can be traced back to the early Celtic and Illyrian tribes who began cultivating vines for wine production sometime between the 5th and 4th centuries BC. By the Middle Ages, the Christian Church controlled most of the region's wine production through the monasteries. Under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, privately owned wineries had some presence in the region but steadily declined following the empire's fall and the beginning of Yugoslavia. By the end of the Second World War, co-operatives controlled nearly all of the region's wine production and quality was very low as the emphasis was on the bulk wine production. The exception was the few small private wineries in the Drava Valley region that were able to continue operation. In 1967, the government established the PSVVS (Business Association for Viticulture and Wine Production) which established testing practices for quality assurance and issued seals of approval for wines that met the organization's standards. In 1991, Slovenia was the first Yugoslav republic to declare independence. While the wine industry, as did other sectors of the Slovenian economy, experienced some decline following the turmoil of the Yugoslav wars, the region's strong ties to the West allowed the industry to quickly rebound. Today the Slovenian wine industry the most advanced and well developed of the former Yugoslav republics and is starting to gain interest in the world's wine market. Slovenia's major wine regions Climate and geography Slovenia has a diverse geography which provides a wide variety of microclimates. It is bordered to the north by Austria, separated by the Alps. To the west is Italy and the Adriatic Sea, Hungary to the east and Croatia forms the southern border. The region has a continental climate with cold, dry winters and hot summer. The far western regions of the Littoral have some Mediterranean influence. Some common viticultural hazards in the region include spring frost, drought during the growing season and summertime hail. Many of Slovenia's vineyards are located in the foothills of the Julian and Karavanke Alps and the Pannonian Plain. The Drava and Sava Rivers are major influences in the Drava Valley and Lower Sava Valley, respectively. H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 253 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Wine-growing regions Slovenia has three main wine-growing regions () : the Littoral Region, encompassing the area of the traditional region of Slovene Littoral, the Lower Sava Region, which includes the Lower Sava Valley, the White Carniola, and the Lower Carniola, and the Drava Region, which includes the Drava Valley. The Littoral Region is Slovenia's most internationally known region. Though predominately a white wine producer, it is responsible for most of Slovenia's red wine production. = Littoral Region = The Littoral Wine-Growing Region () has two of Slovenia's most widely known and prominent wine districts, the Gorizia Hilla (Goriška brda) and Koper districts. It is subdivided into four districts. The Brda district borders the Italian wine region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia with the Gorizia Hills Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC). This region was one of the first in Slovenia to make a concentrated attempt at establishing an international reputation for quality. The area is planted with international varieties of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Pinot gris (Sivi Pinot), and Pinot noir (Modri Pinot) as well as Rebula, Refosco (Refošk) and Friulano. Brda is best known for its Rebula white wine and Merlot-Cabernet blends. The Koper district on the Istrian peninsula along the Adriatic coast is the warmest wine region in Slovenia. The Refosco and Malvazija grapes are the most widely planted in Koper. The Karst plateau district, located near the Italian city of Trieste, is known for the wine style Teran which is a very dark, highly acidic red wine made from Refosco planted in the region's red iron-rich soil. Other varieties grown in the region include Piccola nera.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours p. 797 Allen Lane 2012 The Vipava Valley district specializes in light, crisp white wines made from the local Pinela and Zelen grapes. Other grapes found throughout the Littoral region include Barbera, Beli Pinot (Beli Burgundec), Cabernet Franc, Cipro, Glera, Klarnica, Laški Rizling, Maločrn, Rumeni Muškat, Syrah and Vitovska Grganja. = Lower Sava Region = Wine of the Gorjanci region at Žumberak Mountains The Lower Sava Wine-Growing Region () is the only Slovenian wine region that produces more red wine than white, though not by a large margin. The area is subdivided into three districts. The Bizeljsko-Brežice district is known for its sparkling wine production and acidic white wines made from the Rumeni Plavec grape. The Lower Carniola district is known for its production of Cviček made from a blend of white and red wine grapes, most commonly Kraljevina and Žametovka. The White Carniola district is known for its red wine made from Modra Frankinja and Rumeni Muškat. Other grapes found planted throughout The Lower Sava Valley include Beli Pinot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Gamay, Modri Pinot, Neuburger, Ranina, Rdeča Zlahtnina, Renski Rizling, Šentlovrenka, Šipon, Sivi Pinot, Traminec, and Zweigelt. Currently the Lower Sava Valley region is dominated more by bulk wine, rather than premium wine, production. = Drava Region = The Drava Wine-Growing Region () is the largest wine region in Slovenia and is subdivided into 7 districts. The Radgona-Kapela district was the first Slovenia wine region to produce sparkling (penina) wine using the méthode champenoise in 1852. The Ljutomer-Ormož district includes the village of Jeruzalem which is known for white wine made from Dišeči Traminec and Ranina. Along with Radgona-Kapela and the Maribor district, Ljutomer-Ormož produces some of the best examples of Drava Valley wine. While the Haloze district is improving in quality, that district along with the Prekmurje, Central Slovene Hills, and Šmarje-Virštanj districts have small production that is consumed locally. Nearly 97% of the wine made in the Drava Valley region is white wine. Other grape varieties found in the Drava Valley include Chasselas, Gamay, Kerner, Kraljevina, Muškat Otonel, Portugalka, Ranfol, Rizvanec, Rumeni Muškat, Zeleni Silvanec, Zlahtnina and Zweigelt. Viticulture and winemaking A sparkling wine from Brda In Slovenia, many vineyards are located along slopes or hillsides in terraced rows. Historically vines were trained in a pergola style that optimizes fruit yields. However the emphasis on higher quality wine production has encouraged more vineyards to switch to a Guyot style of vine training. The steep terrain of most vineyards encourages the using of manual harvesting over mechanical. Wines in Slovenia have traditionally follow the Austrian preference of single varietal over blended wines but the production of blended wines are on the rise. While wines were historically aged in large Slovenian or Slavonian wooden cask, the trend has been to use small and varying sizes of French and Slovenian oak barrels. In the Littoral both red and white wines often go through Malolactic fermentation with the Drava Valley and the Sava Valley typically using that technique only for red wine production. In the Littoral, dessert wines are made in a passito style with the Brda region specialize in wines made from Verduc and Pikolit. In the Drava Valley region, botrytized wines are produced from Laški Rizling, Renski Rizling and Šipon and classified in a system similar to the German wine classification based on sweetness-ranging from pozna trgatev (Spätlese), izbor (Auslese), jagodni izbor (Beerenauslese), ledeno vino (Eiswein) and suhi jagodni izbor (Trockenbeerenauslese). Slovenian wine acts stipulate that all wines must be submitted to chemical analysis and tastings prior to being released on the market. After testing the wines are assigned a quality level according to a system similar to the European Union's QWPSR system-Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions. The quality categories are the following: *Table wine () *Country wine with a certified geographic emblem (, ) *Quality wine with protected geographic origin (, ) *Premium quality wine with protected geographic origin (, ) Slovenia wine labels include the sweetness level of the wines ranging from suho (dry), polsuho (medium-dry), polsladko (medium-sweet) and sladko (sweet). The special traditional name (; PTP) designation is applied to a traditional Slovenia wine from a specific region. As of 2009, the PTP wines in Slovenia are the Karst wine Teran from the Slovenian Littoral, the Lower Carniolan wine Cviček, the White Carniolan wines Belokranjec and Metliška Črnina, and both the red and the white Bizeljčan from Bizeljsko-Sremič.

Aenea (; , Aineia) was an ancient Greek city in northwesternmost Chalcidice, said to have been founded by Aeneas, and was situated, according to Livy, opposite Pydna, and 15 miles from Thessalonica. It appears to have stood on the promontory of Megalo Embolo, which forms the northwest corner of the peninsula of Chalcidice, and which, being about 10 geographical miles in direct distance from Thessalonica, may be identified with the promontory Aeneium of Pseudo-Scymnus. Aeneia must therefore have been further north than Pydna. It was colonised by the Corinthians.Scymnus Ch. 627. It is mentioned by Herodotus, and continued to be a place of importance down to the time of the Roman wars in Greece, although we are told that a great part of its population was removed to Thessalonica, when the latter city was founded by Cassander.Herodotus vii. 123; Strabo p. 330; Dionys. i. 49; Lycophron 1236 and Schol.; Virgil Aeneid iii. 16; Stephanus of Byzantium s. v.; Livy xl. 4, xliv. 10, 32; William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 451.)

The album was a top 10 CMJ ADD and reached number 137 on the CMJ college radio charts.Vitriol Independent Promotions /// Charting History Many of the songs featured on the album would remain in the Kudzu Wish repertoire until the end. \\"I Am Robot\\", \\"We've Got Big Hands\\", and \\"Do You need An Anthem?\\" had audiences singing along to the lyrics as though they were written with a mob of voices in mind.YouTube - Kudzu Wish \\"Do You Need An Anthem\\" More touring followed the release of Reverse Hurricane including a tour of the southeast with Army of Ponch, as well as a number of opening slots with the up-and-coming Against Me! In 2004 Kudzu Wish completed a five-week tour of the continental United States. En Route The band's next step was to record an EP entitled En Route with respected producer J. Robbins. The album was released by Ernest Jenning on October 7, 2005 and was released post-humously as a 12\\" EP by Permaculture Records (now Red String Records). 2005 saw Kudzu wish touring up to Canada and back down to Florida with No Idea Records band, Fifth Hour Hero. 2005 also saw the final Kudzu wish show which took place at the Greene Street Club in Greensboro (A reunion concert was held at Two Art Chicks in 2007). In 2006 No Idea Records released the Fest3 DVD which featured a Kudzu Wish performance of their song \\"I Am Rocket,\\" and Series DVD released First in Flight: A North Carolina Retrospective DVD which featured Kudzu Wish performing \\"Do You Need An Anthem?\\" live.

In humans, the PGRMC1 protein is encoded by the PGRMC1 gene. The sole biochemical function of PGRMC1 is heme-binding. PGRMC1 shares key structural motifs with cytochrome b5. PGRMC1 binds and activates P450 proteins, which are important in drug, hormone and lipid metabolism. PGRMC1 also binds to PAIR-BP1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor RNA-binding protein-1). However, its expression outside of the reproductive tract and in males suggests multiple functions for the protein. These may include binding to Insig (insulin-induced gene), which regulates cholesterol synthesis.  Expression  PGRMC1 is highly expressed in the liver and kidney in humans with lower expression in the brain, lung, heart, skeletal muscle and pancreas. In rodents, PGRMC1 is found in the liver, lung, kidney and brain. PGRMC1 is over-expressed in breast tumors and in cancer cell lines from the colon, thyroid, ovary, lung, and cervix. Microarray analyses have detected PGRMC1 expression in colon, lung and breast tumors. PGRMC1 expression is induced by the non-genotoxic carcinogen 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the rat liver, but this induction is specific to males. PGRMC1 is expressed in the ovary and corpus luteum, where its expression is induced by progesterone and during pregnancy, respectively. PGRMC1/25-Dx is expressed in various regions of the brain [hypothalamic area, circumventricular organs, ependymal cells of the lateral ventricles, meninges, including regions known to facilitate lordosis.  Binding to heme and cytochrome P450s  The PGRMC1 yeast homologue, Dap1 (damage associated protein 1), binds heme through a penta-coordinate mechanism. Yeast cells lacking the DAP1 gene are sensitive to DNA damage, and heme-binding is essential for damage resistance. Dap1 is also required for a critical step in cholesterol synthesis in which the P450 protein Erg11/Cyp51 removes a methyl group from lanosterol. Erg11/Cyp51 is the target of the azole antifungal drugs. As a result, yeast cells lacking the DAP1 gene are highly sensitive to antifungal drugs This function is conserved between the unrelated fungi S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Dap1 also regulates the metabolism of iron in yeast. In yeast and humans, PGRMC1 binds directly to P450 proteins, including CYP51A1, CYP3A4, CYP7A1 and CYP21A2. PGRMC1 also activates Cyp21 when the two proteins are co-expressed, indicating that PGRMC1 promotes progesterone turnover. Just as Dap1 is required for the action of Erg11 in the synthesis of ergosterol in yeast, PGRMC1 regulates the Cyp51-catalyzed demethylation step in human cholesterol synthesis. Thus, PGRMC1 and its homologues bind and regulate P450 proteins, and it has been likened to “a helping hand for P450 proteins”.  Roles in signaling and apoptosis  The yeast PGRMC1 homologue is required for resistance to damage. PGRMC1 also promotes survival in human cancer cells after treatment with chemotherapy. In contrast, PGRMC1 promotes cell death in cancer cells after oxidative damage. PGRMC1 alters several known survival signaling proteins, including the Akt protein kinase and the cell death-associated protein IκB. Progesterone inhibits apoptosis in immortalized granulosa cells, and this activity requires PGRMC1 and its binding partner, PAIR-BP1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor RNA-binding protein-1). However, PAIR-BP1 is not a progesterone binding protein, and the component of the PGRMC1 complex that binds to progesterone is unknown. PGRMC1 was originally thought to represent a progesterone receptor of some sort and to bind to progesterone, but subsequently thought has moved towards PGRMC1 acting as a downstream mediator of some other progesterone-binding protein.

Function  Retention of resident soluble proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in animal cells and his-asp-glu-leu (HDEL) in S. cerevisiae. This process is mediated by a receptor that recognizes and binds the tetrapeptide-containing protein and then returns it to the ER. In yeast, the sorting receptor is encoded by a single gene, ERD2, which is a seven-transmembrane protein. Unlike yeast, several human homologs of the ERD2 gene, constituting the KDEL receptor gene family, have been described. The protein encoded by this gene was the first member of the family to be identified, and it encodes a protein structurally and functionally similar to the yeast ERD2 gene product. The KDEL receptor mediates the retrieval of misfolded proteins between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. The KDEL receptor functions by binding to endoplasmic reticulum chaperones. These chaperones are recognized by the KDEL receptor in downstream compartments of the ER. Once bound, they are packaged into coat protein complex I vesicles for retrograde transport to the ER. In vitro studies in yeast have revealed that this receptor regulates membrane transport in the early stages of the secretory pathway from ER to the Golgi. An error or mutation in the KDEL receptor disturbs the ER quality control and diseases associated with ER stress are observed. Dilated cardiomyopathy KDEL receptors have been implicated in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To determine the relationship between KDEL receptor and dilated cardiomyopathy, transgenic mice with a point mutation (D193N) were made. The mice expressing the transport mutant D193N gene grew normally until they reached adulthood. The mutant KDEL receptor did not function after 14 weeks of age, and these mice developed DCM. They were observed to have dilated heart chambers, as well as higher heart-to-body ratios with enlarged hearts, and the cardiac myocytes were larger in size. No difference was observed in arterial blood pressure between wild-type and mutant mice, thus cardiomegaly was not attributed to hypertension. Upon analysis, it was found that KDEL mutant mice had proliferation in their sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and a narrowing in the transverse tubule compared to the wild-type and controls. Moreover, aggregations of degenerative membrane proteins were observed in the expanded SR. This suggests that the mutant KDEL receptor leads to impaired recycling and quality control of the ER, which leads to aggregation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Furthermore, KDEL D193N transgenic mice had defects in the L-type Ca++ channel current in ventricular myocytes. The basal current of these channels was significantly lower than the controls. L-type channels expression was lower in the plasma membrane of the KDEL D193N heart cells due to the narrowing of transverse tubules. BiP, a chaperone protein, was unevenly distributed and synthesized in larger proportion in the transgenic mutant mice, which suggests that there was an increase in concentration of misfolded proteins. They also observed aggregates of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (a degradation system); this suggests that there was saturation of the system due to the high levels of misfolded proteins that lead to impaired ER quality control. The researchers concluded that hyperubiquitination and saturation of the proteasome system results due to the accumulation of misfolded protein, which induces stress. The accumulation of misfolded proteins induced by ER stress has also been observed in human DCM. A murine DCM study found an increase in apoptosis due to the high levels of CHOP expression. CHOP is a transcription factor that is elevated during ER stress and causes apoptosis of cells during the process of an unfolded protein response. Increase pressure load/mechanical stress in KDEL D193N mice caused an even greater synthesis of BiP, CHOP and other proteins that are biomarkers of cellular stress and ER stress as the capacity of the ER to deal with this is very limited. Lymphopenia KDELR1 is also critical for the development of lymphocytes. Mice with a Y158C missense mutation in Kdelr1 have reduced numbers of B and T lymphocytes, and a more susceptible to viral infection.  Interactions  KDELR1 has been shown to interact with ARFGAP1.  Structure  The structure of Gallus gallus KDELR2 (Uniprot Q5ZKX9) has been solved in the Apo state, KDEL peptide-bound state, and bound to a synthetic nanobody. Sequence identity between human KDELR1 and chicken KDELR2 is 84.4%.

Recent evidences on proteasome complex structure confirmed that the protein encoded by gene ADRM1, also known in yeast as 26S Proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn13 (systematic nomenclature for proteasome subunits), is a subunit of 19S proteasome complex.  Gene  The gene ADRM1 encodes one of the non-ATPase subunits of the 19S regulator base, subunit Rpn13. The human PSMD4 gene has 10 exons and locates at chromosome band 20q13.33.The human protein Proteasomal ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 is 42 kDa in size and composed of 407 amino acids. The calculated theoretical pI of this protein is 4.95.  Structure  The protein encoded by this gene is an integral plasma membrane protein which promotes cell adhesion. The encoded protein is thought to undergo O-linked glycosylation. Expression of this gene has been shown to be induced by gamma interferon in some cancer cells. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. = Complex assembly = 26S proteasome complex is usually consisted of a 20S core particle (CP, or 20S proteasome) and one or two 19S regulatory particles (RP, or 19S proteasome) on either one side or both side of the barrel-shaped 20S. The CP and RPs pertain distinct structural characteristics and biological functions. In brief, 20S sub complex presents three types proteolytic activities, including caspase-like, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like activities. These proteolytic active sites located in the inner side of a chamber formed by 4 stacked rings of 20S subunits, preventing random protein-enzyme encounter and uncontrolled protein degradation. The 19S regulatory particles can recognize ubiquitin-labeled protein as degradation substrate, unfold the protein to linear, open the gate of 20S core particle, and guide the substate into the proteolytic chamber. To meet such functional complexity, 19S regulatory particle contains at least 18 constitutive subunits. These subunits can be categorized into two classes based on the ATP dependence of subunits, ATP- dependent subunits and ATP-independent subunits. According to the protein interaction and topological characteristics of this multisubunit complex, the 19S regulatory particle is composed of a base and a lid subcomplex. The base consists of a ring of six AAA ATPases (Subunit Rpt1-6, systematic nomenclature) and four non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn10. Thus, Proteasomal ubiquitin receptor ADRM1 (Rpn13) is an important component of forming the base subcomplex of 19S regulatory particle. Traditional view of Rpn13 is that it is rather an associating partner of proteasome complex than a constitutive subunit. However, emerging evidences suggested that Rpn13 is a novel subunit of 19S. A recent study provided new evidences of 19S complex structure via an integrative approach combining data from cryoelectron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, residue-specific chemical cross-linking, and several proteomics techniques. In the newly established sub complex model of 19S base, Rpn2 is rigid protein located on the side of ATPase ring, supporting as the connection between the lid and base. Rpn1 is conformationally variable, positioned at the periphery of the ATPase ring. The ubiquitin receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 are located further in the distal part of the 19S complex, indicating that they were recruited to the complex late during the assembly process.  Function  As the degradation machinery that is responsible for ~70% of intracellular proteolysis, proteasome complex (26S proteasome) plays a critical roles in maintaining the homeostasis of cellular proteome. Accordingly, misfolded proteins and damaged protein need to be continuously removed to recycle amino acids for new synthesis; in parallel, some key regulatory proteins fulfill their biological functions via selective degradation; furthermore, proteins are digested into peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation. To meet such complicated demands in biological process via spatial and temporal proteolysis, protein substrates have to be recognized, recruited, and eventually hydrolyzed in a well controlled fashion. Thus, 19S regulatory particle pertains a series of important capabilities to address these functional challenges. To recognize protein as designated substrate, 19S complex has subunits that are capable to recognize proteins with a special degradative tag, the ubiquitinylation. It also have subunits that can bind with nucleotides (e.g., ATPs) in order to facilitate the association between 19S and 20S particles, as well as to cause confirmation changes of alpha subunit C-terminals that form the substate entrance of 20S complex. Rpn13 is one essential subunit of 19S regulatory particle and it contributes to the assembly of the \\"base\\" subcomplex. In the base sub complex, Rpn13, as a ubiquitin receptor, offers a docking position for ubiquitinated substrate. Evidence showed that ubiquitination of Rpn13 subunit can significantly reduced the proteasome's ability to bind and degrade ubiquitin- conjugated proteins. Investigation employing biochemical and unbiased AQUA-MS methodologies offered evidences showing that, although the vast majority (if not all) of the double-capped 26S proteasomes, both 19S complexes, contain the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10, only one of these 19S particles contains the additional ubiquitin receptor Rpn13, thereby defining asymmetry in the 26S proteasome. Such structural asymmetry might be the molecular foundation for the one-directional substrate feeding process of proteasome complex.

The former Palace Hotel in the town of Childers, Queensland, Australia, had been converted into a backpacker hostel; it was popular with backpackers who were doing fruit-picking work on farms in the Childers area.Bundaberg Region Robert Paul Long was arrested for lighting the fire and charged with murder (two counts) and arson (one count). He was later sentenced to life in prison.  Incident  Prior to the arson, two guests saw the arsonist Robert Long in the back yard of the hostel. Long had asked them to leave the door open so he could bash (beat up) his former roommate; when they declined, he stated he still had a key. Long had previously been evicted from the hostel. The fire was started at about 1 am, in the downstairs recreation room. A guest recounted how he had woken up during the night around 12:30 to find Long standing by a burning trashcan. After he extinguished it, the guest went back to bed, but awakened again about an hour later to banging sounds, shouting, and black smoke. A survivor recounted how he and his girlfriend went from door to door through their floor of the hostel, crawling on the floor and banging on doors in an attempt to awaken and rescue as many individuals as they could. The Palace Backpackers Hostel, a 100-year-old, two-story timber building, did not have working smoke detectors or fire alarms. It was later reported that the owner had installed fire alarms in the building, but they had been disabled weeks prior to the fire due to the systems malfunctioning. A survivor told reporters he read the fire notes on the wall, which showed the best escape route, and could barely make it 10 yards to a balcony. Local firefighters raised a ladder to allow some people to escape. Firefighters spent four hours battling the fire before it was fully extinguished. = Victims = The mayor of Childers, Bill Trevor, told reporters that the hostel was not razed to the ground, and that victims either got out alive or did not get out at all. The 70 backpackers who survived the fire were temporarily housed locally at the Isis Cultural Centre. Of those, 10 suffered minor injuries as they tried to escape from the upper level by jumping onto the roofs of neighbouring buildings. Most of the backpackers who died were on the second floor of the hostel. Through an inquest, it was found that in one of the rooms where 10 of the deceased victims were found, a bunk bed blocked an exit door and the windows were barred. Identification of the deceased was hampered due to an incomplete hostel register that recorded check-ins but not departures, and because most of the residents' passports were destroyed or damaged by the fire. Of the fifteen individuals who died in the fire, seven were British (including two Welsh); three were Australian; two were from the Netherlands; and one each from Ireland, Japan, and South Korea.  Perpetrator  Robert Paul Long, a fruit picker who had expressed a hatred of backpackers, had earlier threatened to burn down the hostel. After his eviction from the hostel due to rent arrears, Long allegedly told an English couple staying at the hostel they should leave their windows and doors open, as he was planning arson. Long was arrested in bush-land less than from Childers five days later. During the arrest he slashed a police dog and stabbed one of the officers on the chin. The second officer shot Long in the arm. In March 2002, Long was found guilty of two charges of murder and arson and sentenced to life in prison. Although fifteen individuals died in the fire, Long had only been charged with two deaths in order to expedite the proceedings and to allow for other charges to be brought in the event of an acquittal. He lodged an appeal in 2002, which was denied; in June 2020 he became eligible for parole. Aftermath Immediately after the fire, residents of Childers knitted blankets and donated food and backpacks for the survivors. A picnic bench in front of the building became a shrine to the deceased, with flowers, notes, and fruit from the local farms; 20 of the survivors held an impromptu memorial service with a local Roman Catholic priest at the shrine. Anne, Princess Royal visited Childers on 2 July, just a week after the blaze, to meet the surviving backpackers and others involved in the disaster. Bill Trevor, the Isis Shire Mayor, travelled to England and the Netherlands in October 2001 to consult the bereaved families about the memorial proposals. He negotiated to rebuild the Palace in its original early 1900s style and the building was restored and turned into a memorial for those affected by the fire. Some 250 invited guests, including many members of the families of the dead from around the world, attended the official opening on 26 October 2002.

Cathepsin Z has been reported involved in cancer malignancy and inflammation. Structure =Gene= The CTSZ gene is located at 20q13.32 on chromosome 20, consisting of 6 exons. At least two transcript variants of this gene have been found, but the full- length nature of only one of them has been determined. =Protein= Cathepsin Z is characterized by an unusual and unique 3-amino acid insertion in the highly conserved region between the glutamine of the putative oxynion hole and the active site cysteine. The pro-region of cathepsin Z shares no significant similarity with other cathepsin family sequences. It contains only 41 amino acid residues without the conserved motif of ERFNIN or GNFD found in other cysteine proteinases. Besides, the proregion sequence contains no lysine residue.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase and member of the peptidase C1 family. It exhibits both carboxy-monopeptidase and carboxy-dipeptidase activities. Up to date, eleven human cysteine proteinases have been identified, including cathepsin B, cathepsin C, cathepsin G, cathepsin H, cathepsin K, cathepsin L, cathepsin L2 or V, cathepsin O, cathepsin S, cathepsin Z, and cathepsin W. These cysteine proteinases belong to the papain family and represent a major component of the lysosomal proteolytic system. In addition to playing a critical role in protein degradation and turnover, these proteinases appear to play an extracellular role in a number of normal and pathological conditions. The human cathepsin Z contains distinctive features from other human cysteine proteases. It is an exopeptidase with strict carboxypeptidase activity, while most other cathepsins are endopeptidases. Cathepsin Z has an exposed integrin- binding Arg-Gly-Asp motif within the propeptide of the enzyme, through which cathepsin Z has been shown to interact with several integrins during normal homeostasis, immune processes and cancer. It is also shown to bind cell surface heparin sulphate proteoglycans, indicating possible functions in cellular adhesion and phagocytosis.  Clinical significance  This gene is expressed ubiquitously in cancer cell lines and primary tumors and, like other members of this family, may be involved in tumorigenesis. For instance, cathepsin Z promotes invasion and migration via a noncatalytic mechanism, suggesting multiple modes of cell invasion may be involved in cancer malignancy. Cathepsin Z is also reported to have a protective, but not proteolytic, function in inflammatory gastric disease. It is reported in another study that cathepsin Z may be responsible for dopamine neuron death and thus involved in the pathogenic cascade event. Single-nucleotide polymorphism in CTSZ is found associated with tuberculosis susceptibility, indicating that the pathways involving this protein could yield novel therapies for tuberculosis.  Interactions  Cathepsin Z has been shown to interact with the following proteins: CEP55, FBXO6, KIFC1, KRT40, KRTAP5-9, KRTAP5-9, LYPLAL1, MID2, MSN, MTUS2, NOTCH2NL, PLK2, PLSCR1, SGOL2, and SPRED2. Cathepsin Z has also been found to interact with: * Integrin, * PRLP0, and * γ-Enolase.

Function Fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 (FACL4), the protein encoded by the ACSL4 gene, is an acyl-CoA synthetase, which is an essential class of lipid metabolism enzymes, and ACSL4 is distinguished by its preference for arachidonic acid. The enzyme controls the level of this fatty acid in cells; because AA is known to induce apoptosis (cell specific), the enzyme modulates apoptosis. Overexpression of ACSL4 results in a higher rate of arachidonoyl-CoA synthesis, increased 20:4 incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and triacylglycerol, and reduced cellular levels of unesterified 20:4. Additionally, ACSL4 regulates PGE₂ release from human smooth muscle cells. ACSL4 may regulate a number of processes dependent on the release of arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators in the arterial wall. Clinical significance The most common SNP (C to T substitution) in the first intron of the FACL4 gene is associated with altered FA composition of plasma phosphatidylcholines in patients with Metabolic Syndrome. It has been implicated in many mechanisms of carcinogenesis and neuronal development. =Cancer= In breast cancer, ACSL4 can serve as both a biomarker for and mediator of an aggressive breast cancer phenotype. ACSL4 also is positively correlated with a unique subtype of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by the absence of androgen receptor (AR) and therefore referred to as quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC). The encoded protein FACL4 also plays a role in the growth of hepatic cancer cells. Inhibiting FACL4 leads to inhibition of human liver tumor cells, as marked by an increased level of apoptosis. It has also been suggested that modulation of FACL4 expression/activity is an approach for treatment of hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC). The FACL4 pathway is also important in colon carcinogenesis; the development of selective inhibitors for FACL4 may be a worthy effort in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer. FACL4 up-regulation appears to occur during the transformation from the cancer from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Additionally, some colon tumor promoters significantly induced FACL4 expression. =Neuronal development= FACL4 was the gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental retardation and fatty-acid metabolism. Since the ASCL4 gene is highly expressed in brain, where it encodes a brain specific isoform, a FACL4 mutation may be an efficient diagnostic tool in mentally retarded males. FACL4was discovered to bedeleted in a family with Alport syndrome and elliptocytosis. Interactions ACSL4 expression is regulated by SHP2 activity. Additionally, ACSL4 interacts with ACSL3, APP, DSE, ELAVL1, HECW2, MINOS1, PARK2, SPG20, SUMO2, TP53, TUBGCP3, UBC, UBD, and YWHAQ.

Function  This gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV). It encodes a fusion protein consisting of the ubiquitin-like protein fubi at the N-terminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C-terminus. It has been proposed that the fusion protein is post-translationally processed to generate free fubi and free ribosomal protein S30. Fubi is a member of the ubiquitin family, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S30E family of ribosomal proteins. Whereas the function of fubi is currently unknown, ribosomal protein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome. Pseudogenes derived from this gene are present in the genome. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribosomal proteins S27a and L40 are synthesized as fusion proteins with ubiquitin.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. This protein functions as a signal transducer for a wide variety of signaling pathways, including those promoting neural and bone formation as well as tumor growth. The MRAS gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The MRAS gene resides on chromosome 3 at the band 3q22.3 and includes 10 exons. This gene produces 2 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = M-Ras is a member of the small GTPase superfamily under the Ras family, which also includes Rap1, Rap2, R-Ras, and R-Ras2 (TC21). This protein spans a length of 209 residues. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence shares 60-75% identity with that in the Ras protein while its effector region is identical with that in Ras. M-Ras shares a similar structure with H-Ras and Rap2A with the exception of its switch 1 conformation when bound to guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). Of the two states M-Ras can switch between, M-Ras is predominantly found in its state 1 conformation, which does not bind Ras effectors.  Function  The MRAS gene is expressed specifically in brain, heart, myoblasts, myotubes, fibroblasts, skeletal muscles, and uterus, suggesting a specific role of M-Ras in these tissue and cells. M-Ras is involved in many biological processes by activating a wide variety of proteins. For instance, it is activated by Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors and can bind/activate some Ras protein effectors. M-Ras also weakly stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and ERK2 activity, but modestly stimulates trans-activation from different nuclear response elements which bind transcription factors, such as SRF, ETS/TCF, Jun/Fos, and NF- kB/Rel. M-Ras has been found to induce Akt kinase activity in the PI3-K pathway, and it may play a role in cell survival of neural-derived cells. Moreover, M-Ras plays a crucial role in the downregulation of OCT4 and NANOG protein levels upon differentiation and has been demonstrated to modulate cell fate at early steps of development during neurogenesis. M-Ras, induced and activated by BMP-2 signaling, also participates in the osteoblastic determination, differentiation, and transdifferentiation under p38 MAPK and JNK regulation. M-Ras is involved in TNF-alpha-stimulated and Rap1-mediated LFA-1 activation in splenocytes. More generally, cells transfected with M-Ras exhibit dendritic appearances with microspikes, suggesting that M-Ras may participate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, it is reported that M-Ras forms a complex with SCRIB and SHOC2, a polarity protein with tumor suppressor properties, and may play a key role in tumorigenic growth.  Clinical significance  In humans, other members of the Ras subfamilies carry mutations in human cancers. Furthermore, the Ras proteins are not only involved in tumorigenesis but also in many developmental disorders. For instance, the Ras-related proteins appear to be overexpressed in human carcinomas of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, skin, and breast, as well as in lymphomas. More currently, Ras family members such as R-RAS, R-RAS2 and also R-RAS3 have also been implicated as main factors in triggering neural transformation, with R-RAS2 as the most significant element. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the MRAS gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incidence and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

It is the first and so far only internationally distributed WLCG Tier1 center, providing computing and storage services to experiments at CERN.  History  Nordic Data Grid Facility traces its history back to end-2001, being intrinsically related to the NorduGrid project. Success of the latter indicated need for a larger pan- Nordic facility, with storage resources being of high priority. This need has been addressed by establishing a pilot NDGF infrastructure, which was operational in 2002-2005, and provided distributed storage in addition to the NorduGrid computing resources. During this phase, NDGF committed to provide a Nordic Tier1 (regional computing center) for the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid project at CERN. Specifics of this Tier1 are such that it has to be an internationally distributed Facility. The Nordic Data Grid Facility in its present function as a provider of the Nordic Grid Infrastructure was established in April 2006 by the Nordic Research Councils. It came into operation on June 1, 2006, and its initial priority is to live up to the original commitment of establishing the Nordic Tier1, with the traditional focus on storage facilities. NDGF team includes software experts who take part in various Grid middleware development. In 2012 NDGF became a part of a wider initiative, the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration.  Users and operations  NDGF Tier1 is a production Grid facility that leverages existing, national computational resources and Grid infrastructures. To qualify for support research groups should form a Virtual Organization, a VO. The VO provides compute resources for sharing and NDGF Tier1 operates a Grid interface for the sharing of these resources. Currently, most computational resources of NDGF Tier1 are accessible through ARC middleware. Some resources are also available via AliEn software. Distributed storage facility is realised through dCache storage management solution. Today, the dominant user community of the NDGF Tier1 is the High Energy Physics - the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS Virtual Organizations - through the operation of the Nordic Tier1, which together with the Tier0, CERN, and the other 12 Tier1s collects, stores and processes the data produced by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Since 2010, NDGF Tier1 is a part of the European Grid Infrastructure. NDGF Tier1 was hosted by NORDUnet in 2006-2011, and since 2012 is hosted by NordForsk.  NDGF vs NorduGrid  Many confuse NDGF and NorduGrid - which is not surprising, especially since in its second phase NDGF was proposed to assume the name \\"NorduGrid\\". It was however decided to distinguish between the mostly development-oriented project, NorduGrid, and the mostly operations-oriented one, NDGF. As a rule of thumb, NDGF provides mostly services, while NorduGrid provides mostly ARC middleware.

In 2001, the owner of the property, Lend Lease Prime Property Fund, brought in Simon Property Group as half-owner and manager of the property. =2000s= Due to the merger of May Department Stores and Federated Department Stores in 2006, Robinsons-May shuttered their store in March of that year, and the location was replaced by San Diego's first Bloomingdale's on November 18, 2006. =2010s= Due to underperformance, Saks Fifth Avenue closed its Fashion Valley location on July 17, 2010. The space was replaced with and still houses a Forever 21. In 2019 Simon Malls announced another renovation, to add public spaces, landscaping, a broader selection of dining, outdoor \\"lounges\\" and water features. Mexican customer base Fashion Valley is one of many shopping centers in the San Diego area which has customers from both Tijuana (a city of more than 2 million bordering the City of San Diego, 20 miles to the south of Fashion Valley), and visitors from the interior of Mexico (such as Mexico City), as an important part of its customer base. In 1977, 10% of transactions were with Mexican nationals. In 2019 Simon Malls again reiterated the importance of its customers visiting from Mexico. Legal issues Fashion Valley Mall was involved in a legal case involving the quasi-public nature of some private property. The printers union wanted to distribute leaflets in the mall encouraging patrons to boycott Robinsons-May, because Robinsons-May was an advertiser in the San Diego newspaper with which the printers union was negotiating. The court held that this activity was protected and allowed on the property, even though the action was contrary to the business interests of the targeted tenant.Fashion Valley Mall, LLC v. NLRB, 172 P. 3d 742 - Cal: Supreme Court 2007 The decision is based on article 1 section 2 of the California Constitution.

She appeared in three films during the 1970s. Two of them were directed by Monte Hellman. She was romantically involved with Hellman and Art Garfunkel, committing suicide in the latter's apartment by taking an overdose of Valium. Bird inspired one of Tim Kinsella's novels. Early life Bird's mother died when she was three. Her father was an electrical engineer. She had two elder brothers. Her strict father restricted her social life and she fled home multiple times. In response, her father had an arrest warrant issued in her name and she was put in an institution for neglected girls. She attended Jamaica High School until she was 15. Career Described by Hollywood columnist Dick Kleiner as \\"look[ing] like an innocent Hayley Mills,\\" Bird appeared in just three films: Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), Cockfighter (1974), and a small role as girlfriend to Paul Simon's character in the romantic comedy Annie Hall (1977), from Woody Allen. While researching for Two-Lane Blacktop, screenwriter Rudolph Wurlitzer met her and recommended her name to Hellman while he was looking for actresses for the same movie. In Two- Lane Blacktop she played a hitchhiker to whom the film's characters are initially attracted, but after they lose a race she joins another driver. Her second release, Cockfighter, had her paired opposite Warren Oates. He loses her in a bet. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Film critic Michael Atkinson wrote in his book Exile Hollywood (2008) \\"In two films, she made more of an impression, left more of a synaesthetic presence, than many actors do in a career\\". Bird was the still photographer on Cockfighter and shot the cover photo for Art Garfunkel's 1977 album Watermark. Personal life She was romantically involved with her Blacktop and Cockfighter director Monte Hellman. From 1974 until her death in 1979, Bird was in a serious romantic relationship with Art Garfunkel. Suicide In 1979, Bird died by suicide by taking an overdose of Valium in the apartment she shared with Garfunkel in New York, who was deeply affected by her death. Garfunkel said, \\"She was beautiful, in a lonesome, haunted way, and I adored her. But I wasn't ready for marriage and she was not very comfortable being Laurie. She wasn't happy with herself. Her mother died by suicide at 26, and so did she.\\" Legacy Bird's relationship with Garfunkel was referred to in the liner notes of the latter's 1988 album Lefty and his collection of prose poems Still Water. Hellman dedicated his 2010 film Road to Nowhere to Laurie Bird. Tim Kinsella's novel Let Go and Go On and On (2014) is subtitled Based on the roles of Laurie Bird. In the foreword, he writes, \\"This book by no means intends to convey any truth beyond one possible solution to the puzzles of her life and work.\\" Credits { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Title !scope=\\"col\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" Role !scope=\\"col\\" Director(s) !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Notes !scope=col class=\\"unsortable\\"  - !scope=rowTwo-Lane Blacktop 1971 The Girl  also uncredited performer: \\"Stealin'\\", \\"Satisfaction\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=rowCockfighter 1974 Dody White  Also credited as still photographer style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=rowAnnie Hall 1977 Tony Lacey's Girlfriend  Credited as Lauri Bird style=\\"text-align:center;\\" } References Bibliography * * External links  Category:1953 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Glen Cove, New York Category:20th-century American actresses Category:American women photographers Category:20th-century American women artists Category:American film actresses Category:Suicides in New York City Category:Drug-related suicides in New York (state) Category:American actresses who committed suicide Category:Burials at Flushing Cemetery Category:20th-century women photographers ","title":"Laurie Bird"},{"id":"14873897","text":"Nim's Island is a 2008 adventure film written and directed by Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin, and based on the children's story of the same name by Wendy Orr. A young girl alone on a remote island seeks help from an agoraphobic San Franciscan author. While the author attempts to overcome her agoraphobia to search of her, Nim tries to overcome her fear of losing her father. It stars Abigail Breslin, Jodie Foster, and Gerard Butler, and was released on 4 April 2008 by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $100.1 million on a $37 million budget. Plot 11-year-old Nim (Abigail Breslin) lives with her widower marine biologist father Jack Rusoe (Gerard Butler) on a South Pacific island. Jack has told Nim that her mother Emily died when she was swallowed by a blue whale after it was scared by a ship called The Buccaneer. Nim has several native animals for company: Selkie the sea lion, Fred the bearded dragon, Chica the sea turtle, and Galileo the pelican. Jack takes the boat for a two-day scientific mission to find Protozoa nim, a new species of plankton he has named after his daughter. He wants to take Nim along but she convinces him that she can manage on her own and needs to stay to oversee the imminent hatching of Chica's eggs. They will be able to communicate by satellite phone. Nim is fond of \\"Alex Rover\\" adventure books written by Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster). Nim receives an email addressed to her father from \\"Alex Rover\\" enquiring about Jack's field of knowledge. She imagines it to be from the explorer but is actually from the author. The author, in turn, is a neurotic agoraphobe who likes to imagine she is speaking to her fictional hero Alex Rover (also portrayed by Butler). An email conversation follows. Jack suffers a shipwreck in a cyclone and cannot return on the planned day, nor communicate with Nim. Galileo brings Jack things he needs to fix his ship as sharks begin to circle. Nim tells Alex her father has not returned as planned but Alex feels powerless to help, given that she can hardly even open her own door. The island is visited by uncouth tourists whom Nim believes to be pirates, since the name of their cruise liner is The Buccaneer. She attempts to make the island unattractive to them by catapulting lizards to shore, and by making a fire in the crater of the volcano and rolling boulders down the slopes to make it appear to be erupting. In so doing she inadvertently triggers an actual eruption. The tourists scramble for the boats. One of them, a boy, Edmund, sees and catches up with Nim. He is confused by her presence and she tells him she lives on the island. He tells the others, but they do not believe him. Meanwhile, Alexandra overcomes her agoraphobia to travel to the island to rescue Nim. Nim, expecting \\"Alex\\" (the fictional male character), at first rejects Alexandra, but later relents and they share a meal. The next day, Nim starts to cry, reasoning that her ever-successful father would be back by then if he were still alive. Fortunately, Jack reaches the island windsurfing on a makeshift catamaran. Jack and Alex meet and begin to get to know each other (Alex amazed at Jack being identical to how she pictured her fictional character). The film ends with them all playing on the beach using a coconut as a ball.

This gene encodes a protein that contains a MIT (Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking molecule) domain. This protein may be involved in endosomal trafficking, microtubule dynamics, or both functions. Spartin loss has been associated to mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired complex I activity and altered pyruvate metabolism. Frameshift mutations associated with this gene cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 20 (Troyer syndrome). Troyer syndrome (SPG20) is a complicated type of hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs). HSP is a category of neurological disorder characterized by spasticity and muscle weakness in the lower limbs. Background The original description of this gene mutation and associated symptoms were described in 1967. This mutation is commonly found in high frequency with the Amish population. Newer studies have found that the mutation is not isolated to the Amish population, but also resides in the Omani population. Presentation This syndrome is not only characterized by spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs, but also with dysarthria, mental retardation or mild developmental delay, and muscle wasting or muscle atrophy. =Physical= Individuals appear to have difficulty walking, and report a clumsy, spastic gait which worsens over time. Some additional common physical features include overgrowth of the jaw bone, hammer toes, hand and feet abnormalities, and pes cavus. =Cognitive= Cognitive challenges, including developmental delay and difficulty with performance in school, may affect individuals with this syndrome. =Neurologic= Neurologic examination of individuals with this mutation may show dysmetria in the upper extremities, hyperreflexia, distal amyotrophy and ankle clonus, in addition to spasticity, weakness and dysarthria. =Diagnostic Imaging= The cerebellar vermis may present with mild atrophy and a loss of white matter volume. =Through Lifespan= Facial dysmorphism and subtle skeletal features are common in younger children. The condition progressively worsens, as spasticity and distal amyotrophy symptoms are revealed more in teenage years. SPG20 expression in the adult is relatively modest, however it is widespread in the nervous system. Longitudinal comparison of magnetic resonance imaging concluded that there was a progression of the syndrome; thus, the condition appears to worsen over time.

The Miller was built by architect Roy A. Benjamin utilizing the Arte Moderne style of architecture and was owned by Frank Miller. Due to an economic downturn in the 1980s in downtown Augusta, the theater was forced to close. It sat dormant until 2005 when it was purchased by local Augusta businessman and entrepreneur Peter S. Knox IV. The first action taken after the purchase of the theater was to repair the roof to stop further damage to the structure. The theater reopened on January 6, 2018 to a sold out gala featuring Sutton Foster performing with Augusta Symphony Orchestra (Augusta, Georgia). History For more than 20 years, the name Frank J. Miller was synonymous with entertainment in Augusta, GA. Through his company Augusta Amusements, he and his partners operated five downtown theaters and the brightest star in that constellation was the Miller. In 1938, Jacksonville-based architect Roy Benjamin was commissioned to design a theater large enough to accommodate the city's growing audiences. The result was a beautiful Art Moderne-style building that featured Italian marble terrazzo, black walnut millwork and a performance stage framed by fluted columns and hand-painted panels. Named after its founder, the Miller Theater seated over 1600 patrons and was the second- largest theater in Georgia, behind only Atlanta's Fox Theatre (Atlanta). The Miller opened in February 1940 with a sold-out performance of “A Night at the Moulin Rouge”, beginning what would be a 40-year run as one of Augusta's premier entertainment destinations. Hundreds of movies, musical acts and other memorable events found an audience at the Miller Theater. The theater closed in 1984, falling into disrepair until 2005, when Augusta businessman and philanthropist Peter Knox IV bought it with the goal of preservation. After installing a new roof and an updated ventilation system and removing water- damaged carpets and fixtures, Mr. Knox began considering what would be best for the theater and community moving forward. In 2008, Mr. Knox offered the Miller Theater to the Augusta Symphony as a performing venue and home and, after extensive feasibility studies, the Symphony Board of Directors accepted his generous offer. A capital campaign was launched, and in June 2016, thanks to the generosity of the community and many foundations, coupled with SPLOST funds and federal and state historic preservation tax credits, enough funding was in place to break ground. The renovation project, which has spanned more than seven years and cost nearly $25 million, is a testament to the volunteers and donors who believed there was real worth in not only preserving an important piece of Augusta history, but also providing its symphony orchestra a permanent home and the community a state-of-the-art venue designed with a variety of artists and stage performances in mind.

The piece contains two movements, \\"Ludus\\" and \\"Silentium,\\" and is a double concerto for two solo violins, prepared piano, and chamber orchestra.  History  In 1968, Arvo Pärt fell publicly silent and entered a period of “artistic reorientation.” During this period, he developed his tintinnabuli style of composition, which pairs two voices, one playing the notes of a scale (Melodic Voice), and the other playing notes of a triad (Tintinnabuli Voice). Pärt emerged from this period of innovation in 1976, and composed many of his most well known works, including Fratres, Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten, and Summa, all written in the tintinnabuli style. Tabula Rasa is one of these earliest tintinnabuli pieces, and holds the distinction of being one of the first compositions of Pärt's to reach Western listeners outside of Estonia and the Soviet States. =Composition and première= Tabula Rasa was composed at the request of Eri Klas, a friend and conductor, who asked Pärt to write a piece to accompany Alfred Schnittke’s Concerto Grosso, which was scored for two violins, prepared piano, harpsichord, and string chamber ensemble, for an upcoming concert. The piece is dedicated to violinist Gidon Kremer. Kremer premièred the piece in Tallinn, Estonia, on 30 September 1977, with Tatjana Grindenko, on solo second violin, Alfred Schnittke on the prepared piano, and the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Eri Klas. = Editions = Pärt released two versions of Tabula Rasa in 1977. The first is scored for two solo violins, prepared piano, and string chamber orchestra. The second is scored for solo violin and solo viola, prepared piano, and string chamber orchestra. = Recording = In 1984, ECM Records, under the direction of Manfred Eicher, released their first recording of Pärt's music, entitled \\"Tabula Rasa\\", which featured performers Gidon Kremer, Tatjana Grindenko, Alfred Schnittke, with the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Saulius Sondeckis. This recording was the first of Pärt’s long collaboration with Eicher and ECM. Another excellent recording is on the EMI Eminence label. Tasmin Little is the soloist with Martin Roscoe (piano) and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta conducted by Richard Studt who also plays the second violin.  Instrumentation  Tabula Rasa is scored for two solo violins (or one solo violin and one viola), prepared piano, and string chamber orchestra (Violin I and II, Viola, Cello, Contrabass). The score indicates the notes to be prepared on the piano, and states, \\"Das Klavier soll nach Möglichkeit elektrisch verstärkt werden,\\" which translates to, \\"The piano should be amplified if possible.\\"  Form  = Ludus = The first movement of Tabula Rasa is entitled \\"Ludus,\\" which means \\"game\\" in Latin. The movement contains alternating moments of silence and expanding canon variations, a cadenza, and a final meno mosso. The movement begins with the two solo violins playing a ff octave \\"A,\\" followed by an eight beat grand pause (G.P.). This octave highlights the large four-octave pitch range on the violin, with violin II playing A3, and violin I playing A7. The string orchestra enters in pairs after the G.P. in the first \\"variation\\" on the pitch, \\"A.\\" Pärt phases in each of the string instruments in pairs, violin I in two parts, violin II and viola, cello and contrabass. The pairs enter from highest to lowest pitch range every half measure, beginning with the first violins. Pärt divides each pair into a melodic and tintinnabuli voice. The melodic voice plays the notes of the A minor scale, and the tintinnabuli voice plays the notes of the A minor triad. When the cello and contrabass finish their melodic figure, the contrabass continues playing a pedal note \\"A,\\" until in mm. 6, when the pattern reverses, and again the instrument sections are phased in, displaced by a half measure, but this time beginning with the lowest instrument pair (cello and contrabass). The string orchestra’s phasing pattern is reflected in the solo violin parts. When the orchestra is phasing in each part from highest pitch range to lowest, the solo violin plays an eighth note melody, when the solo bass line is played, the solo parts switch and play triplets, and when the chamber orchestra reverses the pattern and phase in again from the lowest pitch range to highest, the solo violin line plays sixteenth notes. After the chamber orchestra finishes, one of the solo violins and the prepared piano play together, followed by a grand pause of seven beats. Pärt takes this variation pattern and expands upon it eight times, each time lengthening the melodic figure in the string orchestra parts by two beats. The variations increase in length from 8 measures, to 13, 17, 22, 26, 31 and 35, before the final variation. While the variations increase in length, Pärt also adds a new pitch or pitches to each variation until all the pitches in the A minor scale are represented in the fourth variation. The variations become increasingly close together as Pärt decreases the length of the G.P. after each variation by one beat. In variation eight, Pärt does not leave any silence, and instead writes a cadenza for all of the instruments. In the cadenza, the solo violins and prepared piano play ff arppegiated chords, while the string orchestra sections play a three-octave descending scale, beginning on “E.” The cadenza lasts 22 measures, until the piano plays the first accidental of the movement, F-sharp, signaling the beginning of the final section, meno mosso. The meno mosso is divided into two-bar phrases. The string orchestra plays a divided chord in steady quarter notes, while the solo violins arpeggiate notes of the chord in sixteenth notes above. Each time the key changes in the orchestra, the piano punctuates the texture with an A minor chord in both hands. The meno mosso works its way back to the key of A minor through several chords, beginning with a diminished F-sharp minor chord. When the soloists and orchestra finally reach the A minor chord, the soloists play the opening ff “A” octave, followed by four measures of silence in which the chamber orchestra plays a triple forte A minor chord. = Silentium = The second movement of Tabula Rasa, “Silentium,” or silence, is composed in the key of D minor, giving the impression of a V-I cadence in relation to \\"Ludus\\" in A minor. The movement begins with an arpeggiated D minor second inversion chord, played by the prepared piano. “Silentium” expands as a mensuration canon. Pärt divides the instruments into three sections; solo violins, violin I and violin II, and viola and cello. Each pair, divided into melodic and tintinnabuli voices, begin on a central pitch, and move at a different rhythmic speeds. Pärt expands the music by adding one pitch above and below the central pitch of each pair in each successive section. Every time the solo violins reach their central pitch, “D,” the piano again plays a D minor chord and the contrabass plays an octave “D.” Once each of the sections reach their expanded octave range, they fade out of the texture. The solo violins, moving at the slowest rhythmic speed, reach their octave span in measure 130, and then begin a downward descent of a D minor four-octave scale. As the violins move down the scale, the lower voices return to the texture and assist in the downward motion, until the violins finish their scale, leaving solo viola, solo cello, and solo bass to continue the scale in their low register. The viola and the cello finish the scale, leaving only the contrabass, which continues to play until reaching “E,” or the second scale degree of the D minor scale. Pärt omits the final “D” of the scale, leaving the listener with four written bars of silence in which to resolve the piece. Reception and influence =Notable performances= The first performance of Tabula Rasa in Tallinn 1977 was considered to be a major success. The composer Erkki-Sven Tüür, said about the performance: \\"I was carried beyond. I had the feeling that eternity was touching me through this music...nobody wanted to start clapping.\\" = Recording = In 1984, Arvo Pärt began his longtime collaboration with ECM and Manfred Eicher. “Tabula Rasa” was the title of the first ECM recording of Pärt’s music released in 1984. The CD included Fratres (for violin and piano), Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten, Fratres (for twelve celli), and Tabula Rasa. The liner notes for “Tabula Rasa,” written by Wolfgang Sandler, set the tone for Pärt’s marketing as a “holy minimalist.” The photographs of Pärt depict him as an icon-like figure, reflecting his Orthodox Christian beliefs and influences. The simplicity and minimal design of the packaging set the tone for all subsequent releases of Pärt’s music with ECM. =Palliative care= In an article in The New Yorker in December 2002, music critic Alex Ross discussed the use of Tabula Rasa in palliative care for AIDS and cancer patients facing the end of their disease. Caretakers working with the AIDS patients would often be asked to play the \\"angel music,\\" which was the dying patients’ name for the second movement of Tabula Rasa, \\"Silentium.\\"  References  * Pärt, Arvo. “Tabula Rasa”.

The IQCODE is used as a screening test for dementia. If the person is found to have significant cognitive decline, then this needs to be followed up with a medical examination to determine whether dementia is present.  Rationale behind the IQCODE  Most screening tests for dementia involve a brief list of questions to directly assess cognitive functioning. Probably the best-known dementia screening test of this kind is the Mini- Mental State Examination. A disadvantage of such tests is that they are affected by the person's level of education, familiarity with the dominant language and culture in their country, and level of intelligence before the onset of dementia.Jorm, A.F. (1996). Assessment of cognitive impairment and dementia using informant reports. Clinical Psychology Review, 16, 51-73. Because of this, cognitive screening tests can falsely indicate dementia in people with lower education, culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and lower intelligence. Cognitive screening tests may also have the opposite problem, falsely indicating that a person does not have dementia, especially if that person had a higher level of education or intelligence originally. The IQCODE attempts to overcome this problem by assessing change from earlier in life, rather than the person's current level of functioning. It does this by making use of the informant's knowledge of both the person's earlier and current cognitive functioning.  Content  The IQCODE lists 26 everyday situations where a person has to use their memory or intelligence.Jorm, A.F. & Jacomb, P.A. (1989). The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): Socio-demographic correlates, reliability, validity and some norms. Psychological Medicine, 19, 1015-1022. Examples of such situations include: “Remembering where to find things which have been put in a different place from usual” and “Handling money for shopping”. Each situation is rated by the informant for amount of change over the previous 10 years, using the following scale: 1. Much improved, 2. A bit improved, 3. Not much change, 4. A bit worse, 5. Much worse.  Scoring  The IQCODE is generally scored by averaging the ratings across the 26 situations. A person who has no cognitive decline will have an average score of 3, while scores of greater than 3 indicate that some decline has occurred. However, some users of the IQCODE have scored it by summing the scores to give a range from 26 to 130.Jorm, A.F. (2004). The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): A review. International Psychogeriatrics, 16, 1-19. Various cutoff scores have been used to distinguish dementia from normality. In community samples, cutoff scores for likely dementia have ranged from 3.3 and above to 3.6 and above, while in patient samples the cutoff scores have ranged from 3.4 and above to 4.0 and above. To improve the detection of dementia, the IQCODE can be used in combination with the Mini- Mental State Examination. A graphical method of combining the two tests has been developed and is known as the Demegraph.Mackinnon, A. & Mulligan, R. (1998). Combining cognitive testing and informant report to increase accuracy in screening for dementia. American Journal of Psychiatry, 155, 1529-1535.  Validity of the IQCODE  The IQCODE has been found to distinguish people who have or do not have dementia. A low score on the IQCODE in a person who does not currently have dementia has also been found to predict that they will develop dementia in the future. The IQCODE has found to correlate highly with conventional dementia screening tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, and to have moderate correlations with a range of neuropsychological tests. It has also been found to correlate with change in cognitive test scores over time. The IQCODE has near-zero correlations with a person's level of education or with their intelligence earlier in life. This is in contrast to conventional dementia screening tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination, which are affected by education and intelligence as well as the presence of dementia.  Other versions of the IQCODE  The original IQCODE has 26 items. A Short IQCODE has been developed, consisting of the 16 items, and has been found to be as valid as the full version.Jorm, A. F. (1994). A short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): Development and cross-validation. Psychological Medicine, 24, 145-153. Because it is briefer and of equal validity, the Short IQCODE can generally be used in preference to the original version. Because the IQCODE does not require the involvement of the person being assessed, it can be used to assess probable dementia in someone who is unable to be assessed because they have had a stroke, developed delirium or have died. A Retrospective IQCODE has been developed for this purpose. The IQCODE has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Canadian French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.

Tight junctions form continuous seals around cells and serve as a physical barrier to prevent solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular space. These junctions are composed of sets of continuous networking protein strands in the outer surface of the cell membrane, with complementary grooves in the inwardly facing extracytoplasmic leaflet. The CLDN14 protein also binds to particular part of a protein called Yes- associated protein, known as its WW domain. Defects in CLDN14 are the cause of an autosomal recessive form of nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

Dedicated to Saint Ninian, it was formerly the Anglican parish church for Brougham, a parish which is now combined with Clifton, a neighbouring village. It is preserved as a redundant church for its architectural interest, and presents a mainly seventeenth- century appearance. It has been known as Ninekirks since at least 1583. Importance The building is Grade I listed. It is one of very few churches to be built during the Commonwealth of England and has been altered very little. (Three other churches of this age are: Church of the Holy Trinity, Berwick-on-Tweed; St Matthias Old Church, London Borough of Tower Hamlets; and Staunton Harold, Leicestershire.) History The Romans built a fort at Brougham called Brocavum, situated near the confluence of the River Eamont and the River Eden. The Ninekirks site has been continuously occupied since at least Roman times. Roman occupation of the site is demonstrated by the Ninekirks Hoard of barbarous radiate coins. As a Christian site, the area was associated with St.Ninian from a very early date but \\"not everyone is convinced entirely by the arguments of Canon Bouch and others for Ninian\\". There are caves nearby on the north bank of the Eamont at a site called Isis Parlis and possible evidence of occupation of these is used to support arguments in favour of early hermit use. The centre of population moved near Brougham Hall sometime between 1230 and 1284. The Hall had a chapel from the 14th century, and the church fell into disuse. In 1659 the church was reconstructed by Lady Anne Clifford, the then owner of Brougham Castle, the work being completed the following year. Ninekirks tended to be used when the chapel at Brougham Hall was unavailable. For example, from 1764 until the 1840s Ninekirks was used for weddings because Brougham Chapel was in need of repair work. Ninekirks was itself repaired in the 1840s. The porch was added in 1841 and tombs within the church were excavated in 1846 when the church was being repaired. According to Brougham (1847) these included those of Udard (or Odard) de Broham (died c.1185) and Gilbert de Broham (died c.1230). Despite the repair work, the church was poorly maintained when George Shaw visited in 1847. The church had a brief golden age in the early 1950s when the Rector was Canon Bouch.

This protein promotes mitochondrial homeostasis and survival of cells under stress and is involved in inflammatory and hypoxia-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as cancer.  Structure  The protein encoded by this gene is 10.4 kDa mitochondrial inner membrane protein with two transmembrane domains at the N- and C-terminals. These two domains are arranged such that the N- and C-terminals face outward into the intermembrane space while the rest of the protein loops inside the matrix. Though the N-terminal domain is not necessary to direct the localization of HIGD1A, it is required for the survival of the protein. The gene HIGD1A is an isoform of HIMP1-b via alternative splicing.  Function  HIGD1A primarily functions in mitochondrial homeostasis and, thus, cell survival when under conditions of stress, such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation. For instance, HIGD1A promotes survival of pancreatic α and β cells under stress. HIGD1A has also been found in other parts of the brain, heart, liver, and kidney, where it enhances the survival of these organs. In macrophages, HIGD1A prevents apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome C release and caspase activity. HIGD1A is also involved in mitochondrial fusion by regulating OPA1 activity. Its inhibition of the cleavage of OPA1 preserves mitochondrial membrane potential, protects against apoptosis, and maintains ATP levels. Its role in mitochondrial fusion also influences downstream processes such as mtDNA synthesis, cell growth, and cristae organization. In addition, HIGD1A helps preserve mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial γ-secretase activity under hypoxic conditions. In the absence of HIGD1A, γ-secretase contributes to the accumulation of amyloid beta in the mitochondria, leading to increased ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually, cell death. While HIGD1A predominantly contributes to cell survival, it can also promote apoptosis in neurons during the early developmental stages of the central nervous system.  Clinical significance  Since HIGD1A promotes cell survival under hypoxia, the protein protects organs like the heart and brain from hypoxia-related diseases. In particular, HIGD1A localization to the nucleus correlates with the severity of stress in ischemic heart disease, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and cancer, and thus may serve as a biomarker for these diseases. Moreover, HIGD1A is involved in inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, through its role in macrophage survival. Similarly, HIGD1A could become a key target for treating Alzheimer’s disease by inhibiting γ-secretase, and by extension, amyloid beta production. Notably, HIGD1A inhibits γ-secretase without interfering with Notch cleavage, thus minimizing detrimental side effects from targeting this protein.

It was identified by its homology with GRASP65 and the protein's amino acid sequence was determined by analysis of a molecular clone of its complementary DNA. The first (N-terminus) 212 amino acid residues of GRASP55 are highly homologous to those of GRASP65, but the remainder of the 454 amino acid residues are highly diverged from GRASP65. The conserved region is known as the GRASP domain, and it is conserved among GRASPs of a wide variety of eukaryotes, but not plants. The C-terminus portion of the molecule is called the SPR domain (serine, proline-rich). GRASP55 is more closely related to homologues in other species, suggesting that GRASP55 is ancestral to GRASP65. GRASP55 is found associated with the medial and trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.  Function  GRASP domain alignment of GRASP55 and the GRASP homologue of Cryptococcus neoformans GRASP55 is involved in establishing the structure of the Golgi apparatus. It is a peripheral membrane protein located on the Golgi cisterna, and it can bind to another GRASP55 located on an adjacent cisterna through the GRASP domain, thus linking the cisternae together through multiple protein–protein interactions. GRASP55 is attached to the membrane in two ways; it is myristylated, which attaches it directly to the lipid bilayer; it is also bound indirectly by binding to golgin-45, which binds to a Rab protein, which itself is lipidated and thus anchored to the membrane. The structure of the Golgi is disrupted during mitosis, and phosphorylation of the SPR domains of GRASP55 and GRASP65 regulate that disruption, GRASP55 may also be involved in forming Golgi ribbons, but the evidence is mixed.  Other interactions  GRASP55 has been shown to interact with TGF alpha, TMED2 and GOLGA2. :  References   Further reading     ","title":"GRASP55"},{"id":"14874199","title":"OSBPL3"},{"id":"14874208","text":"Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAB11FIP5 gene.  Interactions  RAB11FIP5 has been shown to interact with RAB11A and RAB25. Vesicle trafficking Rab11FIP5 is one of the many proteins that have been shown to interact with the Rab11 protein. Rab GTPases, such as Rab11, are enzymes that are involved in vesicular trafficking. Rab11 specifically plays a key role in endocytic trafficking and recycling through guiding early endosomes to endosome recycling complexes. Rab11FIP5, like most other Rab11FIP proteins, interacts with Rab11 by serving as an adaptor protein. This leads to downstream changes with regards to which proteins can interact. This is a result of the various Rab11FIP proteins that each have different binding partners. This process allows for the coordination and organization of endosomal transport and ultimately gives Rab11 its versatile function in the cell. It is believed that Rab11 recruits specific Rab11FIP proteins to the surface of vesicles in order to determine how the vesicle will behave. Studies have shown that Rab11FIP5 localizes to the perinuclear endosomes where it aids in sorting vesicles into the slow recycling route. This process involves the transport of cargo proteins, like endocytosed receptors, to endosome recycling complexes and subsequently to the plasma membrane. This is in contrast to the fast constitutive recycling route which allows for the direct transport of cargo from the endosome to the plasma membrane. Rab11FIP5 aids in this sorting process by binding to kinesin II and forming a protein complex to regulate vesicular trafficking. Some of the proteins that are regulated through Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking are microtubule proteins and the TfR receptor. This links Rab11FIP5 functionality to the cell cytoskeleton and the iron uptake of a cell, respectively. Other functions Rab11FIP5 has been shown to play a role in the nervous system because it functions in neurons. Studies have suggested that Rab11FIP5 is involved in regulating the localization of the postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptor. The AMPA receptor is an excitatory receptor that can be found on the plasma membranes of neurons. Studies have shown that mice with the Rab11FIP5 gene knocked out have severe long term neuronal depression. Without the presence of Rab11FIP5, it is hypothesized that the internalized AMPA receptors cannot be recycled back onto the plasma membrane because the receptors cannot be correctly trafficked to intracellular organelles responsible for recycling. Rab11FIP5 has also been implicated as a protein involved in the creation of tissue polarity during development. Rab11FIP5 has been shown to be involved in the vesicle trafficking and degradation of proteins used to coordinate embryonic development. This is conducted in a manner that helps maintain the ectoderm polarity in embryonic Drosophila. Rab11FIP5 is also suggested to be involved in aiding salivary epithelial cells to adjust to extracellular pH. V-ATPase, a proton pump protein, has been shown to be reliant on Rab11FIP5 mediated vesicle trafficking. When Rab11FIP5 is knocked down, salivary cells cannot correctly translocate V-ATPase to the plasma membrane in response to extracellular acidosis. While this pathway remains largely unknown, these results suggest a link between Rab11FIP5 function and the maintenance of the buffering capacity of saliva. Rab11FIP5 is also required for regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. Knockdown of Rab11FIP5 inhibited calcium-stimulated dense core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis in a neuroendocrine cell line BON cells. DCV membrane proteins are lost to the plasma membrane during exocytosis and recycle to the Golgi through the retrograde trafficking pathway. The requirement of Rab11FIP5 for regulated DCV exocytosis may be attributed to its role in endosome-mediated retrograde trafficking.

Its expression is first noticed in embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) in the splanchnic mesoderm caudal to the level of the heart and foregut pocket, and in the branchial arches. Around E10- E12.5, the expression becomes more prominent in the mesenchyme of the visceral organs of the gut such as liver, intestines and gall bladder. Hlx is essential for liver and gut expansion, but not for onset of their development. Heterozygous knockouts of Hlx (Hlx +/−) are normal whereas homozygous knockouts (Hlx −/–) develop severe hypoplasia of the liver and gut along with anaemia. Hlx controls the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction necessary for liver and gut expansion. At E8.0, the primary liver bud is formed from the midgut endoderm in response to signals from the cardiogenic mesoderm. This is followed by signals from the septum transversum that induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the hepatic progenitors of the gut endoderm. In a third stage, these signaling factors induce the liver endoderm to undergo proliferation and form liver cords. The same factor controls gut proliferation, and Hlx governs its expression.

The plant was last operated in 1972. strip mine operates from the top and rear of the mountain. The St. Nicholas Breaker was a historic coal breaker in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Description The St. Nicholas Breaker was located between Mahanoy City and Shenandoah in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, in the southern part of the Coal Region. The breaker was once the largest of its kind, being the size of a city block and capable of processing 12,500 tons of coal per day. It has been described as having a \\"hulking, asymmetrical facade\\". The St. Nicholas Breaker was constructed using 3,800 cubic yards of steel and 10,000 cubic yards of concrete. It contained of conveyor lines, of pipes, of conduits, of wire, and of rubber belting. The construction required half of the village of Suffolk to be relocated. The St. Nicholas Breaker was described as sounding \\"like thunder\\" during operation. More recently, Kurt Zwikl, the executive director of the Schuylkill River Heritage Area, described the breaker as \\"fantastically unique building\\", but in \\"bad shape\\". It was divided into two sections that were capable of operating independently. Coal took 12 minutes to be processed by the breaker. History The St. Nicholas Breaker first became operational on March 11, 1931. It was the second breaker in the area to be named after St. Nicholas; the first was built in 1861 and torn down in 1928. When the new breaker opened, it was the \\"crown jewel of a relatively safer, more modern anthracite industry\\". However, the breaker stopped operating in 1965. In the early 2000s, there were proposals to make the St. Nicholas Breaker a historical site. However, such a plan was found to be prohibitively expensive, costing tens of millions of dollars. As of 2013, the breaker was owned by the Reading Anthracite Company. In 2013, part of the breaker was demolished. As of mid-2017, the St. Nicholas Breaker is being dismantled piece by piece. The work has been ongoing for several years, but the bulk of the structure still stands. The breaker is the last remaining large-scale coal breaker in Northeastern Pennsylvania; there were once many area facilities with similar scale including the Huber and Locust Summit breakers. In 2015, numerous people came to visit the breaker before a round of demolition work began. The St. Nicholas Breaker was demolished in a controlled explosion on March 15, 2018.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the allosterically regulated rate-limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Each isozyme is a heterotetramer that is composed of two alpha subunits, one beta subunit, and one gamma subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is the alpha subunit of one isozyme of NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]  Structure  IDH3 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes, the other two being IDH1 and IDH2, and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which are IDH1, IDH2, IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G. The genes IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G encode subunits of IDH3, which is a heterotetramer composed of two 37-kDa α subunits (IDH3α), one 39-kDa β subunit (IDH3β), and one 39-kDa γ subunit (IDH3γ), each with distinct isoelectric points. Alignment of their amino acid sequences reveals ~40% identity between IDH3α and IDH3β, ~42% identity between IDH3α and IDH3γ, and an even closer identity of 53% between IDH3β and IDH3γ, for an overall 34% identity and 23% similarity across all three subunit types. Notably, Arg88 in IDH3α is essential for IDH3 catalytic activity, whereas the equivalent Arg99 in IDH3β and Arg97 in IDH3γ are largely involved in the enzyme’s allosteric regulation by ADP and NAD. Thus, it is possible that these subunits arose from gene duplication of a common ancestral gene, and the original catalytic Arg residue were adapted to allosteric functions in the β- and γ-subunits. Likewise, Asp181 in IDH3α is essential for catalysis, while the equivalent Asp192 in IDH3β and Asp190 in IDH3γ enhance NAD- and Mn2+-binding. Since the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by IDH3 requires binding of NAD, Mn2+, and the substrate isocitrate, all three subunits participate in the catalytic reaction. Moreover, studies of the enzyme in pig heart reveal that the αβ and αγ dimers constitute two binding sites for each of its ligands, including isocitrate, Mn2+, and NAD, in one IDH3 tetramer.  Function  As an isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH3 catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and CO2 as part of the TCA cycle in glucose metabolism. This step also allows for the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which is then used to generate ATP through the electron transport chain. Notably, IDH3 relies on NAD+ as its electron acceptor, as opposed to NADP+ like IDH1 and IDH2. IDH3 activity is regulated by the energy needs of the cell: when the cell requires energy, IDH3 is activated by ADP; and when energy is no longer required, IDH3 is inhibited by ATP and NADH. This allosteric regulation allows IDH3 to function as a rate- limiting step in the TCA cycle. Within cells, IDH3 and its subunits have been observed to localize to the mitochondria.  Clinical significance  IDH3α expression has been linked to cancer, with high basal expression in multiple cancer cell lines and increased expression indicative of poorer prognosis in cancer patients. IDH3α is proposed to promote tumor growth as a regulator of α-KG, which subsequently regulates HIF-1. HIF-1 is largely known for shifting glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (the Warburg effect). Moreover, IDH3α activity leads to angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming to provide the necessary nutrients for continuous cell growth. Meanwhile, silencing IDH3α is observed to obstruct tumor growth. Thus, IDH3α may prove to be a promising therapeutic target in treating cancer. IDH3α is also implicated in psychiatric disorders. In particular, IDH3α expression in the cerebellum is observed to be significantly lower for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. The abnormal IDH3α levels may disrupt mitochondrial function and contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.

Early life  Karns was the son of the well-known character actor Roscoe Karns and his wife Mary Fraso. He initially planned to have a career as a newspaper reporter, but participation in a little theater production changed his mind, turning him toward acting.  Film  Karns started his film career in 1941 as Harry Land in two Andy Hardy movies with Mickey Rooney, but shortly after that, his beginning film career was interrupted by the Second World War, where Karns served in the Army Air Corps. When he returned to Hollywood, Karnes portrayed his signature role as Harry Bailey in Frank Capra's Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life (1946). He often had minor film roles, such as in Good Sam (1948) and The Caine Mutiny (1954).  Television  Karns played Jackson Jones in Jackson and Jill (1949–1953), the first weekly situation comedy for television. He also appeared with his father Roscoe in the criminal series Rocky King, Detective (1950–1954), playing Sergeant Hart. He retired from film and television in the mid-1950s.  Later years  Karns and his wife Katherine with their three children moved to Mexico near Guadalajara where they opened the English-language venue, Lakeside Little Theater in 1971.

Discovery  The enzyme was first described by Blumenstein and Williams (1960) in guinea pig liver. However, this enzyme was not purified until 1972 in the rabbit liver by Kerr. In 1984, Cook and Wagner demonstrated that a liver cytosolic folate binding protein is identical to GNMT. The human GMNT gene was cloned in 2000 by Chen and coworkers.  Tissue distribution  GNMT is an abundant enzyme in liver cytosol and consists of 0.9% to 3% of the soluble protein present in liver. In addition to liver, GNMT activity has been found in a number of other tissues including pancreas and kidney. GNMT is most abundant in the peri-portal region of the liver and exocrine tissue of the pancreas. The GNMT proteins located in tissues that are actively in secretion, such as the proximal kidney tubules, the submaxillary glands and the intestinal mucosa. GNMT is also expressed in various neurons presented in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and cerebellum. The presence of GNMT in these cells suggests that this enzyme may play a role in secretion.  Structure  The properties of GNMT protein from rabbits, rats and humans, either purified from liver/pancreas, or expressed in Escherichia coli, have been well characterized. All GNMTs have very similar molecular and kinetic properties. Comparison of the cDNA and protein sequences of human, rabbit, pig and rat GNMTs shows similarities of over 84% at the nucleotide level and about 90% at the amino acid level. All GNMTs are 130 kDa tetramers consisting of four identical subunits, each having a Mr of 32 kDa. The structure of recombinant rat, mouse and human GNMTs have been solved. The four nearly spherical subunits are arranged to form a flat and square tetramer with a large hole in the center. The active sites are located in the near center of each subunit.  Function  Glycine N-methyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of N-methylglycine (sarcosine) from glycine using S-adenosylmethionine(SAM) (AdoMet) as the methyl donor. GNMT acts as an enzyme to regulate the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine(SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (AdoHcy) and participates in the detoxification pathway in liver cells. GNMT competes with tRNA methyltransferases for SAM and the product, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), is a potent inhibitor of tRNA methyltransferases and a relatively weak inhibitor of GNMT. GNMT regulates the relative levels of SAM and SAH. Since SAM is the methyl donor for almost all cellular methylation reactions. GNMT is therefore likely to regulate cellular methylation capacity. An endogenous ligand of GNMT, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate (5-CH3-H4PteGIu5) is a powerful inhibitor of this enzyme. Thus, GNMT has been proposed to link the de novo synthesis of methyl groups to the ratio of SAM to SAH, which in turn serves as a bridge between methionine and one-carbon metabolism. In addition to the methyltransferase activity, the 4S polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-binding protein and GNMT are one and the same protein. The catalytic site resembles a molecular basket, unlike most other SAM-dependent methyltransferases, which therefore suggests that GNMT may be capable of capturing unidentified chemicals as a part of a detoxification process. Therefore, GNMT has been proposed to be a protein with diverse functionality.  Clinical significance  GNMT has been shown to detoxify some environmental carcinogens such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and aflatoxin. There is mounting evidence that supports the involvement of GNMT deficiency in liver carcinogenesis.  Inducer  The glycoside natural product 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PGG) isolated from Paeonia lactiflora, an Asian flower plant, induces GNMT mRNA and protein expression in Huh7 human hepatoma cells.

Enhancing A3C's catalytic activity had only a marginal effect on HIV-1 replication (in absence of Vif), the counteractive viral mechanism is unclear. A3C was also shown to inhibit other viruses.

Function  This gene encodes a ubiquitin-like protein (ubiquilin) that shares high degree of similarity with related products in yeast, rat and frog. Ubiquilins contain a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain. They physically associate with both proteasomes and ubiquitin ligases, and are thus thought to functionally link the ubiquitination machinery to the proteasome to effect in vivo protein degradation. This ubiquilin has also been shown to bind the ATPase domain of the Hsp70-like Stch protein. Similarity to other proteins Human UBQLN2 shares a high degree of similarity with related ubiquilins including UBQLN1 and UBQLN4.  Clinical significance  In a small proportion of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), the UBQLN2 gene is mutated, causing formation of a non-functional Ubiquilin 2 enzyme. This non-functioning enzyme leads to the accumulation of ubiquinated proteins in the lower motor neurons and upper corticospinal motor neurons, due to the fact that ubiquilin 2 normally degrades these ubiquinated proteins, but cannot if the ALS mutation is present.

He was largely responsible for carrying out her actions to wipe out senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan, but, in a turnabout, was in 691 himself accused of crimes and, under threats of a torture technique himself developed, confessed. Wu Zetian spared his life and exiled him, but he was killed by his enemies on the way to exile.  Background  It is not known when Zhou Xing was born, but it is known that he was from Chang'an County (), one of the two counties making up the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. He studied law in his youth, and as of the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang he was serving as the magistrate of Heyang County (河陽, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). Zhou became known for his abilities, and was summoned to the capital, as Emperor Gaozong was considering promoting him. However, someone submitted a letter to Emperor Gaozong, pointing out that Zhou had not passed imperial examinations, and Emperor Gaozong thereafter changed his idea about promoting Zhou. However, Zhou was not aware of this, and he repeatedly visited the government officials, awaiting a promotion. The chancellors said nothing to him, but eventually Wei Xuantong told him, \\"Magistrate Zhou, you may go.\\" Zhou thereafter believed that Wei was the one who blocked his promotion, and hated Wei immensely.As Wei Xuantong did not become chancellor until 682, and Emperor Gaozong died in 683, this incident must have occurred during those years.  As secret police official  Emperor Gaozong died in 683 and was succeeded by his son Li Zhe the Crown Prince (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wu retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. In 684, when Emperor Zhongzong displayed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with his younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but thereafter wielded power even more firmly. She soon faced a rebellion against her led by Li Jingye the Duke of Ying, but quickly defeated the rebellion. However, Li Jingye's rebellion caused Empress Dowager Wu to suspect many people of opposing her, and she began to encourage secret reports. Zhou had been serving as a low-level secretary (尚書都事, Shangshu Dushi) at the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), and he became involved in serving as a secret police official for her, eventually promoted by her to be deputy minister of justice (秋官侍郎, Qiuguan Shilang). It was said that Zhou was involved in the deaths of thousands. In 688, there was a false accusation by a slave of the official Hao Xiangxian () against Hao, whose deceased grandfather Hao Chujun had previously served as chancellor during Emperor Gaozong's reign and had opposed Emperor Gaozong's one-time plan, during his time of illness, to have Empress Wu serve as his regent. Empress Dowager Wu still bore grudges against Hao Chujun for that episode, and took this opportunity to have Zhou investigate Hao Xiangxian. Zhou found Hao Xiangxian guilty and sentenced his entire family to death. (On the way to the execution field, Hao Xiangxian tried to flee and also loudly yelled out insults against Empress Dowager Wu and accusations that she was committing immoral acts; he was eventually killed by the guards, but as a result of what Hao Xiangxian did, thereafter until her death, whenever prisoners were to be executed, their mouths would be stuffed with wood so that they would not be able to yell out insults.) Later in 688, in the aftermath of another failed rebellion, led by Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Zhen the Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son Li Chong the Prince of Langye, Empress Dowager Wu considered wiping out the senior members of the imperial Li clan, and she put Zhou in charge of the plan. Zhou thereafter arrested Emperor Gaozong's uncles Li Yuanjia () the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui () the Prince of Lu, Li Yuanjia's son Li Zhuan () the Duke of Huang, and Emperor Gaozong's aunt Princess Changle and her husband Zhao Gui (), brought them to the eastern capital Luoyang, and forced them to commit suicide. He then further massacred the princes' family and friends. In 689, still bearing grudges against Wei Xuantong, who was a friend of Pei Yan, a chancellor that Empress Dowager Wu had executed in 684 on suspicions that he opposed her, Zhou falsely accused Wei of having said, \\"The empress dowager is old. It is better to support the emperor, for he will last longer.\\" In anger, Empress Dowager Wu ordered Wei to commit suicide. Zhou also falsely accused the general Heichi Changzhi the Duke of Yan of treason, and Heichi was strangled to death. In 690, Zhou suggested that the Li clan members be stripped of imperial clan status, and Empress Dowager Wu did so. He also falsely accused the chancellor Wei Fangzhi, who was subsequently exiled and executed in exile. Then, at the instigation of Empress Dowager Wu's powerful nephew Wu Chengsi, he accused Emperor Gaozong's sons by concubines, Li Shangjin () the Prince of Ze and Li Sujie the Prince of Xu of treason. Li Sujie was strangled, while Li Shangjin committed suicide. Later in 690, Emperor Ruizong yielded the throne to Empress Dowager Wu, and she took the throne as \\"emperor\\" of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang Dynasty. Yet later that year, the prefectural prefect Li Xingbao () and his brothers were falsely accused and sentenced to have their clan executed. A subordinate of Zhou's at the ministry of justice, Xu Yougong () tried to get the judgment reversed but was not able to. However, Zhou then accused Xu of acting on behalf of treasonous individuals and requested that Xu be executed. Wu Zetian refused to execute Xu, but for a time relieved Xu of his duties.  Death  In 691, however, in a famous incident involving Zhou Xing and fellow secret police official Lai Junchen would lead to Zhou's downfall. Earlier that year, the general Qiu Shenji () had been accused of crime and executed, and subsequently, there were secret reports that Zhou was involved with Qiu's crimes. Wu Zetian had Lai investigate, without Zhou's knowledge. One day, Lai and Zhou sat down to lunch, and Lai asked Zhou the question of, \\"Many of the accused are not willing to confess. Do you have an idea on how to get them to confess?\\" Zhou responded, \\"That is easy. Take a big urn and set a fire under it.

History  Lincoln Mall opened in 1973 with anchors Carson Pirie Scott, Montgomery Ward, Wieboldt's, and JCPenney. The center was developed by Randhurst Corp, the same developer consisting of Wieboldt's and Carson's executives who developed Randhurst Mall and Lakehurst Mall. Wieboldt's closed in the 1980s. In 1991, Walmart and Sam's Club opened across the street from the mall. Walmart moved to Olympia Fields in 2016, while Sam's Club officially closed on January 26, 2018. A Year later in 1992, Best Buy opened in the surrounding area of the Mall. It closed in 2012. The mall underwent a renovation in 1993. In 1995, Sears opened in the former Wieboldt's location. Montgomery Ward closed their store in 1999 and went bankrupt soon after. In 2000, JCPenney closed their location in Lincoln Mall. Due to the loss of two anchors, mall traffic declined and many stores began to vacate Lincoln Mall. In 2006, Lincoln Mall started the process of a $115-million redevelopment in hopes of attracting more retailers to the mall. The plan included a multi-screen movie theater and a four-lane road to connect Cicero Avenue and Lincoln Highway. However, it include demolitions of existing out-parcels and a section of the mall where Montgomery Ward and JCPenny was. In 2007, two new stores opened at the site. Target, with a store built on an outparcel, opened in July and JCPenney returned to Lincoln Mall with a store in October also on an outparcel. On Friday, May 11, 2012, Sears began a store- closing sale. On June 1, 2012, Lincoln Mall was scheduled for a court ordered sale by auction. Lincoln Mall had been in the process of undergoing a $115-million redevelopment in hopes of attracting more retailers to Lincoln Mall. The plan included a multi-screen movie theater and a four-lane road to connect Cicero Avenue and Lincoln Highway. To make room for the new plans some parts of the mall were demolished, including the former JCPenney and Montgomery Ward stores. In August 2013, representatives of Matteson attempted to sue the mall owners and order that it be closed, due to fire, safety, and building code violations, including exposed electrical wiring, an inoperative fire sprinkler system, blocked fire exits, a crumbling roof, and a damaged foundation. On November 11, 2014, Cook County Judge Thomas Condon ordered that the mall be closed permanently as of January 7, 2015, with the exception of Carson's (whose building is owned separately by its parent company), which will remain open. Operating funds that owner Michael Kohan initially provided for the mall's upkeep had been depleted and nothing remained to keep the mall operating after December. Kohan has provided a court-appointed receiver with only $100,000 in the preceding 15 months to pay for the mall's repairs, maintenance, and staffing, while the number of remaining tenants paying rent was insufficient to sustain daily operations. The mall would have needed to replace several exits and repair its electrical and air conditioning systems in order to be brought up to code. In late 2016, photos of the abandoned mall surfaced, as part of a photo project by photographer Seph Lawless.http://www.nbcchicago.com/multimedia/Shocking-Photos-Show-Inside- Abandoned-Lincoln- Mall-402466166.htmlhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/25165196@N08/albums/72157685915508996 In February, 2017, a Cook County Circuit Judge ordered immediate demolition of the mall. On March 17, 2017, news outlets reported the Village of Matteson had agreed with the court-appointed receiver on final demolition costs, with demolition projected to begin shortly after it received the judge's approval. Demolition began May 8, 2017. Demolition was completed by the end of summer 2017. On November 7, 2017, it was announced that Target would be closing as part of a plan to close 12 stores nationwide.

The protein encoded by this gene is a core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). Mutations in this gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency.  Structure  NDUFS2 is located on the q arm of chromosome 1 in position 23.3 and has 15 exons. The NDUFS2 gene produces a 52.5 kDa protein composed of 463 amino acids. NDUFS2, the protein encoded by this gene, is a member of the complex I 49 kDa subunit family. It is a peripheral membrane protein on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It contains a cofactor binding site for a [4Fe-4S] cluster, a transit peptide, 5 turns, 11 beta strands, and 18 alpha helixes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Function  Mitochondrial complex I is the first multimeric complex of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the NADH oxidation with concomitant ubiquinone reduction and proton ejection out of the mitochondria. Mammalian mitochondrial complex I is an assembly of at least 43 different subunits. Seven of the subunits are encoded by the mitochondrial genome; the remainder are the products of nuclear genes. The iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction of complex I is made up of 7 subunits, including NDUFS2. Dimethylation at Arg-118 by NDUFAF7 takes place after NDUFS2 assembles into the complex I, leading to the stabilization of the early intermediate complex.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the NDUFS2 gene are associated with Mitochondrial Complex I Deficiency, which is autosomal recessive. This deficiency is the most common enzymatic defect of the oxidative phosphorylation disorders. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency shows extreme genetic heterogeneity and can be caused by mutation in nuclear-encoded genes or in mitochondrial-encoded genes. There are no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations, and inference of the underlying basis from the clinical or biochemical presentation is difficult, if not impossible. However, the majority of cases are caused by mutations in nuclear-encoded genes. It causes a wide range of clinical disorders, ranging from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, nonspecific encephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease.  Interactions  NDUFS2 has been shown to have 121 binary protein-protein interactions including 112 co-complex interactions. NDUFS2 appears to interact with NDUFS3, MKLN1, EGR2, HMOX2, CENPU, and TNFRSF14.

One of his elder brothers was Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi. His younger brother was Retsudō Gisen, the real person who is fictionalized as Yagyū Retsudō, leader of the Ura-Yagyū (Shadow Yagyū), in Lone Wolf and Cub. In 1650, Munefuyu became the head of the Yagyū clan. In 1657 he received the title Hida no kami. In 1668 he rose to the rank of daimyo of the Yagyū Domain when he received an additional grant of land, bringing his holdings above the 10,000 koku minimum. Initially weaker than his brothers and father, a kōan tells how he managed to become an expert after training his zanshin (vigilance) for several years in a temple. Despite his success and fame, he was defeated in a single stroke by Yagyū Renya Toshikane (fourth headmaster of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū), who had previously fought, before Tokugawa Yoshinao lord of Owari, over 30 duels without being hit.

Georgia State University is the largest university in the state of Georgia. The Andrew Young School enrolls more than 2,100 students each semester. Community internships and job opportunities are a major draw for enrollment, with the school being within walking distance of one of the nation’s largest concentrations of local, state and federal governments and also close to several nonprofit headquarters, such as Care USA and Habitat for Humanity.  History and Culture  The beginnings of the Andrew Young School were in the establishment of a Master of Governmental Administration degree in 1972. This would later evolve into a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) which was offered originally though the Institute of Governmental Administration. After shuffling around throughout the decades, the Georgia State Policy School was established in 1996. Three years later in 1999, The Policy School was renamed the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. The name pays respects to Andrew Young, a civil rights leader from Atlanta who served as United Nations Ambassador from 1977–79, as mayor of Atlanta from 1982–90, and was instrumental in bringing the Olympics to the city in 1996. His leadership and Georgia State University's status as one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation allow Andrew Young School's programs to be inclusive and make a global impact. Roughly one-fifth of graduate students come from developing countries, 59 percent of students are women and nearly one-half are African Americans.  Rankings  U.S. News and World Report’s 2020 Best Graduate Schools Public Affairs list ranks the Andrew Young School No. 21 overall: No. 7 in Local Government Management, No. 8 in Public Finance & Budgeting, No. 8 in Urban Policy, No. 9 in Nonprofit Management, No. 19 in Public Management & Leadership, and No. 22 in Public Policy Analysis. Criminology ranks No. 22, Economics ranks No. 59, and the School of Social Work ranks No. 59.  Departments  Andrew Young School of Policy Studies includes five academic departments: *The Department of Criminal Justice & Criminology * The Department of Economics * The Department of Public Management and Policy * The School of Social Work *The Urban Studies Institute  Degree Programs  A major pillar of the philosophy of the Andrew Young School is the belief that economics, public administration and social policy should not be separated. The result is an approach to policy studies that is multidisciplinary, evident in the numerous interdisciplinary degrees offered and partnerships in research with other departments throughout Georgia State University. Notably, a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics was established in Fall of 2017, based on a deep historical connection of the disciplines and using analytically rigorous tools to prepare students for careers in law, economics, and business. The Andrew Young School also offers a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Economics is offered in partnership with the J. Mack Robinson College of Business, and various other interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate degrees. = Undergraduate Degree Programs = *Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Economics *Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Economics *Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) in Economics *Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics *Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Criminal Justice *Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in International Economics & Modern Languages *Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) in Social Entrepreneurship *Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Public Policy *Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Social Work = Graduate Degree Programs = *Master of Arts (M.A.) in Economics *Master of Arts (M.A.) in Economics - Public Policy Track *Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) *Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) / Juris Doctor (J.D.) *Master of Public Policy (M.P.P.) in Policy Studies *Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) in Social Work *Master of Science (M.S.) in Criminal Justice *Master of Interdisciplinary Studies (M.I.S.) in Criminal Justice Administration *Master of Interdisciplinary Studies (M.I.S.) in Urban Studies *Peace Corps Masters International Program = Doctoral Degree Programs = *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Criminal Justice and Criminology *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Economics *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Public Policy with the Georgia Institute of Technology *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Public Policy *Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Urban Studies = Graduate Certificate programs = * Nonprofit Management * Planning and Economic Development  Research Centers and Programs  The Andrew Young School has an international presence in its research efforts with more than 135 faculty having worked in more than 70 countries worldwide. This translates to more than 230 scholarly papers, journal articles, chapters and books published annually and more than $26 million in active sponsored grants in the 2019 fiscal year.

The Fourth National Bank opened the building on the southwest corner of Marietta and Peachtree streets in 1905 - the site of the Norcross Building which had burned in a 1902 fire – and was for one year the tallest building in the city until the Candler Building was built. Morgan & Dillon designed the building. In 1928 firm Pringle & Smith directed addition of several floors to the building, an extension northward along Marietta street resulting in an L-shaped building, and a renovation of the interior to an even more opulent style. In 1966, First National Bank built a 41-story tower on the lot adjacent to the south, site of the Peachtree Arcade (1917-1964); today the State of Georgia Building; the architect was Cecil Alexander. It removed the top half of the original building and resurfaced it in the white marble that covers it today.

Function  NFKBIE protein expression is up-regulated following NF-κB activation and during myelopoiesis. NFKBIE is able to inhibit NF-κB-directed transactivation via cytoplasmic retention of REL proteins. NFKB1 or NFKB2 is bound to REL, RELA, or RELB to form the NF-κB transcription factor complex. The NF-κB complex is inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA or NFKBIB), which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, or IKBKB) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B complex. Activated NF-κB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine).

The product of this gene belongs to the family of purinoceptors for ATP. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified for this gene although their full-length natures have not been determined. The receptor is found in the central and peripheral nervous systems, in the epithelia of ducted glands and airways, in the smooth muscle of the bladder, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and arteries, in uterine endometrium, and in fat cells. P2X4 receptors have been implicated in the regulation of cardiac function, ATP-mediated cell death, synaptic strengthening, and activating of the inflammasome in response to injury.  Receptor structure and kinetics  The P2X4 subunits can form homomeric or heteromeric receptors. The P2X4 receptor has a typical P2X receptor structure. The zebrafish P2X4 receptor was the first purinergic receptor to be crystallized and have its three- dimensional structure solved, forming the model for the P2X receptor family. The P2X4 receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel that opens in response to ATP binding. The P2X4 receptor has high calcium permeability, leading to the depolarization of the cell membrane and the activation of various Ca2+-sensitive intracellular processes. Continued binding leads to increased permeability to N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG+) in about 50% of the cells expressing the P2X4 receptor. The desensitization of P2X4 receptors is intermediate when compared to P2X1 and P2X2 receptors.  Pharmacology  = Agonists = P2X4 receptors respond to ATP, but not αβmeATP. These receptors are also potentiated by ivermectin, cibacron blue, and zinc. = Antagonists = The main pharmacological distinction between the members of the purinoceptor family is the relative sensitivity to the antagonists suramin and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS). The product of this gene has the lowest sensitivity for these antagonists  Receptor trafficking  P2X4 receptors are stored in lysosomes and brought to the cell surface in response to extracellular signals. These signals include IFN-γ, CCL21, CCL2. Fibronectin is also involved in upregulation of P2X4 receptors through interactions with integrins that lead to the activation of SRC-family kinase member, Lyn. Lyn then activates PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling pathways to stimulate receptor trafficking. Internalization of P2X4 receptors is clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis.  Neuropathic pain  The P2X4 receptor has been linked to neuropathic pain mediated by microglia in vitro and in vivo. P2X4 receptors are upregulated following injury. This upregulation allows for increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, thereby increasing the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from microglia. BDNF released from microglia induces neuronal hyperexcitability through interaction with the TrkB receptor. More importantly, recent work shows that P2X4 receptor activation is not only necessary for neuropathic pain, but it is also sufficient to cause neuropathic pain.

Function  Potassium channels play a role in many cellular processes including the maintenance of the action potential, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, osmotic regulation, and ion flow. This gene encodes the K2P4.1 protein, a lipid-gated ion channel that belongs to the superfamily of potassium channel proteins containing two pore-forming P domains. K2P4.1 homodimerizes and functions as an outwardly rectifying channel. It is expressed primarily in neural tissues and is stimulated by membrane stretch and polyunsaturated fatty acids. KCNK4 protein channels are also called TRAAK channels. TRAAK channels are found in mammalian neurons and are part of a protein family of weakly inward rectifying potassium channels. This subfamily of potassium channels is mechanically gated. The C-terminal of TRAAK has a charged cluster that is important in maintaining the mechanosensitive properties of the channel. TRAAK is only expressed in neuronal tissue, and can be found in the brain, spinal cord, and retina, which suggests that it has a function beyond mechanotransduction in terms of neuronal excitability. The highest levels of TRAAK expression are in the olfactory system, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, habenula, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. TRAAK channels are mechanically activated when there is a convex curvature in the membrane that alters the channel’s activity.

He played college football at Williams College. Early years Brooks grew up in Simsbury, Connecticut. He attended Westminster School, a small prep school with a poor football record while he was there. He was not recruited by Division I-A schools, but had opportunities to play with a scholarship at Division I-AA schools. His father Alan had gone to Wesleyan University and was good enough to be invited to the Baltimore Colts training camp. When Brooks graduated, Williams College had a better football program than Wesleyan and the other school of the \\"Little Three\\", Amherst College, good enough to be a Division III \\"football power\\". College career Brooks had NFL aspirations and thought that the Division III level of play would not be the best route to the NFL. He intended to go to Bucknell University which had a superior football program as a Division I-AA program and was still a good academic institution. However, he did not think he would be accepted at Division III Williams College, because although his academics were good for a football player, they were low for the school. Nevertheless, his application was approved and he accepted a football scholarship. He became a starter at defensive tackle and stood out in the division for his size (270 pounds) and skill. He was also used on the offensive line to block in specific goal-line situations. As a sophomore, he took a year off to recover from a broken foot. He became a two-time All- conference player and the NESCAC defensive player of the year as a senior. He also contributed to his team having a 17-0-1 record in his final two seasons He was an All-American in track and field in the hammer throw. On his last throw of the 35 lb. weight at the 1996 NCAA Indoor Championships, Brooks broke the NCAA Division III record with a heave of 63’ 8 ¾” and later that spring he won the NCAA hammer throw (194’ 2”). His major was psychology. Professional career =Atlanta Falcons= Brooks was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the 7th round (229th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft, with the intention of being converted into an offensive tackle. He was moved back to the defensive line due to team injuries in training camp. As a rookie, he dressed for the final two games of the season. In 1997, Dan Reeves replaced June Jones as the new Falcons head coach and Brooks was allocated to the World League of American Football. He made the All-WLAF first team as a right tackle with the Rhein Fire, playing in World Bowl V. However, the league schedule forced him to miss the Falcons minicamps and was not able to appropriately learn the new offense being implemented. He was again moved back to defense and eventually waived on August 27. =St. Louis Rams= On November 20, 1997, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Rams. In 1998, he played as the backup swing offensive tackle and on special teams in 15 games. In 1999, he was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but his wife was diagnosed with cancer, which impacted the time he could devote to training. He was released on July 19, because the team considered that he wasn't progressing as they'd hoped and he was also experiencing chronic back problems. =Arizona Cardinals= On February 3, 2000, he signed as a free agent with the Arizona Cardinals, after spending the 1999 season out of football. He appeared in 14 games with 3 starts. He was not re-signed after the season. =Denver Broncos= On March 15, 2001, he was signed as a \\"camp body\\" for the Denver Broncos. On August 28, he was cut after the third exhibition game, having had almost no playing time. He would return back to Atlanta and eventually home to Connecticut. =Baltimore Ravens= A year after Jackie's death he was ready to start training again. His trainer, Charles Poliquin was headed to Arizona and Brooks followed him to get himself in football shape. On August 2, 2002, the Baltimore Ravens signed him as a free agent to play on the offensive line as a swing tackle backup, behind All-Pro left tackle Jonathan Ogden. He ended up playing in 15 games, starting 13 at right tackle. On March 13, 2003, he was signed to a new 2-year contract. Orlando Brown returned that season as the starting right tackle, having recovered from a freakish eye injury, and Brooks went back to being a swing backup tackle behind Brown and Ogden. He started 3 games in place of an injured Brown. In 2004, he started 7 games at left tackle in place of an injured Ogden. He became an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. He started 23 games in 3 years with the Ravens. =New York Jets= On May 23, 2005, he signed with the New York Jets, but was released at the end of training camp on August 27. =Dallas Cowboys= The Dallas Cowboys called him six weeks into the season and signed him on October 19, 2005. He played left tackle under head coach Bill Parcells, attempting to help replace the injured Pro Bowl player Flozell Adams. He was released just over a month later on November 27, to make room for offensive tackle Marcus Price. Personal life Brooks met his wife Jaqueline Smith on a blind date during his first year in Atlanta. They were married in less than a year in the Spring of 1997. In the Fall of 1999 Jackie was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Brooks put football on the back burner while he stayed with his wife who was having chemotherapy treatment. He also was struggling with a back injury and was released by the Rams. He turned down new signing offers from the Saints, Cowboys, Cardinals, and Jaguars. When the doctors pronounced Jackie in remission, he accepted an offer from the Arizona Cardinals for the 2000 season and made the team. Jackie joined him but she was already ill with a fatal recurrence and died in March 2001. Brooks did not tell many people about the situation and was not re-signed at the end of the season. In September 2009, he joined the staff of the Pomfret School in Connecticut as a strength and conditioning coach. He left for a similar position at his alma mater, Williams College in 2011. Brook's sister, Rebecca, was an All-American in soccer, basketball and outdoor track & field. His older brother Fletcher was the head coach of the Ephs men’s and women’s track & field teams, before moving on to Iowa State University in 2013.

The creek is the second largest tributary of Lake Erie in New York State. The name is derived from the creek's distance south of the Niagara River in Buffalo. The creek was named Koughquaugu Creek by the Seneca Nation. Course From its source in the Town of Concord, Eighteen Mile Creek flows north and then west before entering Lake Erie at the community of Highland-on-the-Lake in the Town of Evans. It has one major tributary, the South Branch Eighteen Mile Creek, which joins the main branch within Eighteen Mile Creek Park in the Town of Hamburg. The creek drains an approximately watershed. Geology The lower section of Eighteen Mile Creek has been known for its abundance of fossils since the 19th century. The faces of the creek's gorges expose bands of shale overlain by limestone which yield numerous fossils dating from the middle to late Devonian Period. These include corals such as Heliophyllum and Favosites in addition to various species of crinoids, brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, and trilobites. Portions of the creek and surrounding area in the Town of Hamburg have been designated as a \\"Critical Environmental Area\\" due to its abundance of fossils.; Map of the Critical Environmental Area Public use =Sportfishing= Eighteen Mile Creek is utilized by anglers seeking Lake Erie steelhead during their annual spawning runs that take place from mid- October to early May. Brown trout are also sought year-round.

With an enrollment of only 161, Milan was the smallest school ever to win a single-class state basketball title in Indiana, beating the team from the much larger Muncie Central High School in a classic competition known as the Milan Miracle. The team and town are the inspiration for the 1986 film Hoosiers. The team finished its regular season 19–2 and sported a 28–2 overall record.Although Milan’s championship is now the most well-known example of a small high school winning a single class state basketball tournament, other small schools in different states have had similar accomplishments. For example, Melrose High School, a school with an enrollment of only 66, won the 1937 Iowa boys' basketball championship. Background Unlike most states, Indiana held a single-class tournament in which all schools competed for the same championship in one of America's largest and most popular high school tournaments, until the separation into enrollment classes in 1997. Indiana still possessed a large rural population well into the 1950s and rural school consolidation was still in its infancy. As a result, most Indiana high schools of the era had what today are considered extremely small enrollments. Many of these small schools had realistic expectations of advancing several rounds into the tournament in that era, but they would almost inevitably fall in the regionals to urban schools from places such as South Bend, Evansville, Gary, Terre Haute, Muncie, Bloomington, Lafayette, Fort Wayne, and Indianapolis. 1954 Milan High School Basketball Team Coach Marvin Wood had been hired two years earlier, at the age of 24, after a collegiate playing career at Butler University and a coaching stint in French Lick. His hiring was controversial, coming on the heels of Superintendent Willard Green's firing of coach Herman \\"Snort\\" Grinstead, who had ordered new uniforms without authorization. Wood's coaching style was the opposite of Grinstead's in many ways. He closed practice to outsiders, an act that removed one of the major forms of leisure time entertainment for the town's basketball-crazed population and angered many. He was impressed by the unusual scope of size and talent available in such a small school among the many boys trying out for the team, talent forged by a strong junior-high program. He taught them more patience than the run-and-gun Grinstead, culminating in a four-corner ball control offense he called the \\"cat-and- mouse\\". Expectations were higher in the 1952–1953 season. These were realized as the Indians won their first regional game in school history under questionable circumstances against Morton Memorial, an orphanage school outside of Knightstown. In that game, Morton Memorial held a nine point lead late in the game, only to lose in double-overtime as Milan's fourth quarter comeback was aided when the timekeeper delayed restarting the clock by a few seconds on one occasion. Milan went on to shock the state by winning the 1953 regional title and sweeping the semi-state to advance to the final four, finally bowing out in a 56–37 semifinal blowout to the Bears of South Bend Central High School. The nucleus of that team returned for the 1953–54 season with expectations of tournament success unprecedented for such a small school. The 1953–54 season With four starters returning from the semifinalists, Milan was considered a lock to win both the Ripley County tournament and the sectional. To prepare for the rigors of tournament play, Milan scheduled several games against larger, more prestigious schools, including a tournament at Frankfort, where they would suffer their first loss of the season, a 49–47 nail-biter against the hosts. Milan cruised through the rest of the schedule before suffering a late-season upset to Aurora, who were also coming into a successful period in their basketball history. =Schedule= *Milan 52; Rising Sun 36 — W *Milan 64; Vevay 41 — W *Milan 48; Osgood 44 — W *Milan 61; Seymour 43 — W *Milan 24; Brookville 20 — W *Milan 67; Hanover 36 — W *Milan 50; Lawrenceburg 41 — W *Milan 39; Versailles 35 — W *Milan 47; Frankfort 49 — L *Milan 52; Columbus 49 — W *Milan 74; Rising Sun 60 — W *Milan 52; Versailles 46 — W *Milan 41; Napoleon 34 — W *Milan 44; Holton 30 — W *Milan 38; Hanover 33 — W *Milan 61; Napoleon 29 — W *Milan 42; Sunman 36 — W *Milan 48; Versailles 42 — W *Milan 38; North Vernon 37 — W *Milan 45; Aurora 54 — L *Milan 38; Osgood 30 — W 1954 IHSAA Boys Basketball Tournament Anticipating a run deep into the later rounds of the Indiana High School Athletic Association boys basketball tournament, Milan expected to easily take the sectional before facing a tough test in the regional and a possible rematch against Aurora. =Sectional at Versailles= *Heavily favored to take the Versailles Sectional, Milan did not disappoint as the Indians crushed tiny Cross Plains before dispatching traditional rivals Versailles and Osgood to take their fifth sectional title.

As schools consolidated throughout Indiana, the days of small-town success gradually ended. Fewer than half of the 751 schools entered in the 1954 tournament exist today. With increased urbanization and suburbanization throughout the state, Indiana schools became much larger and the urban schools that had the most success in the tournament increased their domination of the tournament. No school with an enrollment less than five times that of Milan's ever won the tournament again under the one-class system that was replaced with a multi-class tournament in 1997. The smallest school to win the state tournament after Milan was Plymouth in 1982, led by future NBA star and coach Scott Skiles. Milan's enrollment is now over twice as large as it was in 1954. Thirty-three years later, the film Hoosiers, a fictionalized account based on Milan's 1952–54 seasons, opened to positive reviews, renewing interest in the team and its legacy. The film combined game play from both the 1952–53 and 1953–54 seasons, merging the 1953 quarter-final opponent, the South Bend Bears, with the scoring pattern from the 1954 championship win against Muncie Central. The 2010 run of Butler—a university team that to this day plays its home games in the same building that hosted Milan's historic victory—to the Final Four led to countless comparisons with both the 1954 Milan team and its cinematic alter ego of Hickory High. The Bulldogs stunned perennial power Michigan State 52–50 in the national semifinal to make it to the National Title Game, where they lost to Duke 61–59. (Butler forward Gordon Hayward narrowly missed a last-second half court shot that would have won the game, and the national championship, for Butler.) Appropriately, the Milan team, all but one of whom were alive at the time of the tournament, attended the Final Four (held just up the road at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis) as guests of Indiana governor Mitch Daniels.

PEX6 is an AAA ATPase that localizes to the peroxisome. PEX6 forms a hexamer with PEX1 and is recruited to the membrane by PEX26.  Function  From yeast to plants to humans, there is only one verified function of PEX6; PEX6 (and PEX1) removes PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane so that PEX5 may do additional rounds of peroxisomal import. Human PEX6 can genetically complement plant pex6 mutants, which highlights functional conservation. Work with pex6 mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that PEX6 may have a role in consuming oil body (plant-specific lipid droplets). Work with yeast pex6 mutants has shown that PEX6 is a key player in the autophagy of peroxisomes called pexophagy.  Related diseases  Mutations in the genes encoding PEX6, along with PEX1, are the leading causes of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger Syndrome spectrum, infantile Refsum disease, and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy.

The encoded protein is a transmembrane protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and catalyzes the transport of phosphate ions across it for the purpose of oxidative phosphorylation. There are two significant isoforms of this gene expressed in human cells, which differ slightly in structure and function. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial phosphate carrier deficiency (MPCD), a fatal disorder of oxidative phosphorylation symptomized by lactic acidosis, neonatal hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and death within the first year of life.  Structure  The SLC25A3 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 12 in position 23.1 and spans 8,376 base pairs. The gene has 9 exons and produces a 40.1 kDa protein composed of 362 amino acids. The encoded protein (PHC) is a multi-pass transmembrane protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; it contains six transmembrane segments, emerging into a large extramembranous loop. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of this protein protrude toward the cytosol. PHC contains three related segments arranged in tandem which are related to those found in other characterized members of the mitochondrial carrier family. There exist two transcript variants of this protein, PHC-A and PHC-B, which differ by 13 amino acids. Isoform A contains 42 amino acids while Isoform B contains 41. In vitro, the isoforms differ in their substrate affinities and transport rates.  Function  The encoded protein (PHC) catalyzes the transport of phosphate from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix, either by proton cotransport or in exchange for hydroxyl ions. In the final steps of oxidative phosphorylation, this protein catalyzes the uptake of a phosphate ion with a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The availability of inorganic phosphate for oxidative phosphorylation is mainly dependent on PHC activity. To substantially affect oxidative phosphorylation, PHC depletion must be severe, exceeding 85%. This protein may be involved in regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial phosphate carrier deficiency (MPCD), a fatal disorder of oxidative phosphorylation. Symptoms include lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and neonatal hypotonia; afflicted patients die within the first year of life. Isoform A of this gene is expressed at high levels in heart, pancreatic, and skeletal muscle cells while Isoform B is expressed in all tissues, albeit poorly. In the sole recorded case of a mutation in this gene, a homozygous mutation (c.215G>A) in the alternatively spliced exon 3A of this gene caused an amino acid replacement (G72E) in Isoform A. This leads to ATP synthase deficiency in muscle cells, which express Isoform A, but not in fibroblasts, which express Isoform B, causing MPCD and the aforementioned standard symptoms.

Early life Sinclair was born in Thornton, Wellington, New Zealand, to 16-year-old Margaret Hocking of Cornish extraction and a mixed Polynesian father who left, never to return, when he was three. A decade later, his mother remarried, and Sinclair did not get along with his stepfather. It was with some relief that, upon completing high school, he left home to take up an opening as a labourer-cadet with the Forestry Service at the age of 16. At 14, he was deeply affected by Edgar Snow's glowing 1937 account of the Chinese Communist Party, Red Star Over China, later rating it the book that most influenced his outlook. Career in journalism Sinclair started as a 16-year-old copy boy at the Wellington Evening Post and then The Dominion for a year. Having left New Zealand in 1961, he lucked into his first job in Australia as the sole employee (and editor) of the south Queensland tourist-targeted rag, the Surfers Paradise Guide, and, by 1962, he was working as a reporter at Brisbane's The Telegraph. He spent a year crime reporting at Sydney's The Daily Telegraph from 1964, another year back at The Dominion, and then joined the sensationalist New Zealand Truth. He finally left his second stint at The Daily Telegraph to join The Star, another sensationalist tabloid, in Hong Kong, as news editor, in 1968. He arrived on the SS Oronsay in the spring of that year. Sinclair described the quality of his journalism in the 60s as \\"disgraceful\\" and \\"irresponsible\\" while taking to it with unbridled and unashamed alacrity. The New Zealand Truth, where he had been a reporter, was a > training ground for generations of journalistic hoodlums, practised evaders > of the truth and reporters who lived by skillful exaggeration and downright > lies. On seeing out his two-year contract at The Star in 1970, he moved to the Hong Kong Standard as news editor. In 1972, he became news editor at the South China Morning Post, and, after a July 1978 demotion resulting from alcoholism, continued on in the newsroom till 1986, returning in 2003 to write for the Post's 100th anniversary publication, Post Impressions. Sinclair was the author of some 24 books. His first, No Cure, No Pay: Salvage in the South China Seas was published by SCMP Books in 1981 and his last, Tell Me A Story: Forty Years of Newspapering in Hong Kong and China, also by SCMP Books, was published shortly before his death. Political standpoint Sinclair was deeply distrustful of democracy for Hong Kong, believing that one man, one vote would turn it into a \\"give-it-away society\\". In 2007, Sinclair stated that he would \\"sooner vote for a rabid dog\\" than a democrat. He scoffed at suggestions of future communist repression and the jailing of dissidents. Personal life Sinclair married his first wife, Robyn, in Sydney in 1963, but the marriage only lasted four years. He married Kathleen \\"Kit\\" Allred in Hong Kong on 16 December 1972. Allred was a volunteer with the US Peace Corps who had moved to Hong Kong from Korea three years earlier. They had two children, David and Kiri. Sinclair died at the age of 65 after a long battle with cancer. Four days before his death, he had attended a book signing at Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club - an event even attended by Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang who he counted among his many friends, including Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew and billionaire transport magnate Sir Tang Shiu-kin among his friends. A celebration of his life was held at the Hong Kong Police Officers' Club on 7 January 2008 attended by 300 government officials, close friends and colleagues. Honours In 1983, Sinclair received an MBE from Queen Elizabeth for his contribution to the community through journalism. He was named \\"Person Of The Year\\" for 2007 in a poll run by the Government-owned radio station, RTHK.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, and is most closely related to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), are activated through protein phosphorylation cascades and act as integration points for multiple biochemical signals. This kinase is localized in the nucleus, and has been reported to be activated in fibroblasts upon treatment with serum or phorbol esters.  Discovery  ERK3/MAPK6 was initially cloned from the rat brain cDNA library by homology screening with probes ERK1 derived probe.  Gene location  In humans, MAPK 6 gene is located on the distal arm of chromosome 15 (15q21.2). It is 47.01kb long and is transcribed in the centromere to telomere orientation. It consist of 6 exons with the translation initiation codon which is located in exon2.  Structure  It is an atypical member of the mitogen activated kinases family. The molecular mass of the translated protein is approximately 100kDa, and is made up of 721 amino acid residues. It contains a typical kinase domain at the N- terminal and an extended C- terminal. The first 150 residues at c- terminal are 50% similar to ERK4 protein. At the kinase domain it exhibits about 70% similarity with the ERK4 protein. The activation loop of the phosphorylation motif contains only one phospho acceptor site (Ser-Glu-Gly). The structure is predicted by homology modelling using the crystal structure of phoshphorylated ERK2. According to the model, the structure of ERK3/MAPK6 kinase domain resembles other MAP kinases. The modelled ERK3/MAPK6 kinase domain is predicted to fold with a topology similar to other MAP kinases.  Expression  ERK3/MAPK6 is widely expressed protein however it is expressed in significantly higher amounts in skeletal muscles and brain. It is localized in cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells. ERK3/MAPK6 is a highly unstable protein and has a very little half life of less than an hour. It is degraded by ubiquitin mediated proteasomal pathway.  Function  It is very important for neonatal growth and survival. ERK3/MAPK6 forms a complex with microtubule associated protein2 (MAP2) and MAPKAPK5 which mediates the phosphorylation of MAPKAPK5 which in turn phosphorylates ERK3/MAPK6 at serine 189 residue mediating the entry into cell cycle. It also acts as a regulator for T- cell development. The catalytic activity of ERK3/MAPK6 plays an important for the proper differentiation of T-cells in the thymus. The long c- terminal is responsible for thymic differentiation.  Role in cancer  ERK3/MAPK6 interacts with and phosphorylated steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) This coreceptor is an oncogenic protein which when overexpressed at serine 857 leads to cancer. After the phosphorylation of SRC-3 results in the upregulation of MMP activity ERK3-mediated phosphorylation at S857 was essential for interaction of SRC-3 with the ETS transcription factor PEA3, which promotes upregulation of MMP gene expression and proinvasive activity.

Function  ATM (ATM) is a protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand damages also activate the Fanconi anemia core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). The FA core complex monoubiquitinates the downstream targets FANCD2 and FANCI. ATM activates (phosphorylates) CHEK2 and FANCD2 CHEK2 phosphorylates BRCA1. Ubiquinated FANCD2 complexes with BRCA1 and RAD51. The PALB2 protein acts as a hub, bringing together BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 at the site of a DNA double- strand break, and also binds to RAD51C, a member of the RAD51 paralog complex RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (BCDX2). The BCDX2 complex is responsible for RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. RAD51 plays a major role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during double strand break repair. In this process, an ATP dependent DNA strand exchange takes place in which a single strand invades base-paired strands of homologous DNA molecules. RAD51 is involved in the search for homology and strand pairing stages of the process. The clinical phenotype of mutational defects in all Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation groups is similar. This phenotype is characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, cancer proneness and typical birth defects. The main cellular phenotype is hypersensitivity to DNA damage, particularly inter-strand DNA crosslinks. The FA proteins interact through a multi-protein pathway. DNA interstrand crosslinks are highly deleterious damages that are repaired by homologous recombination involving coordination of FA proteins and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1). The Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL). A critical step in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 by the RING E3 ligase FANCL. FANCL comprises 3 domains, a RING domain that interacts with E2 conjugating enzymes, a central domain required for substrate interaction, and an N-terminal E2-like fold (ELF) domain that interacts with FANCB. The ELF domain of FANCL is also required to mediate a non-covalent interaction between FANCL and ubiquitin. The ELF domain is required to promote efficient DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vertebrate cells, suggesting an important function of FANCB and ubiquitin binding by FANCL in vivo. A nuclear complex containing FANCL (as well as FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCM) is essential for the activation of the FANCD2 protein to the mono-ubiquitinated isoform. In normal, non-mutant, cells FANCD2 is mono-ubiquinated in response to DNA damage. Activated FANCD2 protein co-localizes with BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein) at ionizing radiation-induced foci and in synaptonemal complexes of meiotic chromosomes (see Figure: Recombinational repair of double strand damage).

It is not known when Hou Sizhi was born, but it is known that he was from Tang's capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). He was said to be poor and unable to make a living from selling bread, and so he served as a servant at the household of the general Gao Yuanli () in Heng Prefecture (恆州, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). In 690, he was accused of inappropriate conduct, and the prefect of Heng Prefecture, Pei Zhen, was set to sentence him to caning. A local official advised him to make a secret report to Wu Zetian, who was then empress dowager and regent over her son Emperor Ruizong, and he did so, accusing Pei and Emperor Ruizong's granduncle Li Yuanming () the Prince of Shu of plotting treason together. Empress Dowager Wu, already looking for excuses to act against senior members of the Li imperial clan, exiled Li Yuanming and executed Pei and Li Yuanming's son Li Dan () the Prince of Yuzhang. She gave Hou a general title, but Hou offered to become an assistant censor, which was ranked lower but which had the authority to investigate crimes. Empress Dowager Wu asked him, \\"You are illiterate. How can you be a censor?\\" Hou responded, \\"A xiezhi is also illiterate, but it could use its horn to hit the evil!\\" (The xiezhi was a mythical one-horned animal that was intelligent, and whenever it saw two people fighting, it would use its horn to hit the wrong side.) Empress Dowager was pleased and made him a censor. On one occasion, she was set to award a house to Hou that was seized from a person accused of treason. Hou declined and stated, \\"I hate treasonous individuals, and I do not want a house from one!\\" She was further impressed. In 692 (by which time Wu Zetian had seized the throne from Emperor Ruizong and established her own Zhou Dynasty), a number of officials—the chancellors Ren Zhigu, Di Renjie, and Pei Xingben, along with other officials Pei Xuanli (), Lu Xian (), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen () -- were accused of treason. The secret police official Lai Junchen was in charge of the investigations, but Hou was specifically charged with interrogating Wei. Wei refused to admit to treason, and Hou reacted by having him dragged on the ground feet-first. Wei sarcastically stated, \\"I am so unlucky that it is like having fallen from a donkey with my feet stuck to the stirrup, and being dragged by the beast.\\" Hou, in anger, increased the speed of the dragging, and Wei responded, \\"Hou Sizhi, if you want my head, just cut it off. Do not ask me to admit treason.\\" He further criticized Hou for using vulgar speech unfit for an imperial official—which, oddly, caused Hou to stop the torture and thank him for teaching him to speak properly. (Ultimately, the seven officials were spared their lives but were exiled.) Hou, however, continued to be known for his vulgar speech, which the other officials often joked about. When the censor Huo Xianke () once laughed about Hou's speech, Hou, in anger, reported it to Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian rebuked Huo for laughing about one of her trusted officials—but when Huo then informed Wu of Hou's vulgarities, she laughed as well. Meanwhile, Hou, seeing that Lai had divorced his previous wife and forced the daughter of one Wang Qingshen (), of a prominent clan, to marry him, also wanted to marry a daughter from a prominent clan—the daughter of one Li Ziyi () -- and this matter was discussed by the chancellors. The chancellor Li Zhaode thought this to be extremely inappropriate and vowed to act against Hou. After Wu Zetian decreed in 693 that no one was to use silk, Hou was accused of improperly using silk, and Li Zhaode investigated the case. He took this opportunity to have Hou battered to death.

It has necessary roles in the formation and stability of microtubules from the centrosome and has been found to be linked to human brain size variation in males. Multiple transcript variants exist for this gene, but the full-length nature of only two has been determined. CDK5RAP2 is homologous to the Drosophila protein centrosomin (cnn) and paralogous to myomegalin, which in mammals contains an Olduvai domain, a domain implicated in human brain size evolution.  Function  CDK5RAP2 is necessary for the proper formation, anchoring and orientation of microtubules from the centrosome. It binds with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), and this is required for the γTuRC to attach to the centrosome. CDK5RAP2 also binds to p25, a form of CDK5R1 that serves as the activating subunit of CDK5, which is involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation. CDK5RAP2 therefore has a role in neuronal differentiation. CDK5RAP2 is also necessary as a scaffolding protein in the centrosomal corona of Dictyostelium.  Clinical significance  = Human brain size variation = An MRI study has demonstrated a link between common human variation in the CDK5RAP2 gene and brain structure. More specifically, associations were found between several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and brain cortical surface area and total brain volume. These associations were found exclusively in male subjects, and all SNPs were located either in the last 7 introns or downstream of the gene. The functional significance of these loci is not yet known. However, given their location close to regulatory elements, it is possible that they are involved in gene regulation, which suggests that common variance in brain structure could be associated with differences in gene regulation rather than protein structure, consistent with findings in other complex human traits. CDK5RAP2 is a paralogue of myomegalin, which in mammals contains an Olduvai domain, a domain with human-specific duplications that have been implicated in human brain size evolution. = Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly = Mutations in CDK5RAP2 cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly type 3.

Plot The Jester is a thriller novel focused on a man named Hugh De Luc. Set in the year 1096, Hugh is living in a time of unrest when peasants like himself are treated poorly. The region is ruled by the tyrannical Duke Baldwin. In seeking freedom, Hugh joins the Crusades. While invading one of the Turk cities, Hugh realizes the horror around him and decides he cannot face it. He passes a church, where he sees a priest being beaten, and kills the men attacking him. At the dead priest's side lies a staff, which Hugh decides to carry with him from then on. Hugh flees the Holy Land, returning to his home village of Veille du Père, only to find that his wife Sophie has been kidnapped, his son Phillipe dead (born after Hugh had left), and his inn destroyed. Townsfolk inform him that the attackers wore no colors except for black crosses sewn onto their tunics and that the attackers were dishonored knights who seemed to be looking for Hugh particularly. Angered, he wanders into the forest, searching for Sophie, who Hugh believes is still alive and being held captive in the dungeons at Treille. After being attacked by a boar, he is saved by Emilie, a woman who reminds him of Sophie. She turns out to be highborn — a daughter of the King of France — though he does not learn of this until much later. She takes care of him in her hometown of Borée, which is the dukedom of her cousin's husband, Stephen. Hugh's plan is to infiltrate the castle of Lord Baldwin at Treille. With the help of Emilie and Norbert (the jester at Borée), he pretends to be a jester. Through Lord Baldwin and his court, Hugh learns that his wife was never in Treille with Baldwin, so he travels back to Borée to see Emilie once more. Winning Anne's (Emilie's cousin) ear, Hugh eventually finds that Sophie was in the dungeon of Borée all along; Anne had been lying to him. Killing three of the Tafurs (Anne's guards, which turn out to be the dishonored knights who took his wife), Hugh runs back to Veille du Père. By then, he is sure that the men are hunting him, but he knows not for what. The Tafurs were a fearsome war band, with rumors circulating that they resorted to cannibalism, either deliberately or as a last resort. The Tafurs launch an attack on Veille du Père, but Hugh and his friends had prepared traps, and so killed all but one. The last Tafur attacks Hugh before his escape, breaking his staff, revealing a hidden reliquary — the Holy Lance that pierced Jesus Christ's side as he lay on the cross. Peasants flock to the spear, so Hugh marches on Treille and takes Baldwin prisoner. Next, he marches on Borée. The leader of the Tafurs, \\"Black Cross,\\" attacks Hugh but he and the rest of the Tafurs are defeated. Stephen (Anne's evil husband who had recently returned from the Crusades), threatened to kill Emilie, but a plot by Hugh and Anne saves her. Stephen runs into the castle with Hugh in pursuit, and Ann kills Stephen with the Holy Lance.

Andy Varipapa (March 31, 1891 - August 25, 1984) was a professional and trick bowler. He became famous around the world for his trick bowling shots. Life and career Varipapa was born Andrea Varipapa in Carfizzi, a small Arbëreshë comune in the Calabria region of Italy, the son of Francesco and Concetta (née Fuoco) Varipapa. After his father's death, he and his family moved to the United States, where they settled in Brooklyn, New York City. Before becoming a professional bowler, he also played baseball, golf and had a try at a boxing career. He started his bowling career in the 1920s and soon made a reputation for himself in this sport, becoming one of the first pro bowlers in the country. Varipapa was considered to be \\"the greatest one-man bowling show on Earth\\" because of his array of exhibition rolls, such as a \\"boomerang ball\\" that Varipapa would slowly roll down the lane, only to have it return. He was famous for his ability to convert splits and, astoundingly, could regularly convert the 7-10 split by rolling one ball from each hand, simultaneously. A film shows the balls crossing paths before meeting the pins. He made many demonstration short films over his career, including 1934's Strikes and Spares with Sally McKee and Buster Brodie. Beyond his trick shot exhibitions, Varipapa was a solid professional bowler. In 1947, at the age of 56, he won the prestigious BPAA All-Star competition (predecessor to the U.S. Open) in a gruelling 100 game format, making him the oldest winner ever. He became the first to win two years in a row when he repeated in 1948 in spite of a dramatic comeback by Joe Wilman, who had won the All-Star in 1946. In 1949, Varipapa came close to a three-peat, finishing second to winner Connie Schwoegler of Madison, Wisconsin. He was inducted into the USBC (United States Bowling Congress) Hall of Fame in 1957. Varipapa lived to be 93 years old and was an active bowler well into old age. At the age of 78, he taught himself to bowl left-handed, as his right hand was giving him difficulties. Within two years he averaged 180, a testament to his skills and longevity. The \\"Andy Varipapa 300\\" game was so-named after Andy joked that a string of 12 consecutive strikes spanning two games should count as a 300. In 1950, he published the pamphlet Better Bowling, which was expanded two years later into Andy Varipapa's Quick Way to Better Bowling (Garden City Books). Personal life During his lifetime Varipapa was also known as \\"The Greek\\", a clear reference to his Arbëreshë ancestry.Arbëreshë people were often nicknamed \\"Greeks\\" in Italy, since a lot of them originally came from Greece and not only from Albania.

For the last part of its history, it attempted to target the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania market. The station's studios were located in Wilmington. History WVUE first signed in March 1949 as WDEL-TV, owned by the Steinman family of Lancaster, Pennsylvania along with WDEL radio (AM 1150 and FM 93.7, now WSTW). It received a full license on June 30. It shared a studio and tower on Shipley Road in north Wilmington with its radio sisters. It operated on channel 7 as the NBC affiliate for Wilmington, and also carried a secondary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network. At the time, Wilmington was a separate television market. However, WDEL-TV found the going somewhat difficult. It was forced to operate at only 1,000 watts because it was sandwiched between New York City's WJZ-TV (now WABC-TV) and Washington, D.C.'s WMAL-TV (now WJLA-TV). This resulted in hit-or-miss reception outside of Wilmington itself. In 1951, WDEL-TV moved to channel 12 for two reasons—to allow its sister station in Lancaster, WGAL-TV, to move to channel 8 and to alleviate the aforementioned interference from WJZ-TV and WMAL-TV. The channel switch allowed WDEL-TV to significantly increase its power to cover much of the Philadelphia market. While Philadelphia already had an NBC affiliate, WPTZ-TV (channel 3, later WRCV-TV and now KYW-TV), its transmitter was not strong enough to cover Wilmington at the time. The Steinmans realized that Philadelphia and Wilmington were going to be a single market (Wilmington is only southwest of Philadelphia). In hopes of boosting the station's profile, the Steinmans persuaded Joe Pyne, who had been a popular talk show host on WILM radio, to come back to Wilmington and start a talk show there. Pyne stayed at the station for two years before going to Los Angeles. In early 1955, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officially collapsed Wilmington into the Philadelphia market. By this time, NBC was negotiating to buy channel 3, and informed the Steinmans that in the event negotiations were successful, it would pull its affiliation from channel 12. With that in mind, the Steinmans opted to sell channel 12 to Paul F. Harron, owner of Philadelphia radio powerhouse WIBG (now WNTP). The sale closed in March 1955, and channel 12 changed its calls to WPFH, after its new owner. Harron turned channel 12 into Philadelphia's first independent station. However, he continued to lease space on WDEL-AM-FM's tower. Two years later, Harron sold WFPH and WIBG to Storer Broadcasting, who changed channel 12's calls to WVUE. Storer operated the station out of a studio on Baynard Boulevard in downtown Wilmington, with a satellite studio at Suburban Station in Philadelphia. Storer also moved the transmitter to Glassboro, New Jersey. Plans were in the works to build a new transmitter at the Roxborough tower farm in Philadelphia, but while Storer bought land for a new tower, it was never built. In 1958, Storer brought Pyne back to Wilmington to host a late-night talk show. Pyne's program reportedly boosted the station's ratings 30-fold. However, it wasn't enough to keep the station going. Later in 1958, Storer bought WITI in Milwaukee. At that time, Storer owned VHF stations in Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Toledo in addition to WVUE, and the purchase of WITI would have left the company one VHF station over the FCC ownership limit of the time. As a result, Storer had to either sell off or shut down WVUE in order to comply with the ownership limit. There were no interested buyers, however, so Storer took the station off the air on September 13 of the same year. The license was returned to the FCC on December 18. Around this time, Philadelphia's public television station, WHYY- TV, was looking for a way to boost its coverage. Operating on channel 35, it had difficulty attracting an audience because of the limitations of UHF's reach at the time. Shortly after WVUE went off the air, WHYY-TV's owners, the Metropolitan Philadelphia Educational Radio and Television Corporation, asked the FCC for permission to move to channel 12. There weren't any free VHF allocations in Philadelphia itself, and the channel 12 allocation in Wilmington was the only available VHF allocation on the New Jersey or Delaware sides of the market that could cover Philadelphia with a city-grade signal. The FCC granted the request in early 1963, and on September 12, WHYY-TV moved to channel 12. It operated from the old WVUE facility in Glassboro until moving to the Roxborough tower farm in 1971. The WVUE calls currently belong to the Fox-affiliated television station in New Orleans.

Structure  The NLRC4 protein is highly conserved across mammalian species. It bears homology to the C. elegans Ced4 protein. It contains an n-terminal CARD domain, a central nucleotide binding/NACHT domain, and a c-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain. It belongs to a family of NLR proteins that includes the transcriptional co- activator CIITA and the canonical inflammasome protein NLRP3. A truncated murine NLRC4 was the first member of this family whose crystal structure was solved.  Function  NLRC4 is best associated with triggering formation of the inflammasome. Unlike NLRP3, certain inflammasome-dependent functions of NLRC4 may be carried out independently of the inflammasome scaffold ASC. Human Ced4 homologs include APAF1, NOD1 (CARD4), and NOD2 (CARD15). These proteins have at least 1 N-terminal CARD domain followed by a centrally located nucleotide-binding domain (NBD or NACHT) and a C-terminal regulatory domain, found only in mammals, that contains either WD40 repeats or leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). CARD12 is a member of the Ced4 family and can induce apoptosis.  Interactions  NLRC4 has been shown to interact with NAIP (there is one human NAIP but mice express at least 4 distinct NAIP proteins). The NAIP/NLRC4 interaction may determine the ligand specificity. NLRC4-dependent inflammasome activity activates CASP1. Under certain circumstances, NLRC4 and NLRP3 may occupy the same inflammasome complex.  Clinical significance  Humans bearing activating mutations in NLRC4 can develop an autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by acute fever, hepatitis, very high serum ferritin, and other features suggestive of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Some patients also developed a potentially life- threatening enterocolitis that abated during early childhood. In these patients, chronic and extraordinary elevation of serum IL-18 is found, in distinction from patients with NLRP3 mutations who develop Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes.

Bst1 is a stromal cell line-derived glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule that facilitates pre-B-cell growth. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits 33% similarity with CD38. BST1 expression is enhanced in bone marrow stromal cell lines derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The polyclonal B-cell abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis may be, at least in part, attributed to BST1 overexpression in the stromal cell population. CD157 and CD38 are both members of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family of enzymes that catalyze the formation of nicotinamide and adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+, although CD157 is a much weaker catalyst than CD38. cADPR is required for regulation of Ca22+ in cells. Only CD38 hydrolyzed cADPR to ADPR. CD38 is widely expressed in tissues, whereas CD157 e is primarily found in gut and lymphoid tissue. CD157 has an important role in controlling the migration of leukocytes, the adhesion of leukocytes to blood vessel walls, and the passage of leukocytes through blood vessel walls. CD157 is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, and is being evaluated as a diagnostic sign, as a treatment target, and as a means of monitoring treatment progress.

Function  Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a member of the SFRP family that contains a cysteine-rich domain homologous to the putative Wnt-binding site of Frizzled proteins. SFRPs act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling. The expression of SFRP4 in ventricular myocardium correlates with apoptosis related gene expression. SFRP4 is a hub gene in a Type 2 Diabetes-associated gene coexpression module in human islets, and reduces glucose-induced insulin secretion through decreased β-cell exocytosis. Expression and release of SFRP4 from islets is enhanced by interleukin-1β. SFRP4 is elevated in serum several years before clinical diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals who have above-average levels of SFRP4 in the blood are five times more likely to develop diabetes in the next few years than those with below-average levels.

He was given an honorary doctorate in \\"recognition of his contribution to the field of law and jurisprudence\\" by the North Orissa University in September 2009.  Education  After finishing his schooling in Bombay, he studied at the Fergusson College in Pune and thereafter at the Government Law College, Bombay. He graduated with a law degree in 1952. He thereafter joined the London School of Economics. In the summer of 1955, he was one of the first students from Great Britain to be invited on a study visit to China. In 1956, he graduated from the London University with a BSc in Economics. The same year, he was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn, London. He was part of the Harvard International Seminar in 1967.  Career  Desai started practice in Bombay High Court in 1956. He was designated as a Senior Advocate on 8 August 1977. As an Advocate he appeared in a large number of cases in the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court particularly those involving issues of accountability in public life & transparency in Governance. Some of the cases of general interest include:- (a) Sakharam Binder77 (1975) BomLR 13. The delicate question of censoring plays in Maharashtra was curiously governed by the Bombay Police Act. The Police took the view that the tender morality of the Bombay audience could not withstand a play about illicit sexual relations. which struck down the pre censorship of dramatic performances. The play \\"Sakharam Binder\\" as being censored by the Police on the ground of obscenity. Justice Kania (later on the Chief Justice of India) saw the play at a special audition. He set aside the Police decision and also struck down the relevant provisions of the Act as unguided and unconstitutional The trial itself became the subject matter of books and other plays.After passing through the legal fire the play suddenly caught on and had the unique distinction of being performed in four languages, namely, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi and English at the same time in the same city. The play became a popular paperbook and also led to a Marathi book by Sarang Kamlakar called \\"Binderche Divas\\". It again found a place later on the stage as a part of the theme of a Marathi play \\"Sex, Morality and Sakharam Binder\\". (b) Piloo ModiPiloo Mody Vs. State, Unreported.

Justice Lentin found that there was quid pro quo and held that the administration was accountable even when it extracted donations for a public trust. The Chief Minister had to resign his office promptly. He was Legal Correspondent for Times of India from 1963 to 1969. Mr. Desai was Professor of Law in Law College, Bombay from 1964 and Lecturer in Law in Bombay College of Journalism from 1967-1972. Desai moved from Bombay to New Delhi in 1989, when he was appointed Solicitor General of India by then Prime Minister V.P. Singh. After December 1990 after resigning as Solicitor General of India, he continued practising in Delhi. He was appointed Attorney General for India on 9 July 1996 by Prime Minister H.D. Devegowda and continued to hold office under Prime Minister I.K. Gujral till he resigned as on 6 May 1998. Some of the cases of general interest in Supreme Court include the case of – (a) Ramanna ShettyRamana Shetty Vs. International Airport Authority of India, ( 1979) 3 SCC 489. on the obligation of the State to act fairly. The case dealt with a tender for a food stall in the Bombay Airport where despite the conditions of eligibility a non-eligible person was given the allotment.

The Supreme Court accepted the submission that Member of Parliament would be a public servant and would be subject to the Prevention of Corruption Act. By a narrow majority the Court held that a Member of Parliament had immunity regarding any scrutiny of the reason as to why he cast a vote in a given way and a court could not hold an inquiry into whether he received any bribe to induce him to vote in a given manner; (c) Vineet Narain[1] Vineet Narain Vs. Union Of India, ( 1998) 1 SCC 226. about powers of a Court to monitor investigation against political leaders. The Court passed a detailed order after considering the report of Independent Review Committee regarding working of the Central Investigation Agency and Central Vigilance Commission and gave mandatory directions regarding implementing the same. One distinct contribution of the Bench was to evolve the concept of \\"continuing mandamus\\" so that a Court could oversee whether its orders were being carried out; (d) Narmada DamNarmada Bachao Andolan Vs.

Proteoglycans consist of one relatively small protein core and attached large glycosaminoglycan side chains. To block the very formation of these side chains xylosyltransferase (XYLT1) which attaches xylose to a serine of the protein core as initiation for glycosaminoglycan chain extension, was targeted by a class of designed DNA molecules. These molecules are called DNA-enzymes which were designed to specifically cleave XYLT1 mRNA within cells. DNA-enzymes are readily taken up by mammalian cells, but are more stable and require much lower concentrations then siRNA. XTYL1 DNA-enzyme in co-cultures of neurons with neurocan secreting cells displayed a marked increase of axon outgrowth. Rats with defined spinal cord lesions, i.a. the clinically relevant contusion injury, treated with XTYL1 DNA-enzyme administered by micro-infusion pumps or systemically achieved improvements in the horizontal ladder task, enhanced axonal plasticity, growth of the corticospinal tract, no effect on neuropathic pain when using mechanical and thermal allodynia tests and no toxicological or pathological side effects compared to control animals.

M. (2000). Buddlejaceae. Flora Neotropica 81. New York Botanical Garden, USA The species was first described and named by Hope in 1782 Hope, J. (1782). Verh. Holl. Maatsch. Weetensch. Haarlem 20(2): 417-418. t.11. 1782. Description Buddleja globosa is a large shrub to tall, with grey fissured bark. The young branches are subquadrangular and tomentose, bearing sessile or subsessile lanceolate or elliptic leaves 5-15 cm long by 2-6 cm wide, glabrescent and bullate above and tomentose below. The deep-yellow to orange leafy-bracted inflorescences comprise one terminal and < 7 pairs of pedunculate globose heads, 1.2-2.8 cm in diameter, each with 30-50 flowers, heavily honey-scented. Ploidy: 2n = 38 (diploid). In common with many New World Buddlejaceae species B. globosa is dioecious: although the flowers appear hermaphrodite in having both male and female parts, only the anthers or pistils are functional in a single plant (:'cryptically dioecious'). Cultivation Buddleja globosa was first introduced to the United Kingdom from Chile in 1774, and is now commonly grown as an ornamental and landscape shrub in temperate regions. Unlike B. davidii, introduced over a century later, B. globosa is not invasive owing to its wingless seeds. Hardiness: USDA zones 5-9, RHS H5.Stuart, D. (2006). Buddlejas. Plant Collector Guide. Timber Press, Oregon, USA. The plant was accorded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (record 687) in 1993. =Cultivars= * Buddleja globosa 'Cally Orange' * Buddleja globosa 'Cannington Gold' * Buddleja globosa 'Lemon Ball' * Buddleja globosa 'Los Lagos' * Buddleja globosa 'HCM98017' =Hybrids= * Buddleja × weyeriana B. globosa was hybridized with B. davidii var. magnifica by van de Weyer at Corfe Castle, England, during the First World War, the first cross between an Asiatic and an American species. The F2, rather than F1, generation are named × weyeriana; there are several popular cultivars, notably 'Sungold'.  Uses  Folk medicine attributes to B. globosa wound healing properties, and the infusion of the leaves is used topically for the treatment or wounds, burns and external and internal ulcers.
