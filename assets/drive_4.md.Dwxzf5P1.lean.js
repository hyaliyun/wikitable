Wilderness  Granite rock formations define the wilderness The area is named for Lost Creek, a perennial stream that disappears and reappears before finally joining Goose Creek which empties into the South Platte River at Cheesman Reservoir just east of the Wilderness area. The entire water system of the area forms a watershed for the Platte River Basin. The area is notable for its many rock formations, natural arches, and rounded granite domes and knobs,. These are contained in two ranges of low alpine foothills of the Rocky Mountains: the Kenosha Mountains and the Tarryall Mountains. Bison Peak is the highest peak in the wilderness. Because of its proximity to Denver, the area is quite popular for outdoor recreation in both summer and winter months. Typical activities in the area include hiking, backpacking, rock-climbing, as well as cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and winter camping. There are of trails in the wilderness, including a section of the Colorado Trail that crosses Lost Creek then parallels the northeast boundary toward Kenosha Pass.

The format was based on the dice game Shut the Box. High Rollers debuted on July 1, 1974, as part of NBC's daytime lineup. In September 1975, an accompanying series was launched in syndication and aired once weekly on local stations. Both of these series ended in 1976, with the daytime series ending on June 11, 1976. Alex Trebek was the host for these series. On April 24, 1978, NBC brought High Rollers back with Trebek hosting and aired it until June 20, 1980, when it was one of three series cancelled to make room for The David Letterman Show. The series was produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions.David Schwartz, Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock, The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, 3rd ed., Checkmark Books, 1999, p. 92 In 1987, Merrill Heatter, working solo since his production partner Bob Quigley's retirement in 1981, teamed with Orion Television and its subsidiary Century Towers Productions to revive High Rollers with Wink Martindale as host. This series premiered in daily syndication on September 14, 1987, and aired new episodes until May 27, 1988. Reruns aired until September 9, 1988. GameplayBasics= Two contestants competed. The object was to remove the digits 1 through 9 from a game board by rolling an oversized pair of dice. In order to determine who gained control of the dice, the host asked a toss-up question. The answers were usually multiple choice, true/false, or yes/no. The first contestant to buzz in received the chance to answer, and answering correctly won control. If that contestant did not answer correctly, control went to the opponent. Once in control, a contestant could either roll the dice himself/herself or pass them to the opponent. After rolling, the contestant had to remove one or more digits from the board that added up to the total on the dice. For example, if a 10 was rolled, the contestant could remove any available combination that added up to that number: 1-9, 2‚Äì8, 3‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6, 1‚Äì2‚Äì7, 1‚Äì3‚Äì6, 1‚Äì4‚Äì5, 2‚Äì3‚Äì5, or 1‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì4, providing that none of the digits within the combination had already been removed. Contestants banked prizes by removing individual numbers or combinations of them, depending on the rules. A \\"bad roll\\" occurred if the total showing on the dice did not correspond with any combination of the digits still in play. A contestant making a bad roll immediately lost the game unless he/she had an insurance marker (see below). A contestant clearing the last digit from the board won the game. The winner of each game received any prizes that were banked, or $100 if no prizes had been banked. The first contestant to win two games won the match and advanced to the Big Numbers bonus round. 1974‚Äì76 The original series featured a prize or cash amount hidden under every digit on the gameboard, revealed and added to a contestant's bank only when that digit was removed. Two digits each contained one half of a large prize, usually a new car, boat, or a luxury vacation. To bank this prize, both cards had to be uncovered by the same contestant. If the contestants each revealed one of the two cards, the prize was taken out of play for that game. During the final seven weeks of the first daytime version (April 26 ‚Äì June 11, 1976), the main game was known as \\"Face Lifters\\". Digits were arranged in a 3√ó3 grid and concealed a picture of a famous person. A contestant won the game by correctly identifying the person in the picture. A contestant could take a guess after making a good roll. If a contestant made a bad roll, the opponent was allowed one guess for each remaining digit in the picture. A successful guess won the game plus the prizes belonging to the digits still on the board. If neither contestant guessed the identity correctly, Trebek gave clues until one contestant buzzed- in with the answer. A co-hostess (Ruta Lee, daytime and Elaine Stewart, nighttime) rolled the dice for the contestants. The contestants sat along the long side of the dice table opposite from Trebek. No insurance markers were given in the main game; a bad roll meant an automatic loss. A syndicated version with almost identical rules ran weekly in 1975‚Äì76. Each episode featured the same two contestants competing for the entire show. After the first few episodes the rules were changed so that rather than requiring contestants to win a two-out-of-three match, the winner of each game played the Big Numbers, and the losing contestant returned for another game. The contestants played as many games as possible until time was called. If this happened during a game, the one who had removed more digits won the final game and any prizes accumulated. Under the two-out-of-three game format used in the first few episodes, the contestant also had another chance at the Big Numbers. Like other weekly nighttime game shows at that time, this version had no returning champions. 1978‚Äì80 When the series was revived in 1978 (and originally titled The New High Rollers), the board consisted of three columns with three randomly assigned digits apiece. Each column contained one or more prizes, which were only banked by the contestant who removed the last digit from a column (regardless of who removed the others). The prizes ranged from typical game show gifts (furniture, appliances, trips, etc.) to more unusual items such as a collection of musical dolls or 52 Sunday Kentucky Fried Chicken dinners (a common game show prize of the era). Prizes that were banked but not won during a game were returned to their columns. One new prize was added per column at the beginning of each game, to a maximum of five. When the prizes in a column were won, a new one was placed in that column for the next game. At least one column in each game was designated as a \\"hot column,\\" meaning that all three of its digits could be cleared with a single roll of the dice. Insurance markers could be earned by rolling doubles in the main game. If a contestant made a bad roll while holding a marker, he/she turned it in and rolled again. Making a bad roll without a marker lost the game. Markers earned in the main game did not carry over to the Big Numbers or to the next match. Contestants on this version rolled the dice themselves, instead of having a hostess roll for them. 1987‚Äì88 This version followed the rules of the 1978‚Äì80 version, but with only one prize available in each column. If any prizes were not won during a particular game, they were replaced for the next one (although, on the 1986 pilot episode, prizes not won in a game carried over to the next game).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91JX85voQow Frequently, one column offered a chance to play a special game if the contestant claimed it and won the round. For the special games described below, only one die was used. * Around the World: Each number on a die corresponded to one of five available trips. Rolling a six won all five trips (i.e., a trip around the world) and a $5,000 cash bonus. Later, the $5,000 cash bonus was dropped. * Cookie Jar: The contestant rolls a die and whatever number the contestant rolls is worth $100 times the value of the die. However, rolling a six earns the contestant $1,500. The game was also known as \\"Trick or Treat\\" on the Halloween episode. * Diamond Mine: Each number from one through six was worth some type of jewelry. Rolling the corresponding number won that piece of jewelry. * Dice Derby: This game mimicked a horse race. One horse was designated with even numbers (2, 4 and 6), and the other odd numbers (1, 3 and 5). The contestant rolled the die and the appropriate horse moved one space depending on the outcome. The first horse to move four spaces on the track won the race and a prize for the contestant. The even horse carried a larger prize, which was usually a trip or car, and the odd horse awarded a smaller prize, such as a short vacation or $1,000. * Driver's Test: The contestant controlled a game piece on a twelve space gameboard, arranged in a 4√ó4 ring of spaces. The contestant had six rolls of a die to make the piece land exactly on the \\"CAR\\" space, which was seven spaces away from the starting position. The piece always moved toward the \\"CAR\\" space. If a roll caused it to overshoot the target, the next roll had the piece reversing direction. Failure to win the car won the cash amount on the final resting space, up to $2,500. * For Lovers Only: Each number represented a romantic vacation and the contestant won the trip represented by the number. * Full House: Each number on a die corresponded to a different room of a house. The contestant won the room corresponding to the number rolled. However, if a contestant rolled a six, the contestant won all five rooms in the house. * High Seas: Each number on a die represented a watercraft or a boat. The contestant won that prize represented by that number. * Home Away From Home: Each number represented an RV of some type. The contestant wins that RV represented by that number. *Island Hoppers: Each number represented an island vacation, and the contestant won the trip represented by the number rolled. * It Takes Two: A different prize was assigned to each number on the die. The contestant continued to roll the die until repeating a number, winning the prize corresponding to that number. The game was sometimes called \\"It Takes Two: For the Famous and Rich.\\" * Love Letters: The contestant rolled a die up to six times to reveal letters in a six-letter word. Solving the word at any time won a new car. Otherwise, the contestant won $100 for every letter that was revealed. * Lucky Numbers: The contestant chose a number between one and six, and then rolled the die. A correct hunch won the contestant a new car. * Map Game: An earlier version of \\"Around The World\\" played similarly, except in this game rolling a six won a more expensive single-destination trip rather than a trip around the world. * Millionaire Game: Each number one through six was worth a certain number of California Lottery tickets. Rolling the corresponding number won that number of tickets. * Paris or Bust: The contest rolls a die and if the contestant rolls an even number, the contestant wins a trip to Paris. However, if the contestant rolls an odd number, the contestant wins nothing. * Rabbit Test: The models wore fur coats, one of which was fake worth $600 and the other was real rabbit fur worth $6,000. The contestant won the coat selected that was worn by the model. This game was played on the 1986 pilot episode. * Screen Play: Each number one through six was worth a TV set of some type. Rolling the corresponding number won that TV. * Shop Till You Drop: The contestant rolls a die and the contestant wins a shopping spree worth $1,000 times the number on the die. However, if the contestant rolls a six, then the contestant wins a $10,000 shopping spree. *Smiling Wink's Car Lot: Each number on a die represented a new car, except number six, which represented a \\"clunker,\\" a used but operational car. The contestant rolled the die and won the car corresponding to the number rolled. *Wild Wheels: The contestant rolled a die, and if the contestant rolled an odd number, the contestant won a new car. If a contestant rolled a two or a four, the contestant won 1,000 gallons of gas. However, if a contestant rolled a six, the contestant won two cars. * Wink's Garage Sale: Six prizes, including a worthless gag gift, were available. Rolling a six won the gag gift. =The Big Numbers= The champion rolled the dice and attempted to remove the digits 1 through 9 from the board, with a large prize awarded for clearing them all. A larger game board was used, except on the 1978‚Äì80 series, which used the same board as the main game. Insurance markers were awarded for rolling doubles, with each marker giving the contestant another roll of the dice after making a bad roll. These markers did not carry over to the main game. Contestants were awarded $100 for each digit removed from the board. In the earliest episodes of the 1974‚Äì76 version, contestants could stop and take this money after a good roll. A bad roll with no insurance markers, or eliminating all digits except for the 1, ended the game and forfeited the money. The contestant won a car for removing eight digits, and $10,000 for all nine. The rules were soon changed to eliminate the car bonus and allow the contestant to keep any accumulated money even after making a bad roll. The 1978‚Äì80 version offered three top prizes at different times: a car plus $5,000 cash, the car alone, and the $5,000 alone. The 1987‚Äì88 version offered a prize of $10,000 and was played using a pair of gold-colored dice. The Big Numbers bonus round was also used on Las Vegas Gambit, which was hosted by future High Rollers host Wink Martindale and was also produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions, in 1981. The round used the same dice table as the 1978‚Äì80 version (complete with sound effects) and had the same rules, but the top award was an accumulating jackpot of prizes known as the Gambit Galaxy. Champions stayed on the show until they were defeated or until they won five matches (seven on the 1978‚Äì80 version). On the 1987‚Äì88 version, winning five matches originally won a new car but was later dropped by the time a contestant finally retired undefeated, which led to more cars being awarded in some of the mini-games played during the main game. Production informationPersonnel= Alex Trebek and Wink Martindale served as hosts for High Rollers. Heatter-Quigley staff announcer Kenny Williams served as announcer for the Trebek versions. The 1987 series used Dean Goss as its announcer. The 1970s editions of High Rollers were recorded at NBC's Burbank studio complex while the 1987 series taped at Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Hollywood (though the 1986 pilot was taped instead at ABC Television Center [now The Prospect Studios]).David Schwartz, Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock, The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, 3rd ed., Checkmark Books, 1999, p. 92. Actress Ruta Lee and Gambit card dealer Elaine Stewart were the prize models on the first High Rollers series, with Lee performing those duties on the daytime series and Stewart the weekly syndicated series. As noted above, both women were also the dice rollers for the contestants. Becky Price, Linda Hooks, and Lauren Firestone rotated as models during the 1978 revival while Martindale was assisted on his version by models Crystal Owens and KC Winkler. =Music= Stan Worth composed the theme for the 1974‚Äì76 and 1978‚Äì80 versions. In 1985, Score Productions composed a theme titled \\"Bubble Gum,\\" originally for a failed Heatter pilot called Lucky Numbers (intended as somewhat of a revamp of this show with altered gameplay mechanics), which was reused for the 1987‚Äì88 version. =Merchandise= Two editions of home games were released in 1975, as Big Numbers: The High Rollers Game. The first edition was released by E.S. Lowe, while the second edition was released by Milton Bradley. Both versions have Trebek on the cover. A board game based on the 1987 version was released by Parker Brothers in 1988. The cover shows Martindale and two contestants during a game. A computer game also based on the 1987 version was released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and DOS by Box Office in 1988. The cover has Martindale holding a pair of Golden Dice in his left hand while pointing to them with his right. =International versions= An Australian version aired on the Seven Network for a brief period in 1975, hosted by Garry Meadows with Delvene Delaney and Suzanne Fox as the dealers. The announcer was Max Rowley. A Japanese version called SuperdiceQ, hosted by Masaru Doi, aired on TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) from 1980 to 1984.

It consists normally of an ewer or container of some kind to pour water, and a bowl to catch the water as it falls off the hands. In ecclesiastical usage it refers to all of: the basin in which the priest washes his/her hands; the ritual that surrounds this action in the Catholic Mass; and the architectural feature or fitting where a basin or place for one is recessed into the side wall of the sanctuary, or projects from it. If this last includes or included a drain, it is a piscina used for washing the church plate and other fittings, though the terms are often confused. In secular usage, it is an obsolete term for any sink or basin for washing hands, especially in a lavatory. Ablutions before Christian prayer and worship Cantharus of Pamplona Cathedral in Spain Churches from the time of Constantine the Great were built with an exonarthex that included a fountain known as a cantharus, where Christians would wash their hands, face and feet before entering the worship space. The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity symbolizes \\"separation form sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.\\" Canthari continue to be used in some Orthodox churches, where worshippers also remove their shoes before entering into the presence of God. In many early and medieval monasteries, there would be a large lavabo (lavatorio) where the brethren would wash their hands before entering the church. St. John Chrysostom mentions the custom in his day of all Christians washing their hands before entering the church for worship. This practice was first legislated in the Rule of St. Benedict in the 6th century, but has earlier antecedents. Ecclesiastical usage Mediaeval lavabo in the right-hand transept of Saint Mark's Church in Milan. The name ' (\\"I shall wash\\" in Latin) is derived from the words of Psalm (KJV; in the Septuagint it is Psalm 25), which the celebrant traditionally recites while he/she/they washes his/her/their hands: \\"I will wash my hands in innocence, so will I compass thine altar, O Lord\\". The washing of hands during the recitation of these psalm verses is of very ancient usage in the Catholic Church: > In the third century there are traces of a custom of washing the hands as a > preparation for prayer on the part of all Christians; and from the fourth > century onwards it appears to have been usual for the ministers at the > Communion Service ceremonially to wash their hands before the more solemn > part of the service as a symbol of inward purity.Report of the Royal > Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline (Church of England) 1906 In most liturgical traditions, the priest washes his/her/their hands after vesting, before the beginning of the liturgy. This washing may be accompanied by prayers. Many Christian rites also have the priest wash his/her/their hands before beginning the Eucharistic prayer. In the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII, 11, the hands of the celebrants are washed just before the dismissal of the catechumens. =Western Rite= Lavabo, Le Thoronet Abbey, Le Thoronet, France In the Roman Rite, the celebrant washes his hands privately before vesting for Mass, perhaps using the prayer (Da, Domine, virtutem). Within the rite of Mass he washes his hands after preparing the offerings on the altar. This is the lavabo ceremony proper. It appears in both the Tridentine and the post-Vatican II forms of the Roman Rite Mass. It probably developed from the need to wash the hands after receiving the gifts brought by the people at the offertory as was used at Rome.Duchesne, Louis, Origines du Culte chretien (Paris, 1898), 167, 443. In the Gallican Rite the offerings were prepared before Mass began, as in the Eastern Liturgy of Preparation, so in those rites there was no long offertory rite nor need for a lavabo before the Eucharistic Prayer. In the Middle Ages, the Roman Rite actually had two washings of hands, one before and one after the offertory. The first one has since disappeared, and the one which remains is the second. At High Mass (or sung Mass), in the older rite, and in the more solemn forms available in the newer version, after the offertory, the celebrant incenses the altar and is then incensed himself at the Epistle side (south side of the altar), he remains there while his hands are washed by the acolytes, who ought to be waiting by the credence table. The first acolyte pours water from the cruet over his fingers into a little dish, the second then hands him the towel to dry the fingers. Meanwhile, in the 1962 rubrics he says the psalm verses: \\"I will wash my hands among the innocent...\\", to the end of the psalm (Psalm 25: 6-12 in the Vulgate, which is Psalm 26: 6-12 in the Hebrew). In the newer Mass the celebrant says the prayer: \\"Lord, wash away my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin\\" (Psalm 50:2, Psalm 51:2 in the Hebrew). A bishop at high Mass wears the \\"precious\\" mitre (mitra pretiosa) while he is censed and then washes his hands. A larger silver basin and cruet are generally used for a bishop, though there is no official requirement for this. For the lavabo, the priest will use a simple linen towel, which is often considered to be one of the altar linens, though technically it is not. =Eastern Rites= Patriarch Kirill I of Moscow washing his hands at the Great Entrance during an outdoor Divine Liturgy. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, the priest says the last six verses from Psalm 26: > I will wash my hands in innocence and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord, > that I may hear the voice of Thy praise and tell of all Thy wondrous works. > O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory > dwelleth. Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with men of > blood, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes. > But as for me, in mine innocence have I walked; redeem me, O Lord, and have > mercy on me. My foot hath stood in uprightness; in the congregations will I > bless Thee, O Lord. After vesting, he goes to the thalassidion (piscina) to wash his hands before approaching the prothesis (altar of preparation), where he will prepare the bread and wine for the Divine Liturgy. This lavabo takes place quietly, outside of the view of the congregation. Saint Cyril of Jerusalem mentions a washing of hands that takes place in the sight of the people (Mystagogical Catechism, v). And this still takes place at a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., one at which a bishop is serving). He will wash his hands as he stands at the kathedra in the nave of the church. This takes place during the reading of the Little Hours after he has been solemly vested by two subdeacons. The subdeacons and a server will approach the bishop; the server holds the ewer and basin, and has a large towel around his neck. The subedacons pour rose water over the bishop's hands and then lift the towel from the server's neck and give it to the bishop for him to dry his hands. Meanwhile, the protodeacon is swinging the censer and chanting the verses from Psalm 25. Afterwards, the subdeacons replace the towel over the server's neck, and all three bow to the bishop and return to the sanctuary. An 18th-century brass lavabo used in the Russian army. Just before the Great Entrance the same ceremony takes place as during the Little Hours, except now it takes place in front of the Holy Doors of the iconostasis. After drying his hands, the bishop goes to the prothesis to make his personal commemorations for the living and the dead, as he removes particles from the prosphora. The clergy will also wash their hands after receiving Holy Communion, but this is not accompanied by special prayers. In the Syriac and Coptic rites, the lavabo takes place after the recitation of the Nicene Creed. Secular usage A 19th-century lavabo. Though ecclesiastical lavabos are ordinarily of metal, a familiar lavabo consists of a terra cotta tank with a faucet attached and a small basin below it. Today it is a common feature in many gardens in Europe and the U.S. as a decoration whose practical use has been long forgotten. The lavabo may be considered the forerunner of the modern sink. In several European languages (French, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Turkish), lavabo is the modern word for sink or washbasin.

Software Planning in 1993. Its storyline is not directly connected to the original Shining Force, although a Game Gear title Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict links the two games' plots. The game is much longer than the first and more free-roaming. There is no chapter system, so the player can return to previously visited parts of the world. There are also two different ways of promoting many characters. This game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on October 3, 2008 and in North America on October 6, 2008. It also appears in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and as a standalone game on Steam. Gameplay Shining Force II is a tactical role-playing game. The player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader, Bowie. When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects. Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which give them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to a more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item. Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battles are turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions. The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again. Plot In a shrine south of Granseal Castle, a thief named Slade unwittingly breaks the power of a magic seal by stealing the jewels of Light and Darkness; this unseals the demon king Zeon trapped therein. The following day, King Granseal falls sick when he is attacked by an unknown creature. Sir Astral, the court's adviser, along with his apprentices, Bowie the squire, Sarah the healer and Chester the knight, investigate these events at the castle. They find that the door to the Tower of Ancients has been unlocked and stands open. Greeting their arrival in the tower are devils named \\"Gizmos\\" springing forth to attack, though their ultimate intentions are unknown. Upon their defeat, the Gizmo that appears to be the leader flees. It is discovered thereafter to have possessed King Granseal. Sir Astral and the nascent Shining Force visit the king, finding him possessed. Sir Astral exorcises the demon, which promptly flees. The Minister, in place of King Granseal who is looking over a fainted Astral, then orders the slaying of the Gizmo by a platoon of Granseal's soldiers. The Gizmo subsequently possesses the king of the neighboring kingdom of Galam. Bowie and his friends are captured by the Galam military: while in their dungeon, they meet the thief, Slade. When the party breaks out, Slade helps Bowie retrieve the Jewel of Light and accompanies his party back to Granseal, which has been invaded by Galam forces. They find the possessed King Galam inside the Ancient Tower, who has taken Princess Elis as a hostage. In the ensuing battle, Bowie wrests the Jewel of Darkness from him, but he is unable to rescue Elis, and the ground around the Ancient Tower collapses. The people of Granseal are forced to resettle on the continent of Parmecia. It is here that the true nature of the threat is revealed, so Bowie and friends must now travel across Parmecia to gather allies, solve the riddle of the Jewels, obtain the Force Sword, and seal away Zeon once more. Shining series continuity Shining Force II takes place somewhere in the area of 40-70 years after Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict, and is set in the same lands of Parmecia and Grans. The story focuses on the bid for freedom of Zeon, the devil who helped defeat Darksol in Final Conflict, and it is explained how Zeon's rivalry with Darksol began. Zeon's chief follower Oddeye also plays a major role and meets his final fate. The nation of Granseal, founded at the conclusion of Final Conflict, is flourishing. Hawel is still living in the town he pledged to establish in Final Conflict, and has sired several children, one of them, Chaz, joins the Shining Force II party. He also passes on information concerning the Devil Kings that he learned in Final Conflict, and a student of his called Kazin joins the party in the early stages of the story. The gods Volcanon and Mitula again play a hand in matters. Artifacts from Final Conflict such as the Caravan and Nazca Ship make return appearances, and several monsters, most notably the Kraken, still terrorize the lands. Additionally, the game Shining Wisdom is a sequel of sorts to Shining Force II. Shining Force II tells how Sarah and Kazin (\\"Salah\\" and \\"Parn\\" in the Working Designs translation) became traveling companions and recounts the full story of the Parmecia War referred to several times in Shining Wisdom. Translation issues The most notable translation error is that the three Devil Kings are named as \\"Dark Sol, Dark Dragon, and Zeon\\". Fan translators have since uncovered (and Shining Force II co-director/programmer Yasuhiro Taguchi has confirmed) that the Devil Kings are in fact Darksol, Lucifer, and Zeon. The official translation's assigning Dark Sol and Dark Dragon the relatively detailed history of the Devil Kings not only alters Shining Force II but effectively rewrites the entire premises of Shining in the Darkness and Shining Force I, the games in which they are the foremost villains. For similar reasons, the entire plot of Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict is rendered nonsensical, since it is based on Darksol's role as a Devil King and shows \\"Dark Sol\\" (actually \\"Mephisto\\" in the original script, and an entirely different character from Darksol) being born less than a century before Shining Force II. This mistranslation also creates at least two major contradictions between the English versions of Shining Force I and II: #Shining Force I strongly implies that Dark Dragon is a creation of the Ancients, not a devil at all. #In Shining Force I, Darksol is trying to resurrect Dark Dragon, while Shining Force II tells that the three Devil Kings are fierce arch-rivals. Development Despite being the fifth game in the successful Shining series, Sega allotted the same budget for Shining Force II as it had for the first game in the series, Shining in the Darkness. Additionally, producer/co-programmer Hiroyuki Takahasi remarked in a 2009 interview that \\"We were in a really precarious position at that point because we knew that if we couldn't produce another hit we would have no future.\\" As a result, most of the Shining series development team dropped out and had to be replaced with new staff for the production of Shining Force II.(November 2009). \\"Behind the Scenes: Shining Force\\", GamesTM (90): 136-41. Hiroyuki Takahashi summarized the game as \\"an experimental title where we improved the story and enhanced the game's 'RPG-ness'.\\" Reception GamePro panned the game, saying that the cheerful and upbeat soundtrack is out of place, the menu system is confusing, the style is too RPG-generic, and the use of turn-based instead of real-time combat makes battles \\"slow and cumbersome\\". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Mike Weigand commented that the story \\"could use a few more twists and turns\\", but that the music is good, the control configuration is very user-friendly, and the game improves on the first Shining Force with bigger areas to explore. He summarized that \\"This will definitely appeal to fans of the first one, and to RPG fans in general.\\" Stan Hojnacki of the Santa Cruz Sentinel recommended the game, describing it as \\"a worthy sequel to a popular first edition.\\" Shining Force II was a bestseller in Japan.Official Japanese Mega Drive sales chart, January 1994, published in Mega (magazine) issue 16 In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed it as the 60th best console video game of all time, citing the compelling story and the cerebral challenge of the battles. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. In 2007 IGN named it one of the top 100 video games of all time at number 48, and Retro Gamer included it among the top ten Mega Drive games.

It broadcasts a classical music format; it existed as a commercial station from the early 1950s until December 2009, and as a listener-supported station since then, having then been acquired by the WGBH Educational Foundation. Programming is also simulcast on the second HD Radio channel of WGBH, allowing WCRB to reach some portions of the Boston area that cannot receive 99.5, as well as WJMF in Smithfield, Rhode Island (serving nearby Providence), the second HD Radio channel of WCAI in Woods Hole, and W242AA (96.3) in Kendall Square, Cambridge (designed to serve Beacon Hill, Boston). History of WCRB intellectual property WCRB began broadcasting on 1330 kHz out of Waltham on January 30, 1948. In 1950, the station was sold entirely to Theodore Jones, who would own the station under the name of Charles River Broadcasting until his death in 1991. Prior to that time, \\"Ted\\" Jones set up the Charles River Broadcast Trust to guarantee that his establishment would continue in perpetuity. Around the time Jones first acquired the station, WBMS, a daytime AM radio station that had programmed classical music, changed format. Jones decided to change WCRB's format from that of a typical suburban AM station of the era to full-time classical music. FM service at 102.5 Megacycles (as MegaHertz was then known) was added by 1954 upon the purchase of the WHAV FM transmitter. FM brought WCRB's classical music format to parts of the Boston area that did not get good reception of WCRB's directional AM signal, and made improved audio quality available. In 1961, WCRB-FM became the first Boston-area station to broadcast in multiplex stereo; for a few years prior to that, WCRB had broadcast some of its programming in stereo by carrying one channel on AM, the other on FM. WCRB was directly involved with the development of FM multiplex stereo. Station WCRB and H. H. Scott, then of Maynard, Massachusetts developed prototype stereophonic equipment that was used to prove the \\"General Electric\\" multiplex method being evaluated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). H.H. Scott was an early stereophonic receiver manufacturer that developed and manufactured high-quality home stereo equipment. Once the FCC approved stereophonic broadcasting, WCRB created a special \\"stereo\\" studio in downtown Boston, the first in the world. There was no dual channel (stereo) studio equipment at the time. Much of the equipment was handmade by the engineering staff. WCRB is noted for many other innovations. It was the first radio station to obtain a permanent waiver of the FCC rules requiring average modulation in excess of eighty-five percent. This was necessary to preserve the dynamic range of the concert music broadcasts. The station also obtained a permanent waiver of the FCC rule that required a station identification announcement every thirty minutes. This meant that a live concert performance no longer had to be interrupted for station identification. The WCRB engineering staff worked with the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) to codify the RIAA LP record frequency-response curve, and create the NAB standard. Other technical innovations followed. Before the early days of FM stereo broadcasting, nobody had encountered the necessity of amplitude- and phase-matching two 15 kHz stereo leased lines. The telephone company called such a channel type \\"Program channel A\\". To them, as long as the frequency response and noise level matched their specifications, stereo simply meant that there would be two lines. It was just a matter of labeling them! Not so. WCRB engineering worked with AT&T; to generate a specification involving matching both the phase and frequency response. This became the standard of the industry. Eventually, as stereo caught on across the country, these methods and specifications were used to install stereophonic leased lines to transmitters across the country, until they were made obsolete by the development of composite-signal studio-transmitter links. In the early days of radio, stations had full-time engineers on duty. Therefore, the WCRB engineering staff also recorded live performances for the Boston Symphony Orchestra Transcription Trust. Although Charles River Broadcasting had acquired other radio stations, WCRB remained as the company's flagship station. In 1975, WCRB ended simulcasting of WCRB-FM, changing callsigns to WHET, and its format to big-band/adult standards. In 1978, Charles River Broadcasting sold off WHET (later renamed WRCA), but retained WCRB, which became increasingly successful over the years as a 24/7 classical music station. Logo under Nassau Broadcasting ownership, a similar logo was used during WCRB's later years on 102.5 WCRB was under a long-term commitment by Charles River Broadcasting Trust, established by Theodore Jones, to continue to air classical music in perpetuity, and it carried no non-classical music programs. However, the decision to interpret the commitment as a request rather than a demand resulted in the announced sale of the station to Greater Media on December 19, 2005. The trustees of the Charles River Broadcast Trust had already sold off portions of the trust's property so that there was little physical property and real estate left. The AM transmitter site in Waltham was sold to a developer who built the Watermill Complex. This, and the sales of stations such as WCRQ in Providence, Rhode Island, marked the beginning of the gradual dissolution of the Theodore Jones trust. It was upon the death of Richard L. Kaye, an early manager, minority stockholder, and trusted associate of Jones, that the Charles River Trust would no longer maintain the commitments made by its founder. Greater Media already owned five FM stations in the Boston market‚Äîthe maximum allowed by the FCC and one of Greater Media's Boston stations would have to be sold before the company could acquire WCRB. Speculation arose that Greater Media would sell off 99.5 WKLB-FM, as its Andover transmitter location provided poor overall coverage of the Boston market, in contrast to the company's other stations. These thoughts were confirmed on July 31, 2006, when Greater Media announced that it would sell the physical property of WKLB-FM and the intellectual property of WCRB to Nassau Broadcasting, thus saving the commercial classical format for the Boston area, albeit on a station with poorer coverage of Boston. At the same time, Greater Media announced that the country format and intellectual property of WKLB would relocate to the prime signal of 102.5 MHz. WCRB's transition from 102.5 to 99.5 was completed on December 1, 2006 at noon local time. The first selection broadcast on the new frequency was the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah. Logo as \\"99.5 All Classical\\" from December 2009 to October 2011 It was announced on September 21, 2009 that the WGBH Educational Foundation would acquire WCRB from Nassau and convert the station to non-commercial operation, complementing sister station WGBH. The sale was completed on December 1, 2009. Since assuming control of WCRB, WGBH has sought to expand the reach of the station, particularly to areas that had been served by the station prior to the frequency shift in 2006, WCRB's programming was added to WNCK, which formerly simulcast WGBH, concurrent with the sale's completion, and April 8, 2010, W242AA also switched from carrying WGBH to WCRB, via the 89.7 HD2 simulcast. WJMF began carrying WCRB programming in September 2011, since the frequency change in 2006, Providence had been one of the largest markets without access to a full-time classical music station. Because of this expanded reach, the station rebranded from 99.5 All Classical (the branding used since the sale to WGBH) to Classical New England on October 3, 2011. By 2015, the station was branded as \\"Classical Radio Boston, 99.5 WCRB.\\" In 2020, the station announced it would rebrand as \\"CRB Classical 99.5\\", as part of a wider rebranding of WGBH and its stations to remove the letter \\"W\\". History of the 99.5 FM broadcast license The 99.5 FM broadcast license began broadcasting October 6, 1948, as WLLH-FM, the FM counterpart to WLLH, programming a full-service format to the Merrimack Valley. During the 1970s, 99.5 became WSSH (for Wish 99.5), which programmed a format of chiefly soft instrumental renditions of pop tunes with a few vocalists an hour, consisting of soft AC (adult contemporary) and standards cuts. In 1982, WSSH evolved to a soft AC format gradually eliminating the instrumental renditions and became home to popular nighttime radio personality Delilah Rene before she became nationally syndicated. Ratings were very high through the 1980s and WSSH often led other AC stations. By then, the station was separated from WLLH, but later gained a sister station on 1510 (now WMEX). WSSH had high ratings and was often the top-rated adult contemporary radio station in the market throughout the 1980s. However, in the early 1990s, ratings went from excellent to mediocre; part of the reason was the perception that WSSH was still an elevator music station. By 1991, the station modified its format to mainstream AC by adding current product and some up-tempo AC tunes. WSSH became the third place radio station, following WMJX and WVBF (now known as WROR, which subsequently became a sister station to 99.5). On December 13, 1995, the owner of WSSH, Granum Communications, changed the format to smooth jazz, under the branding of WOAZ (99.5 The Oasis), mirroring Granum's KOAI in Dallas.Jazzy WOAZ whisks mellow WSSH away(p. 3) Then, in 1997, Granum sold WOAZ and WBOS to Greater Media, which already owned WMJX, WBCS (the incarnation of WKLB at that time) and WROR (the former WVBF and WCLB). On August 22 of that year, Greater Media swapped the frequencies of WOAZ and WKLB in a move where the format and personalities of WOAZ moved to 96.9 (adopting the call sign WSJZ), while WKLB moved to 99.5 and became Country 99.5 WKLB, where it stayed until December 1, 2006. Greater Media noted that the move was made because the 99.5 signal is stronger than that of 96.9 in Essex County, home to many country music listeners. The 99.5 frequency was spun off to Nassau Broadcasting Partners as a consequence of a deal where Greater Media acquired WCRB's current frequency, with 102.5 adopting the WKLB format and call sign. Nassau also acquired WCRB's call letters and programming. Nassau already owned four classical-formatted stations in Maine affiliated with the World Classical Network. The two stations switched frequencies at noon on December 1, 2006. The last broadcast by WKLB on 99.5 was of the U.S. National Anthem. The first song played by WKLB at 102.5 was \\"Life Is A Highway\\" by Rascal Flatts. The last air personality on 99.5, and consequently the first live voice on 102.5, was longtime midday host Carolyn Kruse. A redesigned website was launched immediately after the frequency change. Audience WCRB claimed to have about 500,000 listeners who tune into the live Boston Symphony Orchestra broadcasts and the station's other programming, a longtime claim by management. According to Arbitron, the Metropolitan Boston market contains 3.8 million individuals 12 years of age or older. An FM station of WCRB's power transmitting on 102.5 MHz could reach parts of Worcester, Massachusetts, Providence, Rhode Island; and Southeastern New Hampshire. One could reasonably assume that such coverage adds one-half million individuals, for a total of 4.3 million. If the WCRB programming did in fact reach half a million people, it would generate a rating of close to 12 per cent of the market. The most popular radio programs on Boston radio stations are heard in morning and afternoon drive on weekdays and do not reach as many listeners as WCRB claimed. These numbers predate the move to 99.5 MHz and the switch to a non- commercial format. , the station enjoyed a 2.0 share, which added up to 252,400 listeners.http://www.radio-info.com/markets/boston Community and innovation WCRB engineers worked with Bell Telephone to develop frequency and phase matching technology for using pairs of 15 kHz throughout the country leased lines to carry stereo signals for studio to transmitter links and improved geographical coverage of broadcast signals (leased-line technology has since been replaced by microwave links, satellite feeds, and high-quality transmission using the Internet). They were also at the center of the development of modern multiplexed FM stereo technology and its approval by the FCC, in cooperation with FM receiver manufacturer H. H. Scott, Inc. =WCRB and the 1965 blackout= The solutions developed by WCRB were not just about getting high fidelity audio from remote locations to the studio. Often they involved solutions to problems that nobody anticipated. On November 9, 1965, the northeastern U.S. experienced a massive power blackout. WCRB had a backup power generator at its Waltham studios and also at its Needham FM transmitter site. Within a few minutes of the power failure, WCRB was back on the air. At first, nobody knew how long the power failure would last, or its extent. Soon reports came into the station that showed the widespread extent of the blackout. WCRB engineering checked the amount of diesel fuel remaining and found that it might not last more than a few more hours. The fuel vendor was notified, but there was no fuel available. A radio engineer started driving around and discovered that Civil Defense was trying to get a portable generator running which they had connected to the Waltham Hospital (since renamed). The hospital had no power, and the only generator available would not run. WCRB‚Äôs station engineer suggested that the electric company back-feed power from WCRB to the hospital, using the existing distribution lines but disconnecting everybody else. The hospital was on Hope Avenue, off South Street, on the other side of Brandeis University. WCRB successfully fed power to the hospital, and the fuel from the inoperative generator was transferred to WCRB‚Äôs tank. Within a few hours, WCRB had its fuel tank filled from additional donations. To have enough power available to supply the hospital, it became necessary to shut down the AM transmitter. Translators WCRB was formerly carried on a separately-owned translator in Manchester, New Hampshire, W295BL (106.9); this ended after the translator was sold by Basic Holdings to Saga Communications in September 2019.RBR.comnews.radio-online.com In January 2020, W295BL began carrying the third HD Radio channel of Saga- owned WZID.

Provided that all the systems enforce mutually-compatible password standards (e.g. concerning minimum and maximum password length, supported characters, etc.), the user can choose a new password at any time and deploy the same password on his or her own login accounts across multiple, linked systems. Where different systems have mutually incompatible standards regarding what can be stored in a password field, the user may be forced to choose more than one (but still fewer than the number of systems) passwords. This may happen, for example, where the maximum password length on one system is shorter than the minimum length in another, or where one system requires use of a punctuation mark but another forbids it. Password synchronization is a function of certain identity management systems and it is considered easier to implement than enterprise single sign-on (SSO), as there is normally no client software deployment or need for active user enrollment. Uses Password synchronization makes it easier for IT users to recall passwords and so manage their access to multiple systems, for example on an enterprise network. Since they only have to remember one or at most a few passwords, users are less likely to forget them or write them down, resulting in fewer calls to the IT Help Desk and less opportunity for coworkers, intruders or thieves to gain improper access. Through suitable security awareness, automated policy enforcement and training activities, users can be encouraged or forced to choose stronger passwords as they have fewer to remember. Security If the single, synchronized password is compromised (for example, if it is guessed, disclosed, determined by cryptanalysis from one of the systems, intercepted on an insecure communications path, or if the user is socially engineered into resetting it to a known value), all the systems that share that password are vulnerable to improper access. In most single sign-on and password vault solutions, compromise of the primary or master password (in other words, the password used to unlock access to the individual unique passwords used on other systems) also compromises all the associated systems, so the two approaches are similar. Depending on the software used, password synchronization may be triggered by a password change on any one of the synchronized systems (whether initiated by the user or an administrator) and/or by the user initiating the change centrally through the software, perhaps through a web interface. Some password synchronization systems may copy password hashes from one system to another, where the hashing algorithm is the same. In general, this is not the case and access to a plaintext password is required.

It broadcasts on 107.5 MHz with a classical format. Current hosts on WFCC-FM include Mark Calder, Dave Read, Don Spencer, and Larry King. History Original WFCC logo, as shown on a drink cup. The station started broadcasting on March 24, 1987 from state-of-the-art facilities on Route 28 in West Chatham. It was owned at the time by First Class Communications, run by Joseph A. Ryan and his family, who all worked at the station, including wife Pauline (receptionist), son Kevin (sales manager), and daughter Justine (sales). Joe Ryan, who worked at NBC as a writer for Today during Dave Garroway's tenure, then at WCVB-TV (channel 5) in Boston, hired WCVB personalities to be on his staff at WFCC-FM, including newsman Jack Hynes, meteorologists Bob Copeland (a Chatham resident) and Bill Hovey, and sportscaster Bill O'Connell, complemented by local classical announcers Janice Gray, Dick Eressy, Paul Jimerson, Paul Nossiter, Steve Murphy, Don Lawrence, Pierre Paquin, Don Merna, and Dick O'Connor. The station played mostly classical music weekdays, with the afternoon drive show being big band, hosted by Lou Dumont. On the weekends, classical was complemented by the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts and other syndicated classical shows, as well as local specialty shows Jazz on the Half-Shell and Folk Roots and Branches with Paul Jimerson, and a program devoted to classical piano, Klavier, produced by Jimerson and hosted by his wife, pianist and teacher Melinda Isaacson. The stock market crash of 1987 had a devastating effect on the Cape's economy, and WFCC-FM lost significant advertising revenue. As a result, stronger-rated classical music programming replaced the evening folk and jazz shows. Pierre Paquin, a well-known southern New England classical music recording engineer and broadcaster, was hired in 1989 to help bring up the ratings. His Sunday morning broadcasts earned the highest ratings for the station and his special programs garnished several Massachusetts Broadcasters Association awards, including the award for Best Station I.D., featuring his daughter, MaryAnne \\"Mim\\" L. Paquin. In fall of 1990, Mim, was bought in as an apprentice to write and produce four, one hour-long programs written for a younger audience. Her production \\"Witches, Goblins, Jack-o- lanterns and Ghouls\\" won honorable mention Massachusetts Broadcasters Association. Don Merna was also hired in 1989 to host weekdays as well as weekend evenings. Both Paquin and Merna broadcast for WFCC until 1995 and 1996 respectively and are still Cape Cod residents. In 1991, the station's offices and studios were moved to new facilities on Route 6A in Brewster. WFCC-FM was subsequently sold in 1992 to Dolphin Communications, owned by Allan Stanley. WFCC-FM was purchased by Charles River Broadcasting (then owners of Boston's WCRB) in 1996, with its studios and offices moving to a former bank building on Route 28 in West Yarmouth. WFCC-FM's programming became automated full-time as a result. WFCC-FM has been the flagship station of the World Classical Network syndicated service (started by Charles River Broadcasting) since 1998. The station and the network were sold in 2007 to Sandab Communications (doing business as Cape Cod Broadcasting Media), owners of Cape Cod radio stations WQRC, WOCN-FM, and WKPE-FM), and now broadcast from studios and offices in Hyannis. Original WFCC-FM staff member Steve Murphy returned to the station's airwaves as morning host on September 16, 2008 after an 18-year absence.

It converts a force such as tension, compression, pressure, or torque into an electrical signal that can be measured and standardized. As the force applied to the load cell increases, the electrical signal changes proportionally. The most common types of load cell used are hydraulic, pneumatic, and strain gauge. Strain gauge load cell Strain gauge load cells are the kind most often found in industrial settings. It is ideal as it is highly accurate, versatile, and cost-effective. Structurally, a load cell has a metal body to which strain gauges have been secured. The body is usually made of aluminum, alloy steel, or stainless steel which makes it very sturdy but also minimally elastic. This elasticity gives rise to the term \\"spring element\\", referring to the body of the load cell. When force is exerted on the load cell, the spring element is slightly deformed, and unless overloaded, always returns to its original shape. As the spring element deforms, the strain gauges also change shape. The resulting alteration to the resistance in the strain gauges can be measured as voltage. The change in voltage is proportional to the amount of force applied to the cell, thus the amount of force can be calculated from the load cell's output. Strain Gaugesalt=A strain gauge is constructed of very fine wire, or foil, set up in a grid pattern and attached to a flexible backing. When the shape of the strain gauge is altered, a change in its electrical resistance occurs. The wire or foil in the strain gauge is arranged in a way that, when force is applied in one direction, a linear change in resistance results. Tension force stretches a strain gauge, causing it to get thinner and longer, resulting in an increase in resistance. Compression force does the opposite. The strain gauge compresses, becomes thicker and shorter, and resistance decreases. The strain gauge is attached to a flexible backing enabling it to be easily applied to a load cell, mirroring the minute changes to be measured. Since the change in resistance measured by a single strain gauge is extremely small, it is difficult to accurately measure changes. Increasing the number of strain gauges applied collectively magnifies these small changes into something more measurable. A set of 4 strain gauges set in a specific circuit is called Wheatstone bridge. Wheatstone Bridge A Wheatstone bridge is a configuration of four balanced resistors with a known excitation voltage applied as shown below: thumb Excitation voltage V_\\\\text{EX} is a known constant and output voltage V_o is variable depending on the shape of the strain gauges. If all resistors are balanced, meaning \\\\frac{R1}{R2} = \\\\frac{R4}{R3} then V_ois zero. If the resistance in even one of the resistors changes, then V_0will likewise change. The change in V_o can be measured and interpreted using Ohm's law. Ohm's law states that the current (I, measured in amperes) running through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage V across the two points. Resistance (R, measured in ohms) is introduced as the constant in this relationship, independent of the current. Ohm's law is expressed in the equation I=V/R. thumb When applied to the 4 legs of the Wheatstone bridge circuit, the resulting equation is: thumb V_o = \\\\left(\\\\frac{R3}{R3+R4} - \\\\frac{R2}{R1+R2}\\\\right) V_\\\\text{EX} In a load cell, the resistors are replaced with strain gauges and arranged in alternating tension and compression formation. When force is exerted on the load cell, the structure and resistance of the strain gauges changes and V_o is measured. From the resulting data, V_o can be easily determined using the equation above. = Common types of load cells = There are several types of strain gauge load cells: * Bending beam: uses strain gauges to monitor the stress in the sensing element when the spring element is subjected to a bending force. * Load Button: low-profile load cells often used where the load is concentrated in one single point (button). *Pancake: low-profile load cells often used in vessel weighing; can be tension or compression. * Single point shear beam load cell: spring element fixed at one end and loaded on the other. * Double-ended shear beam: spring element fixed at both ends and loaded in the center. * Canister load cell: Cylindrical shaped spring element; can be used in both tension and compression. *S-type load cell: S-shaped spring element; can be used in both compression and tension. *Miniature load cell: similar to the load cell, but in smaller geometry: * Wire rope clamps: an assembly attached to a wire rope and measures its tension; commonly used in crane and hoist applications. * Tension link load cell: often used in crane and hoist weighing systems. Measures tension force only. * Load pin: replaces pulleys and shivs, typically on cranes. Pneumatic load cell The Load cell is designed to automatically regulate the balancing pressure. Air pressure is applied to one end of the diaphragm and it escapes through the nozzle placed at the bottom of the load cell. A pressure gauge is attached with the load cell to measure the pressure inside the cell. The deflection of the diaphragm affects the airflow through the nozzle as well as the pressure inside the chamber. Hydraulic load cell The hydraulic load cell uses a conventional piston and cylinder arrangement with the piston placed in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually come in contact with the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas.http://www.cardinalscale.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/04/Hydraulic-Load-Cell-Advantages.pdf Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis. Other types Vibrating load cell Vibrating wire load cells, which are useful in geomechanical applications due to low amounts of drift, and capacitive load cells where the capacitance of a capacitor changes as the load presses the two plates of a capacitor closer together. = Piezoelectric load cell = Piezoelectric load cells work on the same principle of deformation as the strain gauge load cells, but a voltage output is generated by the basic piezoelectric material ‚Äì proportional to the deformation of load cell. Useful for dynamic/frequent measurements of force. Most applications for piezo-based load cells are in the dynamic loading conditions, where strain gauge load cells can fail with high dynamic loading cycles. The piezoelectric effect is dynamic, that is, the electrical output of a gauge is an impulse function and is not static. The voltage output is only useful when the strain is changing and does not measure static values. However, depending on conditioning system used, \\"quasi static\\" operation can be done. Using a so-called \\"Charge amplifier \\" with \\"Long\\" time constant allow accurate measurement lasting many hours for large loads to many minutes for small loads. Another advantage of Piezoelectric load cell, conditioned with a Charge amplifier, is the wide measuring range that can be achieved. Users can choose a load cell with a range of hundred of kN and use it for measuring few N of forces with the same Signal/Noise ratio, again this is possible only with the use of a \\"Charge amplifier\\" conditioning. = Common issues = * Mechanical mounting: the cells have to be properly mounted. All the load force has to go through the part of the load cell where its deformation is sensed. Friction may induce offset or hysteresis. Wrong mounting may result in the cell reporting forces along undesired axis, which still may somewhat correlate to the sensed load, confusing the technician. * Overload: Within its rating, the load cell deforms elastically and returns to its shape after being unloaded. If subjected to loads above its maximum rating, the material of the load cell may plastically deform; this may result in a signal offset, loss of linearity, difficulty with or impossibility of calibration, or even mechanical damage to the sensing element (e.g. delamination, rupture). * Wiring issues: the wires to the cell may develop high resistance, e.g. due to corrosion. Alternatively, parallel current paths can be formed by ingress of moisture. In both cases the signal develops offset (unless all wires are affected equally) and accuracy is lost. * Electrical damage: the load cells can be damaged by induced or conducted current. Lightning hitting the construction, or arc welding performed near the cells,https://powderprocess.net/Equipments html/Load_cells.html can overstress the fine resistors of the strain gauges and cause their damage or destruction. For welding nearby, it is suggested to disconnect the load cell and short all its pins to the ground, nearby the cell itself. High voltages can break through the insulation between the substrate and the strain gauges. * Nonlinearity: at the low end of their scale, the load cells tend to be nonlinear. This becomes important for cells sensing very large ranges, or with large surplus of load capability to withstand temporary overloads or shocks (e.g. the rope clamps). More points may be needed for the calibration curve. * Particularity of application: A load cell that is not well suited to the specific magnitude and type of pressure will have poor accuracy, resolution, and reliability. = Excitation and rated output = The bridge is excited with stabilized voltage (usually 10V, but can be 20V, 5V, or less for battery powered instrumentation). The difference voltage proportional to the load then appears on the signal outputs. The cell output is rated in millivolts per volt (mV/V) of the difference voltage at full rated mechanical load. So a 2.96 mV/V load cell will provide 29.6 millivolt signal at full load when excited with 10 volts. Typical sensitivity values are 1 to 3 mV/V. Typical maximum excitation voltage is around 15 volts. = Wiring = The full-bridge cells come typically in four-wire configuration. The wires to the top and bottom end of the bridge are the excitation (often labelled E+ and E‚àí, or Ex+ and Ex‚àí), the wires to its sides are the signal (labelled S+ and S‚àí). Ideally, the voltage difference between S+ and S‚àí is zero under zero load, and grows proportionally to the load cell's mechanical load. Sometimes a six-wire configuration is used. The two additional wires are \\"sense\\" (Sen+ and Sen‚àí), and are connected to the bridge with the Ex+ and Ex- wires, in a fashion similar to four- terminal sensing. With these additional signals, the controller can compensate for the change in wire resistance due to e.g. temperature fluctuations. The individual resistors on the bridge usually have resistance of 350 Œ©. Sometimes other values (typically 120 Œ©, 1,000 Œ©) can be encountered. The bridge is typically electrically insulated from the substrate. The sensing elements are in close proximity and in good mutual thermal contact, to avoid differential signals caused by temperature differences.  Using multiple cells  One or more load cells can be used for sensing a single load. If the force can be concentrated to a single point (small scale sensing, ropes, tensile loads, point loads), a single cell can be used. For long beams, two cells at the end are used. Vertical cylinders can be measured at three points, rectangular objects usually require four sensors. More sensors are used for large containers or platforms, or very high loads. If the loads are guaranteed to be symmetrical, some of the load cells can be substituted with pivots. This saves the cost of the load cell but can significantly decrease accuracy. Load cells can be connected in parallel; in that case, all the corresponding signals are connected together (Ex+ to Ex+, S+ to S+, ...), and the resulting signal is the average of the signals from all the sensing elements. This is often used in e.g. personal scales, or other multipoint weight sensors. The most common color assignment is red for Ex+, black for Ex‚àí, green for S+, and white for S‚àí. Less common assignments are red for Ex+, white for Ex‚àí, green for S+, and blue for S‚àí, or red for Ex+, blue for Ex‚àí, green for S+, and yellow for S‚àí.http://www.aicpl.com/brochures/loadapp.pdf Other values are also possible, e.g. red for Ex+, green for Ex‚àí, yellow for S+ and blue for S‚àí.http://www.s-e-g.com/documents/Load%20Cells/Type%20K/F31-16E.PDF  Ringing  Every load cell is subject to \\"ringing\\" when subjected to abrupt load changes. This stems from the spring-like behavior of load cells. In order to measure the loads, they have to deform. As such, a load cell of finite stiffness must have spring-like behavior, exhibiting vibrations at its natural frequency. An oscillating data pattern can be the result of ringing. Ringing can be suppressed in a limited fashion by passive means. Alternatively, a control system can use an actuator to actively damp out the ringing of a load cell. This method offers better performance at a cost of significant increase in complexity. Uses Load cells are used in several types of measuring instruments such as laboratory balances, industrial scales, platform scales and universal testing machines. From 1993 the British Antarctic Survey installed load cells in glass fibre nests to weigh albatross chicks.Highfield, Roger. Antarctic's birds thrive on warmth, The Daily Telegraph 18 August 1993 Load cells are used in a wide variety of items such as the seven-post shaker which is often used to set up race cars. Load cells weighing performances Load cells are commonly used to measure weight in an industrial environment. They can be installed on hoppers, reactors...etc... to control their weight capacity, which is often of critical importance for an industrial process. Some performance characteristics of the load cells must be defined and specified to make sure they will cope with the expected service. Among those design characteristics are : * Combined error * Minimum verification interval * Resolution Load cell specifications The electrical, physical, and environmental specifications of a load cell help to determine which applications it is appropriate for. Common specifications include: * Full Scale Output (FSO): Electronic output expressed in mv/V. Measured at full scale. * Combined Error: % of the full scale output that represents the maximum deviation from the straight line drawn between no load and load at rated capacity. Often measured during decreasing and increasing loads. * Non- Linearity: The maximum deviation of the calibration curve from a straight line drawn between the rated capacity and zero load. Measured on increasing load and expressed as % of full scale output. * Hysteresis: Maximum difference between load cell output signals for the same applied load. The first measurement can be obtained by decreasing the load from rated output and the second by increasing the load from zero. * Repeatability: Maximum difference between output measurements for repeated loads under identical conditions. Measured in % of rated output. * Zero Balance (Offset): Output reading of the load cell with rated excitation under no load. The deviation in output between a true zero measurement and a real load cell under zero load expressed as a percentage of full scale output. * Compensated Temperate Range: The temperature range over which a load cell is compensated so that it can ensure zero balance & rated output within specified limits. Expressed as ¬∞F or ¬∞C. * Operating Temperature Range: Temperature range extremes in which a load cell can operate without permanent, adverse effects on any of its performance characteristics. Expressed as ¬∞F or ¬∞C. * Temperature Effect on Output: Modification of output readings caused by load cell temperature. Expressed as % of full scale output per degree of ¬∞F or ¬∞C. * Temperature Effect on Zero: Change in zero balance caused by ambient temperature changes. Expressed as % of full scale output per degree of ¬∞F or ¬∞C. * Input Resistance: Input resistance of the load cell's bridge circuit. Measured at the positive & negative excitation leads with no load applied. Measured in Ohms. * Output Resistance: Output resistance of the load cell's bridge circuit. Measured at the positive & negative excitation leads with no load applied. Measured in Ohms. * Insulation Resistance: The resistance measured along pathways between the: bridge circuit and transducer element, bridge circuit and the cable shield, and the transducer element and the cable shield. Typically measured at fifty volts under standard test conditions. * Recommended Excitation: Maximum recommended excitation voltage of the transducer for it to operate within its specifications. Expressed in VDC. * Cable Length: Length of the standard cable for which the load cell is calibrated. Cable length affects how the load cell is calibrated. * Safe Overload: The maximum load that can be applied to a load cell without causing permanent effects to its performance specifications. Measured as a % of full scale output. * Ultimate Overload: Maximum load that can be withstood without causing structural failure. * Material: Substance that comprises the spring element of the load cell.  Load cell calibration  Load cells are an integral part of most weighing systems in industrial, aerospace and automotive industries, enduring rigorous daily use. Over time, load cells will drift, age and misalign; therefore, they will need to be calibrated regularly to ensure accurate results are maintained. ISO9000 and most other standards specify a maximum period of around 18 months to 2 years between re-calibration procedures, dependent on the level of load cell deterioration. Annual re-calibration is considered best practice by many load cell users for ensuring the most accurate measurements. Standard calibration tests will use linearity and repeatability as a calibration guideline as these are both used to determine accuracy. Calibration is conducted incrementally starting working in ascending or descending order. For example, in the case of a 60 tonne load cell, then specific test weights that measure in 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 tonne increments may be used ‚Äì A five step calibration process is usually sufficient for ensuring a device is accurately calibrated. Repeating this five-step calibration procedure 2-3 times is recommended for consistent results.

Between the World Wars, he helped establish Poland's interbellum borders in conflicts over territory with Poland's neighbours. Also, for a dozen years before World War II, he coordinated Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Promethean movement, aimed at liberating the non-Russian peoples of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union‚Äîan objective that Pi≈Çsudski deemed crucial if Poland, sandwiched between Germany and the Soviet Union, were to preserve her just-regained independence.  Early career  Edmund Charaszkiewicz was born on 14 October 1895 in Punitz (in Polish, Poniec), in the Province of Posen, an area of the German Empire that had been annexed from Poland by Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland (1795). He was the son of Stanis≈Çaw Charaszkiewicz, a building contractor, and Bronis≈Çawa, n√©e Rajewska. Edmund completed his elementary schooling in Poniec, then attended secondary schools successively in Krotoszyn, Katowice and Krak√≥w. In the latter city, before World War I, his family lived at ulica D≈Çuga 63 (63 Long Street). In Krak√≥w Edmund graduated from secondary school on 17 December 1915, while already a soldier in the Polish Legions.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., introduction to Zbi√≥r dokument√≥w pp≈Çk. Edmunda Charaszkiewicza (A Collection of Documents by Lt. Col. Edmund Charaszkiewicz), p. 5. In that period, it was common for secondary-school students in Galicia to join Polish patriotic paramilitary organizations. On 1 November 1913 Charaszkiewicz, aged 18, joined the Riflemen's Association and in 1913‚Äì14 attended an Association noncommissioned-officers' school, using the pseudonym Kalikst (his second given name).Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 5. Soon after the outbreak of World War I, on 4 or 5 August 1914, Charaszkiewicz enlisted in the Polish Legions. He served successively in several units and convalesced from several illnesses. In November or December 1917 he was inducted into the Polish Auxiliary Corps (the former Second Brigade of the Polish Legions), in which he served till February 1918 as senior sergeant major. He was then released from the Legions to serve in the German Army. To avoid such service, and because he was liable to arrest and internment as a former Polish Legionnaire, he went into hiding from 18 February until June 1918 in Krak√≥w, and from November 1918 in Warsaw, where he worked at the Ministry of Military Affairs of the Polish Armed Force. His superiors there were two future Polish generals: Colonel Marian ≈ªegota-Januszajtis and Major Stefan Pas≈Çawski.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 5‚Äì6. Just after the close of World War I, on 15 November 1918, Charaszkiewicz joined the Polish Army in the rank of sublieutenant. During the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì21) he participated in battles at Nowo≈õwiƒôciany, Podbrodzie, Bezdany, Vilnius and Ejszyszki. During the Polish defence of Vilnius, he was taken prisoner by the Lithuanians and was interned from 19 July to 18 August 1920. He escaped and, on returning to the Bia≈Çystok Rifle Regiment (Bia≈Çostocki Pu≈Çk Strzelc√≥w), temporarily commanded the 11th Company (21 September ‚Äì 6 October 1920), then served as a junior officer in the 9th Company. On 27 February 1921, for conspicuous valor behind Soviet lines, he was recommended for Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 6‚Äì7.  Military intelligence  Meanwhile, on 15 December 1920, Charaszkiewicz had been assigned to the Second Department of Polish General Staff, or Intelligence ‚Äì specifically, to its Upper Silesia Plebiscite Department. During the Third Silesian Uprising he served (2 May ‚Äì 15 August 1921) as deputy commander of demolition squads known as the Wawelberg Group. For his courage and steadfastness in action against the Germans, as he blew up mined structures in the face of withering enemy fire and thereby halted the German advance, he was on 18 February 1922 again recommended for the Virtuti Militari.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 7‚Äì8. On 27 June 1922, Lt. Charaszkiewicz was decorated with the Virtuti Militari, 5th class.Wesolowski, p. 231. Charaszkiewicz would later (16 February 1940, in Paris) describe the Polish military-intelligence operation in the Third Silesian Uprising as a model operation of its kind: its objectives were clearly defined; the requisite personnel were skilfully recruited and trained; the necessary explosives, weapons, ammunition, equipment and supplies were smuggled into the operational areas and cached well in advance; and the plans were efficiently and resourcefully executed.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Referat o roli dywersji w Trzecim Powstaniu ≈ölƒÖskim\\" (\\"Report on the Role of Covert Operations in the Third Silesian Uprising\\"), pp. 31‚Äì55. He would later favourably contrast the Third Silesian Uprising with the indecisive preparations for, and execution of, Poland's takeover of Zaolzie 17 years later, in 1938.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Referat o dzia≈Çaniach dywersyjnych w Czechos≈Çowacji\\" (\\"Report on Covert Operations in Czechoslovakia\\"), p. 103. Moreover, the preponderant political circumstances in Poland, Germany and the world favoured the Polish cause. The Silesian-Polish population gave its enthusiastic support, and all its social groups were recruited except for the communists, who for their part evinced a benign neutrality, having been instructed to back the Polish proletariat.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Referat o roli dywersji w Trzecim Powstaniu ≈ölƒÖskim\\" (\\"Report on the Role of Covert Operations in the Third Silesian Uprising\\"), pp. 39‚Äì40. Between 1918 and 1923, Charaszkiewicz completed three years of the four-year law curriculum at Warsaw University.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 9. After the Third Silesian uprising (2 May ‚Äì 5 July 1921), in 1922 Charaszkiewicz was assigned to the General Staff's Section II. In evaluations, he was commended for his strength of character, initiative, energy, enthusiasm, and devotion to duty, especially in covert operations in Lithuania, with which Poland had a running dispute over Vilnius. In 1927, when he was decorated with the Silver Cross of Merit, he was cited for actions in the rear of the Soviet Army in 1920, actions in the Third Silesian uprising, and actions in the Polish-Lithuanian neutral zone to secure the lives and property of Polish citizens against Lithuanian irregulars.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 10. Charaszkiewicz's service record noted that his qualifications for intelligence work included a knowledge of German, French and English. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1919, to captain on 1 July 1925,Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 10‚Äì11. and to major in 1935.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 14. By 1931, until World War II, Charaszkiewicz served, last in the rank of major, as chief of \\"Office [Ekspozytura] 2\\" of the General Staff's Section II. Office 2, which had been so named on 1 April 1929, was charged with the planning, preparation and execution of clandestine-warfare operations.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 11. In the face of growing threats from Germany and the Soviet Union, Polish organizing of a \\"behind-the-lines\\" (pozafrontowa) clandestine network had begun immediately after the post-World War I wars for Poland's borders. Charaszkiewicz had been assigned to this network already on 15 April 1922.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 12. Especially after Adolf Hitler's accession to power in 1933, Polish clandestine organizations were vigorously built up. They were meant, in future military actions, to paralyse enemy road and rail transport and destroy enemy military depots. Clandestine centres were created in Poland as well as in neighbouring countries, chiefly Germany and the Soviet Union. Personnel for the clandestine networks were recruited with great care. Thanks to this, the intelligence services of Poland's neighbours learned nothing about them until mid-1939, when the rising German threat prompted mass Polish training of irregular forces.  Prometheism  J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski about 1916 Office 2 was also responsible for \\"Promethean operations,\\" conceived by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. The idea was to combat Soviet imperialism by supporting irredentist movements among the non-Russian peoples of the Soviet Union. Thus the Prometheists' ultimate goal was nothing less than the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 15. As Pi≈Çsudski and his adherents (the \\"Pi≈Çsudskiites\\") exerted a preponderant influence on Poland's government through nearly the entire interwar period, the Promethean agenda became integral to the operations of many Polish public institutions concerned with eastern European affairs. Tadeusz Schaetzel Tadeusz Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski After Pi≈Çsudski's May 1926 coup d'√©tat, Section II intensified its engagement with Prometheism. The movement's leaders included prominent Sanation figures such as Colonel Walery S≈Çawek and the publicist and Sejm deputy, Tadeusz Ho≈Ç√≥wko. Great importance was attached to Prometheism by Section II's successive chiefs, Colonel Tadeusz Schaetzel and Colonel Tadeusz Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski, and by deputy chief Lieutenant Colonel J√≥zef Englicht. The movement's intelligence operations were directed by Edmund Charaszkiewicz. Contacts were maintained with Ukrainians and Cossacks, and with representatives of several peoples of the Caucasus: Azeris, Armenians and Georgians. In its prosecution of the Promethean agenda, Office 2 worked with official institutions such as the Institute for Study of Nationality Affairs (Instytut Bada≈Ñ Spraw Narodowo≈õciowych) and the Polish-Ukrainian Society (Towarzystwo Polsko- Ukrai≈Ñskie) and its Polish-Ukrainian Bulletin (Biuletyn Polsko-Ukrai≈Ñski), published from 1932. The latter Society included such experts on East European affairs as Leon Wasilewski, Stanis≈Çaw ≈Åo≈õ and Stanis≈Çaw Stempowski, and its founder and prime mover as well as the Bulletin's editor was W≈Çodzimierz BƒÖczkowski, a leading figure in the \\"Promethean movement.\\" From March 1934 Charaszkiewicz was a member of the Commission for Scientific Study of [Poland's] Eastern Lands (Komisja Naukowych Bada≈Ñ Ziem Wschodnich) and the Committee on [Poland's] Eastern Lands and Nationalities (Komitet do Spraw Ziem Wschodnich i Narodowo≈õciowych) at the Council of Ministers. He had already become a spokesman for the oppressed peoples east of Poland who wished to deepen their national self-awareness and groom leaders for their liberation.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 15‚Äì16. Since 1927, Wasilewski, S≈Çawek, Schaetzel and Ho≈Ç√≥wko had been laying foundations for Promethean movements in Paris, Warsaw and Istanbul. They had been studying questions involving national self-determination and federative polities with help from academic experts at institutions such as the Eastern Institute (Instytut Wschodni) in Warsaw and an analogous one in Vilnius, as well as at an Institute for Study of Nationalities (Instytut Bada≈Ñ Narodowo≈õciowych) and at several publications.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 16. Charaszkiewicz's deputies at Office 2 were two officers from the Third Silesian uprising: Major Feliks Ankerstein (1929‚Äì39), who during that Uprising had commanded a group (from 27 April 1921, the subgroup \\"Butrym\\"); and Major W≈Çodzimierz DƒÖbrowski, who had commanded group \\"G\\" in the Destruction Office (Referat Destrukcji).Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 16‚Äì17.  Covert operations  It appears that, as of 1935, Office 2 employed 11 officers, seven of them in Office [Referat] \\"A\\" (for the West‚ÄîGermany, East Prussia, Danzig, Czechoslovakia), headed by Ankerstein, and 22 civilian contract workers. The officer cadre were fairly stable; most of the officers served in Office 2 for at least six years.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 17‚Äì18. A principal task of Office 2 was organizing and conducting clandestine operations outside Poland, chiefly in bordering countries, and preparing resistance cells in areas of Poland that, in the event of war, might be occupied by enemy forces. Office \\"B\\" (responsible for the East), headed in 1937‚Äì39 by Major DƒÖbrowski, prepared clandestine actions against the Soviet Union, conducting \\"Promethean operations\\" among non-Russian peoples (e.g. Caucasus, Tatar, Ukrainian and Cossack √©migr√©s) and creating covert organizations at Poland's borders with Soviet Belarus and Ukraine. Office \\"A\\" (the West) was tasked with preparing and running clandestine operations against \\"Western\\" countries of interest.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 18. Agents of Office 2 operated in Germany, Danzig, Czechoslovakia and Lithuania. They also penetrated anti-Hitler German √©migr√© communities in Czechoslovakia and especially in France. In 1935 Charaszkiewicz and Ankerstein organized in the Free City of Danzig a covert \\"Group Zygmunt\\", which in September 1939, on the outbreak of World War II, would conspicuously defend the Polish Post Office in Danzig. \\"Group Zygmunt's\\" networks were to cover Poland's western border, Pomerania and the Free City of Danzig, and were to concentrate on sabotage and clandestine operations in the event of these areas' temporary occupation by the enemy. The signing of the Polish-German Non-aggression Pact of 26 January 1934, had produced a reorientation in Polish foreign policy. Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie area (which was in dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia) had lain outside Office 2's sphere of interest, but from spring 1934 covert propaganda and clandestine operations began to be developed there.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 19. Charaszkiewicz suggested to an old Polish Legions comrade, Wiktor Tomir Drymmer ‚Äì from 15 September 1933 to the outbreak of World War II, director of the Polish Foreign Ministry's Consular Department ‚Äì the creation of an organization covering all countries that harboured substantial Polish communities. They agreed that this would be necessary due to the inevitability of war with Nazi Germany. They were also agreed that the organization was to be strictly covert, both in Poland and abroad; was to be of a nationalist character; and was to be elite rather than large-scale in nature. The organization's regulations were drawn up by Captain Ankerstein. Eventually it was decided that the organization should be run by a \\"Committee of Seven\\" (K-7) comprising half Foreign Ministry personnel ‚Äì Drymmer, his political deputy Dr. W≈Çadys≈Çaw J√≥zef Zaleski, Tadeusz Kowalski, and the latter's deputy Tadeusz Kawalec ‚Äì and half Office 2 personnel: Charaszkiewicz, Ankerstein and the latter's deputy, Captain Wojciech Lipi≈Ñski. Later, Lieutenant Colonel Ludwik Zych, chief of staff of Poland's Border Guard (Stra≈º Graniczna), would be coopted.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 19‚Äì20. K-7 set about recruiting young Poles residing in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia and Romania's Bukovina. They were trained in small groups in Poland, to be deployed in wartime. Beginning in May 1938, K-7 conducted courses in Warsaw, Gdynia and several other Polish localities.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 20. In Zaolzie, about 1935, the first Polish clandestine operations had taken place; later, during Poland's 1938 annexation of that territory, K-7 members participated. The proceedings were directed from Warsaw by Drymmer and Charaszkiewicz, and on the ground by Ankerstein and later Zych. After the Zaolzie takeover, preparations began on 7 October 1938 for a covert operation codenamed ≈Åom (\\"Crowbar\\")Pawe≈Ç Samu≈õ et al., Akcja \\"≈Åom\\", passim. in easternmost Czechoslovakia's Carpathian Rus, coordinated with Hungarian operations conducted from the south. The Polish commander on the ground was again Major Ankerstein, while at Warsaw Charaszkiewicz was again in overall command. The operation took place in October and November 1938 and helped bring about the First Vienna Award (2 November 1938). In mid-March 1939, the operation's objective was fully accomplished:Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 20‚Äì21. the restoration of Carpathian Rus to its pre-World War I master, Hungary, and thereby also the recreation of the historic common Polish- Hungarian border. Six months later, during the September 1939 invasion of Poland, the common Polish-Hungarian border would become of pivotal importance when Hungarian Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy's government, as a matter of \\"Hungarian honor,\\" declined Hitler's request for permission to send German forces across Carpathian Rus into southeastern Poland to speed Poland's conquest. Horthy's refusal allowed the Polish government and tens of thousands of Polish military to escape into neighbouring Hungary and Romania; and from there, to France and French-mandated Syria, to carry on the war as the third-strongest Allied belligerent after Britain and France.J√≥zef Kasparek, \\"Poland's 1938 Covert Operations in Ruthenia\\" and Przepust karpacki (The Carpathian Back Door); and Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Referat o dzia≈Çaniach dywersyjnych na Rusi Karpackiej\\" (\\"Report on Covert Operations in Carpathian Rus\\"). Office 2's next task was organizing \\"behind-the-lines covert-operation networks\\" (siatki dywersji pozafrontowej) that were to undertake intelligence, sabotage and covert operations upon the outbreak of war, especially in areas occupied by the Germans. Charaszkiewicz was a conceptual founder of these networks. Particularly intensive work on them began early in May 1939. These structures were given diverse names such as \\"Secret Military Organization\\" (Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa, or TOW) and \\"Mobile Combat Units\\" (Lotne Oddzia≈Çy Bojowe). In many cases ‚Äì in Silesia, in southwestern Poland, and in western Poland ‚Äì after Poland had been overrun by Germany in September 1939, these networks became the foundations for the first local underground resistance organizations, which in many cases later became part of the Union for Armed Struggle (ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej, or ZWZ).Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 21. One such organization that arose on the foundation of a \\"behind-the-lines covert- operation network,\\" in Krak√≥w on 22 September 1939, was the White Eagle Organization (Organizacja Or≈Ça Bia≈Çego, or OOB), which soon, in 1940, became part of ZWZ. The OOB was a major organization that, in addition to southern Poland, also held some sway in Silesia, Warsaw and Lublin. The order to form OOB was issued by Charaszkiewicz's deputy, Major Ankerstein, who had returned from Hungary to Krak√≥w expressly for that purpose. He also conducted a three- day covert-operations training for Organization members before making his way back to Hungary and proceeding on to the West.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 21‚Äì22. Before the war, a network of clandestine groups was created, tasked with paralysing lines of communication and destroying enemy supply depots and command networks. Their membership was drawn from varied backgrounds, including the Riflemen's Association (ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki), Reserve Noncommissioned Officers' Association (ZwiƒÖzek Podoficer√≥w Rezerwy), Reserve Officers' Association (ZwiƒÖzek Oficer√≥w Rezerwy), referrals by County Offices of Physical Education and Military Training (Powiatowe Urzƒôdy Wychowania Fizycznego i Przysposobienia Wojskowego, or PUWFiPW), the Polish Scouting Association (ZwiƒÖzek Harcerzy Polskich, or ZHP), the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), and a host of other organizations.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 22‚Äì23. The preparatory work was coordinated by a Department for Planning Wartime Intelligence and Covert Operations (Wydzia≈Ç Planowania Wywiadu I Dywersji Wojennej), created in late 1937. Its tasks included organizing mobilization procedures for the foreign intelligence network and assuring its functioning under wartime conditions, as well as securing covert support for the army at the front.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 22. Spring 1938 saw expanded training of clandestine networks. Courses organized by Office 2, disguised as civil- defense training, might cover cryptology, intelligence microphotography, toxicology, railway sabotage, hand-to-hand combat, new weapons, explosives, and suppression of fires. In view of the enemy's growing preponderance in armour, artillery and especially air forces, it had been decided to increase the tasks set for covert-operations networks. On 3 June 1939 Section II sent, to army commanders, regulations for covert operations; among other things, it was set down that only those members of a covert unit should know each other who were to carry out practically defined assignments. In summer 1939, weapons and explosives began to be distributed to clandestine centres and patrols. Deliveries were also made to networks created within the Third Reich. Despite the secrecy of the preparations, German intelligence obtained information on the Polish networks, and German security agencies received orders to suppress the Polish networks. When overt war did come in September 1939, the mass terror applied to the Polish population by the Germans, in many instances ‚Äì though by no means universally ‚Äì paralysed the Polish clandestine networks.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 23‚Äì24. In September 1939, during the Polish retreat before advancing German forces, Drymmer and other clandestine- operations leaders, as early as their stop at Kazimierz Dolny on the Vistula River, left behind K-7 members and freshly sworn-in individuals. Likewise, at a Polish consulate in Romania's Bukovina, K-7 trained a group of young men in covert action. Major Charaszkiewicz himself, at the outbreak of war, became head of Department (Wydzia≈Ç) F at the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief and carried on this function from 1 to 20 September 1939. According to other information, he was special-assignments officer to the Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, and in that capacity with the Marshal's approval commissioned the creation of at least one underground organization about 12 September. Next Charaszkiewicz, along with other K-7 members, crossed Poland's border into Romania. There he organized a group of officers who were to return to occupied Poland to set up another underground organization.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 24‚Äì25.Before the war, one of the leaders of a covert-operations network had been Henryk J√≥zewski. Grzywacz et al. remark (p. 25) on the evidently strong influences, in the early establishment of the Polish World War II underground movement, of individuals connected with the Sanation political camp and with Section II's Office 2. Colin Gubbins In Romania, Charaszkiewicz established ties with a Sanation group, the \\"Schaetzel-Drymmer group,\\" that was ill-disposed to Marshal Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy and supportive of Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck. Charaszkiewicz also played a substantial role in creating an Office (Ekspozytura) \\"R\\" of Polish intelligence headquartered in Bucharest, with satellite outposts scattered about Romania. It was important not only to the conduct of intelligence work but to liaison with occupied Poland.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 25. In Bucharest, in October 1939, Charaszkiewicz received from his British colleague, Lt. Col. Colin Gubbins ‚Äì soon to become the prime mover of the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.) ‚Äì a very warm letter informing him that Gubbins had been personally searching for him, and offering every possible assistance, including financial (Charaszkiewicz declined the money). Through Gubbins' good offices, Charaszkiewicz obtained from the British military attach√© a British visa.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Raport o wsp√≥≈Çpracy z wywiadem angielskim przed wybuchem wojny\\" (\\"Report on Prewar Cooperation with British Intelligence\\"), p. 134.  France and Britain  Charaszkiewicz never used the visa. On 31 October 1939 he arrived in France, where at first (November 1939 ‚Äì April 1940) he found himself without assignment at the Bessieres barracks. After a brief stay (April‚ÄìMay 1940) in an officers' camp at Vichy, he joined the Officers' Legion at Niort. During the \\"phony war,\\" the new Polish premier and commander-in-chief in exile, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, investigated the causes of Poland's defeat in September 1939. Officers with pertinent knowledge were instructed to submit reports. Probably it was in response to this that Charaszkiewicz drew up the series of intriguing reports in late 1939 and early 1940 that comprise the bulk of his Collection of Documents that was published 60 years later, in 2000.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, Zbi√≥r dokument√≥w pp≈Çk. Edmunda Charaszkiewicz (A Collection of Documents by Lt. Col. Edmund Charaszkiewicz). Sikorski, whose own military and political career in Poland had been stymied while the Pi≈Çsudskiites held sway after the May 1926 coup d'√©tat, now sidelined many officers deemed to have been close to the Pi≈Çsudskiites. Perhaps that was why an officer as experienced in clandestine warfare as Charaszkiewicz, then only 44 years old, apparently was never again entrusted with such operations.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 25‚Äì26. After France's capitulation (22 June 1940) Charaszkiewicz managed to evacuate to Great Britain. In Scotland he was accommodated at the Douglas officers' camp (July‚ÄìAugust 1940), then the Broughton officers' camp (August‚ÄìSeptember 1940). He organized, and served as deputy commander, then commander, of armoured trains \\"C\\" and later \\"D\\" (October 1940 ‚Äì August 1943) of the 1st Armored Train Command (1 Dywizjon PociƒÖg√≥w Pancernych). On 3 August 1943 he was transferred to the Polish Infantry Training Center (Centrum Wyszkolenia Piechoty), then to the Administrative Department (Oddzia≈Ç) of the Polish Ministry of National Defense. Next, to the conclusion of military operations and till February 1946, he was deputy chief, then chief, of the Information Department of the Inspectorate of Polish Military Headquarters. On 27 May 1945 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. From February to April 1946 he directed the General Department (Wydzia≈Ç) in the Inspectorate for Civilian Affairs, and in September 1946 he joined the Polish Resettlement Corps. He was demobilized on 11 September 1948 and settled in London. Charaszkiewicz took an active part in Polish √©migr√© life: in the Pi≈Çsudskiite \\"League for Polish Independence\\" (Liga Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci Polski) and in the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute (of which he was for many years president). He founded and for some years edited the Institute's periodical, Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá (Independence). He was also prominent in the Silesian Insurgents' Association (ZwiƒÖzek Powsta≈Ñc√≥w ≈ölƒÖskich). He continued to be a foremost exponent of Prometheism, whose perhaps most important voice he had been over the many years of his involvement with the movement.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., pp. 26‚Äì27. During his career as an intelligence and covert-operations officer, Charaszkiewicz helped pioneer modern techniques of asymmetric warfare. Just before World War II, during a week's visit to London, he shared information on these with Britain's Colonel Holland, Lt. Colonel Gubbins (future leader of the Special Operations Executive), and technical specialists. In his reports about these meetings, Charaszkiewicz noted how far Poland's techniques outstripped Britain's.Edmund Charaszkiewicz, \\"Raport o wsp√≥≈Çpracy z wywiadem angielskim przed wybuchem wojny\\" (\\"Report on Prewar Cooperation with British Intelligence\\"), pp. 131‚Äì34. He died in London on 22 December 1975.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., p. 27. Decorations Charaszkiewicz received many Polish decorations, including the Cross of Virtuti Militari (Silver Cross, 1922), the Order of Polonia Restituta (3rd [Commander], 4th [Officer] and 5th [Knight] classes), the Cross of Independence with Swords (1931), the Cross of Valor (Krzy≈º Walecznych, 1922, three times), the Silver Cross of Merit, and the Silesian Sash of Valor and Merit (≈ölƒÖska Wstƒôga Walecznych i Zas≈Çu≈ºonych), as well as numerous foreign decorations.

WKPE-FM is locally owned by \\"Cape Cod Broadcasting\\" (also known as Sandab Communications). History The station signed on on April 5, 1991, under the callsign WVCU, which changed to WATB that June. On May 6, 1994, the station changed calls again to WOCN-FM. From the moment the station signed on, the station aired a soft AC format. =2007 format change= Beginning on September 25, 2007, the station began stunting. Initially, the stunting involved playing one song in a loop. Each day the station added another song to the line up. On the tenth day of the stunt program (October 4, 2007), the songs began disappearing from the rotation. An announcement between songs also began to play, noting how many more days were left (counting down from 8 days) before the new format would be announced on October 12, 2007. The list of songs played during the stunt were: \\"American Pie\\" by Don McLean, \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\" by Ella Fitzgerald, \\"Rehab\\" by Amy Winehouse, \\"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\\" by Thurl Ravenscroft (the voice of Tony the Tiger), \\"Thriller\\" by Michael Jackson, \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" by The Dixie Chicks, \\"Dirty Water\\" by The Standells, \\"Gone Country\\" by Alan Jackson, and \\"Sexyback\\" by Justin Timberlake.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 13, 1992. In the episode, Bart gets a month's detention for breaking the class aquarium with a yo-yo. To get even with Mrs. Krabappel, Bart responds to her personal ad pretending to be a man named Woodrow. In the subplot, Ned Flanders asks Homer to curtail his swearing, so Homer starts using a swear jar. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined what it was like to have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially in response to the complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalb√°n. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image. Plot Springfield Elementary School teacher Edna Krabappel places a personal ad in the newspaper because she feels lonely and isolated. A yo-yo craze sweeps the school after a performance group demonstrates the toy's potential. When Bart breaks the class fish tank with his yo-yo, Edna gives him one month's detention. While snooping in her desk to retrieve his yo-yo, he discovers her personal ad and seeks revenge by responding to it as a prank. Bart creates an adult male alter ego named Woodrow after seeing former President Woodrow Wilson's portrait on the classroom wall. When Edna responds with a suggestive photograph, Bart sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe as Woodrow. Using dialogue from old romance films, Bart tells Edna what she wants to hear and asks to meet her at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. On his way to the cinema, Bart sees her waiting for Woodrow and laughs. He feels guilty when he sees she is still at the restaurant on the verge of tears after the film ends. Bart feels worse after being unable to console Edna. He tells his family about his prank letters. Realizing the truth would humiliate Edna, Lisa suggests \\"Woodrow\\" write her a letter saying he loves her but is leaving town. When Edna receives a gentle and romantic breakup letter saying Woodrow will never forget her, she feels better. She and Bart spend his last day of detention having fun outside the classroom. In the subplot, Marge notices that Santa's Little Helper needs a new dog house. Homer tries to save money by building one himself, but his attempts fail and he curses loudly enough for Todd Flanders to overhear. When Todd says \\"damn\\" and \\"hell no\\" at dinner, Ned finds he learned those curse words from Homer. Ned complains to Homer, who criticizes his mustache. Ned promises to shave it off if Homer stops swearing. Marge suggests he put twenty-five cents for each curse in a swear jar. Homer's constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to buy a dog house and a six-pack of beer. Production Hockey legend Gordie Howe The script for \\"Bart the Lover\\" was written by Jon Vitti, who wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined what it was like to have Bart as a student. Executive producer Mike Reiss pitched the idea of having Bart answer Mrs. Krabappel's personal ad.Vitti, Jon. (2003).

Commentary for \\"Bart the Lover\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Near the end of the episode, there is a montage where Homer has a series of bad experiences that cause him to curse, although the scene always cuts out before he can be heard swearing. While recording Homer's lines for that sequence, Dan Castellaneta was told to include the cursing. According to Mike Reiss, by coincidence, some eight-year-old children were allowed to visit the studio the day those lines were recorded. Reiss recalls that \\"their eyes were as big as saucers\\" after hearing Castellaneta curse. The ending of the episode was largely pitched by James L. Brooks, who wanted a scene where the entire family got together to write Woodrow's final letter to Edna. The episode was directed by Carlos Baeza.Silverman, David. (2003). Commentary for \\"Bart the Lover\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the background of the classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries to think of a name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalb√°n. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. Howe's wife Colleen convinced him to allow the show to use his image. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run. During the opening sequence in which Bart's class watch a film about zinc, a character in the film tries to shoot himself in the head. The Fox censors objected to this, so the producers had to claim that the character was not aiming at his head. For the name of the yo-yo trick that Bart performs for Milhouse, the writers had wanted to use a term that was slang for masturbation. They proposed several names to the censors, and \\"Plucking the Pickle\\" was the term they deemed acceptable. Cultural references The 1950s educational film at the beginning of the episode is a reference to old science movies that were often shown in classes when the writers were in school; specifically it was a parody of the 1940s educational short film A Case of Spring Fever (later featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000).Jean, Al. (2003). Easter Egg commentary for \\"Bart the Lover\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The Twirl King yo-yo champions are based on groups that companies like Duncan sent to schools to perform tricks. King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew's name appears on a paper Edna Krabappel is grading during detention. Todd Flanders watches a television show that features Gomer Pyle from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.. Bart sees the fictional movie Ernest Needs A Kidney, based on the character Ernest P. Worrell. Rod and Todd Flanders sing the song \\"Bringing in the Sheaves\\", because the writers liked having them sing \\"obscure religious songs\\". Mrs. Krabappel flicks through an issue of the Springfield Magazine which features an interview with the reclusive J. D. Salinger. Reception Marcia Wallace won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over as Mrs. Krabappel. In its original airing on Fox during February sweeps, the episode had a 12.9 Nielsen rating and was viewed in approximately 11.88 million homes. It finished the week of February 10‚Äì16, 1992 ranked 29th, up from the season's average rank of 39th. The Simpsons was the second highest rated show on Fox that week, after Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It was named the eighth best episode of The Simpsons by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said \\"Bart the Lover\\" represents The Simpsons \\"at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out the good stuff with surprising accuracy and skill\\". Gibron added that the episode shows that the made-up romance between Mrs. Krabappel and Woodrow \\"works because it's so painfully true. [...] How the kiss-off to Mrs. Krabappel is created and handled shows that The Simpsons has heart to add to its humor.\\" Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed rated the episode a 5(of 5). He thought the intertwining of the two plots in the episode \\"works very well, creating a fast paced story. Bart's alias, Woodrow, is a delight to hear in voice-overs and Homer's antics produce many laughs.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said \\"Bart the Lover\\" stands out as a \\"very strong episode\\" because it \\"steers clear of most potentially sappy material and offers a lively piece. [...] The 'B' story in which Homer tries not to swear also swings and creates some great moments.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said they \\"loved\\" Homer's suggestion for the kiss-off letter from Woodrow: \\"Dear Baby. Welcome to Dumpsville, population: you. P.S. I am gay.\\" In 2000, the staff of the Star Tribune listed their top ten episodes. \\"Bart the Lover\\" was listed at number four. In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed an education film seen in the episode among \\"The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons\\", writing: \\"'Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones, car batteries, handguns and many things made of zinc,' says Jimmy, a character in an educational film. When confronted with a world without zinc he attempts suicide but fails, as his zinc-free gun cannot work.\\" In 2002, Bill Brioux of The Canadian Press ranked the episode and its use of Gordie Howe as the top reference to Canada on the show. In 2004, ESPN released a list of the Top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking Gordie Howe's image in the episode at number 34. In 2013 a Wired article described the episode as \\"the best Krabappel (and arguably best Simpsons) episode\\".

It is a common feature in identity management software and often bundled in the same software package as a password synchronization capability. Typically users who have forgotten their password launch a self-service application from an extension to their workstation login prompt, using their own or another user's web browser, or through a telephone call. Users establish their identity, without using their forgotten or disabled password, by answering a series of personal questions, using a hardware authentication token, responding to a notification e-mail or, less often, by providing a biometric sample such as voice recognition. Users can then either specify a new, unlocked password, or ask that a randomly generated one be provided. Self-service password reset expedites problem resolution for users \\"after the fact\\", and thus reduces help desk call volume. It can also be used to ensure that password problems are only resolved after adequate user authentication, eliminating an important weakness of many help desks: social engineering attacks, where an intruder calls the help desk, pretends to be the intended victim user, claims to have forgotten the account password, and asks for a new password. Multi-factor authentication Rather than merely asking users to answer security questions, modern password reset systems may also leverage a sequence of authentication steps: * Ask users to complete a CAPTCHA, to demonstrate that they are human. * Ask users to enter a PIN which is sent to their personal e-mail address or mobile phone. * Require use of another technology, such as a one-time-password token. * Leverage biometrics, such as a voice print. * An authenticator, such as Google Authenticator or an SMS code. Security of authenticating users purely by asking security questions Despite the benefits, a self-service password reset that relies solely on answers to personal questions can introduce new vulnerabilities, since the answers to such questions can often be obtained by social engineering, phishing techniques or simple research. While users are frequently reminded never to reveal their password, they are less likely to treat as sensitive the answers to many commonly used security questions, such as pet names, place of birth or favorite movie. Much of this information may be publicly available on some users' personal home pages. Other answers can be elicited by someone pretending to conduct an opinion survey or offering a free dating service. Since many organizations have standard ways of determining login names from real names, an attacker who knows the names of several employees at such an organization can choose one whose security answers are most readily obtained. This vulnerability is not strictly due to self-service password reset‚Äîit often exists in the help desk prior to deployment of automation. Self-service password reset technology is often used to reduce this type of vulnerability, by introducing stronger caller authentication factors than the human-operated help desk had been using prior to deployment of automation. In September 2008, the Yahoo e-mail account of Governor of Alaska and Vice President of the United States nominee Sarah Palin was accessed without authorization by someone who was able to research answers to two of her security questions, her zip code and date of birth and was able to guess the third, where she met her husband. This incident clearly highlighted that the choice of security questions is very important to prevent social engineering attacks on password systems. Preference-based authentication Jakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang proposed to use preferences to authenticate users for password reset. The underlying insights are that preferences are stable over a long period of time, and are not publicly recorded. Their approach includes two phases---setup and authentication. During the setup, a user is asked to select items that they either like or dislike from several categories of items which are dynamically selected from a big candidate set and are presented to the user in a random order. During the authentication phase, users are asked to classify their preferences (like or dislike) for the selected items displayed to them in a random order. Jakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang evaluated the security of their approach by user experiments, user emulations, and attacker simulations. Two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication is a 'strong authentication' method, as it adds another layer of security to the password reset process. In most cases this consists of Preference Based Authentication plus a second form of physical authentication (using something the user possesses, i.e. Smartcards, USB tokens, etc.). One popular method is through SMS and email. Advanced SSPR software requires the user to provide a mobile phone number or personal e-mail address during setup. In the event of a password reset, a PIN code will be sent to the user's phone or email and they will need to enter this code during the password reset process. Modern technology also allows authentication via voice biometrics using voice recognition technology.Inference Solutions (2015). Accessibility A major problem with self-service password reset inside corporations and similar organizations is enabling users to access the system if they forgot their primary password. Since SSPR systems are typically web-based, users need to launch a web browser to fix the problem, yet cannot log into the workstation until the problem is solved. There are various approaches to addressing this Catch-22, most of which are compromises (e.g., desktop software deployment, domain-wide password reset account, telephone access, visiting a neighbour, continuing to call the help desk, etc.). Some companies have created software which presents a restricted web browser at the login screen with the sole ability to access the password reset page without logging into the system; an example of this is Novell's Client Login Extension technology. Because these technologies effectively give the user access to computer resources, specifically a web browser, to reset passwords without authenticating to the computer, security is a high priority and capabilities are very limited so that the user cannot do more than is expected in this mode. There are two additional problems related to the one of locked out users: * Mobile users, physically away from the corporate network, who forgot their PC's login password. * Passwords cached by the operating system or browser, which might continue to be offered to servers after a password change that was initiated on another computer (help desk, password management web server, etc.) and therefore trigger an intruder lockout. The vouching option In conjunction with preference-based authentication, self-service password reset procedures could also rely on the network of existing human relations among users. In this scenario, the user who forgot the password asks a colleague for assistance. The \\"helper\\" colleague authenticates with the password reset application and vouches for user's identity. In this scenario, the problem changes from one of authenticating the user who forgot the password to one of understanding which users should have the ability to vouch for which other users.

Samurai of the K≈çka-ry≈´ were known as \\"K≈çka-no-mono\\" and operated as shinobi throughout Japan's Warring States period. History The beginnings of the K≈çka-ry≈´ may be traced to near the end of the Muromachi period. While the district of K≈çka, in ≈åmi Province, was under the jurisdiction of the Rokkaku clan, it was a kind of autonomous municipality, composed of localized unions called s≈ç (). All important decisions in the municipality were made by a majority vote from the union representatives. This kind of system was uncommon for the period in question. At this time, the leaders of the Rokkaku clan, using Kannonji Castle as a base, started to steadily build up military might. They made light of commands from the Ashikaga shogunate and eventually began to ignore the shogunate altogether. In 1487, General Ashikaga Yoshihisa brought with him an army to stamp out this rebellion, and a battle between Ashikaga and the Rokkaku forces ensued. Ashikaga mobilized daimy≈çs from several provinces against the castle of Kannonji, the headquarters of the Rokkaku; as a result, Rokkaku Masayori and Rokkaku Takayori (Masayori's son) were forced to flee to the castle of K≈çka. The factual accuracy of their escape is debated; it is likely that they gave up the town to avoid a direct confrontation instead. Ashikaga then moved his base to Anshiyoji of Kurita District and attacked the castle of K≈çka. K≈çka fell, but the Rokkaku duo escaped again and ordered the K≈çka samurai who followed them to mount a heavy resistance against Ashikaga using guerrilla warfare. Exploiting their geographical advantage in the mountains, the K≈çka warriors launched a wide range of surprise attacks against Ashikaga's forces and tormented them by using fire and smoke on Ashikaga's camp during the night. The guerrilla warfare prevented a final showdown, until Ashikaga died in battle in 1489, ending the three-year conflict and sparing the lives of the Rokkaku duo. The elusive and effective guerrilla warfare used by the K≈çka samurai became well known throughout the whole country. As a result of this victory, the local samurai in the 53 families who participated in this battle were called \\"the 53 families of K≈çka\\". The last reported S≈çke of K≈çga-ry≈´ was 14th headmaster Fujita Seiko (1898‚Äì1966). In his autobiography Doronron: Saigo no Ninja ( \\"The last ninja\\", October 1958), Fujita categorically stated that he had not and would not teach anyone ninjutsu, and would not pass on the school. The Bugei Ryuha Daijiten, a definitive Encyclopedia of martial arts schools, catalog of Kory≈´ Bujutsu (old schools) and Gendai Bud≈ç (new schools) of Japanese martial arts (bud≈ç) states that no one knows the teachings of this school today. Few today who state a connection to Koga Ryu can show any evidence to refute this claim, and it is in all likelihood that there are no authentic living traditions practiced today.

It is approximately 200 million years old.Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins . Palaeobiology and Biodiversity Research Group, University of Bristol. Megazostrodon rudnerae means, literally, ‚ÄòRudner‚Äôs large girdle tooth‚Äô (from the Greek mega-large, zostros- girdle and don-tooth -- referring to the founder, Ione Rudner, and the large external cingula, or ridges of the upper molars). Characteristics Megazostrodon was a small, shrew-like animal between long which probably ate insects and small lizards. It is thought to have been nocturnal as it had a much larger brain than its cynodont relatives and the enlarged areas of its brain were found to be those that process sounds and smells. This was probably in order to avoid being in competition with the reptiles or becoming prey to the dinosaurs.Smithsonian Science Abstract Although considered a mammal (or mammaliaform), it did have some non-mammalian characteristics inherited from its predecessors: the first two vertebrae (atlas and axis) were still unfused as in cynodonts, and it only had three sacral vertebrae instead of the usual mammalian five.Kemp, The Origin and Evolution of Mammals, (2004). Oxford Univ. Press, p. 146. An interclavicle is also present, another trait inherited from non-mammlian cynodonts, and still present in monotremes. Evolution Megazostrodon is the only well-known genus of the family Megazostrodontidae, part of the larger group called Morganucodonta. The other members of this family that are currently known are Indozostrodon, Dinnetherium, Wareolestes and Brachyzostrodon. The megazostrodontids used to be classified as members of a group of mammals called the Triconodonts, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of cynodontsMammalogy Sam Houston State University. during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms outside of the stricter grouping of Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. The distinction between true Mammalia and Mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals in the general sense of the word. These early mammals developed many traits which were to make them well-suited for a very active lifestyle. They developed four types of teethFirst Mammals Appear (as opposed to the uniform teeth of the reptiles), incisors, canines, premolars and molars, which enabled them to chew and therefore process their food more thoroughly than their reptilian cousins. There is evidence that the movement of the mandible allowed a shearing action to chew food. Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more mobile, being less laterally splayed,Mammalian Characteristics. Sam Houston State University. and allowing faster forward motion. They had a shorter ribcage and larger lungs which allowed more efficient respiration. Their lower jaw comprised a single bone -- the dentary (as opposed to the multiple bones in the jaws of their ancestors, or seven different bones found in reptilian lower jaws). The other bones which once made up the jaw had reduced, and in later mammals would become incorporated into the middle ear, enhancing their hearing. Probably the most important change in the evolution of the first mammals was that their ancestors, the cynodonts, had become warm- blooded. This meant that they generated their own body heat, relying on the food they ate to help sustain their body temperature rather than depending on their surrounding environment. This permitted higher, more sustained activity levels during the day than reptiles (reptiles must frequently perform temperature regulation activities such as sun basking and seeking shade). It was probably the key to becoming nocturnal -- a major advantage in a world where most predators were active during the day. ;Phylogeny Reproduction Like placentals and possibly Erythrotherium, Megazostrodon is unique among mammaliformes in lacking epipubic bones. Jason A. Lillegraven, Zofia Kielan- Jaworowska, William A. Clemens, Mesozoic Mammals: The First Two-Thirds of Mammalian History, University of California Press, 17/12/1979 - 321 It is likely that Megazostrodon, like all early mammals and the modern monotremes, laid eggs.

DeRogatis has written articles for magazines such as Spin, Guitar World and Modern Drummer, and for fifteen years was the pop music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times. He joined Columbia College Chicago's English Department as a lecturer in 2010 and is currently an associate professor of instruction teaching Music & Media in Chicago, Reviewing the Arts, Cultural Criticism and the Arts, and Journalism as Literature. Career In 1982, while a senior at Hudson Catholic Regional High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, DeRogatis conducted one of the last interviews with rock critic Lester Bangs, two weeks before Bangs's death of a drug overdose. Over a decade later, this encounter would serve as the beginning and inspiration for DeRogatis's Lester Bangs biography Let It Blurt. Attending on a scholarship, DeRogatis attended New York University majoring in journalism and minoring in sociology. As a junior, DeRogatis began writing for the Hoboken Reporter, first as a music columnist before adding city government to his reporting duties. In 1985, at the start of his senior year, DeRogatis began writing full time for the Jersey Journal, spending two nights a week on news stories and three days on wedding and church announcements. After living in Minneapolis to manage a friend's band and do freelance music writing, DeRogatis first joined the Chicago Sun-Times in 1992; he left in 1995 to join Rolling Stone magazine, a job that lasted eight months, and was back at the Sun-Times in three years. While at Rolling Stone magazine, he was fired after writing a negative review of Hootie & the Blowfish's album Fairweather Johnson. The review irked Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner who had it pulled from publication. DeRogatis's employment with the magazine was terminated after he revealed this incident to the public. DeRogatis hosts Sound Opinions with fellow music critic Greg Kot. The radio talk show is heard on Chicago Public Radio and nationally syndicated by American Public Media and is available as a podcast. The program is one of the longest running talk radio shows focusing exclusively on rock music with stints on both Chicago's WXRT and an early incarnation on Q101 featuring Bill Wyman from the Chicago Reader in place of Greg Kot. The move to Chicago Public Radio took place on December 3, 2005.

Vortis has released two albums and a third is due to be released soon. Ryan Adams DeRogatis became known also for a scathing review of a Ryan Adams show in Chicago, which prompted Adams to leave a \\"grumpy\\" message on DeRogatis's answering machine, in which he blasted DeRogatis for seeming to desire criticizing the artist, not the music. Adams later commented that DeRogatis shouldn't have made the recording public, and that leaving the message in the first place was a mistake since it empowered the critic. R. Kelly DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch reported for the Chicago Sun-Times in December 2000 that court records and interviews alleged that musician R. Kelly had used his position of fame and influence to meet and have sex with underage girls. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported in February 2002 that a videotape had surfaced allegedly featuring Kelly engaging in sex with a 14-year-old girl. As a Sun-Times music critic, DeRogatis had received the videotape and subsequently turned it over to police. DeRogatis was named as a witness in Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial. The defense lawyers charged that DeRogatis should be charged with child pornography for allegedly making a copy of the tape and showing it to another person after turning the original over to police. After initially failing to appear for the trial, DeRogatis was ordered by Judge Vincent Gaughan on May 30, 2008, to report to the trial the following day. However, upon questioning by Judge Gaughan outside of the presence of the jury, DeRogatis refused to provide substantive answers, citing his First and Fifth Amendment rights as the basis for his refusal. Judge Gaughan disagreed that as a journalist DeRogatis had a First Amendment basis for refusing to testify, but excused DeRogatis from taking the stand in front of the jury based upon his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. On July 17, 2017, DeRogatis reported for BuzzFeed News that Kelly had been accused by three sets of parents of holding their daughters in an \\"abusive cult\\". The result of 19 years of reporting, his latest book, Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly, was published by Abrams Press on June 4, 2019. Personal life DeRogatis was born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, in a Catholic family. When he was five, his father, an underwriter for Prudential Insurance Company, died of a heart attack in 1969. After rejecting religion during his freshman year of high school, DeRogatis became an atheist. In 2003, DeRogatis married Carm√©l Carrillo. He has a daughter, Melody (born circa 1997), from a previous marriage.

The governmental structure of the Venetian Republic Origins, composition, and powers The Council of Ten was created in 1310 by Doge Pietro Gradenigo.Chambers & Pullan, p. 55. Originally created as a temporary body to investigate the plot of Baiamonte Tiepolo and Marco Querini, the powers of the Council were made formally permanent in 1455.Edwards, p. 20. The Council was composed of ten patrician magistrates elected by the Great Council to one-year terms.Chambers & Pullan, p. 54. Until 1582, an additional zonta of around 15 to 20 members also served on the Council.Edwards, p. 20. No more than one member of the same family could serve on the Council at any one time,Chambers & Pullan, p. 55. and members could not be re-elected to successive terms.Edwards, p. 20. Elections took place annually in August and others in September.Chambers & Pullan, p. 54. The Council, which met at least weekly, had the power to impose punishments upon nobles, including banishment and capital punishment. Doge Marino Faliero was executed on the council's orders in 1355, and Count of Carmagnola was executed on the council's orders in 1432.Chambers & Pullan, pp. 55-56. The body's deliberations were highly secretive, and members of the Council of Ten took an oath of secrecy.Chambers & Pullan, pp. 56-57. Thomas Madden wrote: \\"The three capi of the Ten served for a month at a time and, to avoid any opportunity for bribery, were forbidden to leave the Ducal Palace during their tenure of office.\\" Historian Edward Wallace Muir Jr. wrote: \\"The Council of Ten stood somewhat apart from the hierarchy of offices but was proverbially powerful. With its secret funds, system of anonymous informers, police powers, and broad jurisdictional mandate over matters of state security, the members of the Council of Ten, along with those of the Collegio, rotated offices among themselves and constituted the inner circle of oligarchical patricians who, in effect, ruled the republic.\\"Edwards, p. 20. During the War of the League of Cambrai, for example, the Council had responsibility for finding ways to pay for the state's military expenses.David Michael D'Andrea, Civic Christianity in Renaissance Italy: The Hospital of Treviso, 1400-1530 (University of Rochester Press, 2007), p. 136. From the 1490s through the 1530s, the Council of Ten and other Venetian authorities enacted sumptuary laws.Chojnacki, pp. 263-64; Muir, p. 168. In 1506, the Ten enacted an anti-banqueting law, seeking to prevent ambitious noblemen from engaging in vote buying by hosting lavish dinner parties at the compaginie della calza (exclusive social societies). The law specifically prohibited women other than the wives of members from attending such dinners.Chojnacki, pp. 263-64. The Council was formally tasked with maintaining the security of the Republic and preserving the government from overthrow or corruption. However, its small size and ability to rapidly make decisions led to more mundane business being referred to it, and by 1457 it was enjoying almost unlimited authority over all governmental affairs. In particular, it oversaw Venice's diplomatic and intelligence services, managed its military affairs, and handled legal matters and enforcement. By the end of the sixteenth century, the Council of Ten had become Venice's spy chiefs, overseeing the city's vast intelligence network. The Council utilized bocche dei leoni (lion's mouths) placed around the city which allowed Venetians to report suspected illegal activities by placing a written note into the mouth. The lion's mouths were seen by later observers such as Mark Twain to represent an oppressive autocratic government that spied on its citizens, but in reality the reports placed in lion's mouths were examined and only credible reports were investigated. =State Inquisitors= In 1539, the Council established the State Inquisitors, a tribunal of three judges chosen from among its members to deal with threats to state security. The Inquisitors were given equal authority to that of the entire Council of Ten, and could try and convict those accused of treason independently of their parent body. To further these activities, the Inquisitors created a large network of spies and informants, both in Venice and abroad. Inquisitors could conduct secret trials with a low standard of proof, and the inquisitors' practices bore strong similarities to those of the Roman Inquisition, which was established three years later.De Vivo, p. 34. From 1624 onward, the Council of Ten was charged with the prosecution of all crimes involving the private lives of Venetian patricians.De Vivo, p. 34.

They are dense low evergreen mat-forming perennials or subshrubs, with leathery oval leaves 1‚Äì10 cm long. The flowers are produced in dense inflorescences (capitula) held above the plant on a 1‚Äì30 cm tall stem; the capitula is 1‚Äì3 cm in diameter, with numerous tightly packed purple, violet, pink or white flowers. Globularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora virgatella. Several members of the genus, such as Globularia cordifolia and Globularia punctata, are cultivated and sold for garden use. Under the old Cronquist system of plant classification, they were treated in their own family, Globulariaceae, but genetic evidence has shown that the genus belongs in the family Plantaginaceae.

CharactersMain= * Scary Godmother - A tall, skinny and pretty- looking fairy-witch with long curly red hair, pale green skin, small bat wings on her back, purple and green leggings. She lives on the Fright Side (a world where scary Halloween monsters live). She befriends a little girl named Hannah Marie, who was scared by her older cousin Jimmy into holding the doorknob to the haunted house Scary Godmother and her \\"broommates\\" were in. She also rides a broom and has a pet ghost cat named Boozle. Thompson has acknowledged that the character bears a resemblance to its creator. Her voice was done by Tabitha St. Germain in the TV adaptation. * Hannah Marie - Hannah is scared of monsters, but then she realizes monsters don't eat kids. Hannah's very kind and friendly, and it's implied that she has a crush on Orson, a young male vampire. In the first TV-special, her older cousin, Jimmy, and his friends scare her, but the monsters on the Fright Side help her get back at them in the end. Dresses as a fairy princess. She is voiced by Britt McKillip. * Jimmy - Hannah's cousin who has little affection for her. Since he didn't want to take her trick or treating, he and his friends instead plan on scaring her. However, his plan backfires after Hannah befriends Scary Godmother and her broommates, all of whom give Jimmy and his friends a taste of their own medicine. A year later, he was so traumatized by that ordeal that he tried to stop Halloween from happening (by destroying all Halloween-related items, like pumpkins, costumes and candy), but is otherwise touched when he stumbles into a party that Scary Godmother, Hannah, and their friends were celebrating. Often dresses in a Devil sweatsuit on Halloween. He was the antagonist of the 1st and 2nd books, but in the ending of 2nd and the rest of the series he became good. * Jimmy's friends - Jimmy's three companions, whom he talked into scaring his cousin, Hannah, when she first went trick-or-treating. Unlike Jimmy, they aren't bad children, just easily influenced. They were content with Hannah's company, and even helped her save Halloween when Jimmy tried to ruin it once. ** Bert - A boy and the most imaginative of the three. Dresses as a baseball player wearing a cardboard SUV around his body. ** Daryl - Sweet and naive. Dresses as a piece of candy. Has a crush on Katie. ** Katie - She's the most empathic of the three. Has a crush on Daryl, which is revealed when she tells him she'll trade him chocolate bar for a kiss, though also at times it seems she likes Jimmy. Dresses as a black cat. She is voiced by Britt Irvin. =Monsters= * Mr. Skully Pettibone - One of Scary Godmother's \\"broommates\\". He's the skeleton that hides in people's closets to keep their secrets safe, and, as he puts it, just rattle around. Come Halloween, there's nothing Skully likes more than to cut loose and roll the bones at a good party. His characterization in the books, and to a greater extent in the animated specials, is to a large extent that of a stereotypical \\"female lead's gay best friend,\\" as suggested by his repeatedly coming out of closets. His voice was done by Scott McNeil. * Bug-A-Boo - A huge, round monster with multiple yellow eyes, fur, a pointy tail, horns and a huge mouth with sharp teeth. He is the type of monster that lurks in places like basements, under beds, in closets, and other deep, dark places (and knows what children are scared of, even Jimmy and his friends). Frightened of him at first, Hannah perceived him as the \\"monster in the basement\\" that Jimmy told her would eat children lest she feeds him candy. While she does that, Bug-A-Boo tells her that his job is to scare children, not eat them! (\\"If I went around eatin' all the clients, I'd be out of work!\\"). They have since become great friends. His voice was done by Garry Chalk. * Harry - A talkative werewolf who wears a blue, lamb-patterned shirt. He hails from Ackerman Forest (a pun on horror honcho Forrest J Ackerman) which is somewhere in the Fright Side. With a hammy, self-absorbed and pitying personality and an insatiable appetite for food (especially candy and snacks), he is a huge nuisance to Scary Godmother and her broommates. Is a big fan of the TV \\"skelevision\\" show The Spectral Six. It is notable however that while annoying, Harry is still a full-grown male werewolf possessing razor-sharp claws and fangs, incredible strength, and highly acute lupine senses. It would be unwise to get between Harry and something he wants---especially if it's anything food-related. His voice was done by Garry Chalk. * Count Max - A tall, thin and bald vampire dressed in black. The most famous vampire on the Fright Side, he is the \\"King of the Night\\". Usually very old-fashioned, Max feels awkward for being so out of touch with the times. His visual design is suggestive of that of Count Orlok in Murnau's Nosferatu as played by Max Schreck, his vocal characterization of B√©la Lugosi impersonators. His voice was done by Scott McNeil. * Ruby - Max's beautiful wife who is also a vampire and the \\"Queen of the Night\\". She is more \\"modern\\" than her husband, which drives him batty. Has long, black hair and is clad in a satin dress. Her appearance recalls that of 1950s horror show hostess Vampira. Her voice was also done by Tabitha St. Germain in a Russian accent. * Orson - Max & Ruby's preteen son who is a vampire like his parents. He is the \\"Prince of the Night\\". Wears modern goth clothing, thin round glasses and has blue dyed hair. In the TV-specials, it's implied but never confirmed that he has a crush on Hannah (and that she may reciprocate his feelings). In the book versions, it's confirmed that Orson does in fact have a crush on Hannah. His voice is done by Richie Warke. Development Thompson described the work and the character this way: ‚ÄúScary Godmother is like your fairy godmother, but for Halloween. There‚Äôs really nothing scary about the Scary Godmother. She‚Äôs fun and macabre; reminiscent of childhood with a little bit of social commentary mixed in.\\" She stated that ‚Äúcomics are so segregated now‚Äù and that she wanted to create something that both young readers and adults could enjoy.\\" She decided to create something with a Halloween theme after looking for a Halloween-themed children's book for her niece and not finding anything that she liked. The books employ a combination of storybook/comic formats. Thompson does the interiors as well as the covers for Scary Godmother, and she said that planning ahead and meeting deadlines can be a challenge. Comics * Scary Godmother.

The first, Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktacular, premiered on television in Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Canada in 2003. Later, it premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network in 2004. The film was the first one Mainframe Entertainment used its new software/animation pipeline for. Jill Thompson co-wrote the script, and had some creative control over the project. When she was shown early character designs for the film which resembled the watercolor illustrations in her books, she requested that the characters instead be fully computer-generated.Karen Moltenbray, Witch‚Äôs Brew: Mainframe Entertainment mixes up a wide range of graphic styles to create a unique look for Scary Godmother, Computer Graphics World, October 2003, Volume 26, Number 10 (In an interview, Thompson stated that she wanted them to go with CGI because \\"I'm doing 2D. Nobody else should be doing 2D, just me.\\") However, the mostly static backgrounds used in the film more closely resemble traditional cel animation or the illustrations in Thompson's books. Because of that, the 3D characters often appear to \\"pop out\\" from their backgrounds. The visual style of the film has been described as resembling that of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas rather than that of computer-animated films such as Finding Nemo. A review of the film in School Library Journal, however, described the film as \\"Toy Story meets Tim Burton\\", and thought that the animation closely resembles Thompson's watercolor illustrations. The second, Scary Godmother: The Revenge of Jimmy (based on the second book), premiered in 2005.

Owned by Lotus Communications, the station airs a betting-focused all-sports radio format featuring programming from the locally-based \\"BetR Network\\" and programming from SportsMap. Its studios are in the unincorporated community of Spring Valley in Clark County and its transmitter is in North Las Vegas. History KLAV ran a middle-of-the-road (MOR) format until the late 1970s. In early 1979, at the peak of the disco craze, the station endeared itself \\"Disco 1-2-3 KLAV\\". KLAV evolved into a Top 40 format in the early 1980 under then program director Ted Ziegenbusch. It played a lot of R&B;/Urban music that key rival Top 40 station, 98.5 KLUC, would not play at the time. KLAV was the first commercial station to play rap/hip-hop music in Las Vegas. In 1985 the station briefly switched to an easy-listening format and changed its call letters to KEZD but returned to its traditional KLAV name and time-brokered format by 1987. KLAV previously broadcast from atop the former Bob Stupak's Vegas World Hotel & Casino until its closure in 2000. The station broadcast in a few locations around the Las Vegas Valley but eventually settled down at its current West Sahara Avenue location. In August 2012, KLAV was sold by Hemisphere Broadcasting to Lotus Broadcasting. In April 2015, KLAV flipped to a Regional Mexican format as La Caliente. In April 2017, while announcing that it had acquired the radio rights to the Vegas Golden Knights, Lotus announced that KLAV's FM transmitter K255CT would switch to a simulcast of KRLV. In 2019, KLAV relaunched as \\"La Ranchera 1020 AM\\", emphasizing ranchero music. In August 2020, the station switched to all sports betting when the former programming and branding from KBAD/KRLV was moved to the station. KLAV subsequently relaunced as 1230 The Game. Later that month it was announced that KLAV would be the flagship station for the Henderson Silver Knights of the American Hockey League.

It resembles an oval but is sometimes closer to a rectangle with rounded corners. These allow the contents to be easily scooped out of the container. The name is a portmanteau for \\"square round\\" (cartons), referring to a compromise between a square and a round carton. It is also sometimes known as the scround. \\"Squround\\" can apply to shapes of things other than tubs: Watches, swimming pools, bottles, etc. Ice cream squround containers The term applies mostly to ice cream packaging design, where the switch to a squround from paperboard bricks, cylindrical half-gallons and other containers is motivated by consumer preference, as well as cost effectiveness. These packages are more rectangular than square, but the side edges are rounded, while top and bottom surfaces are completely flat. Squround packaging affords some of the consumer appeal of traditional cylindrical packaging, while also packing tightly like brick- shaped square cartons. The container is usually made of paperboard but can have thermoformed or injection molded plastic components. There is usually a separate lid made of paperboard, plastic, or both. It offers several advantages over other ice cream packages: * It can be easily scooped out * it fits better in home freezers * it packs tightly into secondary packages for shipping * it makes more efficient use of retail shelf space * it has good brand recognition (over the round half-gallon) since the flatter front is a more legible \\"billboard\\" for each flavor The lid can have tamper-evident features. Although squrounds are available in traditional half-gallon sizes, there exists a trend toward marketing non-traditional 56-ounce, and recently even 48-ouce sized cartons. The downsizing in carton size has not seemed to negatively affect unit sales. Mayfield Dairy, which announced the switch to squround cartons in January 2003, told Food Engineering in April that they expect to sell the same number of 56 oz. units in 2003 as it sold 64 oz. cartons in 2002. Breyers, which in 2000 was an early adopter of the smaller package for its \\"Ice Cream Parlor\\" brands, uses the smaller package across all its ice cream flavors. In 2008, they changed to an even smaller 48 oz container.

A special 'Buck Bumble' rumble pack was packaged with the U.K. version.http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/065/065865p1.html IGN.com, News on Buck Bumble Exclusive Rumble Pak. Plot The year is 2010, and as the result of a previous spill at a chemical factory in London, England, the insects in the surrounding area have mutated. Several different types of these mutated insects gather together becoming the evil \\"Herd\\", who are bent on taking over the garden, and eventually the whole world. The game casts the player as a Buck Bumble, a volunteer bumblebee that gets implanted with cyborg technology. He is part of an organization known as \\"The Resistance\\", which is trying to stop the evil Herd Army. Buck's missions send him on multiple tasks, such as defending the resistance base, attacking Herd supply lines while traveling through sewers, and eventually fighting the Herd's mantis-like Queen. Gameplay Buck Bumble is a third-person shooter where the player controls a bee. Buck can be armed with up to eleven different weapons, including such realistic weapons as a stun gun, a laser, a rocket launcher, and a guided missile launcher. While the levels are height-restricted, Buck can fly around in nineteen missions, some requiring the placement of a bomb without bumping it into anything. The player or players in two player mode can also perform various aerial acrobatics, similar to a fighter plane, in fact it was originally programmed as a flight game before it \\"evolved into a flying bee\\".Nintendo Power, Volume 113, page 46. The player controls the bee with moves such as loops and banking to the sides. At the top of the screen the player is given a radar screen which can be used to locate enemies within the level, a damage metre, and the player's current weapon. One level can have multiple locations which the player can reach by passing through teleporters, or gates. There are several items the player can collect while in each level, such as weapons, nectar from flowers to regain energy, and even point bonuses. Several of the game's enemies such as beetles and wasps have special generators that release another enemy when the first enemy is destroyed, requiring the player to destroy the generator itself to defeat the enemies and clear the stage. Besides the enemies, the player can also be drowned if in water for more than a couple of seconds.Buck Bumble: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, by Stevie Case, Prima Publishing Inc., =Multiplayer= Buzz Ball, a soccer-esque game, is one of the multiplayer modes. Buck Bumble has two multiplayer modes. The first, Buck Battle, allows up to two players to engage in an airborne dog-fight on a preset map. The second is a football-style game called Buzz Ball. The goal is to hit a giant soccer ball into the opposing player's net. As in Buck Battle, the player has the ability to kill his or her opponent in the process. Players are able to use two weapons from the game; a simple zapper, which gently moves the ball along, and a rocket launcher, which sends the ball flying in a different direction. Development The game's companion \\"Buck Bumble Pack\\" made by Joy Tech. The game was built with the rumble feature in mind, allowing the player to feel the impact of getting hit, supposedly increasing the sense of realism. This feature of the game was capitalized on by the company Joy Tech, which made an official 'Buck Bumble Pack' which was sold with the game exclusively at Dixons and Currys,Buck Bumble Pack's packaging, sold with the game upon its release, exclusively through Dixons & Currys. however it was a third-party peripheral not licensed by Nintendo. The game's soundtrack was composed by Justin Scharvona and consists entirely of U.K. garage and house music which at the time of the game's release was largely popular in England. Reception While not heavily praised, and widely regarded as below contemporary N64 standards, Buck Bumble was met with generally positive reception from various gaming critics. Narayan Pattison of the Australian magazine N64 Gamer gave the game several compliments, comparing it to Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which was also partly developed by Argonaut Games, saying that it avoids Star Fox's \\"restricted preset paths that had to be followed.\\" They also compliment the game's designers for the added features, like the player being able to hover in the air, and drop down and walk across the ground, thus giving the player \\"the ability to try some new gameplay techniques that have never been used before.\\" He describes the game's main theme as being a \\"very catchy dance beat that even has clear vocals.\\" However, he was disappointed with the game's thick fog, repetitive textures, and that the save feature after each level, \\"makes the game too easy\\". Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Overall, Buck Bumble is most like a diamond in the rough. There are a few edges that need to be polished, but as a whole, it still shines.\\" Matt Casamassina of IGN called it \\"the epitome of 'first generation' Nintendo 64 products\\" and compared it to a lower-quality version of the bee level in Banjo-Kazooie. This is largely due to its heavy distance fog, low frame-rate, and low-resolution graphics. Casamassina also considered the single-player levels too short and too easy. However, he praised the flying controls, the design of the title character, and the addictiveness of the Buzz Ball multiplayer mode. Fabian Blache, III, of Dimension Publishing's Q64 magazine, compared the game's shooter style to the PlayStation game WarHawk. His first response to seeing the game was: \\"I was almost dreading having to labor through (what I perceived would be) inane gameplay at the hands of a childish premise.\\" Praising the game's sound and graphics, he excused the fog because the game was \\"set in England.\\" He finishes the review with \\"There aren't many games of this quality on the market today, and Argonaut should be proud to have this one as their own.\\" Another positive review came from Nintendojo. They stated that, while fog makes navigation difficult, \\"the graphics do not disappoint.\\" In terms of multiplayer, the \\"extremely difficult\\" Buzz Battle was considered much less enjoyable than Buzz Ball. The review summarized stating, \\"Buck Bumble is definitely worth playing. While it isn't perfect, it's a fun game, and that's what really counts.\\" GameSpot's Lauren Fielder gave the title a significantly lower review than most publishers and echoed the belief that it \\"missed the boat\\" of lower-quality first-generation N64 games. She criticized the flying and walking controls and deemed the multiplayer modes \\"seemingly quite literally thrown in.\\" She closed by saying \\"In spite of all the obvious flaws, Buck Bumble is not a terrible game. It's just not a good game, and the rewards do not make up for the dull, tugging experience it quickly becomes.\\" References Category:1998 video games Category:Action video games Category:Argonaut Games games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Fictional bees Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 2010 ","title":"Buck Bumble"},{"id":"2013353","text":"Nathaniel Isaacs (1808‚Äì1872) was an English adventurer who played a part in the history of Natal, South Africa. He wrote a book spread over two volumes (whose accuracy is now disputed) called Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa. This book subsequently became one of the principal sources quoted by writers of the history of Natal including Morris (The Washing of the Spears: The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation), Ritter (Shaka Zulu: The Rise of the Zulu Empire) and Bulpin (Natal and the Zulu Country).  Early life  Isaacs was born in Canterbury, England into a Jewish family. His father was a merchant and resident of Chatham and his mother was Lenie Solomon, daughter of Nathaniel Solomon of Margate and Phoebe Mitz who came from the Netherlands. After his father died in 1822, he joined his maternal uncle, Saul Solomon Sr., a merchant based on the island of St. Helena. His cousin, Saul Solomon Jr., was an influential liberal politician of the Cape Colony. In June 1825 he persuaded his uncle to allow him to accompany Lieutenant King, captain of the brig The Mary to South Africa in the capacity of the captain's \\"companion\\". After the brig had discharged its cargoes in Cape Town, King sailed for Port Natal to search for the adventurers Francis Farewell, an East India merchant, and Francis Fynn, a physician, from whom nothing had been heard for eighteen months.  Stranded in Natal  Leaving Cape Town on 26 August 1825, The Mary the party made several stops along the Southern African coast, anchoring off Port Natal on 1 October. On entry to the port, The Mary foundered when she struck a sandbank. On reaching shore, the party found Farewell's camp, but Farewell and his party were on a hunting expedition. Once Farewell returned, Isaacs accompanied King on a courtesy visit to Dingane, brother of the Zulu king Shaka. Once Shaka heard of King's arrival, King and his entire party were summoned to his kraal. He records his impressions of the Zulu people and their customs which are particularly interesting as they are an account of the Zulu people before they came under European influence. He lived in daily contact with the powerful King Shaka of the Zulus, at the time the Zulu Empire was at its peak influence in Southern Africa. He was treated on the whole with favour, having rank and honours conferred upon him, as well as a large tract of land. Most of what has been written about Shaka comes from the accounts of Henry Francis Fynn and Isaacs who learned to speak the Zulu language fluently. Lt Farewell, Fynn and Isaacs established the town of Port Natal, later renamed Durban, which became the second largest city in South Africa in modern times. In 1828 King Shaka made Isaacs \\"Induna Incoola\\", or Principal Chief of Natal, and granted him great areas of land. Reception of the Zooloos for Chaka from Isaacs' book Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa. Descriptive of the Zoolus, their manners, customs, with a sketch of Natal.  Subsequent career  Isaacs left Natal in 1831, when Shaka's successor Dingane had prepared to massacre the few whites living there; In 1844 Isaacs abandoned his claim on the land granted him by Shaka and settled in Sierra Leone where he built up a thriving business. However, in 1854 he was accused of slave-trading by the governor, Sir Arthur Kennedy. Isaacs got wind of his impending arrest and left for Liverpool where he was to spend the last years of his life. Kennedy was appointed Governor of New South Wales and took the papers relating to the slave-trading charges with him when returning to England before taking up his post in Australia. The papers were lost when the ship in which he was travelling, the Forerunner was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution. Isaacs died on 26 Jun 1872 in Egremont, on the opposite side of the Mersey from Liverpool and is buried in the Canterbury Jewish Cemetery.  Historians' commentary  In recent years many academics have questioned the accuracy of Isaac's writings. Dan Wylie, an academic at Rhodes University has asserted that Isaacs deliberately exaggerated the extent of Shaka's brutality to boost the sales of his and of Flynn's books. Other historians though were quick to challenge Wylie. Petros Sibani, a historian and tour guide of Zulu battlefields, said there was no doubting Shaka \\"was a cruel and ruthless man but they were cruel and ruthless times\\". Another historian, Stephen Gray, also questioned the accuracy of Isaacs' writings. In his commentary on the writings of Charles Rawden Maclean in The Nautical Magazine, he notes that Maclean made no mention of Isaacs at all. He also conjectures that it was Isaacs who gave Maclean the name \\"John Ross\\" because he could not remember Maclean's real name. Gray is scathing of Isaacs to the extent that when comparing the writings of the two men he wrote \\"The differences between Maclean's and Isaacs' accounts [of Shaka's brutality] are so glaring that one is forced to ask which of the two is plain lying.\\" Published works * *  References Further reading * Category:1808 births Category:1872 deaths Category:English emigrants to South Africa Category:English explorers Category:English Jews Category:English memoirists Category:English people of Dutch-Jewish descent Category:Explorers of Africa Category:History of KwaZulu- Natal Category:Jewish explorers Category:People from Canterbury Category:Settlers of South Africa Category:South African explorers ","title":"Nathaniel Isaacs"},{"id":"2013359","text":"KXNT (840 kHz) is an AM radio station licensed to North Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.

Klotski (from Polish klocki‚Äîwooden blocks) is a sliding block puzzle thought to have originated in the early 20th century. The name may refer to a specific layout of ten blocks, or in a more global sense to refer to a whole group of similar sliding-block puzzles where the aim is to move a specific block to some predefined location. Rules Like other sliding-block puzzles, several different-sized block pieces are placed inside a box, which is generally in 4√ó5 size. Among the blocks, there is a special one (usually the largest) which must be moved to a special area designated by the game board. The player is not allowed to remove blocks, and may only slide blocks horizontally and vertically. Common goals are to solve the puzzle with a minimum number of moves or in a minimum amount of time. Naming A screenshot of the \\"forget me not\\" level in the Windows Entertainment Pack version of the gameThe earliest known reference of the name Klotski originates from the computer version for Windows 3.1 by ZH Computing in 1991, which was also included in Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack. The sliding puzzle had already been trademarked and sold under different names for decades, including Psychoteaze Square Root, Intreeg, and Ego Buster. There was no known widely used name for the category of sliding puzzles described before Klotski appeared. History A significant precursor of the Klotzki puzzle is the 19th century 15-puzzle, where fifteen wooden squares had to be rearranged. The 15-puzzle enjoyed immense popularity in western countries during the late 19th century. Around this time, patents appeared for puzzles using differently shaped blocks. Henry Walton filed in 1893 for a sliding puzzle of identically- shaped rectangles, which according to Edward Hordern, is the first known sliding puzzle with rectangular blocks. Frank E. Moss filed in 1900 for a sliding puzzle of six squares and four rectangles, which is one of the first known occurrences of sliding puzzle with non-equal blocks. The layout of the Pennant Puzzle Lewis W. Hardy obtained copyright for a game named Pennant Puzzle in 1909, manufactured by OK Novelty Co., Chicago.Enlisted in Section 5.A.1 of (Available online at the Puzzle Museum) The aim of this puzzle is identical to Klotski, and only its default blocks and arrangement are different. Hardy also filed in 1907, which is about a sliding-block puzzle similar to Pennant Puzzle, but with a slightly different combination of blocks and a different goal‚Äînot must only the largest block be moved to a specific location, but all of the other blocks must achieve a specific configuration as well. The patent was granted in 1912. John Harold Fleming obtained patent for a puzzle in 1934 in England, with almost identical configuration as described in this page. The puzzle concerned has the same blocks and almost identical placement as forget-me-not, only that the unique horizontal 2√ó1 block is placed at the bottom instead of beneath the 2√ó2 block. The patent included a 79-step solution. It is said that the game was already known in Japan around the 10th year of the Sh≈çwa period, i.e. around 1935. The first account of occurrence of Klotski in China is in Shaanxi Province, where L√≠n D√© KuƒÅn of Northwestern Polytechnical University noted children in a village playing a version of Klotski made with pieces of paper in 1938. (translation: Tangram, Baguenaudier and Klotski) One of the earliest books about standard Klotski was written by the Chinese professor JiƒÅng Ch√°ng Yƒ´ng of Northwestern Polytechnical University in 1949Ôºåin his book ÁßëÂ≠¶Ê∂àÈÅ£. (translation: Science Pastime) This book has been republished as (translation: Scientific mindset training and pastime) It is still unknown which version of the puzzle is the original. There are many confusing and conflicting claims, and several countries claim to be the ultimate origin of this game. Solving The minimum number of moves for the original puzzle is 81, which is verified by computer to be the absolute minimum for the default starting layout, if you consider sliding a single piece to any reachable position to be a single move. The first published 81-step solution is by Martin Gardner, in the February 1964 issue of Scientific American. In the article he discussed the following puzzles (with Edward Hordern classification code in parentheses): Pennant Puzzle (C19), L'√Çne Rouge (C27d), Line Up the Quinties (C4), Ma's Puzzle (D1) and a form of Stotts' Baby Tiger Puzzle (F10). For earliest published solutions (not optimal solution), currently known is from Chinese educator X«î Ch√∫n F«éng, in his book Êï∏Â≠∏Êº´Ë´á. (translation: Mathematics Tidbits; KƒÅi M√≠n…° Sh≈´ Di√†n, March 1952) His solution involves 100 steps. Variation There are several variations of this game, some with names specific to the culture of certain countries, some with different arrangement of blocks. It is still unknown whether these variations affected each other and how. =Other names= The following variations basically have the same layout and block arrangement, varying only in name (human, animal, or others), usually with some sort of story behind the names. It is completely unknown whether they share the same origin, though this is highly possible as they are identical to each other. Huarong Dao The Chinese wooden game Huarong Dao(ËèØÂÆπÈÅì), thought to date from the 1930s, follows the same pattern as Klotski. Huarong Dao (alternatively named Huarong Path or Huarong Trail, Chinese name: ËèØÂÆπÈÅì) is the Chinese variation, based on a fictitious story in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms about the warlord Cao Cao retreating through Huarong Trail (in present-day Jianli County, Jingzhou, Hubei) after his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208/209 CE during the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He encountered an enemy general, Guan Yu, who was guarding the path and waiting for him. Guan Yu spared Cao Cao and allowed the latter to pass through Huarong Trail on account of the generous treatment he received from Cao in the past. The largest block in the game is named \\"Cao Cao\\". Daughter in the box A Daughter in the Box ÔºàÁÆ±ÂÖ•„ÇäÂ®òÔºâ board The Daughter in the Box (Japanese name: hakoiri musume ÁÆ±ÂÖ•„ÇäÂ®ò) wood puzzle depicts an \\"innocent young girl, who knows nothing of the world\\" trapped in a building. The largest piece is named \\"daughter\\", and other blocks are given names of other family members (like father, mother and so on). Another Japanese variation uses the names of shogi pieces. L'√¢ne rouge In France it is well known as L'√¢ne rouge. It features a red donkey (the largest piece) trying to escape a maze of fences and pens to get to its carrots. However, there is no known and documented record of its first existence in France. Khun Chang Khun Phaen This is a variation from Thailand. Khun Phaen is a famous character in Thai legend, and the game is named after the epic poem Khun Chang Khun Phaen, in which the character is imprisoned. The game depicts Khun Phaen breaking out of the prison by overcoming its nine sentries. There is a slight difference between Khun Chang Khun Phaen and the standard layout ‚Äì the two middle 1√ó1 blocks are moved to bottom. Other than that, all other blocks are the same. The origin of this variation is unknown. =Other block arrangements= In this context, the \\"basic\\" arrangement is assumed to be a 4√ó5 area laid out as follows:- * In the left-hand column, two 1√ó2 blocks with a 1√ó1 block beneath. * In the right-hand column, two 1√ó2 blocks with a 1√ó1 block beneath. * In the middle two columns, a 2√ó2 block at the top, with a horizontal 2√ó1 block beneath it, two 1√ó1 blocks beneath that, leaving a 2√ó1 empty space at the bottom. This is used globally as the \\"basic\\" game of Klotski. It is coded C27d in Hordern classification of sliding puzzle games. Pennant Puzzle Coded as C19 in Hordern classification, it is first copyrighted in 1909 by Lewis. W. Hardy in United States. Standard Trailer Co. has it copyrighted under the name Dad's Puzzler in 1926 (also in US). Its arrangement is different: # The default location of all blocks are different from Klotski.

The film is written by the creators of MADtv, Fax Bahr and Adam Small, who also serve as producers. The character of \\"B-Rad\\" (a spoof of Eminem's character \\"B-Rabbit\\" in the film 8 Mile) originally appeared in Jamie Kennedy's hidden-camera show The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, but started in his stand-up routine when he was starting out. Plot The film centers on the family life of Bill Gluckman (Ryan O'Neal), a wealthy Jewish senator from Malibu, California who is running for the office of Governor of California. His son Brad (Jamie Kennedy) is a wannabe \\"Eminem\\", preferring to go by the nickname \\"B-Rad\\" despite leading a rich, sheltered life. As a result, members of Mr. Gluckman's political campaign become concerned that Brad's idiotic, outlandish behavior will ruin his father's chances at being elected. The campaign team members hire two actors, Sean (Taye Diggs), and PJ (Anthony Anderson), who don't know any more about inner-city life than B-Rad, to act as gang members. They kidnap him, and take him to South Central Los Angeles, where PJ's cousin Shondra (Regina Hall) lives, and they hope B-Rad will be \\"scared white\\" after witnessing what inner city life is really like. The trio engages in mildly dangerous activities such as petty theft in order to convince B-Rad that he should return home. The three involuntary become mixed up in a shootout between rival gangs, in which the leader of one of the gangs, Tec (Damien Dante Wayans), becomes impressed at intimidation tactics portrayed by B-Rad as a result of playing Grand Theft Auto. In the meantime, B-Rad develops feelings for Shondra, who at first is unimpressed and annoyed, but slowly begins to enjoy B-Rad's company. B-Rad comes to find out that the entire excursion to head to South Central was a ploy in order for him to be scared of his current mannerisms. His recklessness leads to the trio becoming actually kidnapped by Tec and his crew, unbeknownst to B-Rad, who just assumes this is part of the act. When Bill Gluckman realizes that his son is in actual danger, he rushes over, and uses his trademark negotiating skills in order to ease the situation. In doing so, he realizes that he should just accept B-Rad for who he is, and decides that he will support his son unconditionally. The two reconcile, and when the family returns to Malibu, the film closes with Bill and B-Rad celebrating a Gluckman win in the Senate race.

It has a 31% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the general consensus being \\"There are some laughs, but not enough to sustain the running time.\\" Cultural Themes The overarching themes that are discussed in Malibu's Most Wanted are both the exploitation of one culture by another, as well as the pressure to act within the norms of a given culture. Not only are these themes explored explicitly by the actions of B-Rad, but also by Sean and PJ. There is an expectation of how black people are portrayed in Hollywood that is explored in depth in the manner in which Sean and PJ practice acting \\"gangsta\\" in order to prove their blackness. In an interview conducted by Brian Balchack from Movieweb.com, Taye Diggs notes that \\"the interesting thing, being an African-American actor, is that we're constantly challenged with the duality of acting stereotypically ‚Äúblack,‚Äù and just acting. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck don't have to read for a role and ask themselves, ‚ÄòOkay, do they want me to say this word like this, or can I just be myself?' I know tons of black actors that didn't grow up in the ‚Äòhood, and don't have their ‚Äúgangster lingo‚Äù down, who take it to another level when they go in for a gangster role. I think that that's very interesting.\\" in regards to his acting in the film.

It is approximately 370 km away from Cairo. The roughly oval valley extends from northeast to southwest, has a length of 94 km, a maximum width of 42 km and covers an area of about 2000 km¬≤. The valley is surrounded by mountains and has numerous springs. Located in Giza Governorate, the main economic sectors are agriculture, iron ore mining, and tourism. The main agricultural products are guavas, mangos, dates, and olives. Settlement Bahariya consists of many villages, of which El Bawiti is the largest and the administrative center. Qasr is el-Bawiti's neighboring/twin village. To the east, about ten kilometers away are the villages of Mandishah and el-Zabu. A smaller village called el-'Aguz lies between El Bawiti and Mandishah. Harrah, the easternmost village, is a few kilometers east of Mandishah and el-Zabu. El Hayz, also called El-Hayez, is the southernmost village, but it may not always be considered as part of Bahariya because it is so far from the rest of the villages, about fifty kilometers south of El Bawiti. There is an oasis at El- Hayez where mummies have been found on which genetic studies have been conducted. People and culture The people of the oasis, or the Wa·∏•ƒÅtƒ´ people (meaning \\"of the oasis\\" in Arabic), are the descendants of the ancient people who inhabited the oasis, Bedouin tribes from Libya and the north coast, and other people from the Nile Valley who came to settle in the oasis. The majority of Wa·∏•ƒÅtƒ´ people in Bahariya are Muslims. There are some mosques in Bahariya. The nature of social settings in the oasis is highly influenced by Islam. Also, traditional music is very important to the Wa·∏•ƒÅtƒ´ people. Flutes, drums, and the simsimeyya (a harp-like instrument) are played at social gatherings, particularly at weddings. Traditional songs sung in rural style are passed down from generation to generation, and new songs are invented as well. Music from Cairo, the greater Middle East, and other parts of the world are now easily accessible to the people of the oasis. Names In Ancient Egypt the depression was known under two names. The form Djesdjes is first mentioned on a scarab dating back to the Middle Kingdom. In the New Kingdom, however, this name is rarely found, but does appear for example in the Temple of Luxor or in the account of King Kamose, who occupied the oasis during the war against the Hyksos. From the 25th Dynasty it was almost the only name used. The other name W·∏•3.t m·∏•ty.t (\\"the Northern Oasis\\") was almost exclusively used in the New Kingdom, it appears for instance on the local grave of Amenhotep, and is found again in the list of oasis in the Temple at Edfu. From 45 CE the depression is known in Latin as Oasis parva (Small Oasis). The Greek historian Strabo (63 BCE ‚Äì 23 CE) calls it the ‚ÄòSecond Oasis‚Äô; the historian Olympiodorus of Thebes (5th century CE: Byzantine Era) calls it ‚Äòthe Third Oasis. In Coptic times it was known as the Oasis of Bemdje (the ancient Oxyrhynchos, nowadays known as al-Bahnasa) and in Islamic times it was called the Oasis of Bahnasa. The modern name is , al-WƒÅ·∏•ƒÅt al-Ba·∏•riyya meaning \\"the Northern Oasis‚Äù. The southern part of the depression around El Heiz apparently never had a separate name. Agriculture Agriculture is still an important source of income, though now the iron ore industry close to Bahariya provides jobs for many Wahati people. Recently there has also been an increase in tourism to the oasis because of antiquities (tombs, mummies and other artifacts have been discovered there), and because of the beautiful surrounding deserts. Wahati and foreign guides lead adventure desert tours based out of Bahariya to the surrounding White and Black deserts, and sometimes to Siwa or the southern oases. Tourism is a new and important source of income for locals, and it has brought an international presence to the oasis. History Map sheet showing Bahariya Oasis The depression was populated since the neolithic, even if there is no archaeological evidence to all times. In el-Haiz, a prehistoric settlement site of hunter-gatherers was found with remains of grindstones, arrowheads, scrapers, chisels, and ostrich eggshells. In QƒÅrat el-Abya·∏ç, a Czech team led by Miroslav B√°rta discovered a settlement of the Old Kingdom.Nevine El-Aref: The tale of a city, report of the Al-Ahram Weekly of August 9, 2007.

In the 26th dynasty, the depression was culturally and economically flourishing.

Approximately thirty-four tombs have been excavated from this area.Zahi Hawass, The Valley of the Golden Mummies, New York 2000.

In the spring of 2010, a Roman-era mummy was unearthed in a Bahariya Oasis cemetery in el-Harrah. The 3-foot-tall female mummy was found covered with plaster decorated to resemble Roman dress and jewelry. In addition to the female mummy, archaeologists found clay and glass vessels, coins, anthropoid masks and 14 Greco-Roman tombs. Director of Cairo and Giza Antiquities Mahmoud Affifi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said the tomb has a unique design with stairways and corridors, and could date to 300 BC. This find came as a result of excavation work for the construction of a youth center.Nevine El-Aref: In the sands of time, report of Al-Ahram Weekly of April 29, 2010. Carcharodontosaurus and Bahariasaurus (meaning \\"Bahariya lizard\\") dinosaurs have been found in the Bahariya Formation, which date to about 95 million years ago. It was a huge theropod, it was described by Ernst Stromer in 1934,Stromer, E.: Ergebnisse der Forschungsreisen Prof. E. Stromers in den W√ºsten √Ñgyptens : II. Wirbeltierreste der Bahar√Æje-Stufe (unterstes Cenoman). 13.

In 2000, an American scientific team conducted by Joshua Smith found the remains of this type of dinosaur, the Paralititan stromeri.Smith, Joshua et al.: A Giant sauropod dinosaur from an Upper Cretaceous mangrove deposit in Egypt, in: Science, vol. 292,5522 (2001), pp. 1704‚Äì1706. However, the region between the Bahariya and Farafra depressions used to have volcanic activity during the Jurassic Period. In addition, the landscape contains some hills made of barite or calcite crystals, and also golden limestone boulders which became a sanctuary for species, such as white foxes, gazelles and rams. Modernity During the World War I the Baharia Military Railway was built to provide access to the oasis. The oasis has changed drastically in the past 30 years after an asphalt road connecting Bahariya to Cairo was finished in the early 70s. With the new road came electricity, cars, television, phone lines, a more accessible route to Cairo, and, latterly, Internet. The spread of people and ideas between Bahariya and Cairo has increased dramatically since the road was constructed. Also, the language of the Wa·∏•ƒÅtƒ´ people has been changed and influenced in new ways as the Cairene dialect is heard on television and in music.Bliss, Frank: Oasenleben : die √§gyptischen Oasen Bahriya und Farafra in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart, Bonn: Politischer Arbeitskreis Schulen (PAS), 2006, (Beitr√§ge zur Kulturkunde; 23), .

Kharga Oasis: its topography and geology. Survey Department, Public Works Ministry, Geological Survey Report 1899, Part II. Cairo: National Printing Department, 116 pp. The oasis, which was known as the 'Southern Oasis' to the Ancient Egyptians and Oasis Magna to the Romans, is the largest of the oases in the Libyan desert of Egypt. It is in a depression about 160 km (100 miles) long and from 20 km (12 miles) to 80 km (50 miles) wide.Introduction to Kharga Oasis Its population is 67,700 (2012). Overview Kharga is the most modernised of Egypt's western oases. The main town is highly functional with all modern facilities, and virtually nothing left of old architecture. Although framed by the oasis, there is no oasis feeling to it; unlike all other oases in this part of Egypt. There is extensive thorn palm, acacia, buffalo thorn and jujube growth in the oasis surrounding the modern town of Kharga. Many remnant wildlife species inhabit this region. Climate The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Kharga Oasis experiences extreme summers for most of the year with no precipitation and warm winters with cool nights. Darb El Arba'ƒ´n caravan route Map sheet showing Kharga Oasis. A trade route called (\\"the Way of Forty\\") passed through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north. It was a long caravan route running north‚Äìsouth between Middle Egypt and the Sudan. It was used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants. The maximum extent of Darb El Arba'ƒ´n was northward from Kobbei in Darfur, 25 miles north of al-Fashir, passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending in Egypt.Site of the Kharga Oasis in Egypt (lower centre). All the oases have always been crossroads of caravan routes converging from the barren desert. In the case of Kharga, this is made particularly evident by the presence of a chain of fortresses that the Romans built to protect the Darb El Arba'ƒ´n route. The forts vary in size and function, some being just small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation. Some were installed where earlier settlements already existed, while others were probably started from scratch. All of them are made of mud bricks, but some also contain small stone temples with inscriptions on the walls. Described by Herodotus as a road \\"traversed ... in forty days,\\" by his time the route had already become an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. The length of the journey is the reason for it being called Darb El Arba\`ƒ´n, the implication being \\"the forty-day road\\". After the prominent Christian theologian Nestorius was condemned as a heretic in the 431 Council of Ephesus, he was removed from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople and exiled to a monastery then located in the Great Oasis of Hibis (El Kharga). There he lived for the rest of his life. The monastery suffered attacks by desert bandits, and Nestorius was injured in one such raid. Nestorius seems to have survived there until at least 450 and there had composed the Bazaar of Heracleides‚Äîthe only one of writings to survive in full, and of importance to the Christian Nestorians who follow his teachings. As part of a caravan proceeding to Dafur, the English explorer W.G. Browne paused for several days at Kharga, leaving with the rest of the group 7 June 1793. At the time a gindi was stationed at Kharga, \\"belonging to Ibrahim Bey El Kebir, to whom those villages appertain; and to [this official] is entrusted the management of what relates to the caravan during the time of its stay there.\\" In 1930 the archaeologist, Gertrude Caton‚ÄìThompson, uncovered the palaeolithic history of Kharga. Temple of HibisDemographics In his diary, ‚ÄúAl-Hajj Al-Bari‚Äù mentioned the most important families descending of Christians and Romans in the Kharga Oasis. They are the families of ‚ÄúAl-Jawiya, the families of Al-Tawayh, the Al- Bahramah family, the Al-Sanadiyah family, the Al-Azayza family, the Al- Badayrah family, the Al-Mahbasiya family, the Al-Hosnieh family, and the Al- Na‚Äôimah family And the Al-Sharayra family, and there are Nubian families in the village of Baris. There are few Berber families too who are thought to be the indigenous people of Kharga but the majority today are Arab families. Perhaps the most important of these Arab families that came to the Khargha Oasis from the beginning of the year 300 AH are the families of the Idris from Tunisia or Libya, the family of Rekabia and the family of the jewehera from the Hijaz and the family of shakawera and the family of Al-Radawana and the family from the Arabs of Mecca and the family of Al-Shawami from the Levant and there are families from the countries of the Egyptian country such as Dabatiya and Asawiya from Assiut Or Sohag and the Awlad-el-sheikh from Egypt ‚ÄúIt is more likely to mean Cairo‚Äù, the family of Njarin from Qalamoun in Dakhla, the family of Al Shaabna from Mallawi, the family of Al-Awamir from Al-Amayem tribe and the family of Al-Alawneh from Al-Alawiya in addition to Turkish families such as Al-Dabashiya, Al-Tarakah Al-Kharja and the Bash families The Qaqamqam, Askari, Tannabur, Qitas, and Kashif.

It is located at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport in Clearwater, Florida and is home to nearly 700 USCG aviation and support personnel. As of June 2019, there were ten MH-60T Jayhawk helicopters, one HC-130H Hercules (the Coast Guard's oldest operational HC-130) and three HC-130H7 Hercules aircraft assigned to CGAS Clearwater. Also on static display is USCG 1023, a restored Grumman HU-16 Albatross. Air Station Clearwater also operates two aviation facilities in The Bahamas, one at Great Inagua and one at the United States Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) installation at Andros Island. These facilities support continually deployed HH-60Js and MH-60Ts from various air stations for Operations Bahamas, Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a joint U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Coast Guard counter-narcotics (CN) and migrant smuggling interdiction operation. History A Coast Guard HC-130J In 1934, an air station was commissioned on the west coast of Florida at Albert Whitted Airport in downtown St. Petersburg. Designated as Coast Guard Air Station St. Petersburg, it subsequently became a home base for various Coast Guard amphibious aircraft and helicopters. In 1976, the addition of four land-based HC-130 Hercules aircraft prompted the move to, and construction of, new facilities at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport. With this move, the air station's name was changed to U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater. CGAS Clearwater has a rich history, and its operations have been at the heart of significant events in Florida and the Caribbean for many years. In the early 1980s, its high operations tempo earned Clearwater two Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendations, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Unit Commendation. It was during this time that the Air Station provided crucial support to the surface fleet during the Cuban boat lift. Shortly thereafter Clearwater answered the call to duty during Operation Urgent Fury‚Äîthe Grenada rescue mission, and was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for its support of the invasion as well as the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for its continual support efforts. Later that same year another Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation was awarded to the Air Station for its role in Operation Wagon Wheel, an international drug interdiction effort. In 1986, following on the success of the previous operation, Clearwater conducted Operation Hunter. This drug interdiction effort planted the seeds for what is today's OPBAT (Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos). Perhaps the single most noteworthy mission for the Air Station also came in 1986, during the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Air Station Clearwater crews responded immediately, the initial crew arriving on scene so quickly it had to stand off while the debris from the explosion continued to fall from the sky. In all, Air Station Clearwater flew 33 sorties on the Challenger mission and was awarded a Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational device. CGAS Clearwater became the Coast Guard's largest air station in 1987 with the expansion of the drug interdiction mission, \\"Operations Bahamas, Turks, and Caicos\\" or OPBAT. This large ongoing mission resulted in the assignment of 12 HH-60J Jayhawk helicopters, the newest in the Coast Guard fleet, and boosted personnel strength to its current level of over 500 men and women. Also during this period, three additional HC-130s were stationed at Air Station Clearwater to support the increased law enforcement efforts. The air station's motto of \\"Anytime, Anywhere\\" accurately describes its pace of operations. The 1990s were no less dramatic for the men and women of CGAS Clearwater. In 1991, the station's HC-130s responded rapidly to fly personnel and supplies in and out of the combat theater in support of Operation Desert Storm. During the Haitian uprising in 1992, CGAS Clearwater crews evacuated American embassy personnel and transported U.S. Special Forces into Haiti. When south Florida and Louisiana were devastated by Hurricane Andrew, CGAS Clearwater crews flew missions round the clock, transporting hundreds of tons of badly needed supplies. In March 1993, the \\"Storm of the Century\\" struck Florida leaving numerous sunken vessels in its wake. Air Station Clearwater crews launched at the height of the storm and pulled 62 people from the water in what was the busiest search and rescue day in the air station's history. In the summer of 1994 air crews participated in a massive SAR effort which located and rescued 34,568 Cubans and 23,389 Haitian migrants from the waters of the Caribbean. In 1997, the U.S. renewed its effort towards the War on Drugs, and Clearwater responded as part of Operations Frontier Shield, Gulf Shield, and Frontier Lance. Those operations were aimed at stemming the flow of illegal drugs and migrants and spanned from the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean to the southern coastline of Texas. The Coast Guard set new records for both drug seizures and arrests. * Winner of the National Defense Transportation Award for 2000. * Winner of Excellence in Food Services Award for 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2007. In 2005, Air Station Clearwater crews helped support the survivors of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. In 2006, the United States Navy Reserve vacated the former Navy Operational Support Center St. Petersburg/Clearwater (formerly Naval Reserve Center St. Petersburg/Clearwater) adjacent to the air station, transferring the facility to the Coast Guard and placing it under the oversight of Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater. Current aircraft The HC-130 first became a part of Air Station Clearwater in 1976. The Lockheed HC-130H model is the current version assigned, with 5 such aircraft in the air station's current inventory. HC-130s from Air Station Clearwater have deployed worldwide including most of the contiguous 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii, throughout the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The HC-130 Hercules performs numerous missions in support of Search and Rescue, Law Enforcement, Marine Environmental Protection, and logistics. The aircraft is an ideal platform for long range Search and Rescue, with over 14 hours of airborne endurance and large scanner windows built into the airframe side. The 9 Sikorsky HH-60J Jayhawk helicopters previously assigned to the air station have since been replaced by 13 upgraded MH-60T Jayhawk versions. This aircraft has a long-range capability of 600 nautical miles (1100 km) to support Coast Guard cutters on Law Enforcement patrols, deliver dewatering pumps to sinking vessels, evacuate injured crew members from vessels far at sea, and many other missions. Air Station Clearwater helicopter aircrews fly an average of over 400 Search and Rescue cases each year along both the east and west coasts of Florida, the Bahamas, and beyond.

Introduction The character debuted on June 6, 2000, when the Angels were trailing the San Francisco Giants 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth inning. Two video board operators, Dean Fraulino and Jaysen Humes, took a clip of a monkey jumping around from the 1994 Jim Carrey movie comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and superimposed the words \\"RALLY MONKEY!\\" on top of it. The Angels scored two runs and won the game. Growing popularity The video clip proved to be so popular that the team hired Katie, a white-haired capuchin monkey who previously appeared as Marcel in the television sitcom Friends, to star in original clips for later games. When seen, she bounces to the House of Pain song \\"Jump Around\\" and sometimes holds a sign proclaiming that it is \\"RALLY TIME!\\" The rally monkey came to national and world-wide attention during the Angels' appearance in the 2002 World Series, again against the San Francisco Giants. In the sixth game, the Angels were playing at home, but were trailing the series 3-2 and facing elimination. They were down 5-0 as the game entered the bottom of the seventh inning. Amid fervid rally-monkey themed fan support, the Angels proceeded to score six unanswered runs over the next two innings, winning the game and turning the momentum of the series for good (they went on to clinch the championship in game 7). In 2009, the Angels once again reached the post-season, sparking a renewal of the rally monkey's popularity. Cultural references Additional videos featuring the Rally Monkey show her edited into popular films and TV shows such as The Brady Bunch Movie, Jurassic Park, Field of Dreams, Star Trek, Risky Business, WarGames, and Animal House. The Angels started selling plush monkeys that fans bring to games. ESPN did a SportsCenter commercial in which it showed one of the executives having to make \\"budget cuts,\\" leading to the release of the monkey. The monkey pleaded by raising the \\"It's Rally Time\\" sign. In one installment of the popular comic strip Get Fuzzy, the strip's protagonist, Bucky Katt, attempts to travel to Anaheim to eat the Rally Monkey after seeing it on television, as part of a running gag focused on Bucky's irrational desire to eat a monkey.

The institution of the Garrison schools was introduced by the ukase (decree) of Tsar Peter the Great in 1721 primarily for the children of military recruits in the course of Peter's reform of the Russian military. This so-called military revolution transformed the military from an archaic militia-like force to the regular army, which drew upon military recruits called, predominantly from enserfed peasantry, to serve for 25 years, which, given the expected life span of most Russian serfs at the time, essentially meant that they would serve for life. The recruits and their children born after the recruitment were liberated from the serf status and a network of Garrison schools was created for the children's education. The boys, starting from the age of 7, were taught literacy, elementary math, \\"artillery and military engineering\\", but also fine arts and several trade professions, such as shoe- making, sewing, wood- and metal-working, etc. Initially 49 schools were founded, each for 50 boys aged 7 to 15. Upon completion of elementary study course, the boys' education was specialized as follows: 10 boys studied artillery and fortification, 20 studied music (drums and singing), 10 studied trade professions and 10 studied clerical work and writing, scrivenery (–ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ).

The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine, the Ictineo I, a role for which they continue to be used today. Also a term to refer to the army of volunteers making scrubs for the NHS during the covid-19 crisis Snorkel A steam-powered submarine: the Ict√≠neo. Low-tech Magazine, 24 de ghanta de 2008 Traditionally, the term \\"scrubber\\" has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to \\"wash out\\" acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.On Flue gas Condensation by G√∂taverken Milj√∂ AB They are also used for the high flows in solar, PV, or LED processes.Recommended point of use gas scrubber for solar processes. There are several methods to remove toxic or corrosive compounds from exhaust gas and neutralize it.  Combustion  Combustion is sometimes the cause of harmful exhausts, but, in many cases, combustion may also be used for exhaust gas cleaning if the temperature is high enough and enough oxygen is available.  Wet scrubbing  The exhaust gases of combustion may contain substances considered harmful to the environment, and the scrubber may remove or neutralize those. A wet scrubber is used for cleaning air, fuel gas or other gases of various pollutants and dust particles. Wet scrubbing works via the contact of target compounds or particulate matter with the scrubbing solution. Solutions may simply be water (for dust) or solutions of reagents that specifically target certain compounds. Process exhaust gas can also contain water-soluble toxic and/or corrosive gases like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or ammonia (NH3). These can be removed very well by a wet scrubber. Removal efficiency of pollutants is improved by increasing residence time in the scrubber or by the increase of surface area of the scrubber solution by the use of a spray nozzle, packed towers or an aspirator. Wet scrubbers may increase the proportion of water in the gas, resulting in a visible stack plume, if the gas is sent to a stack. Wet scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation. In this mode, termed a condensing scrubber, water from the scrubber drain is circulated through a cooler to the nozzles at the top of the scrubber. The hot gas enters the scrubber at the bottom. If the gas temperature is above the water dew point, it is initially cooled by evaporation of water drops. Further cooling cause water vapors to condense, adding to the amount of circulating water. The condensation of water releases significant amounts of low temperature heat due to the high value of the specific latent heat of the vaporisation of water (more than per ton of water), that can be recovered by the cooler for e.g. district heating purposes. Excess condensed water must continuously be removed from the circulating water.  Dry scrubbing  A dry or semi-dry scrubbing system, unlike the wet scrubber, does not saturate the flue gas stream that is being treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally do not have a stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources. There are a number of dry type scrubbing system designs. However, all consist of two main sections or devices: a device to introduce the acid gas sorbent material into the gas stream and a particulate matter control device to remove reaction products, excess sorbent material as well as any particulate matter already in the flue gas. Dry scrubbing systems can be categorized as dry sorbent injectors (DSIs) or as spray dryer absorbers (SDAs). Spray dryer absorbers are also called semi-dry scrubbers or spray dryers. Dry scrubbing systems are often used for the removal of odorous and corrosive gases from wastewater treatment plant operations. The medium used is typically an activated alumina compound impregnated with materials to handle specific gases such as hydrogen sulfide. Media used can be mixed together to offer a wide range of removal for other odorous compounds such as methyl mercaptans, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. Dry sorbent injection involves the addition of an alkaline material (usually hydrated lime, soda ash, or sodium bicarbonate) into the gas stream to react with the acid gases. The sorbent can be injected directly into several different locations: the combustion process, the flue gas duct (ahead of the particulate control device), or an open reaction chamber (if one exists). The acid gases react with the alkaline sorbents to form solid salts which are removed in the particulate control device. These simple systems can achieve only limited acid gas (SO2 and HCl) removal efficiencies. Higher collection efficiencies can be achieved by increasing the flue gas humidity (i.e., cooling using water spray). These devices have been used on medical waste incinerators and a few municipal waste combustors. In spray dryer absorbers, the flue gases are introduced into an absorbing tower (dryer) where the gases are contacted with a finely atomized alkaline slurry. Acid gases are absorbed by the slurry mixture and react to form solid salts which are removed by the particulate control device. The heat of the flue gas is used to evaporate all the water droplets, leaving a non-saturated flue gas to exit the absorber tower. Spray dryers are capable of achieving high (80+%) acid gas removal efficiencies. These devices have been used on industrial and utility boilers and municipal waste incinerators.  Adsorber  Many chemicals can be removed from exhaust gas also by using adsorber material. The flue gas is passed through a cartridge which is filled with one or several adsorber materials and has been adapted to the chemical properties of the components to be removed. This type of scrubber is sometimes also called dry scrubber. The adsorber material has to be replaced after its surface is saturated. Note: adsorption is a surface phenomena, absorption involves the entire material. Ex: Activated carbon an adsorbent, used for the adsorption of odorous compounds.  Mercury removal  Mercury is a highly toxic element commonly found in coal and municipal waste. Wet scrubbers are only effective for removal of soluble mercury species, such as oxidized mercury, Hg2+. Mercury vapor in its elemental form, Hg0, is insoluble in the scrubber slurry and not removed. Therefore, an additional process of Hg0 conversion is required to complete mercury capture. Usually halogens are added to the flue gas for this purpose. The type of coal burned as well as the presence of a selective catalytic reduction unit both affect the ratio of elemental to oxidized mercury in the flue gas and thus the degree to which the mercury is removed. In July 2015, one study found that some mercury scrubbers installed on coal power plants inadvertently capture PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) emissions as well.  Scrubber waste products  One side effect of scrubbing is that the process only moves the unwanted substance from the exhaust gases into a liquid solution, solid paste or powder form. This must be disposed of safely, if it can not be reused. For example, mercury removal results in a waste product that either needs further processing to extract the raw mercury, or must be buried in a special hazardous wastes landfill that prevents the mercury from seeping out into the environment. As an example of reuse, limestone-based scrubbers in coal-fired power plants can produce a synthetic gypsum of sufficient quality that can be used to manufacture drywall and other industrial products.How Sulfuric (SO2) waste is chemically removed from emissions at General Chemistry Online  Bacteria spread  Poorly maintained scrubbers have the potential to spread disease-causing bacteria. The problem is a result of inadequate cleaning. For example, the cause of a 2005 outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Norway was just a few infected scrubbers. The outbreak caused 10 deaths and more than 50 cases of infection.Update: Outbreak of legionnaires‚Äô disease in Norway traced to air scrubber  Scrubbers on ships  Scrubbers were first used onboard ships for the production of Inert Gas for oil tanker operations. Later, in preparation for the global 0.5% sulfur cap in 2020, The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted guidelines on the approval, installation and use of exhaust gas scrubbers (exhaust gas cleaning systems) onboard ships to ensure compliance with the sulphur regulation of MARPOL Annex VI. http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/AirPollution/Pages/Index- of-MEPC-Resolutions-and-Guidelines-related-to-MARPOL-Annex-VI.aspx Flag States must approve such systems and port States can (as part of their port state control) ensure that such systems are functioning correctly. If a scrubber system is not functioning properly (and the IMO procedures for such malfunctions are not adhered to), port States can sanction the ship. The United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea also bestows port States with a right to regulate (and even ban) the use of open loop scrubber systems within ports and internal waters.Jesper Jarl Fan√∏ (2019).

WLKO broadcasts in the HD Radio format, licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission as a digital (hybrid) station.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=68211 History The station's history in Charlotte began on September 1, 1987, with a signal boost and a move from Hickory, North Carolina (where it was WHKY-FM). Prior to the move, \\"Y-102.9\\" had played Top 40 with a heavy emphasis on album-oriented rock, a format that made people notice at a time when rock radio was in decline. Before that, WHKY-FM had aired Christian programming since 1959. WRLX, also known as \\"Relax 102.9\\", aired a beautiful music format.Jeff Borden, \\"Relax: Beautiful Music Is Back,\\" The Charlotte Observer, June 29, 1987. WRLX promoted itself with images of a pair of retirement-age punk rockers, intended to humorously illustrate how the competition apparently viewed the station's target audience. In March 1989, the station changed its call letters to WEZC (after the 104.7 frequency gave up those letters)Jeff Borden, \\"WBCY Lands Morning Deejay, \\" The Charlotte Observer, March 25, 1989, p. 23A. and its name to \\"EZ 102.9\\", gradually adding more vocals during the summer to make the transition from beautiful music to MOR. Some of the early announcers include Bob Brandon, Jim Davenport, Catherine Lane, Jon Robinson and Todd Edwards. In 1993, the name changed again to \\"Lite 102.9\\" as the station moved from Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond and Barry Manilow to soft adult contemporary (Phil Collins, Elton John and Billy Joel), and the call letters switched to WLYT in 1995.Mark Washburn, \\"Olympic anchor dreading London drenching,\\" The Charlotte Observer, July 21, 2012. Over the years, as the definition of soft adult contemporary changed, WLYT evolved. The station played pop and lite rock music from the 1970s to present, with an occasional 1960s song. Delilah After Dark aired in the evenings. WLYT featured a \\"70's Flashback Weekend\\" every weekend since late 2004 through 2005, but discontinued this tradition after the slogan changed from \\"Continuous Lite Favorites\\" to \\"The Best Variety of Yesterday and Today\\". The station played Christmas music annually, with 'preview weekends' from early November through Thanksgiving, then a 24-hour Christmas format from Thanksgiving through Christmas Day. WLYT's main competitor was CBS Radio's WKQC. WLYT had changed its slogan from The Best Variety of Yesterday and Today to The Bright New Sound of Lite 102.9 in 2011. In late January 2008, WLYT changed its morning show to more closely resemble the Today show on NBC, with more talk geared toward women 25 to 54. During the first hour, the talk was more hard news, becoming lighter as the morning show progressed and adding more music during work hours.Mark Washburn, \\"Morning hosts will double up with afternoon gig,\\" The Charlotte Observer, Jan. 26, 2008. The program schedule was altered as well. The show was discontinued in early 2010 with morning hosts Jim Shafer (who had moved to the station from WWMG in 2004) and Jen Byrum (morning host since 1999) being released. On April 13, 2010, Valentine in the Morning, a syndicated show from sister KBIG-FM in Los Angeles, made its debut. A local host was planned for local segments of the show.Mark Washburn, \\"Jen Byrum and Jim Shafer ponder life without WLYT-FM,\\" The Charlotte Observer, April 10, 2010. On July 2, 2012, at midnight, WLYT changed its format to adult hits, branded as \\"102.9 The Lake\\". The final song on \\"Lite\\" was \\"Far Away\\" by Nickelback, while the first song on the \\"Lake\\" was \\"Father of Mine\\" by Everclear. Lite 102.9 Becomes The Lake Steve Geofferies, operations manager for the Charlotte cluster of station owner Clear Channel, said, \\"If it was a hit song, we‚Äôre going to play it,\\" explaining that the format was based on WARH in St. Louis, and more \\"tempo-oriented\\" than nearby WSMW. The name \\"Lake\\" meant \\"fun, unique, connecting with friends and families. That‚Äôs life on the lake,\\" specifically Lake Norman and Lake Wylie. The playlist was 4000 songs compared to 400 for a typical station. Also, the station would not have DJs, meaning morning host Heather Flynn and Phil Harris were let go.Mark Washburn, \\"Station dumps 'Lite' in favor of 'Lake',\\" The Charlotte Observer, July 14, 2012. On July 9, 2012, WLYT changed its call letters to WLKO to go with the \\"Lake\\" branding. The format change delivered immediate results. While WLYT ranked 15th with 3 percent share of the total audience in its final ratings report, WLKO was ranked 7th with five percent share in its first one.Mark Washburn, \\"Ratings update: Big surge at 'Lake' radio,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 8, 2012. After two years, WLKO was up 52 percent to 4th place for the most successful format change in the market in 25 years. As of 2016, the playlist primarily features hit music from the 1970s and 1980s, with occasional 1990s and 2000s music played; with this, the station more closely resembles a classic hits station than the adult hits format the station started out with, though the \\"We Play Anything\\" slogan is still promoted. On September 16, 2014, WLKO's owners Clear Channel Communications officially changed their name to iHeartMedia.

Chosen to replace the HH-3F Pelican, the MH-60T is a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family of helicopters and is based on the United States Navy's SH-60 Seahawk helicopter. Development began in September 1986, first flight was achieved on 8 August 1989, and the first HH-60J entered USCG service in June 1990. Production ended in 1996 after 42 helicopters were produced; three retired SH-60F Seahawks were also remanufactured to MH-60T specifications beginning in 2010. A total of 42 MH-60Ts are in service with the Coast Guard.MH-60T: Jayhawk . U.S. Coast Guard Development Chosen to replace the HH-3F Pelican, the HH-60J was based on the United States Navy's SH-60 Seahawk and a member of the Sikorsky S-70 helicopter family. Compared to its predecessor, the HH-3F, the HH-60J is lighter, faster, and equipped with more sophisticated electronics and more powerful engines. The HH-60J was developed in conjunction with the U.S. Navy's HH-60H Rescue Hawk.Leoni, Ray D. Black Hawk, The Story of a World Class Helicopter, pp. 212-213. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2007. . Sikorsky HH-60J Jayhawk (USCG registration number 6008) on the tarmac at Coast Guard Air Station Astoria, Oregon Sikorsky began development in September 1986 and aircraft registration number 6001 achieved first flight on 8 August 1989. The first aircraft was delivered to the USCG for developmental testing in March, 1990 at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. In March 1991, ATC Mobile, Alabama became the first USCG unit to fly the HH-60J, allowing instructor pilots to prepare for pilot training. Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina was the first USCG operational unit to fly the HH-60J. Sikorsky produced 42 HH-60Js with sequential registration numbers from 6001 through 6042. Sikorsky ended production in 1996 after completing the 42 units on contract. Subsequently, the Coast Guard has converted three ex-Navy SH-60F Seahawks into MH-60T Jayhawks (registration numbers 6043-6045) as attrition replacements.\\"SH-60F to MH-60T Conversion Process\\" .

The Jayhawk has a radar for search/weather that gives its nose a distinctive look. A forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor turret can be mounted below its nose. It can carry three fuel tanks with two on the port side rack and one on the starboard side rack. The starboard side also carries a capacity rescue hoist mounted above the door. The hoist has of cable. It uses the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System as its primary long range navigational aid, using a Collins RCVR-3A radio to simultaneously receive information from four of the NAVSTAR system's 18 worldwide satellites. The helicopter is normally based on land but can be based on 270 foot medium endurance Coast Guard Cutters (WMEC) or 378 ft high endurance Coast Guard Cutters (WHEC). The MH-60T is equipped with a 7.62 mm M240H medium machine gun and a .50 in Barrett M82 semi-automatic rifle for firing warning and disabling shots. These weapons also serve as defensive armament. Operational history Haitian earthquake victims are unloaded from a HH-60J at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay. In 1990, HH-60J Jayhawks began replacing HH-3F Pelican and CH-3E Sea King helicopters in service with the US Coast Guard. HH-60Js perform search and rescue missions, along with other missions such as maritime patrol and drug interdiction.Tomajczyk, Stephen F. Black Hawk, pp. 74-74. MBI, 2003. . Coast Guard cutters with their HH-60Js and other helicopters performed security and interdiction in the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm and also in 2003 for Operation Enduring Freedom. In January 2011, Juneau Mountain Rescue volunteers, working with the Alaska State Troopers and the Coast Guard, rescued an injured hiker on Ripikski Mountain, near Haines. A Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, dispatched from Sitka, transported the hiker to Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska. On 29 October 2012, Jayhawk number 6031 (70-1790) was used during the offshore rescue of the crew of HMS Bounty during Hurricane Sandy. Starting in 2009, Coast Guard Jayhawks have been tasked with a secondary mission of drug patrol/enforcement. These missions are usually conducted in cooperation with coast guard cutters.

It occurs in the New World from the southwestern United States and Mexico to Argentina, and also on Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. Description Breeding plumage The least grebe ranges in length from (depending on the subspecies) and in weight from . Weights are variable based on region and subspecies, being smaller in Panama, where males weighed a mean of against the females and larger in the West Indies, where the sexes weigh a mean of and , respectively. In Texas, size is intermediate at and . Even in the largest races, the least grebe is still smaller and lighter than any other grebe species.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . Like all grebes, its legs are set far back on its body and it cannot walk well, though it is an excellent swimmer and diver. Small and plump, with a fairly short, sharp-pointed beak and bright yellow eyes, it typically appears quite dark all over. The breeding adult is brownish grey above with a darker blackish crown and throat. It has a brownish chest and pale underparts. It shows a white wing patch in flight. Non-breeding birds are paler with a whitish throat, and immatures are paler and greyer than adults. Unlike all other members of its genus, it lacks any chestnut coloring on its neck. Taxonomy There are five recognized subspecies of least grebe, separated principally by size and color. * T. d. brachypterus ‚Äì (Chapman, 1899): is found from southern Texas and Mexico south to Panama. * T. d. bangsi ‚Äì (van Rossem & Hachisuka, 1937): is restricted to southern Baja California, Mexico. It is the smallest and palest of the subspecies. * T. d. dominicus ‚Äì (Linnaeus, 1766): nominate, is found in the northern Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Greater Antilles and Virgin Islands. * T. d. brachyrhynchus or T. d. speciosus ‚Äì (Chapman, 1899): is found in South America, from Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago south to northern Argentina and southern Brazil. * T. d. eisenmanni ‚Äì Storer & Getty, 1985: is restricted to the lowlands of western Ecuador. This subspecies is not recognized by all authorities. Its genus name, Tachybaptus, is a combination of two Greek words‚Äîtakhus meaning fast and baptos meaning diving, or sinking under. The specific name dominicus refers to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, which was formerly known as Santo Domingo. As its English name suggests, the least grebe is overall the smallest member of the grebe family. It is the only member of its genus found in the New World; the four other members of the genus Tachybaptus reside in the Old World and Australasia. Habitat and range Least grebes are found in a wide variety of wetland habitats, including freshwater ponds, lakes, and marshes, slow-flowing streams and rivers, roadside ditches, and mangrove swamps. In general, they prefer bodies of water with significant amounts of vegetative cover, particularly along the edges; they will even use wetlands which are almost completely overgrown. They may choose small, temporary bodies of water to breed, in an effort to avoid predation of their chicks by large fish. Behavior For much of the year, least grebes are found singly or in pairs; however, when not breeding, they sometimes gather in flocks of 20 or more. =Diet= The least grebe eats a variety of aquatic life, including small fish, crustaceans, frogs and aquatic insects. Like all grebes, it pursues much of its prey under water. During active feeding bouts, it spends an average of 12.5 seconds beneath the surface on each dive, with surface pauses ranging from 2‚Äì24 seconds. =Breeding= Least grebes breed throughout the year. Those in the tropics tend to breed during the rainy season, while active nests have been found in every month of the year in Texas. Each pair builds a compact floating nest of vegetation‚Äîtypically a variety of aquatic weeds‚Äîwhich is anchored to rooted plants in still open water as deep as . The female lays three to six white eggs, though the damp nest material soon stains them with brown. Both adults incubate the eggs, which hatch after 21 days. The striped young are sometimes carried on the adult's back. =Voice= The breeding call has been likened to a horse whinnying. Threats The least grebe, while a species of least concern, experiences a number of predators, particularly early in life. Large fish species and turtles are reported to take young grebes, and bird-eating raptors, including the bat falcon and the golden eagle, have been observed taking adult birds.

The station receives exceptional co-channel interference from WNOK in Columbia, just 75 miles south of Charlotte. The Chester and Lancaster, South Carolina areas are affected the most with interference from both stations. Both WKQC and WNOK do employ directional antennas, despite this, the stations overlap contours quite a bit History WKQC signed on in 1960 as WYFM with a beautiful music format. By 1973, after EZ Communications bought the station, WYFM became WEZC (known by the moniker \\"EZ-104\\") and had a 100,000-watt signal. In September 1978, rival WBT-FM changed to rock and became WBCY, leaving WEZC as the city's only beautiful music station. In December 1982, even though the area had two other soft adult contemporary FM stations‚ÄîWLVV and WZXI‚ÄîWEZC changed to soft adult contemporary as well. The switch generated so many protests that WZXI moved to fill the gap. During the 1980s, WEZC gradually evolved from soft adult contemporary to mainstream adult contemporary. The station's most famous personality was controversial morning host Chuck Boozer. In March 1989, WEZC completed its transition with a name and call letter change to WMXC, \\"Mix 104.7\\", and the WEZC call letters were picked up by the former WRLX at 102.9.Jeff Borden, \\"WEZC Has New Format, Call Letters; New Playlist Aims at Both Sexes\\", The Charlotte Observer, March 21, 1989. The station originally wanted the calls WMIX, but at the last minute found out those calls were already being used by a pair of stations in Mount Vernon, Illinois, WMIX AM and WMIX-FM. Furthermore, in a somewhat controversial move, for a time it referred to itself on-air as WMIX, with an announcer whispering its true calls hurriedly during hourly legal IDs; however, the use of WMIX as a brand was short-lived, as the owners of the WMIX stations in Mount Vernon, Withers Broadcasting, registered the \\"WMIX\\" branding as a registered trademark.Justia Trademarks: \\"WMIX - Trademark Details\\" WMXC would gain a sister station in 1992, when Cox Broadcasting sold WSOC-FM to EZ. On September 2, 1994, with WBT-FM and WLYT (formerly the \\"new\\" WEZC) competing, WMXC became WSSS, \\"Star 104.7\\", playing \\"Super Sounds of the Seventies\\", which evolved to classic hits later in 1997.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-09-09.pdf WSSS would gain 4 sister stations (WBAV-FM, WBAV-AM, WNKS and WPEG) in December 1996 from Evergreen Media, which was part of a large multi-market swap (Evergreen received EZ Communications' Philadelphia stations WIOQ and WUSL in return).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-06.pdf; EZ would then be bought by American Radio Systems in July 1997. ARS would be bought out by Infinity Broadcasting on September 19, 1997, making WSSS a CBS O&O; station (CBS owned Infinity). In January 2000, WSSS added 1980s music to their playlist,Bill Keveney, \\"Star 104.7 Tweaks Its '70s Format\\", The Charlotte Observer, January 25, 2000. and the station later went all-1980s. WSSS would shift back to Classic hits in 2002. But even though format changes generated brief ratings improvement, nothing worked until the station returned to adult contemporary music, with an emphasis on older songs. The switch to the current format came after stunting with Christmas music beginning on Halloween and continuing all through the 2003 holiday season. Operations Manager John Reynolds, Market Manager Bill Schoening and AC Programming Consultant Gary Berkowitz designed the rebirth of the station. Plans were to rename the station \\"Cool 104.7\\". However, on December 23, just three days before the new format was scheduled to debut, CBS Radio's legal department notified the station that the word \\"Cool\\", when used as a noun, had been copyrighted by Clear Channel Communications. A $10,000 jingle package had to be scrapped and Program Director Tom Jeffries and PM Drive host T. Edward Bensen spent Christmas Day re-imaging the station with the quickly revised name of \\"K 104.7\\" so the debut could occur as scheduled the next morning.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2004/RR-2004-01-02.pdf Infinity changed its name to CBS Radio in December 2005 as part of the spin-off of CBS' motion picture and cable television assets under a relaunched Viacom. In January 2007, Tom Jeffries, a former Boston-area programming legend who had been Program Director and Morning Host since the station's flip in 2004, resigned to go into semi- retirement. In April 2007, the station picked up local TV meteorologist Derek James as the new morning host, while promoting Scarlet C. to Assistant Program Director and T. Edward Bensen to Music Director. The station abruptly eliminated its entire on-air staff in October 2008, with the only exception being Holly Haze from 7pm-12am weekdays. Production Director Rick Scaffe and Promotions Director Leah Galloway, as well as sister WNKS Promotions Director Natalie Kirby and long time WSOC-FM newsman Frank Lassiter were also cut at the same time in what was called a cost-cutting move. The station hired Charlotte radio veteran Jon Robinson to do mornings from 6am-12pm a few months later. On November 18, 2009, his name was abruptly removed from the station website, with no report as to why he was terminated. Later, Robinson revealed that he'd been arrested at the end of his shift one day in October for violating a protective order, and that he and station officials agreed to part ways at the end of his contract so he could focus on recovering from a long term substance abuse problem.Former Media Star Reveals Dark Life, Charlotte Observer, December 20, 2009 By 2010, the station had hired an all-new air staff. In January 2012, WKQC changed its slogan from Charlotte's Cool Music Station to More Music, Better Variety. WKQC calls itself \\"Christmas K-104.7\\" when it shifts to its all-Christmas format. The station also uses holiday- themed jingles. Initially, it airs the all-Christmas format only on weekends leading up to Thanksgiving, with a mix of regular and Christmas songs on the weekdays. On the week of Thanksgiving, the all-Christmas format runs on a full-time basis, as of Christmas 2008. The station bills itself as the Carolinas' radio home for the holidays, a title that WLYT once held exclusively until 2004, when both stations started going head-to-head; as of Christmas 2012, WKQC is the exclusive Christmas music station for Charlotte, thanks to WLYT's aforementioned format flip to adult hits and rebranding to WLKO (\\"102.9 The Lake\\"). WKQC also claims to be Charlotte's first eco-friendly station that boasts a promotions fleet of gas saving and flex fuel vehicles. To further promote this, WKQC switched their logo to \\"Be Cool, Go Green\\" and promotes a 'green' lifestyle by providing tips and partnering with local community campaigns in the Charlotte area. On October 2, 2014, CBS Radio announced that it would trade all of their Tampa and Charlotte stations (including WKQC), as well as WIP in Philadelphia to the Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for 5 stations located in Miami and Philadelphia.CBS And Beasley Swap Philadelphia/Miami For Charlotte/Tampa from Radio Insight (October 2, 2014) The swap was completed on December 1, 2014.

He taught at the Catholic University in Nijmegen. He was a member of the Dominican Order. His books on theology have been translated into many languages, and his contributions to the Second Vatican Council made him known throughout the world. Early life and ordination He was born in Antwerp, the sixth of 14 children in a middle-class family. After being educated by the Jesuits at Turnhout, Schillebeeckx entered the Dominican Order in 1934. He studied theology and philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven. In 1941 he was ordained to the priesthood. In 1943 he finalized his studies in Turnhout and moved to Ghent, where he studied at the Dominican house; he was strongly influenced by Dominicus De Petter's courses in phenomenology. After three years of studying philosophy at Ghent, Schillebeeckx heeded the call up of the Belgian Armed Forces in 1938, leaving the army again in August 1939. But one and a half months after that he was summoned to return, due to the start of World War II and he left the Army only after the defeat of the Belgian Armed Forces by the German occupiers. Schillebeeckx then entered the Dominican study house at Leuven, where he stayed until 1945. From that year to July 1946, he studied at the Dominican study centre Le Saulchoir at √âtiolles, near Paris, where representatives of the Nouvelle th√©ologie-movement such as Marie-Dominique Chenu and Yves Congar introduced him to modern Catholic theology as well as to the thought of Calvinist theologians like Karl Barth.Source Citation (MLA 8th Edition) Kerr, F. \\"Schillebeeckx, Edward.\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia Supplement, Jubilee Volume: The Wojtyla Years, edited by Polly Vedder, Gale, 2000, pp. 405-406.

In 1958 the Catholic University of Nijmegen (now called Radboud University) in the Netherlands made him a professor of dogmatic theology and history of theology.

Second Vatican Council During the Second Vatican Council, Schillebeeckx was one of the most active theologians. He drafted various council interventions for Dutch bishops such as Cardinal Bernard Jan Alfrink, and gave conferences on theological ressourcement for many episcopal conferences present in Rome. Due to his having been the \\"ghost writer\\" of the Dutch bishops' Pastoral Letter on the upcoming Council in 1961, he was rendered suspect with the Congregation of the Holy Office, led by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani (President) and the Dutchman Sebastiaan Tromp (Secretary). This was the first of three instances in which Schillebeeckx had to defend his theological positions against accusations from the Roman authorities. As a result, Schillebeeckx drafted anonymously his mostly negative comments on the schemata prepared by the Preparatory Theological Commission, headed by Ottaviani. These anonymous comments on the theological schemata debated at Vatican II, and the articles he published, also influenced the development of several conciliar constitutions such as Dei verbum and Lumen gentium. Concerning the latter document, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Schillebeeckx was mainly involved in the debate on episcopal collegiality, attempting to move Catholic ecclesiology away from a purely hierarchical, structured vision of the church, focusing too heavily on Papal authority (as a result of the declaration of Papal infallibility in Vatican I's constitution Pastor aeternus). This, according to Schillebeeckx and many others at Vatican II, was to be balanced by a renewed stress on the role of the episcopal college. In this way his influence was far greater than that of a formal peritus, a status the Dutch bishops had not granted to him. Not being a peritus also allowed him more time to give talks to the Bishops attending the council, and to explain to them the \\"new theology\\" or understanding arising with the Council. Already in 1963, together with Chenu, Congar, Karl Rahner, and Hans K√ºng, he was involved in preparing the rise of the new theological journal Concilium, which was officially founded in 1965 with the support of Paul Brand and Antoine Van den Boogaard, and which promoted \\"reformist\\" thought. Exegesis In the post-conciliar period Schillebeeckx' attention shifted somewhat from Thomism to biblical exegesis. He saw neo-scholastic theology that reacted against modern ideas as poorly founded in Aquinas‚Äôs writings or their medieval context. He portrayed sacraments less abstractly, like the personal encounters Jesus had with his followers, rather than as mechanisms for the distribution of grace. He became widely known through the English translation in 1963 of his book Christ the Sacrament of the Encounter with God.https://books.google.com/books/about/Christ_the_Sacrament_of_the_Encounter_wi.html?id=mJd8YFnXZkgC On the basis of his study of the earliest Christian sources - often drawing upon the exegetical insight of his Nijmegen colleague Bas van Iersel ‚Äì Schillebeeckx confronted such debated questions as the position of priests, e.g., by supporting a proposal to disconnect sacramental priesthood and the obligation to celibacy. Precisely on this matter, Schillebeeckx played an influential role during the National Pastoral Council (Landelijk Pastoraal Concilie) held at Noordwijkerhout from 1968 to 1970. At the sessions of this synod, the Dutch bishops, intellectuals, and representatives from many Catholic organisations tried to implement what they perceived as the major progressive objectives of the Second Vatican Council. Schillebeeckx, well known in the Netherlands and Belgium through his many interventions in the media, was by then known as the leading Dutch-speaking contemporary theologian. Controversies with the CDF In Jesus: An experiment in Christology (Dutch ed. 1974), Schillebeeckx argued that we should not imagine that the belief of the disciples that Jesus had risen was caused by the empty tomb and the resurrection appearances. It was quite the opposite: A belief in the resurrection, \\"that the new orientation of living which this Jesus has brought about in their lives has not been rendered meaningless by his death ‚Äì quite the opposite,\\" gave rise to these traditions.Edward Schillebeeckx: Jesus: An Experiment in Christology, p. 333f, 345. The empty tomb was, in his opinion, an unnecessary hypothesis, since ‚Äúan eschatological, bodily resurrection, theologically speaking, has nothing to do, however, with a corpse.‚ÄùSchillebeeckx: Jesus: An Experiment in Christology, p. 704 note 45. That was merely a \\"crude and naive realism of what 'appearances of Jesus'\\" meant.Schillebeeckx: Jesus: An Experiment in Christology, p. 346. Although the books were followed by a couple of articles where Schillebeeckx defends himself against criticism and tones down his radicalism, on 20 October 1976 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wrote to him with various objections. As a result of the ensuing correspondence, he was asked to come to Rome to explain his position. In December 1979, he met with representatives of the Congregation. Due to international pressure, the drive for a trial was ended. The conclusions of the Congregation, however, left the impression that a genuine accord had not been reached, and he continued to receive notifications from Church authorities for his repeated writings.James Arraj: The Bodily Resurrection of Jesus (2007).Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger‚Äôs Preparation for the Papacy: How ‚Äòthe Vatican‚Äôs Enforcer‚Äô ran the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1979 - 2005) Appendix. Catholics for a Free Choice, April 2006. His christology was criticized by Cardinal Franjo ≈†eper and then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, whom Schillebeeckx already knew at Vatican II and who was later elected Pope Benedict XVI. In 1984 his orthodoxy was again called into question by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: he was summoned to Rome to explain his views expressed in The Ministry in the Church, which were regarded as Protestant. And in 1986 for a third time Schillebeeckx' theological views were put into question, again regarding the sacramental nature of office in the Roman Catholic Church. More precisely, in The Church with a Human Face Schillebeeckx argued, on biblical-historical grounds, that the consecration to Catholic priesthood does not necessarily gain its validity from, and can therefore be detached from, apostolic succession; rather, the choice of priests (and as a consequence the celebration of the Eucharist) is dependent on the local church community. Despite three investigations with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the writings of Schillebeeckx were never condemned. Some of his doctrines, however, have been implicitly or even explicitly rejected by the Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church; most notably his theory of transignification, designed to supplant the Catholic doctrine of transsubstantiation (in Pope Paul VI's 1965 encyclical Mysterium fidei.Mysterium Fidei) Schillebeeckx continued to publish after his retirement. His oeuvre, surveyed in several bibliographies, has been the subject of many studies and controversies. Later life Professor Schillebeeckx with the Erasmus Prize and prince Bernhard Until his death he lived in Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, where he taught at the Catholic University of Nijmegen until his retirement. He was awarded the Erasmus Prize in 1982, and (as the only theologian) the Gouden Ganzenveer in 1989.

With its second generation, the Matador became AMC's largest automobile after the 1974 discontinuation of the Ambassador that shared the same platform. Premium trim levels of the second generation Matador coupe were marketed as the Barcelona and Oleg Cassini (after the noted fashion designer) positioning the coupe in the personal luxury segment. Abroad, Matadors were also marketed under the Rambler marque and were assembled under license, including in Costa Rica, in Mexico by Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM). and in Australia with right- hand-drive by Australian Motor Industries (AMI).  Background  The 1971 Matador replaced the AMC Rebel, which had been marketed since 1967. With a facelift and a new name, the AMC Matadors were available as a two-door hardtop, four-door sedan and station wagon body styles. The Matador shared a modified platform with the full-size Ambassador line. Sedan and wagon models \\"offered excellent value and were fairly popular\\" cars. Matadors were offered to fleet buyers with various police, taxicab, and other heavy-duty packages. They were popular with government agencies and military units, with police departments in the U.S. equipped Matador sedans and wagons with or V8 engines. The Matador received a redesign in 1974, in part to meet new safety and crash requirements. The previous two-door hardtop body design was replaced with a completely different 2-door coupe model \\"to contend with the bull market for plush mid-size coupes that sprang up after the end of the muscle car era\\". It also featured a design that was praised by owners along with complains about its low roofline. The design of the Matador coupe has been described as \\"polarizing\\" as well as being \\"an evocative, swoopy coupe that perfectly captured the design ethos of the era.\\" Factory-backed first-generation hardtops and second-generation coupes competed in NASCAR stock car racing from 1972 to 1975. Drivers included Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison winning several races including the 1975 Southern 500 at Darlington. Matadors were available equipped for police and were featured in television shows and movies during the 1970s. The Matador coupe was featured and a scale model was used as a flying car in The Man with the Golden Gun, a James Bond film released in 1974.  First generation (1971‚Äì1973)  1971 = Matadors for 1971 received a revised front styling for all body styles, sharing its body design from the firewall rearward with the Ambassador and the same platform. Revision included a longer wheelbase and revised front styling, grille, chrome trim. The new Matador was built in sedan, two-door hardtop, and station wagon body styles. From the 1970 Rebel, the 1971 model retained the same trunk lid chrome strip and rear-corner chrome garnishes; rear bumper with revised rounded-square lenses; interior dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel, and armrests; and the 1967‚Äì1970 Rebel \\"Weather Eye\\" fan-heat control unit. Standard equipment included air conditioning. The 1971 model offered split-bench front seating with individual fold-down center armrests for passenger and driver. As a restyled 1970 Rebel, advertising suggested the Matador was not just a name change and facelift. The new nameplate distanced the car from the previous nameplate's association with the Confederacy, and a \\"what's a Matador\\" advertising campaign established a distinct marketing identity. This self- disparaging marketing campaign \\"turned the styling of anonymity into an asset.\\" Consumer-research polls conducted by AMC found it meant virility and excitement to consumers. American Motors ran into problems in Puerto Rico, where the term \\"matador\\" retained a bullfighting \\"killer\\" connotation. Station wagons offered optional rear-facing third-row bench seats, increasing seating from six to eight passengers. Standard equipment included a roof rack and two- way tailgate ‚Äî that could open from a bottom hinge (with window retracted) to extend the load surface or swing door-like from a left-hinge. The Matador came with a straight-6 or a number of V8 engines. Transmissions for the Matador included the Borg-Warner sourced \\"Shift-Command\\" three-speed automatic, a column-shifted three-speed manual, and a floor-shifted four-speed manual.  Matador Machine  Where the Rebel Machine was a distinct 1970 model, the Matador offered a performance package option, marketed as the Go Package, for all body styles. The Matador two-door Go Package option lacked the optional red, white, and blue striping; special model identification or exterior badging of its predecessor. Approximately 50 Matador Machines were produced for 1971. The package featured 15x7-inch slot-styled steel wheels with white- lettered Goodyear Polyglas tires, dual exhaust system, a heavy-duty handling package, power disk brakes, and a choice of either a ($373 option) or the V8 engine (for $461) with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. = 1972 = 1972 AMC Matador two-door hardtop 1972 AMC Matador wagon The 1972 Matador was built in sedan, two-door hardtop, and station wagon body styles. In 1972 the innovative AMC Buyer Protection Plan was introduced. This was the automobile industry's first 12-month or bumper-to-bumper warranty. American Motors started with an emphasis on quality and durability by focusing on its component sourcing, improving production that included reducing the number of models, as well as mechanical upgrades and increasing the level of standard equipment. This was followed by an innovative promise to its customers to repair anything wrong with the car (except for tires). Owners were provided with a toll-free number to the company, as well as a free loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight. The objective was to reduce warranty claims, as well as achieve better public relations along with greater customer satisfaction and loyalty. The previous Borg-Warner sourced \\"Shift-Command\\" three-speed automatic transmission was replaced by the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite three-speed automatic that AMC marketed as \\"Torque-Command.\\" The column-shift three-speed manual continued as the standard transmission, but the optional four-speed manual was discontinued. Externally the 1972 model was the same as the 1971 model, retaining the same front end but with a simplified grille. The chrome trunk lid strip and rear corner chrome of the 1970 Rebel and 1971 Matador was dropped. The 1972 model was given a new tail light lens assembly with each assembly divided into nine recessed vertically rectangular lenses. Interior-wise the 1972 model saw the return of the round instrument dials of earlier Ambassador and 1967 Rebel models. The steering wheel was the same as the 1970 Rebel and 1971 Matador models. New for the 1972 model were slimmer armrests for the doors and a bench seat without the fold-down center armrests. Individual reclining front seats were an option. = 1973 = The Matador hardtop, sedan, and station wagon body styles came in only one trim model for 1973, with numerous appearance and comfort options. The 1973 model year brought new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a front and a rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Matadors gained stronger front and rear bumpers. The front bumper included self- restoring telescoping shock-absorbers and more prominent vertical rubber guards, while the rear bumper gained vertical black rubber bumper guards that replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards. Aside from the changes to the bumpers, the design of the 1973 model was identical to the 1972 model with the exception of new tail light lens assemblies and a slightly different grille pattern. The dash and instrument cluster of the 1972 model was repeated in the 1973 model although the steering wheel horn pad lost it's \\"bullseye\\" emblem, which had been in use since the last year of the Rebel. The full-width bench seat was standard with 50/50 individually adjustable and reclining seats were optional on all body styles. The station wagons came with \\"Uganda\\" vinyl upholstery, while the two-door hardtops offered optional front bucket seats. All V8 powered Matadors came with a TorqueFlite 998 automatic transmission and a column-mounted shifter. The V8 Autolite 2100 carburetor was replaced with the modified Motorcraft 2150 carburetor. The I6 was the base engine with a column-mounted three-speed manual transmission, with a I6 optional, with which only the station wagon could be ordered with a manual transmission because almost all six-cylinder powered Matadors came with TorqueFlite 904 automatics. Promotional and publicity efforts for the Matador included sponsorship at NASCAR racing events. Mark Donohue drove a two-door hardtop prepared by Roger Penske on the road course at Riverside, California, on January 21, 1973, lapping the entire field to win this NASCAR Cup Series race. This was also Penske's first NASCAR victory at the Winston Western 500, with Donohue's Matador leading 138 out of the 191 laps. A comparison of 1973 Matador owners conducted by Popular Mechanics indicated increased satisfaction and fewer problems than was the case with the owners of the essentially similar 1970 AMC Rebel three years earlier. The intermediate-sized car market segment was growing to almost 20% of the total market by 1973, but the hardtop was the slowest-selling version in the Matador line, \\"in a segment where two-door hardtops were customarily the most popular (and profitable) models.\\" Automobile Quarterly reviewed the 1973 cars and summarized that \\"AMC actually has a very strong product line, but public awareness of it seems so feeble as to be negligible. ... The Matador became a typical intermediate, an exact counterpart of the Satellite/Coronet or Torino/Montego\\", and ranked AMC's car as a \\"good buy.\\"  Second generation (1974‚Äì1978)  American Motors was facing many challenges in a dynamic marketplace. The strategy to redesign the Matador for the 1974 model year was an example of the changes that Gerald C. Meyers, vice president of product development, wanted for AMC's mid-sized product range. The intermediate-sized cars were best sellers in the U.S. and the two-door hardtops or coupe versions most popular with consumers. Because styling was their greatest selling point, a decision was made to develop a new version of the Matador as a coupe, thus giving designers the freedom to style \\"rakishly as sheet metal could be made to look\\" and eliminating the limits of making sedans and station wagons with the same lines. The results were introduced with the 1974 model year Matadors. Four-door sedans and station wagons featured major front end changes and the rear end on the four-door sedans was revised, while the two-door model became a separate and radically styled pillared coupe. All models included new interiors and paint colors. The previous pillar-less hardtop design was discontinued and the new two-door coupe no longer shared any body parts with the sedan or wagon. The two-door's roofline was significantly lower and its wheelbase was shorter compared to the four-door Matadors. These are considered to be the \\"second generation\\" Matadors. = 1974 = New passenger car requirements set by NHTSA called for the front and rear passenger car bumpers to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain impacts with no damage. All the 1974 Matadors accomplished this with massive front and rear bumpers mounted on energy absorbing shocks. The sedans and station wagons had them integrated with the bodywork using gap-concealing flexible filler panels. The four-door sedans and wagons had increased overall vehicle length, as well as new front and rear styling. A new front fascia with a hood and grille featured a prominent central protrusion that followed the front bumper shape. Matadors with this front end are sometimes nicknamed \\"coffin noses\\". The rear of the sedan was redesigned with the license plate was relocated above the number to the center of the rear panel with new, wider rectangular taillights. The station wagon had redesigned taillamps and a stronger bumper with a central rubber facing. The interior of all body styles featured an all-new fully padded and safety shaped dashboard with three squared pods for housing the instruments in front of the driver (indicator lights, fuel gauge, and water temperature to the left, speedometer at the center, and an electric clock or fuel economy gauge on the right) as well as a new horizontal radio/sound system design in the center of the dash. The traditional steering wheel horn pad in use since the 1970 Rebel was replaced with a rectangular \\"soft feel horn bar.\\" Second generation sedans and station wagons continued over all the model years with only minor trim and equipment changes. The base model sedans and wagons came with the I6 with the 3-speed Torque-Command automatic transmission. The V8 was optional. A two-barrel or four-barrel was optional as well as a V8 with dual exhausts. The V8 became a fleet-only option after 1974. A road test by automobile journalist Vincent Courtenay of the 1974 Matador station wagon \\"praised its performance, handling, and fuel economy considering its size and 360 CID engine.\\" He described it as \\"a real sleeper on the market. Its performance ranks it in the first line of cars, yet it's reasonably priced.\\" = 1975 = 1975 Matador sedan in Fawn Beige Changes for the 1975 model year were minor as AMC focused on the development and introduction of its innovative Pacer, but Matadors now included a standard \\"no maintenance\\" electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. New \\"unleaded fuel only\\" decals were placed by the fuel filler door and on the fuel gauge. Steel-belted radial tires became standard equipment on all Matadors. The six-cylinder engine now became the version and it was not available in California. The standard V8 was and optional was the as the was available only for police and fleet orders. From 1975 the 360 and 401 V8s were fitted with the upgraded Autolite 4350 4-barrel carburetor.Cranswick, Marc (2011). The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History. McFarland. p. 153. . Retrieved 14 June 2020. Only V8-powered Matadors were available in California. The sedan and wagon exteriors were updated with a new full-width grille featuring squared-off parking lights in the front and a new tail light lens assembly. An uplevel \\"Brougham\\" trim option became available for both sedans and wagons from 1975. There were no further style changes to the body of the sedan and wagon for the remainder of the production run. A preview of the 1975 Matador models by the editors of Consumer Guide was quite complimentary, especially of the sedan and wagon. = 1976 = 1976 AMC Matador station wagon with optional simulated wood trim second-generation Matador interior (1976) with safety shaped padded dashboard For 1976 the six- cylinder remained the base engine with V8 and V8 engines with 2-barrel carb as options. A \\"Performance Option\\" V8 with 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust with twin catalytic converters was available through 1976. The 2.87 rear axle ratio was standard with 3.15 and 3.54 optional. A floor shifted automatic transmission was available on coupes equipped with bucket seats and console. The \\"Brougham\\" trim option continued for both sedans and wagons in 1976. = 1977 = For 1977 AMC introduced the Buyer Protection Plan II which extended the engine and drivetrain warranty from 12-months/12,000 miles to 24-months/24,000 miles. The base engine continued to be the 258 cubic-inch six cylinder and V8 options were the 304 or 360 cubic-inch. The high-performance \\"Power Package\\" 360 was dropped for 1977. All Matadors now came standard with automatic transmissions. = 1978 = For 1978, the 258-cubic-inch six remained standard, but the became the only V8 engine available. The \\"Barcelona Package\\" option that was previously exclusive to the Matador Coupe was extended to the four-door sedan. This special interior and exterior trim included individual reclining seats in velveteen crush fabric with woven accent stripes, custom door trim panels, unique headliner, vinyl roof, and 15-inch wheels color-matched to a choice of two two-tone color schemes: Golden Ginger Metallic with Sand Tan, or Autumn Red Metallic on Claret Metallic. The AMC Buyer Protection Plan for 1978 changed back to 12-months/12,000 miles across the entire AMC range. Sales in 1978 fell 66% for the Matador line so the line was dropped by the end of the model year. = Matador Coupe = 1974 AMC Matador X Coupe 1976 AMC Matador Coupe, Brougham edition finished in Dark Cocoa Metallic (paint code: H4) with optional vinyl roof cover American Motors' executives saw an opportunity to replace the \\"uninspired\\" Matador two- door hardtop with a new design to capture people looking for exciting, sporty styling in a market segment that was outpacing the rest of the automobile market; and were looking to answer the demand for plush mid-size coupes after the end of the muscle car era. The 1974 model year introduced an aerodynamically styled fastback coupe with pronounced \\"tunneled\\" headlight surrounds. The Matador coupe was the only all-new model in the popular mid- size car segment, specifically targeting the Chevrolet Chevelle Coupe, Ford Torino Coupe, and Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The coupe was designed under the direction of AMC's vice president of styling, Dick Teague, with input from Mark Donohue, the famous race car driver. AMC's styling department had greater freedom because of a decision to design the new Matador strictly as a coupe, without the constraints of attempting to have the sedan and station wagon versions fit the same body lines. Reportedly Teague designed the coupe's front as an homage to one of the first AMCs he designed, the 1964 Rambler American. This was one of several distinctive elements as the long sloping hood was set off by deeply tunneled headlamps between a broad grille with turn signal lamps resembling driving lamps. The forward edge of the hood was part of a character crease line that went completely around the middle of the car and continued across the rear end. The coupe's doors were extra long and featured frameless glass. The B-pillar was also distinctive and the quarter side windows sloped with the roofline. The combination of a very long low hood and a tall short rear deck enhanced the coupe's wind-shaped look. The new coupe featured a totally unique design to avoid the massive, blockish look. The bodywork flowed underneath the coupe's broad grille with tunneled headlamps in the rear with an uninterrupted design with the four round taillamps and indented license plate area while the bumpers were free-standing with only rubber gaiters concealing the retractable shock absorbers. The standard power team for the 1974 coupe was AMC's inline six-cylinder with a 3-speed manual transmission. Standard on the Matador X was the V8. A floor shift automatic transmission was available only on the coupe with center console and bucket front seats. Many were amazed that AMC came up with the fast, stylish Matador, considering the automaker's size and limited resources. The Matador coupe stands out as one of the more distinctive and controversial designs of the 1970s after the AMC Pacer and was named \\"Best Styled Car of 1974\\" by the editors of Car and Driver magazine. A Popular Mechanics survey indicated \\"luscious looks of Matador coupe swept most owners off their feet\\" with a \\"specific like\\" listed by 63.7% of them for \\"styling\\". Sales of the coupe were brisk with 62,629 Matador coupes delivered for its introductory year (August 1973 thru December 1974, Long Year), up sharply from the 7,067 Matador hardtops sold in 1973. This is a respectable record that went against the drop in the overall market during 1974 and the decline in popularity of intermediate-sized coupes after the 1973 oil crisis. After it outsold the four-door Matadors by nearly 25,000 units in 1974, sales dropped to less than 10,000 in 1977, and then down to just 2,006 in the coupe's final year. Nearly 100,000 Matador coupes in total were produced from 1974 through 1978. American Motors executives, including vice president of design Dick Teague, described design plans for a four-door sedan and station wagon based on the coupe's styling themes that did not reach production. = Oleg Cassini = Cassini showing off the interior trim he designed 1975 Matador Oleg Cassini coupe A special Oleg Cassini edition of the Matador coupe was available for the 1974 and 1975 model years. This one more in a series of designer cars that were marketed by AMC. This included the Gucci Hornet and Pierre Cardin Javelin special designs as well as the Levi's versions of the Gremlin and Hornets. American Motors had the famous American fashion designer develop a more elegant luxury-oriented model for the new coupe. Cassini was renowned in Hollywood and high-society for making elegant ready-to-wear dresses, including those worn by Jacqueline Kennedy. Cassini himself helped promote the car in AMC's advertising. With Cassini's styling, the new \\"smooth and slippery\\" two-door featured \\"marks of haute couture\\" with the \\"upholstery, panels and headliner done in jet black, with copper trim pieces, and with carpets and vinyl roof also offered in a copper accent color. The exterior trim included striping, rub rails, wheel covers and special \\"Oleg Cassini\\" crest badging mark the Matador as Cassini's.\\" The Cassini Coupes were limited to black, white, or copper metallic exterior paints, and all came with the vinyl-covered roof. They also featured copper-colored trim in the grille, headlamp bezels, in turbine-type full wheel covers, and within the rear license plate recess. The interior was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal buttons on the individual adjustable and reclining front seats as well as on the padded door panels. The design was further enhanced by deep pile copper-colored carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature. The use of a fashion designer to specially create appearance packages for American cars was taken up by the Continental Mark IV in 1976. In 1979, Cadillac briefly used this approach on the Cadillac Seville partnering with fashion designer Gucci, but ended this practice in 1980. This concept was later satirized on a 1976 episode of SCTV as the 'Salvador Dali Linkin-Murcry Limited Edition', with Dali (Joe Flaherty) explaining the concept of the car in Dali-esque terms. = Barcelona = 1977 Barcelona Coupe 1978 Barcelona Coupe For 1977 and 1978, the \\"Barcelona II\\" coupe featured a padded Landau roof and opera windows, styling cues that were required at that time by buyers in the highly popular two-door \\"personal luxury\\" market segment. At first, it was available in only one distinctive two-tone paint pattern consisting of Golden Ginger Metallic with Sand Tan. The Barcelona included numerous comfort and appearance upgrades in addition to the extensive standard equipment that came on all Matadors. The special items were: individual reclining seats in velveteen crush fabric with woven accent stripes, custom door trim panels, unique headliner, headlight bezels painted accent color, black trunk carpet, rear sway bar, GR78x15 radial whitewall tires, color-keyed slot styled wheels, body-color front and rear bumpers, two-tone paint, landau padded vinyl roof, opera quarter windows with accents, dual remote control mirrors painted body color, Barcelona medallion on glove box door and fenders, carpeting and bumper nerf strips. The standard roll-down rear quarter windows were converted into fixed \\"opera windows\\" with fiberglass covers over the stock openings that were finished with padded vinyl inside and out. For the 1978 model year, the Barcelona package came in a second color scheme: an Autumn Red Metallic on Claret Metallic combination. The 258-cubic-inch six with automatic remained standard, but the 360-cubic-inch became the only V-8 option. Production for this final year was 2,006 coupes. Motor Trend magazine road tested a 1977 Barcelona II coupe and found it to be equal to all in the objective areas, as well as one of the most distinctive vehicles on the road that \\"makes a good deal of sense... if you're not put off by the Matador's unique lines.\\"  NASCAR racing  #12 NASCAR Matador during a pit stop #16 NASCAR Matador tribute car in Sweden Penske Racing prepared factory-backed Matador hardtops and coupes were used in NASCAR stock car tracks. Drivers included Indy winner Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison, and they won a number of races. As it was AMC's first entry into NASCAR since the Hudson Hornet of predecessor company Hudson, the company's effort \\"raised eyebrows\\" for many NASCAR veterans because AMC was not known for cultivating a racing image. Racing pundits \\"initially scoffed at the notion of an AMC entry\\" on the circuit, but \\"the Matador acquired a fan following of its own.\\" Hutcherson-Pagan built a pair of 1972 2-door hardtop \\"Bull Fighters\\" for Penske as the marque's first attempt at NASCAR in 1972. The Matador was one of the first oval stock car to use disc brakes. After Donohue won the Western 500 with the first-generation Matador hardtop with four wheel discs, other teams soon followed with the upgrade. The new 1974 coupe replaced the previous \\"flying brick\\" two-door hardtop design. Penske was quoted as saying that they did what they could with the old hardtop, and it did better on tracks with more curves and fewer straightaways. Donohue did not survive to drive the new aerodynamically designed fastback coupe, that many believe was aimed at NASCAR racing. The five wins for the AMC Matador are: * Winston Western 500 ‚Äì Riverside ‚Äì Mark Donohue ‚Äì January 21, 1973 * Los Angeles Times 500 ‚Äì Ontario ‚Äì Bobby Allison ‚Äì November 24, 1974 * Winston Western 500 ‚Äì Riverside ‚Äì Bobby Allison ‚Äì January 19, 1975 * Rebel 500 ‚Äì Darlington ‚Äì Bobby Allison ‚Äì April 13, 1975 * Southern 500 ‚Äì Darlington ‚Äì Bobby Allison ‚Äì September 1, 1975 Bobby Allison also won the non-points Daytona 125 qualifying race on 13 February 1975 and finished second in the Daytona 500 three days later.  Police and Law Enforcement  Though the full-sized AMC Ambassador was also offered as a police car, the Matador would prove to be very popular. The largest user of Matador patrol cars was the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), primarily from 1972 to 1974. After extensive testing of the special police models offered by Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler, the LAPD chose the AMC Matador because they \\"out handled and outperformed all the other cars.\\" The LAPD police Matadors included among other special equipment: T-2 can lights, a five-channel Motorola Mocom 70 VHF radio, a Federal PA-20A Interceptor siren, and a \\"Hot Sheet Desk\\" with a Roster gooseneck lamp. Matador sedans and station wagons were also used by other agencies, including the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department, and the Los Angeles Fire Department.\\"Battalion 7, AMC Matador\\" URL: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lafdhs/8740205026/ The 1974 models would be the last year for the LAPD's purchase of the Matador. The second-generation longer-nosed restyle and the -mile bumpers added weight that affected handling and performance. Moreover, after 1976, AMC \\"let the police car business go as it causes too many problems.\\" Matadors were used many other law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada, as well as by military police units\\"Vancouver Police Department AMC Matador ‚Äì 1974\\" URL: https://www.flickr.com/photos/91431232@N00/38922295845/in/photolist-22iqWwi with some remaining in service even until the mid-1980s.1975 AMC Matador in service with Dallas Police URL: https://www.facebook.com/DallasPD/photos/amc- matador/10150225104177412/ While V8 power was down for many domestic sedans, AMC used a V8 engine that out-powered most other police vehicles. Tests of the 1972 AMC Javelin pony car and Matador sedan equipped with the 401 V8s resulted both running the quarter-mile dragstrip in the 14.7-second range. 0 to times were within 7 seconds, comparable to a 2006 Hemi Charger police car. Top speed was about , which took 43 seconds, much faster than the previously used Plymouth Satellites. The high-performance 401 V8 was last available in 1975 only for fleet and police ordered sedans.  In popular culture Television shows= A 1972 AMC Matador was used as the hero police car in Seasons 5‚Äì7 of Adam-12 TV show During the 1970s, AMC Matador police cars would appear in many television shows and episodes featuring police car procedures. The vehicle itself was considered a character most famously in Adam-12 from 1972 until the show's end in 1975. The show's stars rode in a 1972 Matador and the character of \\"Mac\\", their precinct sergeant, drove a 1972 Matador station wagon. Most famously, 1974 Matador sedans were the Hazzard County, Georgia police cars featured during the first season of The Dukes of Hazzard and both generations of sedans appeared as LAPD police cars during the first three seasons of The Rockford Files. =James Bond film placement= As part of a significant product placement strategy, an AMC Matador coupe played a starring role in a The Man with the Golden Gun, released in 1974. It featured the newly introduced Matador Brougham Coupe in the Oleg Cassini edition, along with Matador four-door police cars (in the black and white livery used by the Los Angeles Police Department) and a Hornet X hatchback. The Matador is the car of Francisco Scaramanga, and along with Nick Nack, they use the \\"flying\\" AMC Matador to kidnap Mary Goodnight. With its wings, the stunt car was long, wide, and high. A stuntman drove the \\"car plane\\" to a runway. It was not airworthy, so a -long remote controlled model, built by John Stears, was used for the aerial sequences. The \\"flying AMC Matador\\" was exhibited at auto shows, part of AMC's marketing efforts for the aerodynamically designed coupe, as well as publicity exposure for the concept of unique flying machines.  International markets Australia= First generation Rambler Matador sedan in New South Wales assembled by AMI Australian assembly of the Matador by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) started in 1971, and the model was discontinued after 1977. The AMI cars were marketed as the Rambler Matador. AMI also acted as the State distributor for Victoria. Sales for New South Wales were managed by Sydney company Grenville Motors Pty Ltd, which were also the State distributor of Rover and Land Rover. A network of Sydney and country NSW dealers were controlled by Grenville which was in direct communication with AMI. Australian Capital Territory sales were managed by Betterview Pty Ltd in Canberra. Annand & Thompson Pty Ltd in Brisbane distributed Rambler vehicles for Queensland. South Australian sales were managed by Champions Pty Ltd in Adelaide. Premier Motors Pty Ltd in Perth distributed Ramblers for Western Australia, and Heathco Motors in Launceston distributed Rambler vehicles for Tasmania. Knock-down kits for right-hand drive models were shipped from AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin factory for assembly in AMI's facilities in Port Melbourne, Victoria. AMI used the same paint codes for the Matadors as the Toyota and Triumph vehicles they also assembled. These paint codes did not correspond to the AMC paint codes and thus Australian Matador colors are unique. All exterior model year changes otherwise corresponded to those of U.S. production. However, Australian production of each model was carried through to the following year, and the final first-generation 1973 model was further assembled through to the end of 1975. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering, power windows, locally fitted under dash air conditioning, and an AM radio, for both sedan and wagon models. The engine was AMC's V8, following its introduction in the 1970 Rebel. Although superseded by AMC in the United States, Australian Matadors continued to be built with the heavier duty steering components used in Ramblers built with power steering up until 1967. Among the options were an exterior mounted sun visor, vinyl roof cover, tow hitch, and mud flaps. The cars were targeted at the top market segment and advertised as \\"the American luxury limousine made for Australians\\" and built for Australian conditions. In addition to the modifications needed for Australian standards and market requirements, changes included the use of \\"local content\\" sourced parts and components (such as seats, carpeting, lights, wing mirrors, heaters, and even unique \\"R\\"-logo wheel covers) that reduced the tariff added to each car. As red rear turn signals were prohibited in Australia, Matador sedans had amber lenses mounted over or behind the reversing lens of the tail light assembly and the turn signals rewired to the reverse lights, while Matador station wagons had their rear turn signals rewired into amber trailer lights that were retrofitted into the tailgate. As with its Rebel predecessor, the Matador hardtops were not marketed in Australia. AMI's two-door offering was the AMC Javelin. 1971 1971 Matador, assembled by AMI in 1972. Although RHD, the cars still had LHD windscreen wipers From late 1971, the AMI-built Matador was available in sedan and wagon body styles. (AMI had assembled the 1970 Rebel again in 1971, thereby causing the Matador's release to be a year late.) As with the previous Australian-assembled Rebel models, the AMI-assembled Matador continued to use the dash of the U.S. 1967 Rambler Ambassador first used in the right-hand-drive Ambassadors produced for the United States Postal Service in 1967, including the three-lever Weather Eye heater unit and analog clock to the left of the instrument fascia. The black, round instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were also reused. A black metal plate with a picture of a bull and a bullfighter covered the cavity to the right side of the fascia where otherwise the radio went on U.S models. An AM radio unit was instead fitted into the center of the dash, above the ashtray. Air conditioning was fitted by way of locally supplied under dash units. Seating for the 1971 model consisted of a locally-made full bench seat, in vinyl, with a fold-down center armrest for both front and rear seats and headrests for the front. Interior door panels were locally made in the style of the U.S model but with cutouts to accommodate the right-hand drive positioning of the power window controls (from the U.S AMC Ambassador), and the rear door panels came standard with ashtrays. Forward parking light/turn signals received clear lenses as opposed to amber lenses in the U.S. so that front parking lights and turn signals flashed clear. Amber side marker lenses were used for both the front and rear of the sedans, where otherwise the U.S models had red lenses for the rear. The Australian Matador also came with unique \\"R\\" logo hub caps which were locally made. The full-sized stainless steel hubcaps with the writing \\"American Motors\\" which were used in the U.S and New Zealand 1970 Rebel and U.S 1971 Matador were never available as an option in Australia. Apart from the hubcaps, externally the 1971 Australian Matador was the same as the U.S 1971 model. Unlike the U.S models, Australian Matadors came standard with power steering, power windows and continued to use the earlier steering componentry of the mid-1960s U.S Ramblers. Despite being right-hand drive cars Australian Matadors retained the left-hand-drive windscreen wiper assembly (left-hand sweep.) A total of 69 Matador sedans and 64 station wagons (including some 1970 Rebel station wagons reassembled in 1971) were sold in Australia in 1971. 1972 Australian 1972 Rambler Matador. 1972 models were also assembled into 1973 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1971 model into 1972 marketing it as a \\"1972\\" model. The actual U.S 1972 Matador was assembled by AMI from late 1972. As with the U.S model, the Australian 1972 model came with the new Torqueflite 727 transmission and the new-for-1972 external style changes. The black instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were again reused in the RHD 1967 Ambassador dash. The revised armrests of the U.S 1972 model were consistent with the Australian 1972 model. The front bench seats were again locally made with individually reclinable driver and passenger seatbacks and a fold-down middle armrest. The rear seat was the same as the 1971 Australian model. The same door panels from the 1971 model were reused and again made locally, also allowing for the RHD power window controls. In order to comply with Australian Design Rules regarding not allowing red rear turn signals, an orange serrated plastic cut-out was glued inside the reverse light lens of the tail light assembly for the sedans, and the reverse lights re-wired as flashers. Station wagons received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tailgate and wired as turn signals. Clear forward park/turn signal lenses were again used. The Australian \\"R\\" hub caps were reused for the 1972 model. Power windows, power aerial, under dash air conditioning, and earlier Rambler steering componentry remained standard. 300 Matadors (236 sedans, 64 wagons) were sold in 1972, most being U.S. 1971 models. 1973 The U.S 1972 model was further assembled in 1973 and sold as a \\"1973\\" model. The U.S 1973 model was assembled by AMI starting in late 1973. Externally the Australian 1973 model was identical to the U.S 1973 model, with the same grill and taillight changes. Again the models were built with the earlier Rambler heavier duty steering components and heavy-duty suspension. AMI boasted the new model's 11.4% increase in brake horsepower and a 3.5% increase in torque, despite a slew of anti-pollution equipment. A four-barrel carburetor replaced the two-barrel carburetor used up until this time. For amber rear flashers, AMI fitted an orange serrated plastic cut-out over the clear reverse lens of the tail light lens assembly and once again re-wired the reverse lights as the turn signals. Station wagons again received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tailgate and wired as turn signals. For 1973 AMI dispensed with the transparent parking light/turn signal lenses, but instead of simply using the standard U.S amber lens, they fitted an off-the-shelf, notably ill- fitting, rectangular amber trailer lens in each light cavity to make the lights flash amber. From 1973 Matadors were fitted with Australian-made front split-bench seats in vinyl, each with their own fold-down armrest and headrests. The new headrests were not so \\"chunky\\" as the 1971 and 1972 models. The rear bench seat remained the same. The locally-made door panels first used in the Australian 1971 model were again reused. A slight change to the dash was done from the 1973 model onwards, in that the 1967 Ambassador \\"flat\\" passenger dash pad was replaced with a more protruding dash pad that ran flush with the instrument cluster binnacle and without the speaker. For sound, speakers were instead fitted into both front door cards. Otherwise, the dash was the same as previous models but new for 1973 was the introduction of the white-backed instrument cluster of the U.S 1972/1973 Matador, displaying in miles-per-hour (mph.) Power windows, power steering, under dash air conditioning, and electric aerial remained standard. For 1973, Australian sales were 230 Matadors (191 sedans, 30 wagons.) Most were U.S 1972 models. 1974 For 1974 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model again, marketing it as a \\"1974\\" model. Changes for the year included the introduction of white instrument dials (in use on the U.S models since 1972) but displaying kilometers per hour (km/h.) The left-hand-drive wiper assembly was finally re- engineered locally to a right-hand-drive sweep. The horn pad and steering wheel of the U.S 1973 Matador (without \\"bullseye\\" logo) was replaced with the slightly smaller steering wheel and interchangeable horn pad of the AMC Hornet (with the \\"AMC\\" logo in the center.)http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/226/4361/38064680003_original.jpg?v=0 Also for 1974 three-point retractable seat belts for the front and rear were fitted, replacing the two-point sash belts. The locally-made, split-bench front seat and rear seat from the 1973 model were again reused, as were the locally-made door cards copied from the U.S 1971 model. 145 Matadors (118 sedans, 27 wagons) were sold in Australia during 1974. All were U.S 1973 models. 1975 For 1975 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model, marketing it as a \\"1975\\" model. All the standard features of the U.S 1973 model and local year-by-year changes were retained. Assembly of the revised second-generation Matador sedan and wagon released in the United States in 1974 was held off in Australia until December 1975. Registrations for 1975 were 118 Matadors (85 sedans, 33 wagons) including the first few of the second-generation models assembled at the end of 1975. 1976 1976 (U.S 1974) Australian-assembled Rambler Matador sedan AMI assembled the U.S 1974 second-generation Matador sedan and wagon through 1976 marketing it as the new \\"1976\\" model. The first few were built in December 1975. Externally it was identical to the U.S 1974 model, even using the U.S stainless steel, full-size hub caps which AMC had been using on its domestic models since the 1972 Matador. As with the previous models, the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash assembly was reused, but now with the 1974 U.S-version instrument cluster. The 1967 Ambassador Weather Eye unit, previously positioned to the left of the instrument dials for the Australian-built Rebel and first-generation Matador, was shifted to the right of the dials. The new foam-formed cluster fascia encompassed all but the levers of the Weather Eye. The Australian-made seats in use since the 1973 model and the locally-made door cards in use since the 1971 model were continued with no changes. The revised steering wheel with the rectangular horn pad of the 1974 U.S-version was used on Australian models until the end of production. All Australian second-generation Matadors continued to be powered with the AMC 360 V8 engine with automatic transmission, as with the first-generation Australian-built Matadors. From about June 1976 AMI fitted the Matador sedans with a \\"Heavy Duty Fleet Engine.\\" As explained in Rambler Automotive Technical Service sheet #157, dated November 1976, the engines came with a four-barrel carburetor and electronic ignition. There were no other engine or transmission options.https://www.shannons.com.au/club/enthusiasts/351gt/garage/1976-rambler- matador/photos/ Strangely, the bonnet latch on the second-generation Australian Matadors remained on the passenger (left) side of the cabin, whereas previous Australian Matadors had the bonnet latch on the drivers (right) side as would be expected. Under dash air conditioning, power windows, electric aerial, and the superseded 1960s steering componentry remained standard. To meet the requirement of amber rear turn indicators, an orange plastic cut-out was screwed over the clear reverse lens of the tail light assembly and the turn signals rewired to the reverse lights. As Australian number plates were larger than U.S plates a wider sheet of folded steel needed to be welded to the rear of the number plate area so as to be able to fit the larger plates. Registrations in 1976 were 88 Matadors (78 sedans, 10 wagons), 1977 A small number of Matadors which were assembled in December 1976 were registered in 1977. Registrations for 1977 were 27 Matadors (24 sedans and 3 wagons.) Matador Coupe Rambler Matador X Coupe assembled by AMI Australian Matador X Coupe. Generic orange lenses replaced the original red lenses for the turn signals A fully imported AMC Matador X Coupe was presented at the Melbourne International Motor Show in 1974 to gauge interest. The evaluation car was converted from left-hand-drive to right-hand-drive by an outside company for the show. AMI dealers announced that there would only be 80 assembled. One media outlet reporting on the show stated that \\"As an indication that U.S cars are now very passe, most showgoers drifted by with hardly a glance for the car, preferring to paw over the bread-and-butter Toyota range.\\" Other media reports were more positive stating that they expected the model to sell out quickly. Although AMI received 160 knock-down kits for the all-new Matador Coupe in 1974, AMI did not assemble them until late 1976, and by that time 70 were intentionally destroyed leaving 80 still able to be assembled, with another 10 held as parts. Priced at $11,986.00 the model was marketed through 1977, sold for the one year only.'Not for Everyone' ‚Äì The Canberra Times, 22 March 1977 URL: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110729603 Retrieved 4 January 2020 Australian models came with AMC's 360 cu-in V-8 with three-speed automatic transmission, the U.S Matador X sports steering wheel, and bucket seats. Air conditioning, electric antenna, and AM-FM radio were all standard. Because of the low production numbers (under 100) AMI were able to avoid having to re- engineer the left-hand drive wiper sweep to right-hand drive as they had done on the Matador sedans and wagons after 1974. All Australian models were badged as the sportier Matador X. As with all factory RHD export and kit-assembled RHD Rebel and Matador sedans and wagons, the Australian Matador coupe used the dash of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador, although the instrument dials, center column, and steering wheel were from the U.S. 1974 model. Again, to satisfy Australian design rules, the red rear turn signal lenses were replaced with an off-the-shelf round orange lens replacing the inner tail light and rewired to flash amber, leaving the outer lens as tail light and brake light. = Costa Rica = Purdy Motor in San Jose assembled Matadors in Costa Rica from Knock- down kits. Purdy Motor had acquired the franchise rights to market American Motors vehicles in 1959 and had imported complete cars to Costa Rica, but it was not until 1964 that Costa Rican laws permitted the local assembly of vehicles. Purdy Motor built an assembly plant in 1965 and the first locally manufactured Rambler was a 1964 Rambler Classic 660 which came off the line in late 1965. The all-new 1967 Rebel was assembled to production end, followed by the Matador from 1971. In 1974 a new local vehicle manufacturer, Motorizada de Costa Rica, purchased the rights of Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motor. Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands until 1978. Motorizada was liquidated in 1979 allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the AMC brand in Costa Rica. As with other export markets, the Matador was marketed in Costa Rica under the Rambler marque even after the marque was retired by AMC in its home market after 1969. =Mexico= Matadors were built by Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) in Mexico. First generation1971= Continuing the concept of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only available as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, gross at 4,600 rpm I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-in heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote- controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap. =1972= For 1972, all VAM cars received the same revisions and improvements of the AMC models. The Classic line saw upgrades in the replacement of the six in favor of the with gross at 4,400 rpm with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor, 9.5 compression ratio, and 266 degree camshaft. Power brakes with front disks became standard equipment regardless of transmission, a Chrysler A998 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the older Borg-Warner automatics, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, improved heater with revised controls placed to the right of the steering column, and new two-round-pod instrument cluster. New wheel cover and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior, while seat patterns and side panels were also updated. Since its redesign in 1970, the hardtop body style started to drop in sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM did not want to drop it thereby leaving the company without a mid-sized two-door offering. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus for 1972, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car. This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name \\"Rambler\\" removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment (also shared with the Rebel Machine), individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright trim for pedals, heater, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote-controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high level of equipment, the public saw it as the previous model. In reality, the only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations. The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Matador Machine sold in the U.S. and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador/Rebel model produced in Mexico. =1973= Because of the low sales of the Classic Brougham hardtop, the Classic DPL four-door sedan became the only Matador version produced by VAM for 1973, with Javelin being the largest two- door model offered by the company. The 1973 Classic DPLs were virtually the same to their previous year's counterparts with differences only in seat and side panel designs as well as the grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers. Second generation1974= The generational change that AMC Matadors received for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio. Matador Coupe The biggest news of the year was the arrival or a new two-door model, AMC's Matador coupe. Unlike all previous (Matador and Rebel) models, it was available in two different trim levels; the sporty Classic AMX equivalent to the AMC Matador X model and the luxury Classic Brougham equivalent to the AMC Matador Brougham coupe model. Both versions were mechanically the same, carrying the same technical specifications as the Classic DPL models. Their main differences relied on appearance and standard features. The Classic AMX sported VAM's in-house five-spoke wheels with volcano center caps and trim rings, a blacked-out grille, and a rally stripe surrounding the full length of the car with an integrated AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid; the Classic Brougham had a standard vinyl roof cover with its respective moldings, wheel covers (new design for the year), standard grille and \\"Brougham\\" emblems over the C-pillar bases. The Classic AMX showcased a three- spoke sports steering wheel, high-back fold-down individual bucket seats, a center console with locking compartment, floor-mounted gearshift, and AM/FM radio. Despite the sportiness of the model, intended to take the place of the Javelin as VAM's top-of-the-line performance model as well as the image and enthusiast builder, the side armrests were the standard designs used in the Matador base models of the U.S. On the other hand, the Classic Brougham sported a custom sports steering wheel and column-mounted shifter with a fold- down split-back bench seat and AM radio. Unlike the Classic DPL, both the Classic AMX and the Classic Brougham included automatic transmission, power steering, and heater as standard equipment. A unique characteristic of the 1974 VAM Classic AMX was the shifter because it was the Javelin's \\"aircraft\\" U-shaped design. =1975= For 1975, changes in all three versions were few. The Classic DPL obtained the new one-piece grille design with rectangular parking lights, in accordance with the US-versions, alongside new seats and door panels. The luxury steering wheel obtained a new design for the both Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham. Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC's full-length X-model side armrests; the panels of the sports version also carried an etched \\"AMX\\" emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door. The Classic AMX also featured AMC's X-model floor- mounted shifter design. All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition, a vacuum gauge in place of the electric clock, a I6 with a lower 7.7:1 compression ratio, and Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The rear differential gear ratio was changed to 3.31:1 for both transmissions. =1976= Additional changes were incorporated for the 1976 model year. The Classic DPL and Brougham featured a new design for wheel covers. Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided into two portions with squared parking lights. The Classic AMX had a new and more discreet side decal covering only the front fenders and a new metal \\"AMX\\" emblem on the trunk lid corner. All three versions shared a new 160 km/h speedometer, tinted windshield, and seat designs that were based on AMC's Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes. These were color-keyed with the rest of the interior, the most unusual ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and reclining mechanism. This is the only case of a VAM car that came close to the various U.S. AMC designer cars. The Classic line was discontinued in the middle of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to the Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition. VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model. Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer, and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets). =Norway= Matadors were imported into Norway during the 1970s by Norwegian importer Kolberg & Caspary AS located at √Ös, Norway. Kolberg & Caspary was formed in 1906 and imported automotive, industrial, and construction products. Matadors, Javelins, and Hornets were sold by Gavas Motors AS in Oslo and Hasco Motors AS in Drammen. =United Kingdom= The Rambler name was used on right hand drive Matador models sold in the UK. Matador sedans were available through Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Limited in Chiswick, West London alongside the Ambassador hardtop and station wagon, and Javelin. With the exception of the Javelin, Matadors, and Ambassadors were exported from Kenosha with factory right-hand drive, as had been with the prior Rebel and Ambassador models brought into the U.K. Unlike the Knock-down kits used for Australian assembly which continued to use the RHD version of the 1967 Ambassador dash, cluster, and Weather Eye (albeit to the right of the cluster for the second generation models) U.K. second-generation Matadors were factory-built with the temperature controls of the US-versions (positioned underneath and to the left of the instrument dials.) U.K. models also received a locally built and fitted \\"walnut burr\\" fascia that replaced the AMC black plastic cluster surround, as had been the practice for previous U.K.-market Rebels and Ambassadors. The final 1977 models for the U.K. market were regular LHD versions.  End of the line  During the late 1970s, the domestic automobile market was moving to smaller cars. The large-sized Matador was no longer attractive to customers demanding more economical cars as fuel and money became increasingly worrisome problems after the 1973 oil crisis and the continuing double-digit domestic inflation. Lacking the financial resources for a full redesign, AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, around the same time as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The downsized 1977 Chevrolet Impala also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler. American Motors responded to the declining demand for large cars by introducing a new nameplate in 1978, the AMC Concord. The Concord was an upmarket restyling and positioning of the compact AMC Hornet that had the same wheelbase as the redesigned intermediate 1978 Chevrolet Malibu. It was presented as combining an \\"easy-to-handle size with a roomy sumptuous interior\\" and in contrast to the Matador coupe, the \\"overall styling was pleasant ... would not offend anyone\\" This was the first full-line of economical, compact-sized cars with luxurious trim, features, and comfort levels previously available only in larger automobiles. American Motors did not have another large car until the Eagle Premier that was developed with Renault's partnership and introduced to the marketplace following the purchase of AMC by Chrysler in 1987.  Collectability  1974 AMC Matador X Coupe at a classic car show in Daytona Beach, Florida While well-restored examples of Matador sedans can still be purchased for under US$3,000, ads have been published asking over US$10,000 for restored coupes. In Australia, a \\"survivor\\" or restored Matador sedan can fetch between AU$10,000‚Äì14,000. Hemmings Classic Car magazine listed the 1974‚Äì78 Matador Coupe as one of their 19 pieces of rolling proof that the old-car hobby need not be expensive and described the Coupe as \\"possibly one of the most distinctive shapes to come out of the 1970s, and arguably a style pinnacle for the personal luxury movement\\", the James Bond movie role, as well as its NASCAR history. The 1991 Esquire article \\"Cool Cars Nobody Wants\\" describes the 1974‚Äì75 AMC Matadors as a collectable, stating: \\"long considered the automaker to geeks, American Motors began its slow decline, we believe, when the liberal do-gooders who made up its core market began earning enough money to buy Scandinavian cars.\\" In 2014, Hagerty collector insurance listed the Adam 12 AMC Matador as their number one \\"favorite full-size, rear-wheel-drive American cop cars from 60 years of the best cop shows.\\"  References  Further reading   * *  External links  * AMC Matador on fastmusclecar.com * The Coupe Coop, a website dedicated to the Matador coupe * (Archived) MatadorSedan.com * (Archived) Vintage LAPD Matador * (Archived) AMC Police Car Registry * (Archived 2009‚Äì10‚Äì24) Matador racing history * * AMC Rambler Club ‚Äî Club for 1954 ‚Äì 1988 AMCs. * American Motors Owners ‚Äî Club for 1958 ‚Äì 1988 AMCs.

It is administered by Japan with a total shoal area of and land area . Its dry land area is mostly made up by three concrete encasings and there is a stilt platform in the lagoon housing a research station. There is a third complete artificial tetrapod-cement islet. It is located on the Palau‚ÄìKyushu Ridge in the Philippine Sea, southeast of Okidait≈çjima and west- southwest of South Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands or south of Tokyo, Japan. The atoll is the southernmost part of Japan and the only Japanese territory in the tropics. Japan claims the atoll is significant enough for Japan to have a 200 nautical mile (370.4 km) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the atoll, but China, South Korea, and Taiwan dispute the Japanese EEZ, saying that the atoll does not meet the definition of an island under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Etymology The English meaning of the name is \\"remote bird islands\\". The atoll has multiple designations in English (Okinotori coral reefs, Okinotori Islands). Its original name was Parece Vela, Spanish for \\"it looks like a sail\\" (alluding to the original appearance of the reef). This name has been retained in English as well, especially to designate the geological formations of the islets. History It was possibly first sighted by the Spanish sailor Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, certainly by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in 1565, and its first recorded name was Parece Vela (\\"looks like a sail\\" in Spanish). In 1789, William Douglas arrived with the British ship Iphigenia and, in 1790, the place was named Douglas Reef (also spelled Douglass Reef).Yukie Yoshikawa. 2005. \\"Okinotorishima: Just the Tip of the Iceberg\\". Harvard Asian Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 4. The existence of the atoll might not have been known by the Japanese until 1888. In 1922 and 1925, the Japanese navy ship Manshu investigated the area. In 1931, confirming that no other countries had claimed the reefs, Japan declared it Japanese territory, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Metropolis, classifying it as part of the Ogasawara Village, and naming it Okinotorishima. During 1939 and 1941, a foundation was completed for \\"a lighthouse and a meteorological observation site\\" but construction was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. After Japan's defeat, the United States assumed sovereignty over the Ogasawara islands, and returned authority over the islands to Japan in 1968. Between 1987 and 1993 the government of Tokyo and later the central government built steel breakwaters and concrete walls to stop the erosion of Okinotorishima, which today leaves only three of the five rocks that were present in 1939 above water; in 1988 the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center built a marine investigation facility which it has since maintained following typhoon damage. Funding for full repairs was finally allocated in early 2016. The facility also doubles as an EEZ observation post for the Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, being equipped with radar and various other sensors to help monitor activity in the zone. On March 16, 2007, a light beacon was installed by the Japan Coast Guard. The beacon is plotted on the hydrographic chart. Geology Location of Okinotorishima and details of the island Geologically, the islets are a coral atoll, built on the Kyushu‚ÄìPalau Ridge, the westernmost part of the Izu‚ÄìBonin‚ÄìMariana Arc system. The name \\"Parece Vela\\" has been given to the extinct back-arc basin that lies immediately to the east (the northern half of this back-arc basin is known as the Shikoku Basin). This back-arc basin was formed by seafloor spreading between the late Oligocene and Miocene. The Parece Vela Basin contains the longest megamullion in the world. The original Spanish name of the islets is normally used for the geological formations, hence, Parece Vela megamullion, Parece Vela ridge, Parece Vela rift or Parece Vela basin. The waters around the reefs are potentially rich in oil and other mineral and fisheries resources and it lies in an area of potential military significance. At high tide, one area of the reefs is , roughly the size of a twin bed, and pokes just out of the ocean. The other is , the size of a small bedroom, and rises , about twice as high. The entire reef consists of approximately , most of which is submerged even at low tide. The area has three tiny individual islets: *Higashi-Kojima (Êù±Â∞èÂ≥∂, \\"Eastern Islet\\") *Kita-Kojima (ÂåóÂ∞èÂ≥∂, \\"Northern Islet\\"), nevertheless rather in the \\"West\\" *Minami-Kojima (ÂçóÂ∞èÂ≥∂, \\"Southern Islet\\") Satellite Image Minami-Kojima is a completely artificial islet created in shallow water. But also the two original islets appear completely artificial today, with little if any trace of the two natural rocks that still appear on photographs of 1987. In 1925, there were still five above-water rocks, which have eroded since. A report from 1947 mentions five above-water rocks. Three smaller ones were on the west side, nearly impossible to see from seaward because of the breaking waves. The larger rocks on the southwest side and on the northeast side, possibly Kita- Kojima and Higashi-Kojima, were reported to be high, respectively. The original rocks appeared barren, obviously without any terrestrial vegetation. The current artificial dry land areas with their concrete surfaces appear unfit to support terrestrial vegetation either. After concrete encasing, each of the islets appears as a circle with a diameter of 60 meters (196 ft) on detailed satellite images, which would correspond to a land area‚Äîalbeit mostly artificial‚Äîof per islet, or in total. In addition, there is a platform on stilts in the shallow part of the lagoon east-northeast of the southern islet, built by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center in 1988, which appears as a rectangle of . The platform has a helicopter landing pad and a large three-story building with a marine investigation facility and a meteorological station. The rocks are in the western part of a lagoon surrounded by a submerged coral reef, over which the waves break, and that extends east-west and north-south, with an area of roughly 5 km2 within the rim of the reef. The lagoon is 3 to 4.6 meters deep, but there are numerous coral heads of lesser depths throughout the area. The fringing reef of the atoll is pear-shaped in an east‚Äìwest direction with its greatest width at the eastern end. There is a small boat channel into the lagoon in the southwest, about wide and deep, southeast of the artificial islet. Administration Administratively, the island is considered part of Ogasawara village, Tokyo.Onishi, Norimitsu. \\"Japan and China Dispute a Pacific Islet\\", The New York Times. July 10, 2005. In 1939, the construction of a naval base was started by Japan, but suspended in 1941, at the start of the Pacific War. Typhoons are constant threats to Okinotori's existence. In the 1970s there were about five or six visible protrusions, but by 1989, only two were visible. In order to prevent the island from submersion caused by erosion and maintain its claim to the EEZ, the Japanese government launched an embankment building project in 1987, and Higashikojima and Kitakojima were surrounded by concrete. Japan has encased the reefs with $280 million worth of concrete and covered the smaller one with a $50 million titanium net to shield it from debris thrown up by the ocean's waves. The Japanese government has spent over $600 million fortifying the reefs to prevent them from being completely washed away. Furthermore, the Nippon Foundation has drawn plans to build a lighthouse and increase the size of the reef by breeding microorganisms known as foraminifera. Creating land using the microorganisms could take decades to a century before the island is large enough to be useful.Martin Fackler. 2005, February 20. \\"Japan's ultranationalists: Stuck between a rock and a hard sell\\" Currently, Japan carries out maritime research and observation of the area, as well as repair work on the embankment. In 2005, the government installed a radar system (at the cost of ¬• 330 million), repaired a heliport, and placed an official address plaque saying, \\"1 Okinotori Island, Ogasawara Village, Tokyo\\" in Japanese. Fishing expeditions also support the claim of economic activity. Former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara has talked of building a power station, despite protests by environmentalists. His government has helped fund expeditions to Okinotori by Japanese fishermen and scientists. Governor Ishihara himself toured the islands on May 20, 2005 to inspect the conservation and management efforts, went snorkeling to see firsthand the condition of the surrounding waters, and released Japanese horse mackerel fry to show support for the local fishing industry. The islands are an intermittent rallying point for Japanese nationalists, and, as such, a hot- button political issue in Japan. EEZ dispute Exclusive economic zone of Japan. The lowermost purple near-circle is the area around Okinotorishima On 22 April 2004, Chinese diplomats stated during bilateral talks with Japan that they regarded Okinotorishima as an atoll, not an islet, and did not acknowledge Japan's claim to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) stemming from Okinotorishima. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, an island is \\"a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide\\". It states that \\"rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone.\\" Japan signed the Convention in 1983; the Convention came into force in 1994‚Äì1996 for Japan. Japan claims an EEZ over 400,000 square km (154,500 square miles) around Okinotorishima. China and South Korea dispute this claim in their addenda to the CLCS, saying the area only consists of rocks and not islands.\\"Japan hopes to build lighthouse on atoll disputed with China\\". Xinhua. August 25, 2005. Neither China nor South Korea have territorial claims regarding Okinotorishima, but foreign policy analysts speculated that it wants to \\"investigate the surrounding seabed for submarine operations in case of military conflict involving the Republic of China (Taiwan).\\"Campion, Gilles, \\"Remote rocks at center of dispute\\", The Japan Times, AFP-JiJi, March 13, 2010, p. 3. Japan claims that rock is not defined in the convention.tp://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_kaigiroku.nsf/html/kaigiroku/001414519990416008.htm Besides, the construction of a port, lighthouse, and power station may be used as a counterargument for PRC's claim regarding \\"sustain human habitation or economic life\\". The territory lies at a militarily strategic point, midway between Taiwan and Guam, the latter where U.S. forces are based. Vessels of the PRC are believed to have been mapping the ocean's bottom over which U.S. warships might pass on their way to Taiwan. The PRC conducted four maritime surveys near the Okinotori coral reefs in 2001, two in 2002, and one in 2003. However, the number of such incidents rose to four in 2004. These incidents have drawn protests from Japan. Jon Van Dyke, a law professor, has suggested that the situation is similar to the failed British attempt to claim an EEZ around Rockall, an uninhabited granite outcropping in the Atlantic Ocean. The UK eventually dropped its claim in the 1990s when other countries objected.

It airs contemporary Christian music and identifies itself as \\"K-LOVE\\". It is a non-commercial listener supported ministry. The station is licensed to Wingate, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte. History Columbia International University, then known as Columbia Bible College, applied to the FCC for the license in 1982. Internally, this was known as The 92 FM Project. Other entities applied on top of CBC including Wingate College (now Wingate University) and a church in Waxhaw, North Carolina area. After 10 years of negotiations with the other groups, WRCM was granted the license and was signed on the air by founding general manager Ken Mayfield at 12 noon on June 14, 1993. Present at sign on were CIU president, Johnny Miller; CIU vice president John Davidson and former CIU president, Robertson C. McQuilken. (The station's call letters -RCM- were in honor of his father, Robertson C. McQuilkin, the first president of Columbia Bible College.) WRCM's first staff consisted of full-timers Ken Mayfield, the station's first general manager and afternoon personality, program director and morning host, Rodney Baucom, and Karen Wycoff, who served as mid-day announcer and secretary. Mayfield had built and managed another contemporary Christian station, WNOW and had hosted a very popular Sunday morning Contemporary Christian music program for 7 years on Charlotte's 100,000 watt WBCY (now WLNK). Part-time staff members included Shelly Mitchell and Joe Paulo. Paulo stepped into the role of general manager shortly after Mayfield departed in 1999. Former logo of New Life 91.9 WRCM garnered immediate success with a 2.4 in its first Arbitron ratings. This success was in spite of the lack of advertising. Almost all of the \\"promotion\\" for the fledgling station had to come by word of mouth and from the station staff at Christian concerts. Original plans were for WRCM to be a satellite station of Columbia Bible College's original station, WMHK. However, these plans were scrapped, and the station was largely operated and programmed separately from WMHK. However, longtime general manager Joe Paulo was named director of broadcasting at CIU after the departure of WMHK's General Manager Jerry Grimes, with oversight over both stations. Under his watch, WMHK began simulcasting WRCM's \\"Family Friendly Morning Show,\\" and the two stations both aired the syndicated \\"Scott and Sam\\" show on weeknights. Signal During its time as a local broadcaster, the station identified itself as \\"New Life 91.9, WRCM Wingate/Charlotte\\" and heavily promoted churches throughout the Charlotte metropolitan area. However, its signal is not as strong as those of the major FM stations in the Charlotte area. For most of its history, it operated at only 10,000 watts, resulting in marginal coverage even in some parts of Charlotte. In many of Charlotte's inner-ring suburbs, it could only be heard on car radios. It has since increased its power to 30,000 watts. However, it still operates from a tiny (by modern broadcasting standards) 495-foot tower near its former studios in Indian Trail. This is necessary to protect WSGE in Dallas, which is located on adjacent 91.7 FM. As a result, it still only provides grade B coverage to large parts of the market. Most Christian music fans in the western part of the market get a better signal from WMIT in Asheville. Programming Before its switch to K-LOVE, WRCM's music rotation consisted of six or seven current songs in heavy rotation and a mix of six or seven new songs and \\"classics\\" from the last two to five years in medium rotation played in a tight format, often back to back with only the station jingle separating songs from each other. New songs were chosen with the help of the listener advisory panel. The station often promoted live concerts by Contemporary Christian (CCM) musicians, and carried out its Christian mission by performing good works such as collecting donations of baby clothes to support mothers in need who might otherwise consider getting abortions. WRCM used the \\"Charlotte's Number One\\" Radio Jingle package from RadioScape until it switched to the K-LOVE programming format. Starting in 2014, WRCM was simulcast on WRZM in Boiling Springs, North Carolina. On October 6, 2014, it was announced that WRCM, along with translators WRZM, W268BU, and sister station WMHK, were being sold to EMF Broadcasting.WRCM/WMHK to Flip to K-Love, December 17, 2014 The deal closed on December 19, 2014, a day later than expected because of last-minute legal issues. General manager Joe Paulo signed the station off as a local broadcasting entity with a prayer and Chris Rice's rendition of \\"Great is Thy Faithfulness\\" at 4:32 p.m. At that point, WRCM flipped its programming to the national K-LOVE network. Paulo said that the hymn was the first song ever played on WRCM when it signed on in 1993. K-LOVE already owned WWLV in Lexington, North Carolina; which provides a fairly strong signal to the northern portion of the Charlotte market. The combined footprint of WMHK, WRCM/WLXK, WWLV, and WKVK gives K-LOVE at least secondary coverage to more than half of North and South Carolina.

GRPs help answer how often \\"must someone see it before they can readily recall it\\" and \\"how many times\\" does it take before the desired outcome occurs. Overview Gross rating points are a measure of the impact by a campaign using a specific medium or schedule. It quantifies impressions as a percentage of the target population, multiplied by frequency. This percentage may be greater, or in fact much greater, than 100. Target rating points express the same concept, but with regard to a more narrowly defined target audience.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010).

Retrieved 2013-2-11. The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. GRPs are used predominantly as a measure of media with high potential exposures or impressions. Nielsen Media Research is an example of a company which uses GRPs.Will CCPA Force Advertisers to Take Media Measurement Into Their Own Hands? Published by Broadcasting + Cable on January 7, 2020, consulted on January 9, 2020 Purpose With \\"today's fragmented media world\\" the value of GRP is, according to the Advertising Research Foundation's Journal of Advertising Research, even greater than in the pre- Internet era. Since \\"the required frequency changes with the product and the competitive climate it is in\\", the purpose of the GRP metric is to measure impressions compared to the number of people in the target for an advertising campaign. GRP values are commonly used by media buyers to compare the advertising strength of components of a media plan. With \\"today's fragmented media world\\" the value of GRP is, according to the Advertising Research Foundation's Journal of Advertising Research, even greater than in the pre- Internet era. For conventional media such as radio and TV, multi-tasking has reduced the value per GRP, and a measure named Persuasion Rating Point (PRP) was proposed in mid 2020. Construction \\"One GRP is one percent of all potential adult television viewers (or in radio, listeners) in a market.\\" If they are exposed to the ad three times, then that is 3 GRPs. GRPs are simply total impressions related to the size of the target population: They are most directly calculated by summing the ratings of individual ads in a campaign. Mathematically: ::GRPs (%) = 100 * Impressions (#) √∑ Defined population (#) ::GRPs (%) = 100 * Reach (%) √ó Average frequency (#) Two examples: * If an average of 12% of the people view each episode of a television program, and an ad is placed on 5 episodes, then the campaign has 12 √ó 5 = 60 GRPs. * If 50% view three episodes, that's 150 GRPs.

A chinois (; ) is a conical sieve with an extremely fine mesh. It is used to strain custards, purees, soups, and sauces, producing a very smooth texture. It can also be used to dust food with a fine layer of powdered ingredient.  Etymology  Chinois is a loanword from the French adjective meaning Chinese.  Description  A related utensil is the tamis ‚Äì a flat strainer through which food is pressed with a scraper or pestle. A similarly-shaped utensil is the China cap, a reference to the conical Asian hats that used to be common in China. It is a perforated metal conical strainer with much larger holes than a chinois. A China cap is used to remove seeds and other coarse matter from soft foods, but produces a coarser-textured product than the chinois. Both the chinois and the China cap often are used with a cone-shaped pestle. With the pestle tip placed in the bottom of the strainer, it is rolled against the sides of the device to work liquids and soft food through it. In this way, the chinois functions much like a tamis, and the China cap functions similar to a food mill. A small ladle can also be used instead of a pestle, allowing scooping solids from the sides of the strainer as well as pressing liquid through the mesh.

Early life  Harry Ainlay was born in Brussels, Ontario to Watson and Emily (n√©e Sparling) Ainlay, and earned his teaching certificate in that province. He came to Alberta in 1907 to help his carpenter father and settled near Stavely for several years before moving to Edmonton in 1912. In 1911, he married Edith Hammill; the two would remain married until her death in 1959. Ainlay spent several years in the real estate business, then returned to school at the University of Alberta. Upon his graduation in 1920, he returned to teaching, in the Edmonton Public Schools system. Ainlay served as vice-principal of the Queen Alexandra School and principal of the Garneau and Strathcona High School, now Old Scona Academic High Schools.  Municipal politics  While still serving as an educator, Ainlay first sought public office in the 1930 Edmonton election, when he ran for alderman on Edmonton City Council and was defeated, finishing ninth of twelve candidates. He was successful in the 1931 election, when he finished second of fifteen candidates and was elected to a two-year term. He was re-elected in the 1933 election (finishing third of seventeen candidates), but was defeated in the 1935 election. Once out of office, Ainlay made his first bid for mayor in the 1936 election, finishing third of five candidates as incumbent Joseph Clarke was re-elected. He made two subsequent unsuccessful attempts to return to aldermanic office (in the 1937 and 1938 elections) before taking three years off from municipal politics. Ainlay returned to office in the 1941 election, finishing first of fourteen candidates in the aldermanic race. He was re- elected in 1943, but resigned halfway through his two-year term to run for mayor in the 1945 election, when he defeated Winslow Hamilton. He was re- elected in the 1946 and 1947 elections, defeating Thomas Cairns and Frederick Speed, respectively. His 1947 win was notable because it marked the first election in which the mayor was elected to a two-year term. As mayor, Ainlay introduced daylight saving time in the city in 1946 after city residents voted in a plebiscite in favour of the change and after the Government of Alberta refused to bring it in province-wide. Government offices in Edmonton abided by the city's DST, although the government opposed the time change. The next session of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta passed legislation outlawing the use of daylight saving time in Alberta, and Edmonton returned to standard time until the province adopted the practice in 1971.Monto, Tom. Protest and Progress. Three Labour Radicals in Early Edmonton (Rice Sheppard, Harry Ainlay, Margaret Crang). Edmonton: Crang Publishing, 2012 (available at Alhambra Books, Edmonton) Harry Ainlay did not seek re-election in the 1949 election, due to health issues arising from a serious fall he had sustained working on his retirement home in BC.  Provincial and federal politics  Ainlay ran in provincial and federal elections a total of four times, each time under the banner of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. The first was in a 1936 by-election in the riding of Edmonton, when he finished last in a three candidate field that was won by Liberal Walter Morrish. (The other candidate, United Front candidate Margaret Crang, had been an aldermanic colleague of Ainlay's, and fellow Labour rep, when he had served on city council. Due to her running against Ainlay, she was thrown out of the CCF.) His second bid for provincial office took place in the 1940 Alberta election, in which Ainlay again ran in the Edmonton riding. He finished eighth of nineteen candidates on the first count (at the time, the riding used a single transferable vote method of electing its representatives), and was not one of the five candidates elected. Ainlay's lone bid for federal office took place in the 1945 federal election, when he ran in the riding of Edmonton East. He finished second of five candidates, ahead of incumbent Liberal MP Cora Taylor Casselman but still being defeated by Social Creditor Patrick Ashby. Ainlay repeated the experience finishing ahead of incumbent, but still losing, in his last bid for office. He had moved to British Columbia, where he ran in the 1952 provincial election in the riding of Dewdney. He finished second of four candidates, ahead of incumbent Progressive Conservative Roderick Charles MacDonald, but being defeated by Lyle Wicks of the British Columbia Social Credit League. Already more than 60 years old, this was his last bid for public office.  Post-political career, death, and legacy  After leaving politics, Ainlay was the head of the Yellowhead Route Association in the 1940s and 1950s. He died in Haney, British Columbia on March 12, 1970. He was survived by his second wife, Jean. In 1966, the newly constructed Harry Ainlay Composite High School was named in his honour. He left an endowment for a $500 scholarship to be given in his name to a graduating student planning on pursuing a career in Education.

Having confessed to strangling Alice Morgan, a 50-year-old woman who was working as a prostitute in Kingston upon Hull on 1 February 1951 after a quarrel over payment, Inglis opted to plead insanity at his trial. The jury did not believe his version of events, and on 20 April he was sentenced by Justice Ormerod to be hanged. He was gaoled at Strangeways Prison to await execution. Because Inglis did not appeal against his sentence, execution was scheduled to take place only three weeks after the trial ended (according to law, after the passage of three Sundays). On the morning of 8 May 1951, the executioner, Albert Pierrepoint and his assistant, Syd Dernley, escorted Inglis from his cell to the gallows immediately adjacent, and hanged him without delay. This was the fastest British hanging on record, taking just seven seconds from the time that Inglis was removed from his cell to the moment that the trapdoor opened. Dernley later related that Inglis practically ran to his execution, following the prison guard's advice to go quickly and \\"without fuss\\". Inglis's execution is featured in the 2006 film Pierrepoint; although Inglis's name is not mentioned, the character \\"Markovsky\\" was supposed to represent him.

Fortunately, the composer was commissioned to create his Concerto for Orchestra which was extremely well received and decreased the composer's financial difficulties. This, combined with an abatement of his medical condition, allowed for a change in the composer's general disposition. The changes in the composer's emotional and financial state are considered by a few to be the primary causes for the third piano concerto's seemingly light, airy, almost neoclassical tone, especially in comparison to Bart√≥k's earlier works.Morgan, Robert P., Twentieth-Century Music, W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., New York, pp. 179-186, [1991]Antokoletz, Elliott, The Music of B√©la Bart√≥k: A Study of Tonality and Progression in Twentieth-Century Music, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, [1984] However, while the composition of a piece as a gift (his wife Ditta P√°sztory-Bart√≥k's upcoming 42nd birthday on October 31, 1945) as opposed to a commission undoubtedly impacted the composing process, some think it more likely that the piece was instead the culmination of a trend of reduction and simplification which began almost ten years prior, with the Second Violin Concerto, and which concluded Bart√≥k's exploration of tonality and complexity.Gillies, Malcolm, \\"Final Chamber Works\\", in The Bart√≥k Companion, edited by Malcolm Gillies (Portland, Oregon: Amadeus Press, 1993), pp. 538‚Äì553. Bart√≥k died on September 26, 1945, with the concerto unfinished. The task of completing orchestration of the final 17 measures, drawing from Bart√≥k's notes, was eventually executed by the composer's friend, Tibor Serly. The Third Piano Concerto was later published in an edition by Serly and Erwin Stein, an editor for Boosey & Hawkes.Kasparov, Andrey. ‚ÄúThird Piano Concerto in the Revised 1994 Edition: Newly Discovered Corrections by the Composer.‚Äù Hungarian Music Quarterly 11, Nos. 3-4 (2000): 2-11. It was premiered in Philadelphia on February 8, 1946 under Hungarian conductor Eugene Ormandy with Gy√∂rgy S√°ndor as piano soloist. The piece has since been adapted for two pianos by M√°ty√°s Seiber. Beginning in the 1990s, the composer's son, Peter Bart√≥k, in association with Argentinian musician Nelson Dellamaggiore, worked to re-print and revise past editions of the Third Piano Concerto, to eradicate the many printed errors identified but never corrected by his father.Somfai, L√°szl√≥. B√©la Bart√≥k: Composition, Concepts, and Autograph Sources. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. Although few in actual number, changes made to the Piano Concerto affected the pitch content, pedalling and tempos of several key passages. In 1994 Andrey Kasparov was soloist with the Columbus Indiana Philharmonic (formerly Columbus Pro Musica) in the world premiere of the revised edition. According to conductor David Bowden, and Peter Bart√≥k, who was in attendance: ‚ÄúThese changes generally make the piano part more accessible or clarify questions of chordal structure....‚ÄùSluder, Claude K. ‚ÄúRevised Bart√≥k composition highlights Pro Musica concert.‚Äù The Republic 16 February 1994. The revised editions of both the two-piano reduction and the orchestral score of the Piano Concerto No. 3 are now available from Boosey & Hawkes. Music Piano Concerto No. 3 consists of three movements: which combine for an approximate duration of 23 minutes. The piece was originally scored for 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A and B (2nd doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, strings, and piano. =Allegretto= The first movement, based basically in E major, features an original Hungarian \\"folk theme,\\" similar to a nineteenth-century Hungarian verbunkos dance. The theme is first introduced by the piano. The first chord of the first movement, which consists of four pitches, E, F, A, and B, implying both E Dorian and E Mixolydian, is relatively tonal, especially when compared to the first chord of Piano Concerto No. 1. The chord develops further with the addition of C in the second bar, resulting in the pentatonic, which is followed with G, leaving a major scale short of D. Bart√≥k continues to add D to complete the Mixolydian scale, followed by G natural to suggest the Dorian mode. Finally, in bar six, Bart√≥k displays the Lydian mode through G and A. This complex melodic pattern is an example of what Bart√≥k called \\"polymodal chromaticism,\\" the rapid succession of many modes through chromatic alteration to produce a chromatic texture. =Adagio religioso= The second movement, based in C major, seems to mirror the style of a Beethoven chorale. The string introduction followed by the chorale on piano is a clear allusion to the third movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in A minor.Kov√°cs, J√°nos, \\"Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 3\\" Booklet note for Hungaroton HCD 31888-91 (2000)Whittall, Arnold, The Concerto in Modern Times: Central Europe in the Twentieth Century in A Guide to the Concerto, edited by Layton, Robert, Oxford University Press, p. 284, [1996] Bart√≥k includes a harmony related to the Tristan chord, a set of intervals from Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde referred to as the \\"characteristically sad and yearning harmony of Romanticism.\\" The final resolution of the Tristan chord comes as a C-based pentatonic mode, and as Bart√≥k was known to consider pentatony a chief characteristic of ancient Hungarian folksong, this can be considered a musical symbol of his Hungarian homeland. The middle section is in Bart√≥k's Night music style. It contains imitations of natural sounds of insect and bird calls. =Allegro vivace= The third and final movement demonstrates a joie de vivre and apparent optimism often found in Bart√≥k's final movements, though with considerably stronger folk inspiration with its apparent Hungarian folk melody and its rondo-like returning theme. It has been said that this movement \\"captures the infectious ebullient spirit of the folk song.\\"Nissman, Barbara, Bart√≥k and the Piano: A Performer's View, The Scarecrow Press, Inc., Lanham, pp. 274-283, [2002] There is also a central fugato section in almost Baroque style.

By 1972, the firm did business in 22 countries around the world and had global sales of $1.15 billion. Shifting to foreign car companies as U.S. domestic manufacturers bought production in house, by 1971 Ingersoll saw automobile transmission sales increase more than tenfold to 487,000 units in the preceding decade. Ingersoll's experience in dealing with business ventures in Japan played a major role in his choice by President Nixon as United States Ambassador to Japan in 1972, where he was only the second person who was not a career diplomat to be chosen in the period following World War II and the first businessperson to be selected. Ingersoll helped deal with differences between the nations regarding Japan's $3.5 billion trade surplus with the United States, negotiating agreements that led to Japanese imports in excess of $1 billion worth of American agricultural and manufactured products. In 1974, he was named as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and served in that post until 1976. After the Lockheed bribery scandals were disclosed to the public, Ingersoll played a lead role in the State Department's handling of the affair, which he stated had done \\"grievous damage\\" to U.S. foreign relations, with Lockheed having paid $3 million in bribes to the office of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and more than $1 million in improper payments to Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The scandal led to the downfall of governments overseas and the resignations of two senior Lockheed officials. As a trustee of the Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies, he was an active participant in the organization's programs conducted in Colorado, where he participated in discussions with labor officials, politicians and religious leaders on major issues facing society in addition to skiing.

C. BrƒÉtianu, was a Romanian politician who led the National Liberal Party (PNL) starting in 1934. LifeEarly career= Born at the estate of Florica, in »òtefƒÉne»ôti, Arge»ô County, he was the son of the great Romanian statesman Ion BrƒÉtianu, and the brother of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu and VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu. He studied engineering at the Bucharest Polytechnic and at the √âcole des mines in Paris. Although first elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Romania in 1895 (and was elected without interruption between 1910 and 1938), he held no governmental position until 1933-1934 (when he was Minister of Finance). =Under Carol and Antonescu= After the assassination of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca by the Iron Guard (December 1933), he became head of the PNL. During the inter-war period, he became active in opposing the authoritarian regime of King Carol II and his Prime Minister Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu. After Carol's abdication and the fascist regime known as the National Legionary State, BrƒÉtianu offered his support to dictator Ion Antonescu, given that the latter's close relation with Nazi Germany had helped Romania win back territories it had lost to the Soviet Union (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region), taken back through World War II's Operation Barbarossa. The heavy losses inflicted on the Romanian troops and the successful offensives of the Red Army made BrƒÉtianu favor King Michael's plan to align Romania with the Allies. =Post-1945= After the August 23, 1944 Royal Coup, he was Minister without portfolio in two successive cabinets of Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu. As leader of the PNL, he was unable to slow down the accession of Romanian Communist Party to power, as the appeal of the party had suffered major blows due to BrƒÉtianu's sympathy towards Antonescu. He sought to oppose the communists by protesting to the American and British diplomats from Bucharest. Cortlandt Van Rensselaer Schuyler, the American general, portrayed the man who was supposed to fight communists: \\"Generally, Mr. BrƒÉtianu has disappointed me as a political leader\\", Schuyler wrote in 1945. \\"He is almost 80 and seems to be wasting his energy. Although he is very unhappy about the actual state of things, he has not offered a constructive programme for recovery, aside from a general opposition to what he calls the exorbitant and unjust demands set by Russia\\". He refused to be part of the communist cabinet formed by Petru Groza on March 6, 1945. Arrested and imprisoned without trial, he died in 1950, probably in Sighet prison.

It is present in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malesia as a naturalized species. The tree is considered to be sacred by Hindus.  Botanical information Phylogeny and anatomy= Bili tree Bael is the only member of the monotypic genus Aegle. It is a deciduous shrub or small to medium-sized tree, up to 13 m tall with slender drooping branches and rather shabby crown. = Bark = The bark is pale brown or grayish, smooth or finely fissured and flaking, armed with long straight spines, 1.2‚Äì2.5 cm singly or in pairs, often with slimy sap oozing out from cut parts. The gum is also described as a clear, gummy sap, resembling gum arabic, which exudes from wounded branches and hangs down in long strands, becoming gradually solid. It is sweet at first taste and then irritating to the throat. = Leaf = The leaf is trifoliate, alternate, each leaflet 5-14 x 2‚Äì6 cm, ovate with tapering or pointed tip and rounded base, untoothed or with shallow rounded teeth. Young leaves are pale green or pinkish, finely hairy while mature leaves are dark green and completely smooth. Each leaf has 4‚Äì12 pairs of side veins which are joined at the margin. = Flower = The flowers are 1.5 to 2 cm, pale green or yellowish, sweetly scented, bisexual, in short drooping unbranched clusters at the end of twigs and leaf axils. They usually appear with young leaves. The calyx is flat with 4(5) small teeth. The four or five petals of 6‚Äì8 mm overlap in the bud. Many stamens have short filaments and pale brown, short style anthers. The ovary is bright green with an inconspicuous disc. = Fruit = A ripe bael fruit, India Bael fruit The bael fruit typically has a diameter of between 5 and 12 cm. It is globose or slightly pear-shaped with a thick, hard rind and does not split upon ripening. The woody shell is smooth and green, gray until it is fully ripe when it turns yellow. Inside are 8 to 15 or 20 sections filled with aromatic orange pulp, each section with 6 (8) to 10 (15) flattened-oblong seeds each about 1 cm long, bearing woolly hairs and each enclosed in a sac of adhesive, transparent mucilage that solidifies on drying. The exact number of seeds varies in different publications. It takes about 11 months to ripen on the tree and can reach the size of a large grapefruit or pomelo, and some are even larger. The shell is so hard it must be cracked with a hammer or machete. The fibrous yellow pulp is very aromatic. It has been described as tasting of marmalade and smelling of roses. Boning (2006) indicates that the flavor is \\"sweet, aromatic and pleasant, although tangy and slightly astringent in some varieties. It resembles a marmalade made, in part, with citrus and, in part, with tamarind.\\" Numerous hairy seeds are encapsulated in a slimy mucilage. =Range and ecology= Aegle marmelos plant Aegle marmelos is native across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and is cultivated throughout Sri Lanka, Tamilnadu, Thailand, and Malesia. It occurs in dry, open forests on hills and plains at altitudes from with mean annual rainfall of . It has a reputation in India for being able to grow in places that other trees cannot. It copes with a wide range of soil conditions (pH range 5-10), is tolerant of waterlogging and has an unusually wide temperature tolerance from . It requires a pronounced dry season to give fruit. The tree is a larval food plant for the following two Indian Swallowtail butterflies, the Lime butterfly Papilio demoleus, and the Common Mormon: Papilio polytes. As food  The fruits can be eaten either fresh from trees or after being dried and produced into candy, toffee, pulp powder or nectar. If fresh, the juice is strained and sweetened to make a drink similar to lemonade. It can be made into sharbat, also called as Bela pana, a beverage. Bela Pana made in Odisha has fresh cheese, milk, water, fruit pulp, sugar, crushed black pepper, and ice. B√¶l pana, a drink made of the pulp with water, sugar, and citron juice, is mixed, left to stand a few hours, strained, and put on ice. One large bael fruit may yield five or six liters of sharbat. If the fruit is to be dried, it is usually sliced and sun-dried. The hard leathery slices are then immersed in water. The leaves and small shoots are eaten as salad greens. Bael fruits are of dietary use and the fruit pulp is used to prepare delicacies like murabba, puddings and juices. Traditional medicine The leaves, bark, roots, fruits, and seeds are used in traditional medicine to treat various illnesses, although there is no clinical evidence that these methods are safe or effective.  Chemical compounds  The bael tree contains furocoumarins, including xanthotoxol and the methyl ester of alloimperatorin, as well as flavonoids, rutin and marmesin; a number of essential oils; and, among its alkaloids, √°-fargarine(=allocryptopine), O-isopentenylhalfordinol, O-methylhafordinol. Aegeline (N-[2-hydroxy-2(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide) is a constituent that can be extracted from bael leaves. Aeglemarmelosine, molecular formula C16H15NO2 [Œ±]27D+7.89¬∞ (c 0.20, CHCl3), has been isolated as an orange viscous oil. Aegeline and liver injury Aegeline is a known constituent of the bael leaf and consumed as a dietary supplement with the intent to produce weight loss. In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Defense Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, and Hawaii state and local health officials identified an outbreak of 97 persons with acute non-viral hepatitis that first emerged in Hawaii. Seventy-two of these persons had reported using the dietary supplement containing aegeline, called OxyElite Pro which was manufactured by the Dallas company, USPlabs. FDA had previously taken action against an earlier formulation of OxyElite Pro because it contained dimethylamylamine, a stimulant that FDA had determined to be an adulterant when included in dietary supplements and could cause high blood pressure and lead to heart attacks, seizures, psychiatric disorders, and death. USPlabs subsequently reformulated this product without informing FDA or submitting the required safety data for a new dietary ingredient. Doctors at the Liver Center at The Queen's Medical Center investigating the first cases in Hawaii reported that between May and September 2013, eight previously healthy individuals presented themselves at their center suffering from a drug-induced liver injury. All of these patients had been using the reformulated OxyElite Pro, which they had purchased from different sources, and which had different lot numbers and expiration dates, at doses within the manufacturer's recommendation. Three of these patients developed fulminant liver failure, two underwent urgent liver transplantation, and one died. The number of such cases would ultimately rise to 44 in Hawaii. In January 2014, leaders from the Queen's Liver Center informed state lawmakers that they were almost certain that aegeline was the agent responsible for these cases, but the mechanism of how aegeline may damage the liver has not been isolated. Religious beliefs Bael leaves used in the worship of a lingam - the icon of Shiva Bael is used in the ritual rites of Hindus. Bael is considered as one of the sacred trees of Hindus. Earliest evidence of religious importance of bael appears in Shri Shuktam of Rig Veda which reveres this plant as the residence of goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. Bael trees are considered an incarnation of goddess Sati. Bael trees can be usually seen near the Hindu temples and their home gardens. It is believed that Hindu deity Lord Shiva is fond of bael trees and its leaves and fruit still play a main role in his worship. In the traditional practice of the Hindu and Buddhist religions by people of the Newar culture of Nepal, the bael tree is part of a fertility ritual for girls known as the Bel Bibaaha. Girls are \\"married\\" to the bael fruit; as long as the fruit is kept safe and never cracks, the girl can never become widowed, even if her human husband dies. This is a ritual that guarantees the high status of widows in the Newar community compared to other women in Nepal.

The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry, civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event), vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, register, registry office (officially register office), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. The United Nations General Assembly in 1979 adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Article 16 of which requires countries to establish compulsory civil registration of marriages. Most countries have a legal requirement for relevant authority to be notified of certain life events, such as births, marriages and deaths. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was France in 1539, using the registers of the Catholic Church. Sweden followed in 1631, on the basis of a register drawn up by the Church of Sweden on behalf of the Swedish king. The United Nations defines civil registration as \\"the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through decree or regulation in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents required by law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential to ensure the quality of vital statistics.\\" Vital events that are typically recorded on the register include live birth, death, foetal death, name, change of name, marriage, divorce, annulment of marriage, judicial separation of marriage, adoption, legitimization and recognition. Among the legal documents that are derived from civil registration are birth certificates, death certificates, and marriage certificates. A family register is a type of civil register which is more concerned with events within the family unit and is common in Continental European and Asian countries, such as Germany ('), France, Spain, China (Hukou), Japan (Koseki), and North and South Korea (Hoju). Additionally, in some countries, immigration, emigration, and any change of residence may require notification. A register of residents is a type of civil register primarily concerned with the current residence.  Challenges  Civil registration is faced with many challenges, both on the demand side and supply side, especially in low income countries. The demand-side challenges include a lack of awareness of the need and importance of registration of vital events, and the situation is not helped by the many existing barriers to registration. For example, in 2009, the World Health Statistics of WHO estimated that only about 1% of the estimated deaths in low income groups are reported and just about 9% in lower-middle income groups. The registration systems in many cases are very difficult, causing potential barriers to accessing the registration. Furthermore, in certain societies, due to stigmatisation based on cultural and religious settings, single mothers may fear questions of paternity during notification through chief or community agents. On the supply side, challenges often involve different, and often conflicting, legal frameworks various stakeholders (health institution, civil registry, statistics agency), and as a result, many countries with \\"burdensome procedures and non-standardized systems across a country, leading to confusion regarding what individuals need to do or present.\\" Other challenges include accessibility of remote areas and also irregular migration caused by civil conflicts and porous borders.  Innovations  There have been new developments in civil registration across the globe over the years. With the advent of enhanced and information and communication technology, civil registration has been moving from a paper- intensive, manual-based civil registration to more automated and digitalised systems. Some of the innovations implemented in civil registration include the use of e-birth notification systems, whereby the health officials are able to notify the national population registration system with new births. This system improve registration process, by timely feeding the system with information as soon as a birth occurs. Another innovation, such as that implemented by iCivil Africa in Burkina Faso, is the use of a mobile application to register newborns .  Africa  Namibia = In Namibia, Civil registration mandate lies with the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration, which has offices in all fourteen region of the country. Although some vital events (e.g., marriages) are recorded by various agencies (e.g., church and courts), vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the department of Civil Registration within the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration. In Namibia, civil registration and identity management systems are integrated and managed by one department. Over the years, Namibia has transformed its civil registration processes, moving away from the manual system to electronic system. In 2017, Namibia, which has at least 22 birth and registration offices based within the maternity wards of hospitals across the country, launched its e-birth notification system. This improvement is expected to \\"improve the quality of vital statistics produced in the country. The system is also a welcome departure from the present mechanism of relying on surveys for estimations of birth registration rates and projections of the numbers of births each year.\\" = South Africa = In South Africa, vital records are contained in the National Population Register, which is maintained by the national Department of Home Affairs. Any Home Affairs office can record a vital event or issue a certified copy of a vital record. = Burkina Faso = In Burkina Faso, since 2015, a centralized CRVS (civil registration and vital statistics) system is being implemented by the non-governmental organization iCivil Africa. This \\"new tech start up has set themselves a massive task: to register all newborn babies digitally\\".  Europe  France = France was the first country to create a national Registration. In 1539, King Francis I ordered in the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter√™ts, as part of a wider legislation regarding the policing of church benefices, to keep vital records registers in the various church local institutions (mainly parishes). The ordinance orderer the creation of at least a register of baptisms, as a proof of one's date of birth, and a register of burials of churchmen, as a proof of one's date of death. Though both registers were kept by religious authorities, they were authenticated by a public notary, always a layman, and were kept in the local royal administration's archives. In fact, as the church kept parish registers since the Middle Ages (the oldest one in France is Giry's, of 1303), these registers were used to meet the ordinance's dispositions.Delsalle, Paul (2009). Histoires de familles: les registres paroissiaux et d'√©tat civil, du Moyen √Çge √† nos jours : d√©mographie et g√©n√©alogie. Besan√ßon: Presses universitaires de Franche-Comt√©. p. 32 The national registration was fully laicized in 1792 during the French Revolution by order of the French Republic. These records have been continued through the present and are kept at the departmental archives. The Civil Registration includes birth, marriage, divorce, and death records. =Germany= Iceland = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, maintaining the civil registry (\\"basisregistratie personen\\") is the duty of the municipalities. Before the French Rule, the Netherlands did not have a central registration of its population, which was introduced in some parts of the country in 1796 by the French. In 1811, this registration was introduced throughout the country. The Dutch differentiate between the basisregistratie personen, an ongoing database of citizens' information, and the burgerlijke stand, which is a collection (at the municipal level) of documents evidencing certain events taking place in a given municipality, such as birth, marriage, civil union, and death. Beginning on 1 January 1850, municipalities were obliged to keep citizen's records in book form (Dutch: bevolkingsregister). Early in the twentieth century this system was replaced by a card system that registered families. The move toward individual registration took place in 1939 with the introduction of the persoonskaart, a single card registering a single individual, kept in the municipality. Information gathered on this card included family name, first names, gender, position within the family, date and place of birth, marital status, address, and church affiliation, besides information on when a person entered and left a municipality. In 1940, the Dutch government did not want to mandate citizen's identification, but during World War II the German occupying government mandated it so they could assess who was to be sent to Germany as forced labor and to select Jewish citizens from the general population. When the war was over, mandatory identification was done away with. In the 1990s all local registries were automated, and starting on 1 October 1994 the individual registration card was replaced with a digital list containing a person's information as collected by the gemeentelijke basisadministratie van persoonsgegevens (in 2015 replaced with the 'basisregistratie personen'), kept and maintained at the municipal level. Municipalities exchange information through a closed network at the end of each day to a nationwide database, which can be consulted by officials online. Though it was generally considered \\"un-Dutch,\\" on 1 January 2005 mandatory identification (when asked by a mandated person) was reintroduced for everyone over 14; official identification is to be presented for all important transactions between citizens and government. =Portugal= The civil registry in Portugal is officially established by the \\"Civil Registry Code\\" of February 18, 1911 (a few months before the promulgation of the Portuguese Constitution of 1911) Enquadramento hist√≥rico-legislativo do registo civil and is officially called Institute of Registries and Notaries (). On April 20, 1911, the \\"Law of Separation of the Church of the State\\" radicalized the secular state and determined that all parish registers (baptisms, marriages, and deaths) prior to 1911 should be civilly effective and transferred from parishes to newly established Civil Registry Offices. This was a previous struggle that had come since the formation of the Civil Registry Association in 1895, a Masonic organization presented by its mentors as \\"a strong anti-clerical and antireligious stronghold\\".A \\"Guerra religiosa\\" na I Rep√∫blica, Maria L√∫cia de Brito Moura e Fernando Catroga, CEHR-UCP, 2010, p. 287 e 289 In general, there is a civil registry office () in each Portuguese province, and in the cities of Lisbon, Porto, Vila Nova de Gaia and Setubal there are eleven, four, two and two conservatories respectively. In small and medium-sized municipalities, conservatories also accumulate other functions besides the civil registry, such as land registration (), commercial (legal entities, ) and vehicles (). In Lisbon, the Central Registry Office is located, which is responsible for registrations involving Portuguese citizens abroad and for the management of any procedure that concerns Portuguese citizenship. = Romania = Civil registries were introduced in 1806-1812 during the Russian occupation, and they followed the Tsarist model of keeping them with church records. By the \\"Communal Law\\" (Legea comunalƒÉ) of 31 March 1864 subsequent record keeping became the responsibility of the mayor in each dwelling, who was allowed to delegate it to one of his helpers. An effort by the state to gather the ancient historical records happened around 1926-1932 but in some cases as late as 1948-1952; a good number of these early records were lost in this process, sometimes literally by the truckload.Colec≈£ia de stare civilƒÉ ‚Äì √Æntre realizƒÉri ≈üi deziderate by Romanian National Archives (pp. 55-56) = Russia = Vital records (births, deaths and marriages) are called Acts of civil state or Acts of civil status (–∞–∫—Ç—ã –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è - akty grazhdankogo sostoyaniya) in Russia. These records are available only for relatives of a died person. Acts of civil status replaced Metricheskiye knigi (Parish registers) in 1918. All registers before 1918 are open for everyone. Births, deaths and marriages must be registered by register office called Body of registration of acts of civil status (–æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ –∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è - organ zapisi aktov grazhdanskogo sostoyaniya or –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω –ó–ê–ì–° - organ ZAGS for short) or the Palace of Marriages (–î–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü –±—Ä–∞–∫–æ—Å–æ—á–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–π) for civil marriage ceremonies. The system is decentralized. Each Russian federal subject has its own regional body as a part of regional government. The Unified state register of acts of civil status (EGR ZAGS, –ï–¥–∏–Ω—ã–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–µ–µ—Å—Ç—Ä –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–µ–π –∞–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è - –ï–ì–† –ó–ê–ì–°) maintained by the Federal Tax Service of Russia began operations since October 1, 2018. The system of resident registration in Russia (and former propiska) maintained by centralized federal body is not related to this system. = Sweden = In Sweden, the civil registry is maintained by the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket); up into the 1990s the Church of Sweden was responsible. Recording of births and deaths was stipulated in the early 17th century, formal national censuses have been made since the mid-18th century, and Sweden has one of the longest and most comprehensive suites of civil records of any country. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, civil registration was first introduced, in England and Wales, via the 1653 Marriage act, which transferred the statutory duty of recording marriages, births and burials, established in 1538, from the established Churches, to the Civil authorities, with a Justice of Peace, rather than the Parish priest required to maintain a register. The act was repealed on the restitution of the Monarchy in 1660, with the duty reverting to the established Churches, till the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 which affected England and Wales. The General Register Office for England and Wales was set up and the civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths in England and Wales became mandatory on 1 July 1837. Initially the onus lay on registrars to discover and record events, so parents only had to supply information if and when asked. In 1875, the Births & Deaths Act 1874 came into force, whereby those present at a birth or death were required to report the event. Subsequent legislation introduced similar systems in Ireland (all of which was then part of the United Kingdom) on 1 April 1845 for Protestant marriages and on 1 January 1864 for all birth, marriage and death events. Civil registration was introduced in Scotland on 1 January 1855. The administration of individual registration districts is the responsibility of registrars in the relevant local authority. There is also a national body for each jurisdiction. The local offices are generally responsible both for maintaining the original registers and for providing copies to the national body for central retention. A superintendent registrar facilitates the legal preliminaries to marriage, conducts civil marriage ceremonies and retains in his/her custody all completed birth, death and marriage registers for the district. The office of the superintendent registrar is the district register office, often referred to (informally) in the media as the \\"registry office\\".registry office Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. Accessed August 2011 Today, both officers may also conduct statutory civil partnership preliminaries and ceremonies, citizenship ceremonies and other non statutory ceremonies such as naming or renewal of vows. Certified copies of the entries made by the registrars over the years are issued on a daily basis either for genealogical research or for modern legal purposes such as supporting passport applications or ensuring eligibility for the appropriate junior sports leagues. On 1 December 2007 registrars and superintendent registrars became employees of their local authority for the first time following the enactment of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.  England and Wales  Births in England and Wales must be registered within 42 days, whilst deaths must be registered within 5 days unless an inquest is called or a post mortem is held. Marriages are registered at the time of the ceremony by either # the officiating minister of the Church of England or the Church in Wales, # an authorised person at a registered building, religious, or # a registrar at a register office, registered building or approved premise. The official registers are not directly accessible by the general public. Instead, indexes are made available which can be used to find the relevant register entry and then request a certified copy of the details. The General Register Office‚Äînow merged into the Her Majesty's Passport Office‚Äîhas overall responsibility for registration administration.  Scotland  Civil registration came into force in Scotland on 1 January 1855. A significant difference from the English system is the greater detail required for a registration. This means that if a certified copy of an entry is requested, it will contain much more information. The General Register Office for Scotland has overall responsibility for registration administration and drafting legislative changes in this area (as well as census data). They are governed by the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965 and subsequent legislation (responsibility for which has now been devolved to the Scottish Parliament).  North America  Mexico = In Mexico, vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates) are registered in Registro Civil, as called in Spanish. Each state has its own registration form. Until the 1960s, birth certificates were written by hand, in a styled-cursive calligraphy (almost unreadable for the new generations) and typically issued on security paper. After the 1960s, they were issued typed by machine. Currently all copies (from people born before and after the 1960s) are standardized in brown-security paper and are typed automatically by a computer and the CURP, (control identification number in Mexico) and the specific dates of issuing are already issued. = United States = In the United States, vital records such as birth certificates, death certificates, and frequently marriage certificates are maintained by the Office of Vital Statistics or Office of Vital Records in each individual state. Other documents such as deeds, mortgage documents, name change documents, and divorce records, as well as marriage certificates for those states not centralizing these records, are maintained by the Clerk of Court of each individual county. However, the term 'civil registry' is not used.  Asia Iran=Israel= Israeli citizens are required to register their names, marital status, and religion with the government. = Japan = In Japan, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare counts the number of births, deaths, stillbirths, marriages and divorces throughout the year and publishes them as Vital statistics annually. = Philippines= In the Philippines, civil registrations are maintained by the Philippine Statistics Authority.  Oceania  Australia = In Australia civil registrations are carried out and maintained by state administrations. Tasmania began registrations in 1838, Western Australia in 1841, South Australia in 1842, Victoria in 1853, Queensland and New South Wales in 1856,Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages - Queensland Northern Territory in 1870, and Australian Capital Territory in 1911. Prior to those dates, records of baptisms, marriages and burials were kept by individual churches. Because early civil registration often involved the churches, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether early records are civil or church records. Civil registration was carried out by government employees independent of the churches. The information recorded in records varies from state to state. South Australia calls the appropriate central registry the Principal Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and in Victoria it is the Government Statist Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The other states call the registry the Office of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages.

In the seven volume German edition of his works, there are some 480 pages of poems. Hesse's novels themselves contain many passages of literal verse. The common thread that runs through the poems in this collection is homesickness. On the selection of these poems, James Wright wrote in the Translator's Note: \\"All I wish to do is to offer a selection of Hesse's poems which deal with the single theme of homesickness.\\" Many of Hesse's novels touched on this subject, including Steppenwolf (1927): :Towards the end of the novel, Hermine says to Harry: \\"‚Ä¶ Ah, Harry, we have to stumble through so much dirt and humbug before we reach home. And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.\\" In these poems Hesse has touched this theme with a \\"traditionally endearing delicacy.\\" References *Hermann Hesse. Poems.

Among many other more mainstream products they have created two unusual varieties of catadioptric telescopes with an open tube design instead of the full-aperture corrector plate of the Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain and most Maksutov‚ÄìCassegrain designs. Klevtsov‚ÄìCassegrain This design is based on the Maksutov‚ÄìCassegrain. It provides correction of aberrations via a two-element meniscus-shaped corrector lens in front of the secondary mirror. This design was originally envisaged by G. I. Popov with a practical implementation by Yu. A. Klevtsov. It is produced with apertures of 8, 10.25 and 13 inches. The 8-inch model employs a refractor style rack and pinion focuser, while in the larger designs the primary mirror is moved as in most other small to medium-sized Cassegrain designs. Vixen Sixth-Order Aspheric Cassegrain (VISAC) Vixen produces an 8-inch aperture- modified Cassegrain design (VC200L) they refer to as a VISAC (Vixen Sixth- Order Aspheric Cassegrain) that is based on a Cassegrain design with a primary mirror that is \\"sixth order aspheric\\" ‚Äì somewhat like a hyperbolic mirror but able to be manufactured using mass-production techniques. To compensate for the aberrations the mirror design introduces, Vixen adds a \\"field corrector lens\\" ‚Äì actually a three-element corrector in the draw tube of the focuser which also reduces field curvature for wide field applications. The design results in an image that is free of coma and astigmatism. These characteristics have led to the VISAC being referred to as a \\"Poor man's Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien\\". In fact, given that it has no astigmatism and field curvature, it performs better than a true RC. There is the downside of the potential for chromatic aberration due to the refractive elements, but it is hardly noticeable. This particular design is also unusual in that it is a Cassegrain design but has a fixed primary and refractor-style rack-and-pinion focuser which removes the image shift issues seen with other catadioptric designs. These features together make for a telescope that is very well suited to astrophotography either at the native f/9 or using the optional focal reducer at around f/6.3.

His best-known and most critically acclaimed work is Vishnupuram, a fantasy set as a quest through various schools of Indian philosophy and mythology. In 2014, he started his most ambitious work Venmurasu, a modern renarration of the epic Mahabharata. His other well-known novels include Rubber, Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural, Kanyakumari, Kaadu, Pani Manidhan, Eazhaam Ulagam and Kotravai. The early major influences in his life have been the humanitarian thinkers Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Drawing on the strength of his life experiences and extensive travel around India, Jeyamohan is able to re-examine and interpret the essence of India's rich literary and classical traditions. Born into a Malayali Nair family in the Kanyakumari district that straddles Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Jeyamohan is equally adept in Tamil and Malayalam. However, the bulk of his work has been in Tamil. Jeyamohan's output includes nine novels, ten volumes of short- stories/plays, thirteen literary criticisms, five biographies of writers, six introductions to Indian and Western literature, three volumes on Hindu and Christian philosophy and numerous other translations and collections. He has also written scripts for Malayalam and Tamil movies. Early life Jeyamohan was born on 22 April 1962 in Arumanai of Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, to S.Bahuleyan Pillai and B.Visalakshi Amma. Bahuleyan Pillai was an accounts clerk in the Arumanai registrar's office. Visalakshi Amma hailed from a family of trade-unionists. Jeyamohan's siblings were an elder brother and a younger sister. Bahuleyan's family followed him around on his work-related transfers to Thiruvattar and Arumanai towns in the Kanyakumari district. Very early on, Jeyamohan was inspired by his mother to take up writing. Jeyamohan's first publication during schooldays was in Ratnabala, a children's magazine, followed by a host of publications in popular weeklies. After high school, Jeyamohan was pressured by his father to take up commerce and accountancy in college. The suicide of a close friend drove him to drop out of college and constantly travel the country in search of physical and spiritual experience. He supported himself by taking up odd jobs and writing in pulp magazines all the while reading voraciously. He took up a temporary job at the Telephones department in Kasargode where he became close to the Leftist trade union circles. He received many of his formative ideas on historiography and literary narrative during that period. Visalakshi and Bahuleyan committed suicide within a month of each other in 1984, and this drove Jeyamohan further into an itinerant lifestyle. He met writer Sundara Ramasamy in 1985 who took on the role of a mentor and encouraged him to take up writing seriously. Jeyamohan also got another mentor in the form of Aatroor Ravi Varma who sensitized him to the delicate balance between art and life. In parallel, Jeyamohan was an avid reader of Indian classics and philosophical texts like the Bhagavad Gita. CareerFiction & literary criticism= In 1987, the journal Kollippaavai published his poem Kaidhi (The Prisoner). In the same year, Nadhi (The River) was published in Kanaiyazhi with a critical mention from writer Ashoka Mitran. The journal Nigazh published Bodhi, followed by Padugai ('The Riverbed'). Critics heaped praise on Padugai for its evocative narrative that wove together myths and contemporary visuals. Jeyamohan wrote his first full-fledged novel Rubber in 1988 and then re-edited and published it in 1990. The novel won the Akilan Memorial prize for its path-breaking portrayal of the ecological and sociological impact of rubber cultivation in the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Jeyamohan's speech at the awards function was well received, and he further developed those ideas in Novel (1990), an exploration of the art form and its ideologies, and Naveena Thamizhilakkiya Arimugam, a comprehensive introduction to modernist Tamil literature. In 1993, Jeyamohan met Guru Nitya Chaitanya Yati which proved to be a turning point in his spiritual journey. The dialogues with the Guru opened new views into the body of Indian thought, which culminated in his acclaimed work Vishnupuram in 1997. Jeyamohan travelled and witnessed first- hand regional issues, droughts and political problems that underlay issues like Naxalism in tribal areas. His experiences convinced him of the continuing relevance of Gandhian idealism and non-violence as the sensible alternative to naked capitalism and militant socialism. The leftist in him had been saddened by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a decade long introspection on the nature of power and self-righteousness found expression in Pin Thodarum Nizhalin Kural in 1999. Post-2000, Jeyamohan broke new ground with Kaadu (2003), an exploration of the forest landscape as a metaphor for lust and the vigour of life. Kotravai (2005), the renarration of the Kannagi epic, was deemed by the writer and critics as his best yet in terms of structure and depth. From 1998 to 2004, Jeyamohan and his friends edited a literary journal named Solputhithu. In 2009, his readership circle created the 'Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam' to broaden the readership for serious literature in Tamil Nadu and to reward under-recognized pioneers of Tamil literature. When he turned 50, Jeyamohan wrote a set of short-stories, titled 'Aram', that explored the values and idealism that is possible in man. In 2014, Jeyamohan began writing Venmurasu, a re-narration of the Indian epic Mahabharata. In parallel, Jeyamohan has produced a prolific output as one of the foremost Literary critics and theorists of modern Indian literature with focus on Tamil. His 30 volumes on criticism and anthologies have earned him a respectable place among critics like Vedasagayakumar. In 2013, he was considered as Tamil Author of the year by National Library, Singapore. In 2016, he worked as Writer in residence for 2 months at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, organized by National Arts Council (Singapore) and National Institute of Education. =Website= Jeyamohan had been an active participant in Tamil internet discussion groups like Mayyam, Forumhub and Thinnai.com during the early years of the medium in India. As part of the debates, Jeyamohan produced some of his best essays on literary standards and criticism during this period. Recognizing the possibility of losing some of these important works, Jeyamohan's friend and writer Cyril Alex created the author's website for consolidating the author's works. Over the decade, the website has become an important repository of the author's essays running into thousands. The author follows an innovative publishing model in which he serialises all new content on the website and allows free access, while simultaneously offering hardbacks and paperbacks through publishers. More significantly, the website allows the author to freely engage in discussions with thousands of readers on the axioms that govern his works and thought. In early 2011, the Vishnupuram Ilakkiya Vattam has created an online moderated discussion group for discussing literature, criticism, art and related topics. =Gandhian movements & Anna Hazare= Jeyamohan gravitated towards Gandhian philosophy and political principles through debates with many intellectuals of the era. His considerable writing resulted in the corpus of essays published in 2009 as Indraya Gandhi, a collection that examined the continuing relevance of Gandhi's methods and ideals in modern India. Indraya Gandhi explored new dimensions on Gandhi's life including his relationship with Nehru, Ambedkar and Dalit politics and the topic of Lust. Jeyamohan has continued to highlight many Gandhians who represent the philosophy. As a part of the series, he sought to explain how the next generation of Gandhian leaders like Anna Hazare were continuing to inspire the nation towards achieving true democracy and equality. Jeyamohan had been one of the first Indian ideologues to write about Anna Hazare many years before Anna Hazare's popular anti-graft movement. Jeyamohan had personally visited Ralegaon Siddhi to see Hazare's social movements in action, and he also wrote about Hazare's tireless struggle to get the Right to Information Act passed in the Indian parliament. Throughout 2011, Jeyamohan continued to write about and support Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement and the Jan Lokpal bill. Rather than focus on the minutiae of the bill itself, Jeyamohan focused readers' attention on the ideology behind Hazare's actions ‚Äì how he appealed directly to the sense of justice in the common man, his symbolism, and the Gandhian method of achieving the ultimate goal through civil non-violent mass movement without letting up any opportunity to discuss and negotiate with political opponents. Amidst widespread scepticism and slander flamed up by the national and regional media across the political spectrum, Jeyamohan remained rock solid in support of Anna Hazare's movement. By the end of the summer of 2011, Jeyamohan had written close to 60 essays on the topic, many of them in answer to readers who had written in expressing their own doubts and questions. In 2016, on the occasion of state elections in Tamil Nadu, Jeyamohan wrote a series of essays on Democracy in the newspaper Dinamalar which was published as a book. =Environmentalism= Jeyamohan's works like 'Kaadu' and 'Mathagam' feature elephants in central roles, while his biographical and travel essays capture the centrality of nature, ecology and conservation to the Indian way of life. One such true-life story on the conservationist Dr.V. Krishnamurthy (veterinarian) ('Dr K, the Elephant Doctor') sparked huge interest and discussion among readers on the impact of humans on forest life. Told in semi- fictional form as through the eyes of a forest ranger, the story follows Dr K as, despite having a giant reputation in the naturalist circles, he eschews human accolades and seeks a much more rewarding life in the company of animals in the Indian Forest Department's elephant camps. 'The Elephant Doctor' has been included in the Tamil textbook published by the Department of School Education, Tamil Nadu as part of the revised syllabus for the year 2018. =Controversies= Jeyamohan has found himself at the centre of many controversies: * In early 2008, Jeyamohan published a satire on Tamil movie icons M G Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan. A popular print weekly, Ananda Vikatan, picked up on this and it resulted in a huge slander and threat campaign against the author. * Jeyamohan firmly rejects any notion of offering serious literary status to the works of M Karunanidhi, who he classifies under romantic/historical fiction writers. This raised the ire of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party members. * In 2014, Jeyamohan criticized the undue attention that some women writers were garnering without having produced any literary work of merit. This generated a controversy as some activists sought to portray his remarks as misogynist. Jeyamohan responded with his own statements criticizing the intentional slander. Personal life Jeyamohan was introduced to Arunmozhi Nangai as a reader and married her in 1991. Their son Ajithan was born in 1993 and daughter Chaitanya in 1997.

The comic was launched under the editorship of Derek Birnage on 11 September 1954, under the name Tiger ‚Äì The Sport and Adventure Picture Story Weekly, and featured predominantly sporting strips. Its most popular strip was \\"Roy of the Rovers,\\" a football-based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. This strip proved so successful it was spun out of Tiger and into its own comic. The next editor was Barrie Tomlinson. Barrie became Group Editor in 1976, with Paul Gettens as editor. Following successive mergers with other Fleetway publications in the 1960s the comic was known as Tiger and Hurricane, then Tiger and Jag, then it was coupled with the football magazine Scorcher in 1974, resulting in Tiger and Scorcher appearing for more than 6 years. Later there was a further, less successful, merger with another comic called Speed, in 1980. The end finally came on 30 March 1985, with some strips moving to The Eagle from issue #159 of that comic, dated 6 April 1985, which was temporarily titled Eagle and Tiger. In all, 1,555 issues were published, as well as a number of hard-cover annuals. Editorial Assistants included Tony Peagam, Paul Gettens, and Terence Magee. Art Editors included Mike Swanson and Trish Gordon-Pugh. Art Assistant: Maurice Dolphin. Letterers: Stanley Richardson, Paul Bensberg, Peter Knight, John Aldrich. List of strips This list is incomplete. You can help to complete it. * \\"Billy's Boots\\" (writer Fred Baker artist John Gilliat) ‚Äì moved to Eagle, then Roy of the Rovers. A schoolboy believes his footballing success is down to a special pair of old boots. * \\"Death Wish\\" (writer Barrie Tomlinson artist Vanyo) ‚Äì from Speed, moved to Eagle. A racing driver disfigured by an accident wears a leather mask and takes on increasingly dangerous stunts. This strip began just four years after a similar accident at the N√ºrburgring in which racing driver Niki Lauda suffered severe burns. * \\"Fairs Please!\\" * \\"File of Fame\\" (writer Terence Magee artist Jim Bleach) * \\"Fisty Flynn\\" * \\"Football Family Robinson\\" (writer Fred Baker, artist Joe Colquhoun) about a lower division side called Thatchem United. All players had to be Robinson family members under the tutelage of Grandma Robinson. Team members included Crash Robinson (goalie), Alf Robinson, Fred Robinson, Grizzly Bear Robinson, Ron Robinson and Tich Robinson. Their biggest moment was when they got to Wembley and won the League Cup, in a manner similar to Swindon Town's 1969 victory over Arsenal in the same competition. The story resumed in Roy of the Rovers in the late 1970s. * \\"Golden Boy\\" ‚Äì moved to Eagle * A\\" Horse Called Ugly\\" * \\"Hot Shot Hamish\\" (writer Fred Baker artist Julio Schiaffino) ‚Äì moved to Roy of the Rovers. A comedy about a Scottish footballer with a powerful kick. * \\"Jet-Ace Logan\\" * \\"Johnny Cougar\\" (writer Barrie Tomlinson artist Sandy James) ‚Äì A native American wrestler who grappled with a number of colourful opponents. * \\"King Of The Track\\" (writer Paul Gettens, artist Yvonne Hutton) * \\"MacTavish and O'Toole\\" * \\"Martin's Marvellous Mini\\" (writer Fred Baker, artist David Sque) * \\"Mighty Mouse\\" (writer Fred Baker artist Julio Schiaffino) * \\"Nipper\\" (writer Tom Tully, artist Roylance) * \\"Olac the Gladiator\\" * \\"Paceman\\" * \\"Phillip Driver\\" * \\"Rod And Line (writer Paul Gettens) * \\"Roy of the Rovers\\" (writer Tom Tully, artists David Sque and Yvonne Hutton) ‚Äì spun off into its own comic in 1976 (but continued to have stories in Tiger for a couple of years after this) * \\"Skid Solo\\" (writer Fred Baker, artist John Vernon) ‚Äì about a British Formula 1 Driver in the 80s. * \\"Sintek\\" * \\"The Slogger from Down Under\\" * \\"The Strong Guy\\" * \\"Star Rider\\" ‚Äì moved to Eagle * \\"The Suicide Six\\" * \\"Tallon of the Track\\" ‚Äì tomboy Jo Tallon runs the Flying Ospreys speedway team * \\"Topps On Two Wheels\\" (title later changed to \\"Topps\\") - from Speed, about a motorcycle stunt rider based loosely on Eddie Kidd. * \\"The Tough Game\\" ‚Äì a rugby league story involving the exploits of three friends, Duggie Batson, Big Ernie Barnes and Ape Man. * \\"Typhoon Tracy, Trouble-shooter\\" In addition, sports stars such as Tony Greig, Geoff Boycott, Trevor Francis, Ian Botham and Charlie Nicholas wrote columns for Tiger.

It is also the name that it is registered under in the State Committee of Ukraine in Religious Affairs. It is often referred to, as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) or UOC (MP) in order to distinguish between the two rival churches contesting the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Following the creation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, on December 20, 2018, the Ukrainian parliament voted to force the UOC-MP to rename itself in its mandatory state registration, its new name must have \\"the full name of the church to which it is subordinated\\".Ukraine's parliament passes bill on renaming UOC-MP, UNIAN (20 December 2018)https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/ukraine-passes-law-forcing- moscow-backed-church-to-identify-as-russian-fight-erupts-in-parliament.html This was protested by UOC-MP adherents. On 11 December 2019 the Supreme Court of Ukraine allowed the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) to retain its name. The UOC-MP had argued that their governing center is in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, not in Russia's capital, Moscow, and therefore it should not be renamed. HistoryUnder the Ecumenical Patriarchate of ConstantinopleMoscow, Lithuania, Galich metropolia The Ukrainian Orthodox Church considers itself the sole descendant in modern Ukraine of the metropolis of Kyiv and all Rus' within the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople established in Kyiv in the 10th century. Due to invasion of the Mongols in the 13th century the metropolitan seat was moved to Vladimir and later to Moscow, while in the Duchy of Halych and Volhynia was created a separate Metropolis of Halych with own Metropolitan. In the 14th century, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas who established his control over the former territories of Kyivan Rus attempted to move the metropolitan seat back to Kyiv. Revival In 1596, the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galich and all Rus' Michael Rohoza accepted the Union of Brest transforming dioceses of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople into the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church under the Holy See's jurisdiction. In 1620, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Cyril Lucaris reestablished Orthodox dioceses for the Orthodox population of what was then the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth ‚Äî under the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galicia, and all Russia Job Boretsky as the Patriarchal Exarch. =Merger into the Moscow Patriarchate= Following the transfer of the Cossack Hetmanate under the sovereignty of the Tsardom of Russia in 1654, the Kyivan metropolis in 1686–ü–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥ –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏–∏ –∫ –†–ü–¶ –≤ XVII –≤–µ–∫–µ –±—ã–ª –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω–æ –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–º, –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∏ –æ—Å–ø–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–ª—å–∑—è –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ—Ä—å–µ–∑ - –±–æ–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤ Interfax, 5 July 2018.Khomenko, S., Denysov, M.

RIA Novosti. 27 September 2018 Soon, Gedeon gradually lost control of the dioceses which had been under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Kyiv. In January 1688, Gedeon's title was changed by Moscow to the ‚Ä≥Metropolitan of Kyiv, Galich, and Little Russia‚Ä≥. Gedeon's successors were effectively mere diocesan bishops under the Moscow Patriarchate and later Russia's Most Holy Synod. Before the Battle of Poltava, when Ivan Mazepa sided with Carl XII, the new Metropolitan Ioasaf along with bishops of Chernigov and Pereyaslav was summoned by Peter the Great to Glukhov where they were ordered to declare an anathema onto Mazepa. After the battle of Poltava, in 1709 Metropolitan Ioasaf was exiled to Tver and in 1710 a church censorship was introduced to the Kyiv metropolia. In 1718 Metropolitan Ioasaf was arrested and dispatched to Saint Petersburg for interrogation where he died. From 1718 to 1722, the Metropolitan See in Kyiv was vacant and ruled by the Kyiv Spiritual Consistory (under the authority of the Most Holy Synod); in 1722 it was occupied by Archbishop Varlaam. =Synodal period= In 1730, Archbishop Varlaam with all members of the Kyiv Spiritual Consistory were put on trial by the Privy Chancellery. After being convicted, Varlaam as a simple monk was exiled to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery in Vologda region where he served a sentence of imprisonment of 10 years. After the death of the Russian Empress Anna in 1740, Varlaam was allowed to return and recovered all his Archiereus titles. He however refused to accept back those titles and, after asked to be left in peace, moved to the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery. In 1750 Varlaam accepted the Great Schema under the name of Vasili and soon died in 1751. In 1743, the title of Metropolitan was re-instated for Archbishop Raphael Zaborovsky. On 2 April 1767, the Empress of Russia Catherine the Great issued an edict stripping the title of the Kyivan Metropolitan of the style \\"and all Little Russia\\".Arseniy at the Orthodox Encyclopedia =Fall of monarchy in Russia and Exarchate= Participants of the 1917 Local Council. Metropolitan Antony Khrapovitsky is to the right of Patriarch Tikhon Metropolitan Vladimir Bogoyavlensky chaired the All-Ukrainian Church Council that took a break between its sessions on 18 January 1918 and was to be resumed in May 1918. On 23‚Äì24 January 1918, the Red Guards of Reingold Berzin occupied Kyiv (see Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War). In the evening of 25 January 1918, Metropolitan Vladimir was found dead between walls of the Old Pechersk Fortress beyond the Gates of All Saints, having been killed by unknown people. In May 1918, the Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galich Antony Khrapovitsky was appointed to the Kyiv eparchy, a former candidate to become the Patriarch of Moscow at the Russian Local Council of 1917 and losing it to the Patriarch Tikhon. In July 1918 Metropolitan Antony became the head of the All-Ukrainian Church Council. Eventually he sided with the Russian White movement supporting the Denikin's forces of South Russia, while keeping the title of Metropolitan of Kyiv and Halych. After the defeat of the Whites and the exile of Antony, in 1919-21 the metropolitan seat was temporarily held by the bishop of Cherkasy Nazariy (also the native of Kazan). After the arrest of Nazariy by the Soviet authorities in 1921, the seat was provisionally held by the bishop of Grodno and newly elected Exarch of Ukraine Mikhail, a member of the Russian Black Hundreds nationalistic movement. After his arrest in 1923, the Kyiv eparchy was provisionally headed by various bishops of neighboring eparchies until 1927. After his return in 1927 Mikhail became the Metropolitan of Kyiv and Exarch of Ukraine until his death in 1929. In 1945, after the integration of Zakarpattia Oblast into the USSR, eastern parts of the Eparchy of Mukaƒçevo and Pre≈°ov were transferred from the supreme jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church to the jurisdiction of the Exarchate of Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and a new Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhgorod was formed. =Dissolution of the Soviet Union and self rule= On 28 October 1990,–ö 20-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ì—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç—ã –°–≤—è—Ç–µ–π—à–µ–≥–æ –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—Ö–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –≤—Å–µ—è –†—É—Å–∏ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∏—è II –æ –¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ —Å–∞–º–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏: ‚Ä≥–û–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–æ –≤ —Å–∏–ª—É —É–∂–µ 28 –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 1990 –≥–æ–¥–∞ (–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –°–≤—è—Ç–µ–π—à–∏–π –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—Ö –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–π –≤—Ä—É—á–∏–ª –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–≤—à–µ–º—É —Ç–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫—É—é –∫–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä—É –º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç—É –§–∏–ª–∞—Ä–µ—Ç—É —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â—É—é –ì—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç—É)‚Ä≥ it was granted a status of a self‚Äìgoverning church under the jurisdiction of the ROC (but not the full autonomy as is understood in the ROC legal terminology). Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan), who succeeded Filaret (Denysenko), was enthroned in 1992 as the Primate of the UOC under the title Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine, with the official residency in the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, which also houses all of the Church's administration. The UOC- MP, prior to 2019, was believed to be the largest religious body in Ukraine with the greatest number of parish churches and communities counting up to half of the total in Ukraine and totaling over 10,000. The UOC also claimed to have up to 75 percent of the Ukrainian population.Pravoslvieye v Ukraine Retrieved on 10 February 2007 Independent surveys showed significant variance. According to Stratfor, in 2008, more than 50 percent of Ukrainian population belonged to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarch.Countries in Crisis: Ukraine Part 3 Razumkov Centre survey results, however, tended to show greater adherence to the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate.\\"What religious group do you belong to?\\". Sociology poll by Razumkov Centre about the religious situation in Ukraine (2006) Many Orthodox Ukrainians do not clearly identify with a particular Orthodox jurisdiction and, sometimes, are even unaware of the affiliation of the parish they attend as well as of the controversy itself, which indicates the difficulty of using survey numbers as an indicator of a relative strength of the church. Additionally, the geographical factor plays a major role in the number of adherents, as the Ukrainian population tends to be more churchgoing in the western part of the country rather than in the UOC-MP's heartland in southern and eastern Ukraine. Politically, many in Ukraine see the UOC-MP as merely a puppet of the ROC and consequently a geopolitical tool of Russia, which have stridently opposed the consolidation and recognition of the independent OCU. = Russia-Ukraine conflict = Since 2014 the church has come under attack for perceived anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian actions by its clergymen.Ukrainians shun Moscow Patriarchate as Russia‚Äôs war intensifies in Donbas, Kyiv Post (23 Januari 2015) The War and the Orthodox Churches in Ukraine, The Jamestown Foundation (18 February 2014) On 14 September 2015 it urged the pro-Russian separatists of the War in Donbass to lay down their arms and take advantage of the amnesty promised to them in the Minsk II agreement. UOC MP called on militants to lay down arms, Ukrayinska Pravda (14 September 2015) Ukraine passed laws which the Moscow Patriarchate interpreted as discriminatory in 2017. From 2014 until 2018 around 60 Moscow Patriarchate parishes switched to the Kyivan Patriarchate in transfers the leadership of the Moscow patriarchate says were illegal. According to the Razumkov Center, among the 27.8 million Ukrainian members of Orthodox churches, allegiance to the Kyiv Patriarchate grown from 12 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2016 and much of the growth came from believers who previously did not associate with either patriarchate. In April 2018 Moscow patriarchate had 12,300 parishes and the Kyivan Patriarchate 5,100 parishes. By decision of the Russian Orthodox Church Bishops‚Äô Council (November 29-December 2, 2017), a separate chapter of the ROC Statute was singled out to confirm the status of UOC with the following provisions: > * 1) The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is granted independence and self- > governance according to the Resolution of the Bishops‚Äô Council of the > Russian Orthodox Church which took place on October 25‚Äì27, 1990. * 2) The > Ukrainian Orthodox Church is an independent and self-governed Church with > broad autonomy rights. * 3) In her life and work the Ukrainian Orthodox > Church is guided by the Resolution of the 1990 Bishops‚Äô Council of the > Russian Orthodox Church on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the 1990 Deed of > the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia and the Statute on the governance of > the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.Report by Metropolitan Onufry of Kyiv and All > Ukraine to the Russian Orthodox Church Bishops‚Äô Council (November > 29-December 2, 2017) Onufriy Berezovsky in Kyiv, 8 May 2016 In December 2017, the Security Service of Ukraine published classified documents revealing that the NKGB of the USSR and its units in the Union and autonomous republics, territories and regions were engaged in the selection of candidates for participation in the 1945 council that elected Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow from the representatives of the clergy and the laity. This included \\"persons who have religious authority among the clergy and believers, and at the same time checked for civic or patriotic work\\". A letter sent in September 1944 and signed by the head of the 2nd Directorate of the NKGB of the USSR Fedotov and the head of the Fifth Division 2nd Directorate of Karpov stated that \\"it is important to ensure that the number of nominated candidates is dominated by the agents of the NKGB, capable of holding the line that we need at the Council.\\"–°–ë–£ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∞ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤—ã: –º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—Ö–∞ –≤ 1945 –≥–æ–¥—É –∏–∑–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –∞–≥–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –ù–ö–ì–ë On 13 December 2018 a priest of the church, Volodymyr Maretsky, was sentenced in absentia to 6 years of imprisonment for hindering the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014 during the War in Donbass.

In Chernivtsi, the Old Believers came out of the subordination of Moscow, Ukrayinska Pravda (23 December 2018) On 20 December 2018, the Verkhovna Rada passed a legislation to change the UOC-MP's registered name. Ukrainian deputy Oleksandr Bryhynets described the law as stipulating if \\"the state is recognized as the aggressor state, the church whose administration is based in the aggressor state must have in its title the full name of the church to which it is subordinate\\". The Russian Orthodox Church, which the UOC-MP is part of, is based in Russia, which is considered by Ukraine as an aggressor state following the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The law also gave it \\"no right to be represented in military units on the front line\\". On 11 December 2019 the Supreme Court of Ukraine allowed the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) to retain its name.Supreme Court of Ukraine rules in favor of Moscow Patriarchate, UNIAN (16 December 2019) Administrative divisions Eparchies of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in 2011 In October 2014 the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine was subdivided into 53 eparchies (dioceses) led by bishops.

Singing in broken English, which helped create passionate effects, a heavy expressive bluesy sound emerged with blistering Les Paul solos and slabs of Hammond organ backdrops, that was consolidated by Peter Panka's almost hypnotic oscillating drum beats, that would characterize Jane's music for almost 40 years. Together was warmly received by the German music press including Sounds magazine, who had declared Pulst its vocalist of the year for 1971. The first of an almost continual succession of lineup changes occurred later that year with Pulst departing and Maucher bowing out for health reasons. Former Justice Of Peace guitarist Wolfgang Krantz joined on bass and guitar with Panka and Hess sharing the vocals, which displayed even more lethargic and stoned out sonic timbres. Applying their proven formula, their 1973 follow up album Here We Are was somewhat more harmonious with the addition of synthesizers, that provided spacier atmospheres and produced a fan favourite in the form of the sombre rock ballad \\"Out in the Rain\\". Shortly after the album's release Nadolny left to form a new band Lady with the recovered Maucher returning on bass and vocals. Jane's third endeavour, simply entitled Jane III (1974), was a scorching guitar blowout and with Krantz on second guitar. The void left by departing keyboardist Nadolny was adequately compensated for with two dueling guitarists as demonstrated by an impressive in-studio jam entitled \\"Jane Session\\" as well as a spaced out extended track \\"Comin' Again\\" featuring Maucher's harder edged vocals. Not long after the release of Jane III, Maucher and Krantz departed, eventually forming Harlis on the fledgling Sky Records label. In May 1974 Jane rejuvenated itself by absorbing two members from the recently disbanded hard rock band Dull Knife with Martin Hesse on bass and Gottfreid Janko on vocals and keyboards. The slightly more upbeat album Lady (1975) was recorded by this lineup in early 1975, during which time Matthias Jabs of Scorpions fame would also join them for a brief period for some live performances. Keyboardist Werner Nadolny returned in 1976 for Jane's expansive 33 minute symphonic progressive rock masterpiece Fire, Water, Earth & Air (1976). Featuring layers of Hammonds, Moogs, Mellotrons and synths, it was unquestionably Jane at their creative zenith and the Jane album that would hold the most appeal for progheads. Nadolny would split once again after the completion of Fire, Water, Earth & Air and was appropriately replaced by Eloy keyboardist Martin Weiczorke for an extensive tour, which spawned another coup de grace for Jane resulting in the stunning Live at Home (1977) double live LP replete with a cover of a Martian landscape snapped by the Viking Mars lander. Released in early 1977 and broadcast nationally in its entirety on WDR Radio in January of that year, Live at Home went gold in their native Germany and helped them break the international markets in both North America as well as Japan and South America. Containing somewhat darker conceptual atmospheres, their 7th studio album Between Heaven and Hell (1977) once again followed progrock paradigms. Mixed reactions within the German music press did not prevent the album from being embraced by fans, that was at times similar to Pink Floyd's capacious stylings. By this time Jane had become one of the top draws in the German music scene as well as attracting followings in Switzerland and Austria even though they continued to sing in English. Recorded in the band's personal 24 track studio, 1978's Age of Madness rocked it out a little harder maintaining emotional spacey timbres and was released internationally, being presented in clear and red vinyl formats on the now defunct Canadian label Bomb Records. A successful European tour ensued but Wieczorke departed in early 1979. Jane's following album Sign No. 9 (1979) was a near disaster with Jane being reduced to a trio forcing Hess to double on keyboards and the album inevitably had a guitar dominated sound, which was devoid of the spacious moods created by lush keyboards on earlier Jane recordings. Signs of creative burnout cast some doubts not only in the minds of fans but within the band themselves. A new direction was taken in the 1980s on a self-titled album Jane (Mask) (1980), that is sometimes referred to as Mask by aficionados. It incorporated new wave, punk and jazzy elements in straight rock configurations and introduced a new vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist, Yugoslavian eccentric Predrag Jovanovic or \\"Pedja\\". Vocals were never Jane's forte and Pedja's energetic deliveries gave them a fresh sound but unfortunately it was his only appearance with the band and he returned to his native Yugoslavia to form the synth-pop group D'Boys. Bassman Charly Maucher returned to the fold for 1982's Germania (1982) and although it contained some more experiments including a reggae excursion on the track \\"Get Back to You\\" Jane remained, for the most part, a straight hard rock band and included a reworked version of \\"Your Circle\\" from their Between Heaven and Hell album entitled \\"Southern Line\\", that even ventured into heavy metal territory. Internal disagreements between founding members Peter Panka and Klaus Hess resulted in Hess' departure in 1982. He would subsequently release a solo album Sternentanz in 1983, that would recall earlier Jane stylings. Meanwhile, after collaborating on the musical production on the German rock Opera \\"Warlock\\" with other former members of Jane, Peter Panka reformed Jane as a touring band under the moniker Lady Jane in 1984 with various musicians. Unfortunately a coherent unit failed to materialize for the remainder of the decade and only one pop-oriented album Beautiful Lady was released in 1986 with no real connection to past glories. Two live albums were also released in 1989 and 1990 with the former being limited to only 300 pressings and both featured Panka on drums/vocals, Nadolny on keyboards, Klaus Henatsch on bass and keyboards, and Kai Rueter on guitar performing older Jane material. In 1992 Hess and Panka attempted to reconcile and along with Nadolny on keyboards and with Jens Dettmer they embarked on a reunion tour, that included 13 dates in New Zealand! But the reconciliation failed and Jane split into two factions with Hess calling his version Mother Jane while the Panka formation became unofficially known as Peter Panka's Jane as he retained the rights for the band name and logo. In 1996 Peter Panka's Jane (initially referred to as Pano's Jane) recorded the studio album Resurrection and introduced ex-Epitaph member Klaus Walz along with Kai Reuter (formerly of Kasch) on guitars with veteran Nadolny returning on keyboards and Mark Giebeler on bass. Meanwhile Hess' Mother Jane with younger musicians was also touring playing mostly Jane classics, releasing a single in 1998 and finally a surprisingly impressive live album Comes Alive in 2000, that reflected the heavier side of Jane. A more cohesive attempt was made by Panka in 2002 to rekindle the classic Jane groove of the seventies with Klaus Walz joining original members Panka, Nadolny and Maucher. A new album Genuine (2002) (that also contained some live tracks from the failed 1992 reunion) materialized and was followed by a tour which saw the band performing the new material but focused on renditions of old classics. A live album, Live 2002 (2002), documented the shows and although not possessing the impact of 1976's Live at Home, it was a definite indication of Jane's return to the limelight attracting both old and new fans. Not content to tour solely as a retro-Jane band, two more studio albums Shine On (2003) and Voices (2006) were released, that burned on in the classic Jane tradition. Tragically, founding member Peter Panka died as result of cancer in June 2007, which put the band on hold. However, in compliance with Panka's wishes original member Charly Maucher took over as leader and another studio album Traces was released in 2009 with the current lineup of Charly Maucher on lead vocals/bass, Klaus Waltz guitar/vocals, Arndt Shulz guitar vocals and Fritz Randow (ex Eloy & Saxon) on drums plus Werner Nadolny on keyboards. Although Werner Nadolny has since left the band, he currently tours with his own Jane tribute band performing vintage Jane material. Klaus Hess' Mother Jane also remains active with a recently released 2009 album titled In Dreams. Along with other bands such as Amon D√º√ºl II, Grobschnitt and Guru Guru, Jane continues to bear the torch of the early seventies Krautrock phenomenon and continues in that spirit to this day in three different guises led by original members.

Active from 1992 to 2000, the band played a subgenre of industrial music with its fusion of electronic dance, industrial and gothic music. History The band was formed in 1992 in Los Angeles by Matt Green and his New York‚Äìbased collaborator, Rob Morton. They collectively used the funds they had saved up to jump-start the band. Rob Morton had been Matt Green's musical partner for the 5 years prior. That same year in 1992, they signed to Cleopatra Records and released their self-titled, four-song EP, with vocals supplied by Scott \\"Chopper\\" Franklin (later to become bass player for The Cramps) Scott Franklin left another band to provide vocals for Spahn Ranch. In 1993, they added vocalist Athan Maroulis and recorded their debut album, Collateral Damage. Their second album, The Coiled One, appeared two years later in the midst of Morton leaving the band due to creative and logistical differences. After his departure, the line-up was expanded to include Christian Death drummer David Glass, Screams for Tina guitarist Kent Bancroft, and Tubalcain drummer Harry Lewis. This offered a beginning of the fuller, more diverse, dark electro-industrial sound that Spahn Ranch would continue to pursue. By 1997, Spahn Ranch had pared themselves down to the three-piece unit of Green, Maroulis and Lewis. Spahn Ranch continued to release albums throughout the late 1990s. Architecture, released in 1997, featured contributions from Killing Joke/Prong bassist Paul Raven and Rockats/Nancy Sinatra guitarist Danny B. Harvey. This album took an even more experimental approach to the Spahn Ranch sound, incorporating elements of drum and bass, dub and for the first time, live guitar parts.. Beat Noir, in 1998, followed a similar path even further and included work with Bauhaus/Love & Rockets bassist David J. The compilation Anthology 1992-1994 was released in 2000 and contained the band's first four releases in addition to previously unreleased material. The band regularly toured throughout North America during their existence with the likes of Front Line Assembly, Front 242, Switchblade Symphony and Apoptygma Berzerk. Spahn Ranch also made a couple of European treks prior to their demise as a group in 2000. Closure, their final album, was recorded in 2000 and released in 2001.

He enjoyed a resurgence of international attention in the 1980s as a result of his starring role in Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). Early life and education Neville was born in Willesden, London, the son of Mabel Lillian (n√©e Fry) and Reginald Daniel Neville, a lorry driver. He was educated at Willesden and Chiswick County Schools for Boys, and after service in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before starting his professional career as a member of the Trent Players.Hayward, Anthony \\"John Neville: Shakespearean actor and director who became a theatrical force in Canada \\", The Independent, 26 November 2011 CareerUnited Kingdom= Neville was a West End star of the 1950s, hailed as \\"one of the most potent classical actors of the Richard Burton‚ÄìPeter O'Toole generation\\".Jeremy Lewis, \\"A Real Class Act\\", Nottingham Post, 5 March 1999 A leading member of London's Old Vic Company, he played many classical leading roles, including Romeo in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (a role he repeated on American television for the anthology series Producers' Showcase), and an acclaimed Richard in Richard II, with Virginia McKenna as Queen Anne. He also alternated with Richard Burton the parts of Othello and Iago in Othello. He was a frequent performer at the Bristol Old Vic. He received good reviews in the musical adaptation of Lolita, called Lolita, My Love, which closed in Boston. Known for his classical good looks and mellifluous voice, the young Neville was regularly described as the young John Gielgud's natural successor. For a while, he took over the leading role of Nestor Le Frip√© from Keith Michell in the original West End production of the musical Irma La Douce, with Elizabeth Seal as Irma. He returned to the London stage for a brief period in 1963, playing the title role in Alfie by Bill Naughton, but by then his theatrical commitment lay outside London. In 1961, his weekly pay declining from ¬£200 to ¬£50, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, becoming joint artistic director with Frank Dunlop and Peter Ustinov when the current Playhouse opened in 1963. It became one of Britain's leading regional repertory theatres. Though Dunlop and Ustinov soon left, Neville remained at the theatre until 1967, when he resigned over funding disputes with the local authority and the Arts Council. Neville starred as the Duke of Marlborough in the BBC2 serial The First Churchills (1969), a major television role which also maintained his international profile when the show was broadcast as the very first Masterpiece Theatre series in the United States in 1971. =Canada= With his family, he left Britain in 1972 and devoted his later career to the Canadian theatre, taking up the post of artistic director at the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton, Alberta (1973‚Äì78). He later took similar positions with the Neptune Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1978‚Äì83) and other Canadian theatre companies, including as artistic director of the Stratford Festival of Canada from 1985 to 1989, as well as continuing his acting career. On top of his artistic decisions, Neville helped eliminate the Neptune's deficit with canny promotions, such as giving free tickets to the local taxi drivers and their families, correctly anticipating the recipients to enthusiastically discuss the theatre to passengers and tourists. Director Terry Gilliam cast him as the lead in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). In the film, Neville plays the character at three different stages of his life; in his 30s, his 50s and his 70s. From 1995 to 1998, Neville had a prominent recurring role in The X-Files television series as The Well Manicured Man, and in 1998, he reprised the role in the feature film The X-Files. Although he made numerous other television appearances and occasional film roles, the main focus of Neville's career was always on the theatre. In his later years, Neville had numerous cameo appearances in films, including primate of the Anglican Church in Australia in The Man Who Sued God and an admiral in the Earth Space Navy in The Fifth Element.

He was shot dead gangland-style in the underpass leading to the Illinois Central Randolph Street station on the afternoon on June 9, 1930, as dozens of people watched. The man convicted of the murder was German-American mob associate Leo Vincent Brothers. Lingle was initially lionized as a martyred journalist, but it was eventually revealed that he was involved in racketeering with the Capone organization and that his death had more to do with his own criminal activities than his journalism. Early life Jake Lingle was born July 1891 and raised on the West Side of Chicago. When he was eight years old, his parents converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism. He received an education up to the eighth grade at John Calhoun North Elementary. His childhood friend William F. Russell later became the chief of police in Chicago. Before becoming an office boy for the Chicago Tribune, Lingle played semi-professional baseball and worked for a surgical supply company. Career Jake Lingle began his career in journalism in 1912. Lingle was known for his work as a legman covering gang-related crime stories. He reported from the scene by telephone to a writer at the Chicago Tribune office and then that person would write up his story. During this period, Lingle made connections outside journalism, and while he earned $65 a week reporting, he had an annual income of $60,000. Death In Chicago, on the afternoon of June 9, 1930, Lingle left the Sherman House Hotel, where he had conversed with some power brokers, to catch the 1:30 pm train to a racetrack in Homewood where he gambled on horses. On his way through the Randolph Street Terminal, he was followed by two men. One of them, described as thin, with blonde hair, and blue eyes, raised his .38 caliber pistol and shot Lingle once directly in the back of the head, killing him. =Investigation= The police sent 664 hoodlums out to perform what they called a \\"manhunt\\" in Chicago. To find the killer quickly, the Chicago Tribune told readers the newspaper would give them a $25,000 reward if they had information that led them to the killer. Other local newspaper companies said they would throw in an extra $30,000. In January 1931, the police received a tip and arrested a man by the name of Leo V. Brothers from St. Louis. Many people swore that he was Lingle's killer. Others, including Brothers, denied his involvement. Convicted, Brothers was given the minimum sentence for murder of 14 years, and he served 8 years of the sentence. =Discoveries= Lingle's death brought to the public's attention his connections with gangsters. Lingle turned out to have been setting the price of beer in Chicago and involved in organized dog racing and gambling. He had maintained two homes plus a suite at the Morrison Hotel and had a six-figure stockbroker account. High-placed friends of his in the police department resigned. Not only did some people discover what Lingle's occupation really was, but also they learned about the gangs and about those with whom Lingle was associated. =Reactions= Once other journalists learned about Jake Lingle's association with mobsters and his gambling activity, they began questioning the Chicago Tribune about it. In response, the Tribune said that it had not been aware of Lingle's activities. However, Frank Wilson, an IRS agent, said Robert McCormick, who was the Tribune's proprietor, had arranged a meeting between Lingle and himself when he was investigating the Al Capone case, and claimed this proved that the Tribune knew about Jake Lingle's involvement with gangs. In popular culture The 1931 film The Finger Points was loosely based on Lingle's life and death, and starred Richard Barthelmess as the reporter, Fay Wray as his love interest, and Clark Gable as the gangster who corrupts him. In 1959, the Jake Lingle murder was dramatized on a television episode of The Untouchables. In the 1959 film Al Capone, Martin Balsam played a fictional corrupt reporter named Mac Keely, who was Lingle in all but name. In the 1979 film The Lady in Red, Lingle is seen as the reporter harassing John Dillinger's escort/girlfriend, Polly Hamilton (called \\"Polly Franklin\\" in this film). But this is fiction, as Dillinger first met Hamilton in 1934, four years after Lingle's murder. The 1988 novel by Howard Browne, Pork City, depicts Lingle's murder and the subsequent investigation by the Cook County State's Attorney's office. In the 1993 series, The Untouchables, Jake Lingle's murder is depicted in the two- part story, \\"Murder Ink,\\" and is portrayed by David Perkovich.

It is known locally as The Mother Church of Tidewater Virginia. The church was built in 1857-1858, and is a rectangular stuccoed brick church. It features a centrally located, three-stage tower with spire. Also on the property is the contributing rectory. It is a three-story, rectangular brick building in the Late Gothic Revival style. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The associated Saint Mary's Catholic Cemetery was added in 2001. History Beginnings = The parish began in 1791 as Saint Patrick Church founded by French Catholics fleeing the French Revolution who were joined by some of the earliest Irish Catholic immigrants to the United States. St. Patrick's was the oldest parish in the Richmond Diocese and predated the formation of the diocese by 29 years. =19th century= The first church edifice was built in 1842, but was destroyed by fire in 1856.Catholic News Agency: \\"Rebuilt from the ashes: The story of an American basilica\\" By Adelaide Mena July 4, 2017 The present building was completed in 1858 and was rededicated under the title of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception in commemoration of the Marian dogma proclaimed in 1854 by Pope Pius IX. Since it was in the Southern United States, the racially segregated Christian church was for whites only. Fr. Matthew O‚ÄôKeefe initiated permitting African American Catholics to sit in an assigned portion of the choir loft for their use only.youtube.com: Fr. Matthew O‚ÄôKeefe Local Know Nothing movement anti-Catholics threatened him unless the church instituted segregated Masses, which he refused. Thugs tried to intimidate white parishioners until Fr. O‚ÄôKeefe obtained police protection. Diocesan records show that local Catholic families believed the Know Nothings ignited the fire that destroyed St. Patrick's in 1856. \\"The Assumption,\\" a painting donated by King Louis Philippe and Queen Am√©lie of France, fell victim to the flames. The Josephite Fathers arrived in Norfolk from Richmond in 1889. By September of that year, the separate Saint Joseph's Black Catholic parish was founded to serve the religious needs of the city's African American community. When Fr. Matthew O'Keefe moved north to Maryland, he would modeled his new church after St. Mary's. Completed in 1906, Church of the Immaculate Conception in Towson shares the blueprints of St. Mary's with the exceptions of a larger rose window rather than a spire, thicker interior columns, and brownstone accents to the buttress and windows. Father O'Keefe, the first pastor of the new St. Mary's and Immaculate Conception, is buried beneath the altar of the latter. =20th century= In 1961, seventy-two years after its founding, Saint Joseph's Black Catholic parish was clustered with Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception. After an extensive renovation and restoration program, the newly renovated and restored edifice was rededicated on November 1, 1989. Today, St. Mary's Catholic Church is ninety-nine percent African American congregants. The parish formerly supported St. Mary Academy, an inner-city school that provided a Christian education to hundreds of urban children, most of whom were non-Catholic; however, circumstances forced the academy to close. The parish also operates a soup kitchen and provides other outreach to Norfolk's poor and homeless.  Minor basilica  On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the church, December 8, 1991, Pope John Paul II proclaimed the Church of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception a minor basilica, the only one in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the only one with African-American predominance: > \\"Your Black cultural heritage enriches the Church and makes her witness of > universality more complete. In a real way the Church needs you, just as you > need the Church, for you are a part of the Church and the church is part of > you.\\" Gallery Image:St. Mary's Church, Norfolk, VA.JPGSt. Mary's Church, September 2013 Image:St Marys, Norfolk 1.jpgSpire from Virgin Street Image:St Marys, Norfolk 3.jpgFerris and Stuart Organ (1858) File:St Marys, Norfolk 4.jpgGothic Revival style vaults, chancel, and altar ReferencesExternal links *The Basilica of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Churches in Norfolk, Virginia Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:African-American Roman Catholicism Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Norfolk, Virginia Category:Basilicas (Catholic Church) Category:Basilicas Category:Basilica churches Category:Basilica churches in the United States Category:Roman Catholic church buildings in North America Category:Catholic churches in the United States Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Baltimore Category:Catholic Church in Virginia Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore Category:Minor basilicas Category:Minor basilicas in the United States Category:African-American Roman Catholic churches ","title":"Basilica of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception (Norfolk, Virginia)"},{"id":"2013789","text":"Tripterygium wilfordii, or l√©i g≈çng t√©ng (Mandarin) (Chinese:Èõ∑ÂÖ¨Ëó§, Japanese: raik≈çt≈ç), sometimes called thunder god vine but more properly translated thunder duke vine, is a vine used in traditional Chinese medicine. Tripterygium wilfordii has been promoted for use in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis; however, due to safety concerns this use is not recommended. Evidence is insufficient to deem it effective as a method of birth control.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has noted tentative evidence that T. wilfordii may improve some RA symptoms. Serious side effects, however, occur frequently enough to make the risks of taking it higher than the possible benefits. Side effects At medicinal doses, T. wilfordii extract can have significant side effects, including immunosuppression.

The name Maisons comes from Medieval Latin Mansiones, meaning \\"the houses\\". At the creation of the commune during the French Revolution, the name of the hamlet of Alfort was joined with the name of Maisons. The name Alfort comes from the manor built there by Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford (England), in the middle of the 13th century. The name of this Manor of Hereford was corrupted into Harefort, then Hallefort, and eventually Alfort. The National Veterinary School of Alfort was settled several centuries later in the manor and its estate. History On 1 April 1885, 40% of the territory of Maisons-Alfort was detached and became the commune of Alfortville.

History Lobbying for a high school south of Hobart to take students from Sandy Bay, Taroona, and the Channel district happened in 1952. The school opened in 1958. Funds from the commonwealth government were made available in 1968 to construct new science laboratories. Nine students were hurt and hospitalized after an explosion following a reaction of sodium with water on 2 May 1985. On 3 July 1990 two students and a teacher from the school drowned in Mystery Creek Cave near Lune River. A new technology and design centre opened in 1995. After someone started a fire with paper towels in the boys toilet, A block had to be evacuated on 9 October 2009. School houses were called Crayfish, Gellibrand, Cartwright and Droughty after land prominences into the Derwent River. Rhodes scholars from Taroona High are Michael Buchanan (1989), Jessica Radford (2004), Abishek Sharma (2005), Alex Shabala (2008), Robert Hortle (2014),, Bede Jones (2016), and Brook Dambacher (2019).

A small sandy beach on the northeast side is called Dixons Beach. A creek runs in a north east direction north of the buildings and main oval, and meets the sea between the car park and the archery field. This is called School Creek. To the south of the school campus is its access road, Meath Avenue and Melinga Place. The rock beneath the school is Paleogene sandstone and conglomerate. A boulder bed formed in the Paleogene makes up the point. A bed of tuff just to the south of A block heads east-northeast to the coast and southwest inland. The whole region north from Belhaven Avenue to School Creek is unstable ground undergoing a slow moving landslide called \\"School Creek Landslide\\". This started hundreds of years ago before there were any buildings constructed. Movement to the northwest is happening, the tennis court moved about 40 mm in 11 years, and a survey marker near the road entrance has shifted 0.4 m since 1961. Several smaller landslips are parasitic or nearby. These are the Archery Field Landslip, north of the creek; the Dixons Beach Landslip and Carpark Landslip which moved a couple of meters in the late 1980s; and Channel Highway Landslip between the Channel Highway and the primary school.

Non-descendant refers to any young who is not the direct genetic offspring of the individual, but does not exclude related young such as siblings or grandchildren. Individuals providing this care are referred to using the neutral term of alloparent (or 'helper'). Alloparental care encapsulates a diverse range of parenting systems across a range of animal groups and social structures. The alloparent-young relationship can be mutualistic or parasitic, and between or within species. Cooperative breeding, joint brood care, reciprocal allonursing, brood parasitism and cuckoldry represent situations in which alloparenting plays a role.  Theory  In biology, ethology and sociology, alloparental care is defined as any form of parental care, which is directed towards non-descendant young. It was first used by Edward O. Wilson in 1975, in his book Sociobiology in an attempt to define a neutral term which could encapsulate the gender and relation specific terms of 'aunite' and 'auncle' which had previously been coined in the literature to describe this sort of behaviour. In addition, Wilson used the term alloparent (or helper) to refer to the individuals providing the care, and proposed allomaternal and allopaternal as phrases that could be used to distinguish the sex of the helper. The word alloparent roughly translates to \\"other-parent\\" based on the Greek root \\"allo\\", meaning other, and the Latin root \\"parens\\", meaning parent. Alloparenting encapsulates a diverse range of parenting systems and behaviours. Simply, it can be understood as a system of parenting in which individuals other than the direct genetic parents act in a parental role, either for a short, or extended period of time. This definition does not exclude alloparents who are genetically 'related' to the offspring, such as siblings and aunts, who are often observed as 'helpers at the nest'. In instances where this is the case, the alloparent and the offspring share a degree of relatedness (r [the coefficient of relatedness] > 0), and therefore kin selection is often involved in the evolution of the behaviour. Use of the term non-descendant young, as opposed to non-related young is therefore an important distinction in the definition of alloparenting. The non-descendant young in whom the alloparent invests can be conspecific (of the same species) or heterospecific (of a different species), a phenomenon often observed in fish and a select number of bird species. There is some debate as to whether interspecific alloparenting (caring for the young of another species) constitutes 'true' alloparental care, particularly when the relationship is parasitic for the alloparent, and the care being directed is therefore 'misdirected' or constitutes a maladaptive behaviour. Though such parasitic relationships, such as what occurs with cuckoo chicks, were not specifically addressed by Edward O. Wilson in his original discussion, adoption and slavery across species in ants was discussed; a relationship which could be described as parasitic for the heterospecific young. This article will consider interspecific and parasitic alloparental behaviours to satisfy the definition of alloparental care. Alloparental investment In 1972, Robert Trivers defined parental investment as: \\"any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parents ability to invest in other offspring\\" (Trivers, 1972). This concept of parental investment applies to the alloparent in the same way that it does to the genetic parent; however, any investment into the production of gametes, which Trivers included in his definition, is not relevant, and is therefore usually restricted to behavioral considerations for the alloparent. Possible forms of investment provided by an alloparent can be defined by three of the four classifications of energy expenditure proposed by Crawford and Balon (1996): * Type II ‚Äì Preparing for the offspring prior to zygotic development in terms of nest/den building and territory defense. * Type III ‚Äì Direct provisioning of food for the young. * Type IV ‚Äì Tending to, caring for, feeding, defending and teaching the young. Given that the alloparent is never the genetic parent, and was therefore not involved in the reproductive behavior/copulation that produced the young, the Type I classification, 'energy investment in gametes', is not relevant when we consider alloparental investment. Classification The forms of alloparental care which occur in nature are numerous and varied and resist classification. Relationships between the alloparent and the young, and the alloparent and the genetic parent, range from cooperative and mutualistic to exploitative and parasitic. The below outline provides one classification for the many forms of alloparenting which have been observed: ='True' (mutualistic)= This form of alloparenting is characterized by interactions/relationships which provide and overall fitness benefit to the alloparent, the young, and the genetic parent. This sort of parental care is often closely tied to social organisation and is thus very common in advanced animal societies such as primates. It can take on the forms of: * Cooperative breeding ‚Äì This system of breeding is characterised by individuals (alloparents) who delay or forego their personal reproduction in order to assist in the reproduction of other individuals within the group, often a dominant breeding pair. The alloparent 'helpers' are most commonly the siblings of the new offspring, or siblings to the breeding pair. This system is common amongst birds, primates and mammals such as the blackbacked jackal, and African wild dogs who share in pup feeding and display 'babysitting' behaviour. Cooperative breeding is often provided as strong evidence in support of kin selection. Cooperative breeding, particularly in birds, is favored in marginal environments where food is limited or there are high predation rates and it is therefore tough for a breeding pair to successfully raise young on their own. Newly independent young may also find alloparenting the most successful reproduction option available to them in environments where the resources are scarce or there is habitat saturation. An extreme case of cooperative breeding is what occurs in eusocial insects such as some bee and ant species where a caste system has evolved and workers forgo their personal reproduction to aid in the reproductive success of the colony, gaining indirect fitness benefits through assisting related young. * Joint brood care ('babysitting') ‚Äì Communal care of broods is similar to cooperative breeding, but more commonly involves a number of reproductive pairs or mothers. Sometimes referred to as 'babysitting' or reciprocal cooperation, this system of parenting allows the genetic parents greater foraging freedom, and appears to be supported by the mutual benefits participating individuals acquire through reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism involves individuals performing acts to increase the fitness of another individual, in the hope that the act will be reciprocated. It is not dependent on relatedness, and therefore, babysitting behaviour is often observed amongst non-kin. This form of alloparental care has been observed in reindeer and elk who display reciprocal allonursing and form 'nursery' herds, and vampire bats who display reciprocity in food sharing. Babysitting females are frequently observed in primate species, such as the ring-tailed lemur, vervet monkeys, rhesus macaques and langurs. The formation of nursery groups has also been reported in the Atlantic bottle-nose dolphin and sperm whales. There are some cases in which brood amalgamation between two species has been observed. In Lake Malawi, cichlid parents are seen to 'farm out' their brood into the brood a potential predator, the Bagrus meridionalis catfish, and remain to help defend against predators. Intriguingly, the catfish's care of heterospecific young is mutualistic for all parties. Reed warbler feeding a common cuckoo chick in a nest. An example of brood parasitism. ='Misdirected' (parasitic)= Relationships between 'parents' and young that are in some way parasitic, perhaps resulting from reproductive errors or maladaptive behaviour, constitute an interesting and somewhat hazy form of alloparental care. In some cases, alloparents may find themselves investing in heterospecific young, and gaining none, or very little overall fitness benefit. Although ultimately maladaptive, this sort of behaviour may be supported by an inability of parents to recognise their own young (for example stolen fertilisations in fish), or supernormal stimuli 'enslaving' the alloparent into providing the care, as is seen in the case of brood parasitism of the cuckoo bird. The genetic parents and the young are not exempt to parasitism and exploitation either. In some species of fish, males exhibit zygote stealing, or alloparents may kidnap free-swimming young to help reduce selective pressures on their own brood. In some cases, alloparents may exploit young in order to receive immediate benefits. In some primate species, low ranking individuals, particularly males, will temporarily care for young in order to increase social status, gain reproductive benefits or use them for 'agonistic buffering', often with little concern for the welfare of the young. Two well-documented types of parasitic or misdirected alloparenting are: * Brood parasitism: this is where the genetic parent will leave their young in either the care of a conspecific or heterospecific alloparent who commonly has a brood of their own. * Cuckoldry: this occurs in many colonially breeding bird species where extra-pair copulations may take place and the males end up caring for unrelated offspring.  Benefits To the alloparent= Benefits acquired by the alloparent are dependent on the form of alloparental care, but range from: * Indirect fitness benefits gained via kin selection * Parental experience: gaining mothering/parental practice through 'babysitting' can increase the likelihood that the alloparents future genetic offspring will survive. * Increase in social rank * Extra-pair breeding opportunities/acquisition of mates * Protection from predation during cooperative breeding or joint brood care. * 'Agonistic buffering': individuals may enlist the influence of young within a group as protection during aggressive interactions. * Acquisition of home territory following cooperative breeding * Increased survival of genetic offspring during joint brood care =To the young= Black-backed jackal pups playing In almost all forms of alloparenting, the young receives an overall fitness benefit from the care provided. In cooperative breeding or joint brood care, the presence of 'helpers' at the nest or den will usually increase the young's probability of surviving. This has been observed in a number of species including the black- backed jackal (Canis mesomelas). In a study of jackal groups in Tanzania spanning three and a half years, it was found that the presence of sibling helpers in the den had a significant positive correlation to offspring survivorship. Through helping feed the mother and her pups, guarding the litter, and contributing to their grooming and learning of how to hunt, each helper in addition to the parents, added 1.5 surviving pups to the litter. By helping raise their full siblings, with whom they share a coefficient of relatedness of , the helpers were benefiting from increasing their inclusive fitness. =In cooperative breeding= In cooperative breeding, mothers are able to conserve energy, travel further away from nesting grounds to forage for food/supplies, maintain social interactions, and better protect their offspring from predators. The offspring that experience alloparental care benefit from increased protection from predators, development of social cues, and learning group dynamics through social interactions. The alloparents benefit as they are given the opportunity to gain mothering skills before they have reached reproductive age.Stanford, Craig B. \\"Costs and Benefits of Allomothering in Wild Capped Langurs (Presbytis Pileata)\\". Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, vol. 30, no. 1, 1992, pp. 29‚Äì34. The relationships formed through alloparenting have also been seen to enhance the stability of the family, herd, or community over time.Lee, P. C. \\"Allomothering among African Elephants\\". Animal Behaviour, vol. 35, no. 1, 1987, pp. 278‚Äì291/ CostsTo the young= In some instances of alloparental care the young are exploited, which may lead to mistreatment by the alloparent. An example of this is when male primates use young for 'agonistic buffering' during confrontations with dominant males. If the alloparents are inexperienced as parents, this could pose as a danger to the young. In some cases of brood amalgamation, young are positioned in a way that subjects them to greater predation risk than the genetic young of the alloparent. =To the alloparent= Alloparenting, given that the behaviour is often initiated by the alloparent, is rarely a costly act for the individual providing the care. Instances where the alloparent receives no benefits, or incurs a cost, generally involve parasitic relationships, where the individual has performed a reproductive mistake, or is misdirecting their parental care. Evolution In many discussions of alloparental care, the comment is often made that alloparenting can at first appear altruistic. This appearance stems from the fact that benefits to the alloparent are very rarely immediate, and any fitness benefits gained are indirect. Though alloparenting systems based on reciprocal altruism are well studied, purely altruistic care provided by an alloparent has not been observed. Two of the main evolutionary driving forces of alloparental behaviour are kin selection and reciprocal altruism. In cases where the alloparent and young share no degree of relatedness, other benefits to the alloparent will have contributed to the evolution of the behaviour, such as 'mothering-practice' or increased survivorship through association with a group. The cases where an evolution of such behaviour is most difficult to explain are parasitic relationships such as the cuckoo chick in the nest of a smaller host parent. Behavioral ecologists have cited supernormal stimuli, reproductive errors, or the inability of alloparents to recognize their young as explanations that may support this behaviour. In general, the occurrence of alloparental care is the result of both the life history traits of the species (how their evolution has predisposed them to behave), and the ecological conditions in which the individual finds themselves. =Evolution of cooperative breeding= Cooperative breeding constitutes a unique case of alloparenting with a specific evolution. It is a key example of where the evolution has been driven by the combination of life history traits and ecological factors, which act as the triggers. The first hypothesis put forward for the evolution of cooperative breeding was that a shortage of suitable breeding habitat encouraged young to remain at the nest or territory for a period of time before attempting to raise their own young. For example, habitat saturation was shown to be responsible for the occurrence of cooperative breeding in the Seychelles warbler, a small passerine bird. It was also observed that remaining at the nest correlated to a higher chance of inheriting the parent's territory. Additional ecological constraints have since been proposed as factors favoring cooperative breeding: * Reduced survival probability following dispersal *Reduced probability of finding a mate * Reduced chance of successful breeding once a territory has been established As a result, cooperative breeding is often seen in populations where there is: * High population density * Intense competition for food, territory and resources * Stable environment This has in turn selected for species producing a small number of offspring who require a large amount of parental care.  In nature  Barbary macaque with its young in Cap Carbon (Gouraya National Park). Alloparenting behavior is known from 120 mammal and 150 avian species. \\"In mammals, care typically encompasses allolactation, pup-feeding, babysitting and carrying young.\\" This is seen when male Barbary macaques carry around unrelated infants and care for them for hours at a time.\\"Alloparenting\\". unt.edu.

Another example is when warthog sows suckle piglets from other litters after the sows have lost their own litters. A mother sperm whale and her calf off the coast of Mauritius. ='Babysitting' in sperm whales= Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are deep diving cetaceans that exhibit alloparental care in the form of 'babysitting'. When the whales are young, they are not able to dive to and remain at the depths that their mothers frequent in order to graze and feed. Yet being left at the surface alone makes them vulnerable to predators like killer whales and sharks. Sperm whale social groups appear to modulate their diving behaviour in order to provide alloparental care to young within the group and reduce the time they spend alone at the surface, at the same time allowing the mother greater foraging freedom. They do this by changing the synchronicity of their dives to limit the time a young whale spends alone. As the 'babysitters' or alloparents dive and resurface the calves swim between them and therefore care is provided by a number of members within the social group. Bagrus meridionalis catfish in Lake Malawi =Interspecific brood amalgamation= In Lake Malawi, it has been observed that a select few species of cichlids will 'farm out' their young into catfish (Bagrus meridionalis) broods, a larger predatory fish. In many cases the cichlid parent will remain close by to participate in mutualistic defense of the young. In a study by Mckaye et al. (1985), 50% of observed catfish broods contained cichlid young; with the catfish offspring in these broods having six times greater survivorship. This increased survivorship of the alloparent's young has been linked to the dilution effect, and the way that the geometry of the interspecific school is manipulated such that the cichlid young are forced to the periphery, where they are more vulnerable to predation. It is through this manipulation that the catfish young gain greater protection from predators. Although placed in a more vulnerable position, the cichlid young still benefit from the interaction; both their genetic and 'allo' parents defend against predators (mutualistic defense), and being a mouth breeding species, this 'farming out' (which frees them from the mouth) may allow the cichlid young to forage more and grow faster. It has also been observed that the bagrid catfish alloparent will allow the cichlid young to feed off the skin on its dorsal surface. This case of interspecific brood care, which in some cases results in full adoption, is unique in that it is uncommon to see care of heterospecifics where the relationship is mutualistic for all parties.  In humans  Alloparenting in humans is a common form of parental care in a variety of cultures and can include care giving from siblings, grandparents, other relatives and unrelated family members such as teachers for providing learning and support. One particular example is a situation in which grandparents adopt a parental role. This is sometimes named a \\"skipped generation household\\". In 1997, 8% of children in the United States lived with their grandparents, with the grandparents being the caregivers in one third of those cases. According to Deihl,Deihl, Erin. \\"Cross-Cultural Perspective on Adolescent Parenting: Efe and Korea\\". oberlin.edu. Oberlin College. Archived from the original on September 15, 2006. Retrieved 2005-12-28. the Ef√© people of Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo practice alloparenting, with care for infants coming from siblings, grandparents, and older members of the community. Deihl states that where siblings are alloparents this provides adolescents experience of being a parent.  Human psychology in alloparenting  The traditional model of child psychology in relation to parents is called, \\"Classical Attachment\\" in which the child has a strong attachment to one figure (the mother). In alloparenting communities, attachment theory suggest that the same sort of bond is shared between the child and multiple community members. This has potential advantages for the child and the parents. The child has a diversified network of caregivers which can provide intimate emotional support. The parent's cost of child rearing goes down as well as the emotional cost and cost of tangible resources. According to The US National Library of Medicine, alloparenting has proven to activate portions of the brain that are correlated with decreasing stress levels.

Properties The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G8 Ib, where the luminosity class of Ib indicates this is a lower luminosity supergiant star. Alternatively, it may be a star that has passed through the asymptotic giant branch stage and possesses a detached shell of dust. The estimated mass of this star is over 19 times the mass of the Sun, and it has expanded to a radius measured at around 105‚Äì175 times that of the Sun. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Epsilon Geminorum is radiating around 8,500 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,662 K. It is this temperature that gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. A surface magnetic field with a strength of has been detected on this star. This topologically complex field is most likely generated by a dynamo formed from the deep convection zone in the star's outer envelope. Occultations Epsilon Geminorum lies near the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon or a planet. Such an occultation took place on April 8, 1976 by Mars, which allowed the oblateness of the planet's outer atmosphere to be measured. Epsilon Geminorum was occulted by Mercury on June 10, 1940, and on September 3, 2015 it was occulted by the asteroid Iphigenia.

It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe. Interests of its members include basic and applied aspects of viruses, prions, bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasma, fungi, algae and protozoa, and all other aspects of microbiology. Its headquarters is at 14‚Äì16 Meredith Street, London. The Society's current president is Prof. Judy Armitage. The Society is a member of the Science Council. History The society was founded on 16 February 1945 as the Society for General Microbiology. Its first president was Alexander Fleming. The Society's first academic meeting was in July 1945 and its first journal, the Journal of General Microbiology (later renamed Microbiology), was published in 1947. A symposium series followed in 1949, and a sister journal, the Journal of General Virology, in 1967. The society purchased its own headquarters in Reading in 1971, after initially sharing accommodation with the Biochemical Society in London. In 2014 the Society moved to Charles Darwin House, London, sharing the premises with several other learned societies. In 2015, the Society changed its name to the Microbiology Society, after its members voted in favour of the change. In 2019 the Society moved to its new headquarters at 14‚Äì16 Meredith Street, London. Activities The Society currently organises a large Annual Conference and a number of smaller Focused Meetings, which cover a specific microbiology discipline. It publishes a magazine, Microbiology Today (formerly SGM Quarterly), and academic journals in virology and microbiology: *Microbiology *International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology *Journal of General Virology *Journal of Medical Microbiology *Microbial Genomics *Access Microbiology *JMM Case Reports (now closed) Society Prizes The Microbiology Society awards a range of prizes in recognition of significant contributions to microbiology. In 2009, the Society announced the Society for General Microbiology Prize Medal, awarded annually to a microbiologist of international standing whose work has had a far-reaching impact beyond microbiology. The first medal was awarded to Stanley Prusiner. The recipient of the Prize Medal gives a lecture based on the work for which the award has been made, which is usually published in a Society journal. In 2015, the prize was renamed the Microbiology Society Prize Medal. The Marjory Stephenson Prize is awarded annually for an outstanding contribution of current importance in microbiology. The winner receives ¬£1000 and gives a lecture on his/her work at a Society meeting. The lecture is usually published in a society journal. Marjory Stephenson was the second president of the Society (1947‚Äì1949) and a distinguished pioneer of chemical microbiology. The Fleming Prize Lecture is awarded annually to recognise outstanding research in any branch of microbiology by a microbiologist in the early stages of his/her career. Sir Alexander Fleming was the first President of the Society (1945-1947) and received a Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin. The Sir Howard Dalton Young Microbiologist of the Year Competition is presented annually to a Society member who is a PhD student or early-career postdoctoral researcher. The competition is judged on the participants‚Äô oral or poster presentations at Society conferences. The prize was renamed in 2009 in honour of the late Howard Dalton. The Peter Wildy Prize Lecture is awarded annually for contribution to microbiology education or communication. It is named after Peter Wildy, a virologist and was established in 2001.

Surroundings Œ∑ Gem (right), Œº Gem (left), and the nebulosity between them Œ∑ Geminorum lies at the foot of the Castor side of Gemini, about two degrees west of Œº Geminorum and two degrees southeast of the bright open cluster M35. Between the two stars are several faint areas of nebulosity. Œ∑ Gem just to the west of the supernova remnant shell IC 443. Further east around Œº Gem is the emission nebula S249. In between is the small faint emission nebula IC 444 around the 7th magnitude 12 Geminorum. Œ∑ Geminorum is 0.9 degree south of the ecliptic, so it can be occulted by the Moon and, rarely, by planets. The last occultation by a planet took place on July 27, 1910, by Venus, and the next to last on July 11, 1837, by Mercury. Variability In 1865, Julius Schmidt first reported that Œ∑ Geminorum was a variable star. The light variations were described by Schmidt and other observers as having long maxima of constant brightness, minima of greatly varying size and shape, and a period around 231 days. The star was classified as both a semiregular variable and an eclipsing variable. The eclipse period has been set at about eight years, corresponding to the orbit of an unseen companion. The eclipses have been questioned many times, but special observations are still been made at the times of predicted eclipses. The semi-regular variations have been classified as type SRa, indicating relatively predictable periodicity with some variations in amplitude and light curve shape. These types of variable are considered to be very similar to Mira variables, but with smaller amplitudes. Many long-period variables show long secondary periods, typically ten times longer than the main period, but these changes have not been detected for Œ∑ Geminorum. The main period has been refined to an average of 234 days. System WISE infrared image) Œ∑ Geminorum is a triple system, with the luminous class M star having a close companion known only from radial velocity variations, and a more distant companion resolved visually. In 1881, Burnham observed that Œ∑ Geminorum had a close companion (Œ∑ Gem B). At that time the separation was measured to be 1.08\\". This has now increased to 1.65\\" and an orbit has been calculated to be 474 years long and rather eccentric. Little is known about the companion, although it is 6th magnitude. It is given a G0 spectral type and is assumed to be a giant on the basis of its brightness. In 1902, William Wallace Campbell reported that Œ∑ Geminorum A showed radial velocity variations. The assumption was that the star was a spectroscopic binary, although no period or other orbital parameters were determined. An orbit calculated in 1944 is essentially unchanged today, with a period of 2,983 days and an eccentricity of 0.53. Observations were made looking for sign of eclipses corresponding to the derived orbit, but the evidence was regarded as inconclusive. Due to the appearance of the spectrum, the spectroscopic companion is suspected to be a fainter M-class star. Evolution The luminous main component of Œ∑ Geminorum is an asymptotic giant branch star, a highly evolved cool luminous star that was originally on the main sequence. How the system contains 3 evolved stars with very different masses remains to be seen. Namesakes USS Propus (AK-132) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.

It is from the town of Northampton. Governance The village is in the area of South Northamptonshire District Council and Harpole and Grange ward, together with the villages of Milton Malsor, Gayton, Harpole and Kislingbury. The ward had a total population of 1,721 in the 2001 census. The village is part of the Daventry constituency. History The Berry ringworks are medieval fortifications built and occupied from the late Anglo-Saxon period to the later 12th century. They are situated between the junction of North Street and Church Street and were small defended areas of buildings surrounded partly or completely by large ditches and earthworks topped by wooden palisades. They are rare nationally. The Berry is the site of a ringwork which stood at the centre of medieval Rothersthorpe. The site is irregularly shaped with a wide ditch on the north and west sides. There are the remains of an inner rampart in the north east corner and southern end. Features in the west of the interior of the works show the locations of former buildings. Remains of ridge and furrow farming are on the eastern side. Murder The remains of Andrzej Kulesza, 27, were found in a field in the village in April 2011 by a woman walking her dog and confirmed as his in July 2011. A ¬£20,000 reward was offered for information about his kidnap and murder. He disappeared from his home in Stamford Hill in September 2010 after going out to shop.

The M1 motorway with the Northampton (formerly known as Rothersthorpe) Service Area and junction 15A is nearby but mostly out of hearing as the prevailing wind is south-westerly. There is, however, light pollution from the service area and a large area of warehouses in the nearby area of Northampton. The Northampton Arm of the Grand Union Canal, built in 1815 passes near to Rothersthorpe. Seventeen locks, taking the canal into Northampton and its junction with the River Nene, takes about two hours for a boat to travel through. Banbury Lane road bridge crossing the West Coast Main Line south of the village The village is bisected by the Banbury Lane, an ancient drovers' road along which cattle were once taken to market in Banbury from as far afield as Scotland. Along this road a mile or so south was a level crossing with the West Coast Main Line railway route from London Euston to Glasgow, Scotland. The crossing was one of few left on the line and the first outside Euston, some 65 miles south. The level crossing and an adjacent bridge over the Grand Union Canal were replaced by a curved bridge in 2005. This was for safety reasons following projected speed increases to 125 miles per hour on the line operated by tilting Class 390 Pendolino trains.

It is the third-brightest star in the Pleiades open star cluster (M45); the most visible stars in this group are named for the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology. Properties The Pleiades Cluster in infrared with Electra at the very top of the frame The star has an apparent brightness of 3.72, the third-brightest of the stars in the group. Electra belongs to the spectral class B6 IIIe and is approximately 400 light-years from the Sun. The Pleiades cluster is thought to be 444 light-years away. The projected rotational velocity of this star is 181 km/s, making it a fast rotator. This is the velocity component of the star's equatorial rotation along the line of sight to the Earth. The estimated inclination of the star's pole is , giving it a true equatorial rotational velocity of . The rapid rotation rate of this star flattens the poles and stretch the equator. This makes the surface gravity of the star non-uniform and causes temperature variation. This effect is known as gravity darkening, because it results in a variation of radiation by latitude. The rapid rotation extends the life span of the star by increasing the core density and reducing the radiation output. This is classified as a Be star, which is a B-type star with prominent emission lines of hydrogen in its spectrum. The Be stars have a rotation rate that is 1.5‚Äì2 times the rotation of normal B-type stars. This high rate of rotation may allow mass loss during even minor prominences. Changes in the radial velocity measurements indicate that this star may have a companion, which would make Electra a spectroscopic binary. Infrared observations of this star showed an excess level of radiation equal to about 0.5 magnitudes. This emission is probably from a gaseous disk created by radiation-driven mass loss and rapid rotation of the star. These disks are created by an ejection of material roughly every ten years, which then settles into the equatorial plane about the star. However, the bright nebulosity that surrounds this star makes the observation uncertain. Nomenclature 17 Tauri is the star's Flamsteed designation. It bore the traditional name Electra. Electra was one of the Pleiades sisters in Greek mythology. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars.

The FCX Clarity had electric car qualities such as zero emissions while offering five minute refueling times and long range in a full function large sedan. It was the first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle available to retail customers. Production began in June 2008 with leasing in the U.S. commenced in July 2008. It was introduced in Japan in November 2008. The FCX Clarity was available for lease in the U.S., Japan and Europe. In the U.S., it was only available to customers who live in Southern California where several hydrogen fuel stations are available. FCX Clarity were leased for a month in 2010, including collision coverage, maintenance, roadside assistance and hydrogen fuel. There were around 10 others on lease in Japan and another 10 in Europe in 2009. One of the reasons for such a low number of cars in the U.S. was a lack of hydrogen filling stations.

A separate display shows the battery power level and another shows motor output. A speedometer is placed above the cockpit display, to make it easy for the driver to keep eyes on the road. In the interior, upholstery on the seats and door linings are made with Honda's plant-derived Bio-Fabric. = Production = The FCX Clarity was produced in Japan at a dedicated fuel-cell-vehicle assembly line in the Honda Automobile New Model Center (Takanezawa-machi, Shioya-gun, Tochigi Prefecture). The fuel cell stack itself is produced at Honda Engineering Co., Ltd. (Haga-machi, Haga-gun, Tochigi Prefecture). It is reported that Honda plans to offer hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at costs competitive with gasoline mid-size cars by 2020 although its 2005 hand-built predecessor to the Clarity cost about $1 million. In July 2014 Honda announced the FCX Clarity would be discontinued and replaced by a new and higher-volume hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle to be introduced. = Running costs = It is reported in 2009 that hydrogen made from natural gas cost about $5 to $10 per kilogram in California, and after compression cost and transportation cost, retails for $12-$14 per kilogram. Although it was more than double the equivalent amount of gasoline during the summer of 2009, fuel-cell cars have double the efficiency of similar models with a gasoline engine. The FCX Clarity averaged 60 miles per kilogram of hydrogen. = Features = The FCX Clarity's features include an AM-FM car radio with CD player, integration for iPod and iPhone, a USB port, auxiliary input, a voice-activated GPS navigation system, XM satellite radio, cloth seating surfaces, Bluetooth, and digital instrumentation. = Reception = Since the car's unveil at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show, it was reported in May 2008 there were 50,000 people inquiring about the car through its Web site.  Honda Clarity (2016‚Äìpresent)  Fuel Cell = Retail deliveries of the 2017 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell began in Southern California in December 2016. The Clarity is available in 12 approved Honda dealerships located in select California markets, including six dealerships in Southern California, five in the San Francisco Bay Area, and one in Sacramento. The Clarity Fuel Cell, with range of , had the highest EPA driving range rating of any zero- emissions vehicle in the U.S, including fuel cell and battery electric vehicles, until the Hyundai Nexo was released in early 2019. The 2017 Clarity also has the highest combined and city fuel economy ratings among all hydrogen fuel cell cars rated by the EPA, with a combined city/highway rating of 67 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), and 68 MPGe in city driving. = Electric = In April 2016, Honda announced that in addition to the new generation Clarity Fuel Cell there are two additional variants ‚Äî the Clarity Electric and Clarity Plug-in Hybrid, which were both released in 2017. The all-electric Clarity EV with a 25.5 KWh battery has of range,Honda Clarity EV 80 miles range price and is only available for a three-year lease (US$199/month with US$899 down) for residents of California or Oregon.

The Clarity PHEV has an EPA-rated all-electric range of , with a total combined gas/electric range of . The equipped 1.5 L engine boasts an industry- leading 40 percent thermal efficiency. It is the only Clarity model available in all 50 U.S. states as well as Canada, where it was launched nationwide in the latter on December 14, 2017 starting at an MSRP of C$39,990, before available government incentives up to C$13,000. For the North American market, the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid is equipped with SAE J1772-2009 (Type 1) receptacle for 120-240 V Level 1 and 2 AC charging. Approximately 13 hours at Level 1 and 2.5 hours at Level 2 are needed to charge Clarity Plug-in Hybrid's battery to full. Rear viewThe Clarity PHEV was subsequently released in Japan on July 20, 2018, with an MSRP of ¬•5,880,600 including 8% consumption tax, with an advertised all-electric range of on the JC08 driving cycle or on the WLTP driving cycle. Compared to the North American model, the Japanese model includes an additional CHAdeMO DC fast charging connector, providing an 80% battery charge in 30 minutes. As of August 2019, the Clarity PHEV is stocked in the United States only at California dealerships, but it can still be ordered nationally.  Fuel economy ratings (fuel cell models)  The following table shows fuel economy ratings from the United States Environmental Protection Agency test procedures for both the 2014 FCX Clarity and the 2017 Clarity Fuel Cell, expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe).

Purchasers of the 2005 and 2006 Honda FCX were eligible for a Section 30B(b) income tax credit, but consumers were not allowed to purchase the vehicle, as it was only available leased in Southern California, where public hydrogen refueling stations are available. The tax credit expired in 2014. The leasing program began in July 2008 at a price of per month for three years which includes collision coverage, all maintenance and roadside assistance. Honda announced Power Honda Costa Mesa, Honda of Santa Monica and Scott Robinson Honda as the initial dealers, which were chosen for their proximity to hydrogen refueling stations. = Clarity FCV = The Clarity Fuel Cell is eligible for a federal tax credit of , as the tax credit for fuel-cell vehicles was given in December 2015 a short-term extension through the end of 2016. As a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV), the Clarity FCV is eligible for a purchase or lease rebate in California of through the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. However, Honda only currently offers the Clarity FCV for lease, so the federal incentives are retained by Honda rather than the lessee; leasee is able to receive the CVRP rebate from California. = Clarity Plug-in hybrid = Owners of the Clarity Plug-In Hybrid are eligible for a maximum tax credit through U.S. federal tax credit programs. Pace car in IndyCar series The Honda FCX Clarity was the pace car in 2008 Indy Japan 300 which took place at the Twin Ring Motegi in Tochigi, Japan, April 2008.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.89, bright enough to be readily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, it is roughly from the Sun. The three components are designated Pi Sagittarii A (officially named Albaldah , from the traditional name of the entire system), B and C.  Nomenclature  œÄ Sagittarii (Latinised to Pi Sagittarii) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as Pi Sagittarii A, B and C, derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system bore the traditional name Albaldah, which comes from the Arabic ÿ®ŸÑÿØÿ© b√°lda 'the town'. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Albaldah for the component Pi Sagittarii A on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU- approved Star Names. In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Nir al Beldat, which was translated into Latin as Lucida Oppidi, meaning 'the brightest of the town'. This system, together with Zeta Sagittarii and Sigma Sagittarii may have been the Akkadian Gu-shi-rab‚Äëba, 'the Yoke of the Sea'. In Chinese, (), meaning Establishment, refers to an asterism consisting of Pi Sagittarii, Xi¬≤ Sagittarii, Omicron Sagittarii, 43 Sagittarii, Ro¬π Sagittarii and Upsilon Sagittarii. Consequently,the Chinese name for Pi Sagittarii itself is (, .) AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) Â§©ÊñáÊïôËÇ≤Ë≥áË®äÁ∂≤ 2006 Âπ¥ 5 Êúà 11 Êó•  Properties  The spectrum of the system's primary, Pi Sagitarii A, matches a stellar classification of F2 II. The 'II' luminosity class is for a bright giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has followed an evolutionary track away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. Because it has nearly six times the mass of the Sun, it reached this stage in a mere 67 million years. The outer envelope is radiating energy at an effective temperature of about 6,590 K, giving it the yellow-white hue of an F-type star. Pi Sagittarii A has two nearby companions. The first is separated by 0.1 arcseconds, or at least 13 AUs. The second is 0.4 arcseconds away, which is 40 AU or more. Nothing is known about the orbits of these stars. Being 1.43 degrees north of the ecliptic, Pi Sagittarii can be occulted by the Moon, and, very rarely, by planets. The next occultation by a planet will be by Venus on February 17, 2035.

They are designed to lift smoke away from the locomotive at speed so that the driver has better visibility. On the South Australian Railways they are called \\"valances\\". Overview Smoke deflectors became increasingly common on later steam locomotives because the velocity of smoke exiting the chimney had been reduced as the result of efficiency gains obtained by improved smokebox design, such as the Kylchap exhaust and Giesl ejector. Styles Various styles of smoke deflectors have been used by different railway operators. However, many are essentially a variation of one of two designs of Windleitbleche (wind deflecting plates) developed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (the German State Railway Company) between the World Wars: the earlier, larger Wagner-type deflector, and the later, smaller Witte-type deflector, such as those found on preserved LNER Gresley A3 class 4472 Flying Scotsman. The Southern Railway in the UK was one of the first adopters and standardised on its own distinctive style where the deflectors only reached to halfway up the smokebox from the running plate. Wind tunnel testing showed that these less tall deflectors would adequately lift the smoke on the locomotives for which they were designed, without unduly detracting from the appearance.

He was a Bolshevik party member and Soviet officer in the wars fought abroad by the Soviet Union including the one against Polish as well as Ukrainian Republics and in Republican Spain. In 1939 he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland again. At the end of World War II in Europe he was installed as one of leaders of the Soviet-sponsored Polish Provisional Government of National Unity. Soon later, ≈öwierczewski died in a country-road ambush shot by the militants from OUN-UPA. He was an icon of communist propaganda for the following several decades. Life Born in Warsaw in Congress Poland, Karol ≈öwierczewski grew up in a poor family and began working at age 12 in a local Warsaw factory. During the First World War, at the age of 18 he was evacuated in 1915 to Moscow by the Russian Imperial Army. In 1918 he joined the Bolshevik Party, and fought in the Russian Civil War as a soldier of the Red Army. In 1919 during the Polish-Soviet War he fought on the Soviet side against the Polish Second Republic and was wounded. He remained in Russia and in 1928 on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of establishment of the Red Army he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner (no. 146), his first military award. From 1921, ≈öwierczewski taught in the Soviet School for the Red Commissars. In 1927 he graduated from Frunze Military Academy in Moscow and worked in the Red Army General Staff. In 1936, under the name General Walter, he was sent to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, where he led the XIV International Brigade in the battle of Lopera, and later the 35th International Division in the Segovia offensive, and the battles of Brunete, Belchite, Teruel, the Aragon Offensive. and the Battle of the Ebro.John Peet interview, Imperial War Museum =General in the Red Army= Following the outbreak of the Second World War and the Soviet invasion of Poland, ≈öwierczewski served as general in the Soviet Army. His Russian commanders, seeing ≈öwierczewski's apparent incompetence and worsening alcoholism, moved him to a reserve command away from the front lines‚Äîthe decision was made by General Georgi Zhukov himself.Piotr Lipi≈Ñski: Towarzysze Niejasnego. Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Pr√≥szy≈Ñski i Sp√≥≈Çka, 2003, s. 48. . The fact that ≈öwierczewski gave most of his orders under influence of alcohol had tragic consequences for his soldiers, described in General Zygmunt Berling's book Wspomnienia (Memories). Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski, Marian Spychalski and Karol ≈öwierczewski (from left to right) In 1943 he became one of the generals charged with the creation of the Soviet-controlled Polish Armed Forces in the East, the 1st Polish Army. His alcoholism and disregard for the life and health of his soldiers stirred conflict with Zygmunt Berling, and led to his removal from command on several occasions. ≈öwierczewski's alcoholism-related orders gained criticism from other Polish generals as well, including General Aleksander Waszkiewicz. In 1944 he became one of the leaders of the Polish Workers' Party and the government of People's Republic of Poland. In the winter of 1944 and the spring of 1945 he led the Polish Second Army during the fighting for western Poland and the Battle of Berlin. His leadership in the Battle of Bautzen (Budziszyn) has been severely criticized by modern historians, and he is held responsible for the Second Army's very heavy casualties in that engagement. While commanding, he might have been drunk, and was temporarily relieved of his command. However, due to important backing in the Soviet political apparatus (Main Intelligence Directorate or NKVD), not only did he retain his command, but his mistakes were hushed up, and after the war he was glorified as a hero. In February 1946 ≈öwierczewski became the Deputy Defense Minister of Poland. He was involved in the persecution of the anti-communist underground movement in Poland, and signed many death sentences, while establishing the communist regime. Controversial death ≈öwierczewski's monument near his place of death, in Bieszczady mountains. It has since been demolished. ≈öwierczewski was heavily wounded in a skirmish near Baligr√≥d in March 1947 while driving in a car without escort for the inspection of Polish troops fighting Ukrainian insurgents. He was ambushed by a unit of Ukrainian Insurgent Army, and died from his wounds within hours. There were several conspiracy theories claiming that the ambush was arranged by the Soviet intelligence due to his insubordination. According to one theory, the information about the general's arrival to the area was passed to Ukrainians by the NKVD and his escort prevented from leaving by mechanical problems with both trucks that transported the escort's soldiers. Most other hypotheses also suggest Soviet or even direct orders from Stalin. The general, a Pole by ethnicity but essentially a Soviet officer with a military record from the Spanish Civil War and a long Red Army war record, had been previously placed lower in the command structure than prewar Polish officers Berling and Rola-≈ªymierski. For several years after the Second World War ended, the Ukrainian Nationalist insurgency, led mainly by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, continued fighting in the South-East of Poland. This war, largely supported by the local Ukrainian part of the population, continued until 1949, with some sporadic fights taking place as late as 1956. ≈öwierczewski's death was used as direct cause for the forcible expulsion of the Ukrainian civilian population in Operation Vistula from the territories in the South Eastern part of the post-war Poland to the Recovered Territories (Ziemie Odzyskane, areas of western Poland, which before the war had been part of Germany). In the socialist Poland many myths were created around Karol ≈öwierczewski (\\"The General of Three Armies\\"), but details of his life and especially his service in the Red Army during Polish-Soviet War as well as the details of his Spanish War record were never mentioned. Legacy Popular scientific conference on Karol Wac≈Çaw ≈öwierczewski in Stƒô≈ºnica in Gmina Baligr√≥d In People's Republic of Poland, the Polish communist propaganda made him into a hero, and many controversial aspects of his life such as alcohol abuse and his incompetence during the Battle of Bautzen, as well as postwar Stalinist crimes were hushed up. In 1953, a Polish two-part film depicting the life of ≈öwierczewski, ≈ªo≈Çnierz zwyciƒôstwa (A Soldier of Victory), was released. J√≥zef Wyszomirski portrayed the General. During the years 1975‚Äì1996 Karol ≈öwierczewski's picture was on the popular 50 z≈Çoty banknote, initially the equivalent of two bottles of cheap Vodka. After 1989 with the end of the Warsaw Pact and the coming to power of Solidarity, many of his monuments were removed and streets renamed because of his role in implementing the communist regime in Poland. On May 21, 2003, the Polish organization of former veterans and independence fighters applied to the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) to investigate 'crimes against the Polish nation' committed by Karol ≈öwierczewski. In a letter, they recall that he was \\"one of the people who consciously worked towards [the] enslavement of Polish nation, through enforced communist regime that was [a] vassal towards Moscow\\". Among crimes that are not subject to expiry and should be investigated by the IPN are 29 death sentences on Polish soldiers and officers, which were signed by ≈öwierczewski during his command of the Soviet- controlled 2nd Polish Army.

Publication history The Earth-Two Crazy Quilt first appeared in Boy Commandos #15 (March 1946) and was created by Jack Kirby. The Paul Dekker version of Crazy Quilt first appeared in Blackhawks #180 and was created by artist Dick Dillon and an uncredited writer. The unidentified female version of Crazy Quilt first appeared in Villains United #2 and was created by Gail Simone and Dale Eaglesham. Fictional character biographyEarth-Two Crazy Quilt= Crazy Quilt is an unnamed noted painter who leads a double-life as a master criminal. He gives the plans for his crimes to various henchmen through clues left in his paintings. His criminal empire crashes to a halt when one of his henchmen double-crosses him. Blinded by a gunshot wound, he volunteers for an experimental procedure that restores his vision, but is unfortunately left unable to see anything but bright colors.\\"Boy Commandos\\" #15, (1946) In his second published appearance, this is combined with a special helmet that emits bright colored lights, enabling him to see under most circumstances.\\"Boy Commandos\\" #18, (1946) =Paul Dekker= In a 1963 issue of Blackhawk taking place on Earth-One, a fence named Paul Dekker uses the name Crazy Quilt, but the title heroes capture him.Blackhawk #180 (December, 1963) As a result of this appearance, some resources report the original Crazy-Quilt's true identity as Dekker. This includes at least one comic, the Kevin Smith-penned Batman: The Widening Gyre #4. However, the earlier Batman Encyclopedia, another official source endorsed by DC Comics, states that Dekker is a separate character from the original Crazy Quilt.The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, p. 98 In the Post-Crisis, Paul Dekker's history is similar to the Earth-Two Crazy Quilt. Crazy Quilt's sight is restored briefly for a time after he kidnaps a surgeon to assist him. Batman and Robin intervene. In self- defense, Robin reflects the madman's light beams back into his newly restored eyes. Unintentionally, Quilt is permanently blinded. Obsessing over his young adversary, he becomes one of the few bat-villains to hate Robin more than his mentor.Batman #316 Later, thinking to enact his revenge upon Grayson, he mistakenly takes out his aggression on Jason Todd, who was new to the role at the time. Todd is nearly beaten to death. Again, it is Robin who is pivotal to stopping Crazy Quilt's plans.Batman #368 Crazy Quilt later fought Jason Todd after knocking Batman unconscious.Detective Comics #535 When Ra's al Ghul caused a mass prison break at Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary, Crazy Quilt was among the freed inmates that worked for Ra's al Ghul by abducting Alfred Pennyworth, Commissioner James Gordon, Vicki Vale, Harvey Bullock, and Julia Pennyworth.Batman #400 Crazy Quilt was later seen in Arkham Asylum when Batman was Arkham Asylum's latest patient.Batman: Shadow of a Bat #3 He joins the other inmates in attacking Batman who ends up defeating them.Batman: Shadow of a Bat #4 During the Underworld Unleashed storyline, Crazy Quilt was among those who were offered a carved black candle of Neron.Underworld Unleashed #1 Crazy Quilt appears in the Belle Reve riot in Justice League #34, lugging around the eviscerated body of the prison warden. The prisoners, along with much of humanity, were being affected by the entity Mageddon. It had affected fellow prisoner, telepath Hector Hammond, who then altered the minds of the inmates.\\"Justice League\\" #34 (1999) Crazy Quilt also has a role in one of the many reincarnations of the Secret Society of Super Villains. He and dozens of villains gather in response to the JLA's new moonbase and extended team efforts. During the meeting, Quilt has his outfit insulted by the Monocle. The meeting turns out to be a JLA trap and all the villains are captured.JLA-80 Page Giant #1 (1998) In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) during the story arc Batman: Endgame, Dr. Paul Dekker appears as the person Batman suspects supplied the Joker with his newest serum, but is found out to not be guilty. He is also a member of the Doctors Three along with Doctor Death and Hugo Strange. Dekker calls out claiming that the Joker has given him the opportunity to become one of the Dionysian men as well and gleefully injects himself with a syringe despite Batman's warnings. Almost immediately, Dekker's tissues begin to decay and rot from his body and he drops from the window into the waiting crowd of infected who tear what remains of him to pieces.Batman Vol. 2 #38 In a nod to his Pre-Crisis alter ego, Dekker is found covering his nude body with a patchwork quilt. =Female Crazy Quilt= Apparently the Society, led by Alexander Luthor, Jr., has in its roster a new version of Crazy Quilt, a female one with the characteristic costume and vision-helmet of the previous villain. She has appeared in the Villains United series. She works with many other supervillains to take down the 'Secret Six'.\\"Villains United\\" #3 In Outsiders #50, she is captured by the Suicide Squad. In the Secret Six series, she is one of the villains who accepts the offer of a bounty on the heads of the Secret Six from mysterious crime boss, Junior. She is possibly shot by the Six, and stabbed in the stomach by Scandal. She later appears in James Robinson's Justice League: Cry For Justice mini as one of the many villains who attacks the team. Powers, abilities, and equipment Crazy-Quilt has a helmet that allows him to hypnotize his victims using flashing lights of various colors. It can also project lethal laser beams, blinding lights, and functions as artificial eyes since his own eyes no longer function; the lenses feed their input signal straight into his brain. In other mediaTelevision= * The Paul Dekker version of Crazy Quilt is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Jeffrey Tambor. He has a non-speaking cameo in the episode \\"Trials of the Demon\\" where he is shown robbing the Gotham Art Museum until he is defeated by Batman and is taken away to Arkham Asylum. In \\"Night of the Huntress,\\" he is shown amongst the inmates trying to escape from Blackgate Prison. Crazy Quilt plays a major role in the episode \\"The Color of Revenge\\" where he tries to get revenge on Robin for blinding him back when he and Batman worked together. He escapes to Bl√ºdhaven, robs S.T.A.R. Labs, and builds a giant laser cannon to kill Robin and destroy Bl√ºdhaven. He is defeated by Batman and Robin and is taken back to Arkham Asylum. * The Paul Dekker version of Crazy Quilt appears in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Tom Kenny. He is a teacher at Super Hero High. =Film= * Crazy Quilt appears in The Lego Batman Movie. =Video games= * Crazy Quilt is mentioned briefly in Batman: Arkham City. When several inmates talk about Two-Face being defeated at the courtroom, one of the inmates mentions that there are so many rumors as to who took out Two-Face that some people are saying Quilt took out Dent which no one believes.

It is closely related to the very similar mineral chabazite. Gmelinite was named as a single species in 1825 after Christian Gottlob Gmelin (1792‚Äì1860) professor of chemistry and mineralogist from T√ºbingen, Germany, and in 1997 it was raised to the status of a series.Deer, Howie and Zussman (2004) Rock-Forming Minerals Volume 4B:690-696 Gmelinite-Na has been synthesised from Na-bearing aluminosilicate gels. The naturally occurring mineral forms striking crystals, shallow, six sided double pyramids, which can be colorless, white, pale yellow, greenish, orange, pink, and red. They have been compared to an angular flying saucer.  Structure  The aluminosilicate framework is composed of tetrahedra linked to form parallel double six-membered rings stacked in two different positions (A and B) in the repeating arrangement AABBAABB. The framework has no Al-Si order. Within the structure there are cavities with a cross-section of up to 4 √Ö, and also wide channels parallel to the c axis with a diameter of 6.4 √Ö.Senderov and Shishakova (1967) Russian Chemical Bulletin 16-1:151 Space group: P63/mmc.

For his work on and off the internet he was ranked as one of Asia's 50 most powerful communicators in 2001. = Political career  2001 General Election  Gomez joined the Workers' Party in 2001. He was a member of the Workers' Party team which attempted to contest the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency at the 2001 general election, but were disqualified because their nomination papers were incomplete. The name of the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) they were intending to contest had not been written down on the form.  2006 General Election  He stood as a member of the Workers' Party's team in the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency at the election, ultimately losing to the team of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) in the constituency by 44% of the votes to 56%. = Accusations and apologies = In the lead up to the election, Gomez drew international attention when he accused the Elections Department of losing his minority-race candidate's application form. The \\"James Gomez Saga\\" attracted considerable media attention during the 2006 general election. It began after Gomez claimed that he had submitted his minority-race candidate's application form during a visit to the Elections Department with Workers' Party Chairman Sylvia Lim on 24 April. (As teams of candidates in GRCs must include a minority-race candidate, a candidate from each party's team in a GRC must make such an application before the election.) Two days later, Gomez called in at the Elections Department to enquire about the status of the form. He was indignant when he was told that they had not received his form, and he told an officer from the department that there would be \\"consequences\\" if it had been misplaced. The following day, the Elections Department confirmed that their closed-circuit television footage had revealed that Gomez had in fact put the form in his bag and left the building without submitting it. On 29 April 29, Gomez apologised after the release of the CCTV evidence and admitted that he had not filed his application, contrary to his earlier claims. He said that he had been distracted by his busy schedule. (His failure to submit the form did not prevent the Workers' Party team from running in Aljunied GRC because they had a second minority candidate on their team, Mohammed Rahizan bin Yaacob, who had submitted the required paperwork.) PAP candidate Inderjit Singh speculated that Gomez's non-submission of the form may have been an intentional ploy to try and gain publicity and cause confusion. Gomez responded by insisting that he had made a genuine mistake and called for others to \\"move on\\" from the issue. On the eve of polling day, the Workers' Party leader, Low Thia Khiang, backed Gomez and stated that \\"the incident was merely an unintentional omission, a mistake made while busy\\". However Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said that the facts showed that Gomez had lied. = Election results = On polling day, Gomez and his Workers' Party colleagues in Aljunied GRC lost to the PAP's team by 56,593 votes (43.9%) to 74,843 (56.1%). This was the highest percentage of the vote garnered by any opposition losing candidates, and was therefore enough to secure one of the team's members (Party Chairman Sylvia Lim) a seat as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP). = After polling day = Immediately after the election, the Elections Department filed a complaint about Gomez threatening a member of their staff by saying there would be \\"consequences\\" if his form has been lost. On 8 May, two days after the election, Gomez was stopped by police at Changi Airport and prevented from boarding a flight to Stockholm (where he worked at the time for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance). He was held for questioning over whether he had committed criminal intimidation in his dealings with the Elections Department. Gomez and other members of the Workers' Party, including Low Thia Kiang and Sylvia Lim, were questioned regarding the issue. On 9 May, Gomez was questioned for a second time for five hours, and for a third time on 10 May for three hours. Meanwhile, Low assured police that there would be full co-operation with the police on the matter. In the end, Gomez was let off with a \\"stern warning\\" regarding the incident. The police maintained that there had been \\"several serious inconsistencies\\" in the account of events that Gomez had given. However the public prosecutor stated that the willingness of Gomez to co- operate with the police and his lack of a previous criminal record led to the decision.Gomez Let off with a Stern Warning, The Straits Times, 13 May 2006 Following this, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that the decision not to prosecute did not make Gomez any less dishonest and called him a \\"bad egg\\". As a result of the saga, \\"James Gomez\\" became the most searched term on Technorati in May 2006.www.jamesgomeznews.com/blog/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=20&Itemid;=64 .

This star has double the Sun's mass and a radius 2.4 times as large. It is radiating 26 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of around 9,000 K. This heat gives it the characteristic white-hued glow of an A-type star. It has a relatively high rate of rotation, with a projected rotational velocity of 81 km s‚àí1. Delta Aquarii does not display a strong signal of excess infrared emission that might indicate the presence of circumstellar matter. Delta Aquarii is a probable stream star member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, which has an estimated age of 500 million years. Companion An analysis of Hipparcos data strongly suggested a close companion object. An orbit was derived with a 483-day period, an eccentricity of 0.12, and an inclination of 41¬∞. When Delta Aquarii was first examined for the companion, it could not be seen. Any possible companion beyond was constrained to be less than . Infrared interferometric observations did then find a companion, a likely G5 main sequence star around from the primary.

Based on parallax measurement taken during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately from the Sun. Components It consists of a binary pair, designated Delta Herculis A, together with three potential companions, suffixed B, C and D. Furthermore B is believed to be an optical binary. A's components are designated Delta Herculis Aa (officially named Sarin , the traditional name of the system) and Ab. Nomenclature Œ¥ Herculis (Latinised to Delta Herculis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the four constituents as Delta Herculis A, B, C and D, and those of A's components - Delta Herculis Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Sarin. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Sarin for the component Delta Herculis Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Their ancestors were brought there as enslaved people centuries ago, and the islanders developed a language‚Äîknown as Gullah or Sea Island Creole English‚Äîand culture that was creolized from West Africans of Ibo, Yoruba, Kikongo, Mende, and Twi origin and the cultures and languages of the British Isles, with the common variety of English being the superstratum in this caseLeonard, John, \\"Island Notion\\", New York Magazine. Retrieved February 28, 2017. Developed in their relative isolation of large plantations on the islands, the enslaved peoples' unique culture and language have endured over time. Their dialogue is in Gullah creole. Narrated by the Unborn Child, the future daughter of Eli and Eula, whose voice is influenced by accounts of her ancestors, the film presents poetic visual images and circular narrative structures to represent the past, present and future for the Gullah, the majority of whom are about to embark for the mainland and a more modern, \\"civilized\\" way of life. The old ways and African ancestral history are represented by community matriarch Nana Peazant, who practices African spiritual rituals. Nana tells her family as she bids them to remember and honour their ancestors as they embark on their new journey, \\"We are two people in one body. The last of the old and the first of the new.\\" Contrasting cousins, Viola, a devout Christian, and Yellow Mary, a free spirit who has brought her lover, Trula, from the city, arrive at the island by boat from their homes on the mainland for a last dinner with their family. Yellow Mary plans to leave for Nova Scotia after her visit. Mr. Snead, a mainland photographer, accompanies Viola and takes portraits of the islanders before they leave their way of life forever. Intertwined with these narratives is the marital rift between Eli and his wife Eula, who is about to give birth after being raped by a white man on the mainland. Eli struggles with the fact that the unborn child may not be his and his mother's pressure for him to maintain his connection to his ancestors. The unborn child of Eli and Eula narrates the film tracing the legacy before her birth. Several other family members' stories unfold between these narratives. They include Haagar, a cousin who finds the old spiritual beliefs and provincialism of the island \\"backwards,\\" and is impatient to leave for a more modern society with its educational and economic opportunities. Her daughter Iona longs to be with her secret lover St. Julien Lastchild, a Cherokee Native American, a resident of the island. Lastchild presents Iona with a letter confessing his devotion the day of iona's departure asking her to stay with him. While the women prepare a traditional meal for the feast, which includes okra, yams and shellfish prepared at the beach, the men gather nearby in groups to talk and play games. The children and teenagers play games, practice religious rites on the beach, and have a Bible-study session with Viola. Yellow Mary and Eula bond as survivors of rape. Bilal Muhammad, a cousin that is believed to be Ibo but hails from the French West Indies, leads a Muslim prayer. Nana evokes the spirits of the family's ancestors who worked on the island's indigo plantations. Nana combines the power of their ancestors with Viola's Bible as a symbol of the old and the new. Eula and Eli reveal the history and folklore of the slave uprising and mass suicide at Igbo Landing. The Peazant family members make their final decisions to leave the island for a new beginning, or stay behind and maintain their way of life. Yellow Mary chooses to stay on the island along with Eli and Eula. In tears, Iona jumps off of a departing boat as Lastchild comes for her on horseback. Haagar is held back by another family member while calling for her daughter. Remaining family members watch as most of the Peazants finally depart.  Cast  Production  Development = Originally conceived in 1975, Dash planned to make a short film with no dialogue as a visual account of a Gullah family's preparation to leave their Sea Island home to a new life in the North. She was inspired by her father's Gullah family, who migrated to New York City in the early 20th century during the Great Migration of African Americans from the southern states. Her narrative forms were also inspired by the writing of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and Melville Herskovits.Coyle, Jake (November 18, 2016), \\"Julie Dash‚Äôs landmark ‚ÄòDaughters of the Dust‚Äô is reborn\\", AP News. Retrieved October 5, 2017. As the story developed for more than 10 years, Dash clarified her artistic vision and together with Arthur Jafa, her cinematographer and co- producer, she put together a short film to use for marketing. She was initially rejected by Hollywood executives, as this was to be her first full- length film. Dash said they thought it was \\"too different\\" as she thought their reaction was part of a systematic exclusion of black women from Hollywood. Persisting, Dash finally got $800,000 financing from PBS' American Playhouse in 1988. = Casting = With funding secured, Dash and Casting Director Len Hunt, cast a number of veterans of black independent cinema in various roles, as a tribute to the work they had done and the sacrifices they had made to work in independent films. She also hired a mostly African- American crew. Considering she had cast principal actors who were union members. A number of non-union members were cast because of their familiarity with the Gullah Language. Union technicians were also hired. Dash's budget of $800,000 was very small. = Dialogue and narrative structure = For the sake of authenticity and poetry, the characters from the island speak in Gullah dialect. Ronald Daise, author of Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage (1987), was the dialect coach for her actors, none of whom knew Gullah at the start of production. The narrative structure is non-linear, of which Dash explained: > I didn't want to tell a historical drama about African-American women in the > same way that I had seen other dramas. I decided to work with a different > type of narrative structure...[and] that the typical male-oriented western- > narrative structure was not appropriate for this particular film.

Principal photography lasted 28 days, with a majority of the time spent shooting at exterior locations, such as the beach, in front of rustic homes, or further inland, where Nana's home is located near the island's graveyard. The sets, including cabins, the graveyard, and a figurative-sculpture dock at Igbo Landing, were constructed mostly using materials the Gullah would have had available at the time of the story. The costumes feature the women in long indigo-dyed and bright white dresses. The majority of closeups in the film are on the women, and the majority of dialogue is spoken by women and girls. During production on Hunting Island, the crew were evacuated to Charleston, South Carolina to avoid the incoming Hurricane Hugo.

It is made up of a mixture of older tracks and walkways, new tracks, and link sections alongside roads. Tramping the full length of the trail generally takes three to six months. It is becoming increasingly popular. History The idea of a national walkway goes back to the 1970s, when it was first advocated for by the Federated Mountain Clubs of New Zealand and in 1975 the New Zealand Walkways Commission was established, but in 15 years made little progress. In 1994, journalist Geoff Chapple advocated a New Zealand-long walking track, and founded Te Araroa Trust. Advocacy and negotiations for access continued, and by 2006 plans for the trail began being part of local government plans. The route officially opened on 3 December 2011 after 10 years of work by hundreds of volunteers. Construction coordinated by the trust is ongoing. The trail has approximately 300 sections ranging from walks of one to two hours through to an approximately nine-day route in the South Island where most trampers haul large amounts of food and gear. About sixty per cent of the trail crosses conservation land managed by the Department of Conservation, and the Government allocated $3.8 million for development of new sections of the trail on conservation land in 2007. As of 2019 there are further plans to upgrade the trail, including a long-term goal to reduce road-walking to under 5% of the trail. Walking the trail The straight-line distance from Cape Reinga to Bluff is , but the Te Araroa stretches roughly , varying in distance when sections are upgraded or otherwise changed. The trail is a mix of tracks, including wilderness tracks, paths through paddocks, beaches, roads, and highways, as well as a section which is a river and must be kayaked. Many parts of the trail are challenging. In these sections, trip planning, river crossing and navigation skills are recommended, as well as a good level of fitness and heavy boots. Most through- hikers take between three and six months for a complete trip. The full trail was completed in 53 days by British ultra-marathoner Jez Bragg with a dedicated support crew during the 2012‚Äì13 season.Winner of the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in 2010 The youngest to walk the trail was Jonathan Rapsey, who finished it at the age of 7 with his sister Elizabeth aged 9 and their parents. Hundreds of thousands of people walk some part of Te Araroa each year, and in the 2018/19 summer the Te Araroa Trust counted 1200 through- walkers. This was up from 550 people attempting a through-hike in 2016-17, and 350 the year before. Sections of the track can see more traffic; for example, one section is seeing 70,000 to 80,000 people each year. In that example, the section is on private land and has been rising, and such traffic can make using the land as a farm impractical. With the exception of a short section of the Queen Charlotte Track at the trail's northern terminus in the South Island, neither permit nor fee is required to walk Te Araroa. However, the Te Araroa Trust requests a donation of $500 per person tramping the full trail, $250 for those walking one island only, and smaller amounts for section hikers. Through-hikers will also pay $92 for a six-month Department of Conservation Backcountry Hut Pass if they wish to sleep in New Zealand's extensive network of back-country huts.

The company was formed in 1929 through the merger of the American Radiator Company and Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company forming the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation. The group was renamed to the \\"American Standard Corporation\\" in 1967. The company divested all but the HVAC business in 2007, and renamed itself Trane. Trane was acquired by Ingersoll Rand in 2008. History In 1929, the American Radiator Company (founded 1892) merged with the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company (founded in 1875) to form the American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation (as mentioned above in bold). The plumbing division, Standard Sanitary, would continue to sell their products under the \\"Standard\\" label until 1967, when the company changed its name to American Standard Corporation. The American Standard label was used for both divisions from that year on. In 1929, American Standard bought the Kewanee Boiler Company which it kept until the early 1970s. Kewanee Boiler In 1968 the group purchased the Westinghouse Air Brake Company's earthmoving and mining product range. It divested itself of these assets in 1984. In 1984, the group acquired HVAC company Trane. In 1999, American Standard purchased control of the United Kingdom-based Armitage Shanks and Ceramica Dolomite of Italy from Blue Circle Industries for $430 million. On 1 February 2007, the company announced it would break up its three divisions. The plan included the sale of its kitchen and bath division; and the spin off of its vehicle control systems business; the remainder of the company, primarily its air conditioning business was to be retained, and renamed \\"Trane\\": *The vehicle controls division was spun off, forming WABCO Vehicle Control Systems. *The kitchen and bathroom division was sold off: Bain Capital Partners acquired the division for $1.745 billion. Bain Capital sold the North American and Asian operations to Sun Capital and Lixil Group respectively, whilst retaining the European and Latin American operations as Ideal Standard. The North American operations became American Standard Americas, whilst the global business became Ideal Standard. *The remainder of the company held was renamed, taking the name of its heating and air conditioning subsidiary Trane.

Early life and career Born Edward Larry Gordon in Philadelphia, he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey. He attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., where he studied composition and piano. After studying at Howard, he spent time in New York City pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian and actor. In the early 1970s, he began to study Eastern mysticism and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life. It was also at this time he bought his first zither from a local pawn shop. Converting it to an electronic instrument, he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano. By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin busking in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York. He favored the northeast corner of Washington Square Park, where he would improvise for hours on end with his eyes closed. The following year he was \\"discovered\\" by Brian Eno while playing in Washington Square Park. The result was his most widely recognized release, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, the third installment of Brian Eno's Ambient series. This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji. This international exposure led to requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to meditation groups on cassette tapes. It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as Swami Satchidananda and Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York. Laraaji's also started the Laughter Meditation Workshops which he still presents around the globe.

At apparent magnitude +1.86 it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, but is not visible from the northern hemisphere. The False Cross is an asterism formed of Delta Velorum, Kappa Velorum, Iota Carinae and Œµ Carinae. It is so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. Illustration of the Œµ Carinae system Epsilon Carinae is located roughly from the Sun. Measurements during the Hipparcos mission give the pair an angular separation of 0.46 arcseconds with a difference in magnitude of 2.0. At their estimated distance, this angle is equivalent to a physical separation of around 4 astronomical units. The primary component has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.2, which by itself would still make it the third-brightest star in the constellation. It is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. However, examination of the ultraviolet flux from this star suggests it may instead be of spectral type K7. The fainter secondary companion has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.1, which, if it were a solitary star, would be bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. This is a hot, core hydrogen-fusing B-type main sequence star of spectral class B2 Vp. The secondary may itself have an orbiting stellar companion of spectral class F8. This pair may form an eclipsing binary system with a period of 785 days (2.15 years), resulting in a magnitude change of 0.12 during each eclipse. Etymology Œµ Carinae (Latinised to Epsilon Carinae) is the star's Bayer designation. The name Avior is not classical in origin. It was assigned to the star by HM Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s during the creation of The Air Almanac, a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty- seven navigation stars included in the new almanac, two had no classical names: Epsilon Carinae and Alpha Pavonis. The RAF insisted that all of the stars must have names, so new names were invented. Alpha Pavonis was named \\"Peacock\\", a translation of Pavo, whilst Epsilon Carinae was called \\"Avior\\". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Avior for this star.

From parallax measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission, it is roughly distant from the Sun. Mu Geminorum forms the primary or 'A' component of a double star system designated WDS J06230+2231 along with UCAC2 39641417 (also designated WDS J06230+2231BC), itself a binary pair. Nomenclature Œº Geminorum (Latinised to Mu Geminorum) is the star's Bayer designation. WDS J06230+2231 is the double star's designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog. The designations of the double star's components as WDS J06230+2231A and BC derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Mu Geminorum bore the traditional name of Tejat (or more precisely, Tejat Posterior), from an old southern Arabic word of unknown meaning, ti·∏•yƒÅt. The name Tejat Posterior was formerly applied to an asterism consisting of this star, along with Gamma Geminorum (Alhena), Nu Geminorum, Eta Geminorum (Propus), and Xi Geminorum (Alzirr). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Tejat for the component WDS J06230+2231A (i.e. Mu Geminorum) on February 1, 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. The names Calx (Latin, meaning 'heel'), Pish Pai (from the Persian Ÿæ€åÿ¥‚ÄåŸæÿß€å ('pƒ´shpƒÅy', meaning 'foreleg'), and Nuhatai (from Arabic 'Al Nu·∏•ƒÅtai', the dual form of 'Al Nu·∏•ƒÅt', 'a Camel's Hump') have also been applied to Mu Geminorum.

Mu Geminorum has an average apparent visual magnitude of 2.9, which makes it the fourth-brightest member of Gemini. It is 0.8 degrees south of the ecliptic, so it is subject to occultations by the Moon and, rarely, by planets. Seen from Earth, its brightness is reduced by 0.07 magnitudes by extinction from intervening gas and dust. It is a slow irregular variable of type LB. Its brightness varies between magnitude +2.75 and +3.02 over a 72-day period, along with a 2,000-day period of long term variation. It is a red giant at a stellar classification of M3 III, with a surface temperature of 3,773 K, meaning it is brighter, yet cooler, than the Sun. The star is currently on the asymptotic giant branch and is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen and helium along concentric shells surrounding an inert core of carbon and oxygen.

Depictions in popular culture The Marathi play Himalayachi Saavli (The Shadow of the Himalayas) by Vasant Kanetkar, published in 1972, is loosely based on the life of Karve. The character of Nanasaheb Bhanu is a composite character based on Karve and other Marathi social reformers of the late 19th and early 20th century. The play itself depicts the tension between Bhanu/Karve's public life as a social reformer and his family life due to the social backlash and economic hardships his children and wife had to endure. The 2001 film Dhyaas Parva by Amol Palekar, based on the life of Karve's son Raghunath, also depicts the Karve family, and their social reformation projects.

By the late 1940s, Ideal Standard used some products of companies of the American Standard group. The \\"Ideal\\" brand traces back to the \\"Ideal Boilers\\" and \\"American Radiators\\" brands used by the American Radiator Company. Overview Old Ideal Standard Logo Ceramic sanitary ware designed by Gio Ponti for Ideal Standard, 1954 ca. Photo by Paolo Monti. A new company, known as Ideal Standard International, was formed in 2007 by the sale of the bath and kitchen products businesses of American Standard Companies for $1.745 billion to Bain Capital Partners. The North American and Asian operations of American Standard were sold to Sun Capital and Lixil Group respectively, with the European and Latin American operations retained as Ideal Standard. The company was then restructured, implementing cost-cutting measures, as well as moving some of company's production facilities to Asia and Eastern Europe ‚Äì a new production site was opened in Bulgaria. The acquisition by Bain Capital was facilitated by Credit Suisse and Bank of America; the creditors subsequently struggled to dispose of their debt. The restructuring program was complete in 2011, but the company was loss making in 2012/3 due to poor sales. In 2013 the company reduced its workforce by 250 due to poor sales; further restructuring was proposed in 2014, including a debt for equity swap with bondholder Anchorage Capital. In 2014 the EU competition commission approved Anchorage Capital becoming joint owner of the company together with Bain Capital. As of 2014 the company is headquartered in Belgium, and has over 10,000 employees. Its products include bathroom fittings including bathrooms, sanitary ware, and showers, sold under brands including Armitage Shanks, Ceramica Dolomite, Porcher and Vidima.

Jackie is one of the two female leads throughout the show's run and a love interest of Michael Kelso. Character biography Jackie is a self-centered, spoiled, vain member of a wealthy family. She is generally insensitive to the needs and feelings of others, although regarded by many as attractive and fashionable. She is one of the program's most conceited characters, and she can behave quite selfishly. She looks down upon those of lower status in her school and has been said to treat them unfairly, and on the occasions she has treated them with respect, she has not continued to do so for very long or only did it knowing that she could be rewarded for behaving in such a manner, such as when she ran for the title of \\"Snow Queen\\" but was utterly disappointed when she loses the election. For the most part, Jackie only cares about herself, and fashion is one of the few other things that she is concerned about. She believes herself to be very beautiful and appealing and has been involved in romantic relationships with Michael Kelso, Steven Hyde, and Fez at different points in the series. She starts to change when she starts dating Hyde and by doing so, becomes cemented as a member of the group. Even after her break up with Hyde, they remained good friends and she continued hanging around. She also becomes less shallow and cares about others. In the season 8 episode \\"Fun It\\", it is revealed she has had coulrophobia (an irrational fear of clowns) since her seventh birthday party. =Friendships= Jackie's friendships tend to be complicated. While people might be endeared to her good heart and her triumphs over major life upheavals, her habit of being condescending to others keeps them at a distance. Although she frequently criticizes Donna's dress, physique and feminism, she repeatedly calls herself Donna's best friend ever since they first met in 1973 when Jackie first came to Point Place and Donna hit her with a ball in the gymnasium. Even though she thinks Donna is boring and unattractive when compared to herself, she believes Donna could do much better than Eric. Despite their extremely different personalities, Donna serves as Jackie's de facto big sister and often tries to look out for her when she feels Jackie is making a mistake, more often than not due to lack of common sense. After her father is sent to prison in the middle of season five, Jackie moves in with the Pinciottis after the Formans learn that she has secretly been living with Hyde in his basement room. Jackie is also defensive of Donna; she displays this often by insulting or kicking Eric for doing something stupid, for example Eric makes a sexist comment so Jackie kicks him in the shin in the episode \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". Although both girls often tease one another they show genuine friendship. In the episode \\"Squeeze Box\\" Donna shows how much she trusts Jackie when she runs in to talk about Eric. Jackie also demonstrates her level of care for Donna when she helps pay for Donna's engagement ring in the episode \\"No Quarter\\". Of the group, Jackie and Eric seemed to dislike each other the most in the beginning, though as the series progresses, they develop a friendship. She is more like a sister to him in comparison to his own sister, Laurie. Throughout the series, the two have a clear \\"frenemy\\" relationship. They demonstrate their annoyance with each other, but show compassion for each other many times, and through it all, are close. In the beginning of the series, Jackie admits to trusting and liking Eric, confiding in him that she might be pregnant. In \\"The Pill\\", for example, she says to Eric's surprise, \\"Look, I've always been able to trust you‚Äîand, God, you are such a nice guy.\\" Later in the episode, once Kelso threatens to break up with Jackie, Eric yells at him, having developed protective feelings towards her. This proves that their burning of each other throughout the show is only for laughs and friendly bickering, as none of their hostility is ever serious. Eric is consistent in ignoring Jackie as an object of sexual desire, but this changes in \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" where Hyde helps Eric realize that Jackie is \\"hot\\". After this, Eric has shown to have a sexual attraction to her, as shown in many episodes. Jackie is sometimes demeaning towards Eric, as she is to almost everyone, mostly due to his dorkiness and lack of physical prowess. They occasionally help each other out. In the episode \\"Jackie's Cheese Squeeze\\", Eric admits that they are \\"friends\\", as long as they don't refer to each other as such in public, and in the season seven finale, Jackie calls Eric from Chicago and admits that she's always cared for him and that he was always very special to her. Early on, Red remarks she was the favorite of Eric's friends for her ability to hold a flashlight on a car. Jackie has run crying into Red's arms no fewer than three times, all of which left him baffled and uncomfortable. Red finds Jackie as annoying as everyone else, but she still loves him because he's the closest thing she has to a father. =Relationships= When the show premieres, Jackie is dating Michael Kelso, a good-looking, brainless goofball. She decides to finally lose her virginity to him when he is released from jail after being mistakenly arrested for driving a stolen car. Jackie gets on Kelso's friends' nerves on a daily basis and Kelso repeatedly says that he is going to break up with her. However, in the first season it is Jackie who ends the relationship ‚Äì twice. First, after Kelso is caught kissing Pam Macy (they get back together in the very same episode) and again after a pregnancy scare. However, admitting that they miss each other, they get back together at the Junior Prom. In season 2, Kelso is seduced by Eric's promiscuous and manipulative sister, Laurie, who later on begins a physical affair with him. Later in the season, Jackie eventually discovers his repeated infidelities and breaks up with him without realizing that Kelso has told Laurie that he is done with her since he only loves Jackie. After this breakup she is openly hostile to Kelso and many things clearly remain unfinished between them. She often insults him in front of his friends to get his attention and just for the sake of bringing him up. By season 3, she does eventually warm up to him. Following Kelso's breakup with Laurie, Kelso apologizes to Jackie for cheating on her because now he knows how it feels to be cheated on as Laurie cheated on him, except he states that what happened to him and Jackie was different because they were actually really in love. After this, Jackie begins to notice that Kelso has matured somehow, so Jackie devises a series of \\"tests\\" for Kelso to see if they should reconcile. He passes her tests and they get back together. Kelso remains loyal to Jackie after that and stays with her throughout season four, and they enjoy a happier, more loving relationship. However, towards the end of season 4, Jackie's father tells her that if she stays with Kelso, he will cut her off financially. She ends up choosing Kelso, and gets a job. Later, Kelso begins to spend less time with Jackie as a result of his joining a modeling agency and she is caught kissing her boss by Eric. This event spurs a period of discovery for Jackie and Kelso. After reading Cosmopolitan, Kelso realizes that the reason he cheated on Jackie with Laurie was because Jackie has always bossed him around and made him feel bad about himself. Following this revelation, he breaks up with her (true to form, the breakup doesn't stick and they reunite one episode later). In the season four finale, Jackie and Kelso both agree that they don't want to stay broken up. So, Jackie has Kelso choose to kiss any girl at The Hub to make things even between them and they can move on and be together again. Kelso surprises Jackie when he pretends to look around the room, but ends up choosing to kiss her. Jackie decides that it's time for Kelso to really choose her. Without warning, she brings up marriage to Kelso and decides that they're getting married. Kelso, feeling overwhelmed, runs away to California. When he returns in the beginning of season five, he (along with the others) is horrified to learn that she has begun dating Hyde. Jackie continues to date Hyde for most of the season, but when Kelso introduces Annette to the gang, Jackie finds herself clearly jealous and tells Donna that Michael is still supposed to pine over her. Later in the episode, she claims to not be jealous anymore, but the moment she sees Annette kissing Kelso, she screams, \\"Get off my boyfriend!\\" For the rest of the season, Kelso is clearly not over Jackie and doesn't realize that he's indirectly trying to win her back. Towards the end of season five, as Jackie comforts Kelso, he states that no one understands him like she does. In the finale, Kelso and Hyde make Jackie choose between the two of them and she chooses herself. By the beginning of season six, Kelso claims that he is happy and genuinely enjoying their new friendship. He spends the rest of the season trying to move on with his life, joins the police academy and impregnates a girl named Brooke and spends the rest of season 6 and 7 taking care of the baby. Towards the end of season seven, however, Kelso drives Jackie to Chicago after her break-up with Hyde, and Jackie asks him to spend some time with her before he leaves. He is later seen entering Jackie's hotel room in only a towel, implying that he and Jackie were about to sleep together, but runs off nude into the night when he sees that Hyde has come to the hotel to get Jackie back. In the beginning of season eight, with Hyde married to a stripper, Jackie figures out her own life. Kelso considers marrying Jackie and states that the happiest time of his life was with Jackie and claims he still loves her. When Fez tells Jackie what Kelso intends, she considers the proposal and decides that if he asks, she will accept. However, he gets offered a job out of town and realizes he can move on with his life, but Fez reveals to him that he has already told Jackie of the proposal. Kelso grows angry, and states that he loves Jackie and that he knows in the future, they will be together, but now is not the right time, but since Fez has implied that Kelso will lose all of his chances with Jackie if he doesn't propose now, Kelso ends up proposing at Red and Kitty's anniversary party, though, she turns him down giving practically the same reasons as Kelso, which is that she loves him, but he has a lot of maturing to do and she has her own life to figure out so now is not the right time for them yet. They both feel an unexpected relief, and end on good terms. Jackie and Steven Hyde are, from the beginning of the show, polar opposites and even enemies. She is disgusted by his poverty and crass behavior, he scorns her superficiality and materialism. They strongly dislike each other during the first season, but begin to form a bond when Hyde helps Jackie cope with her breakup with Kelso in season two. This leads to a brief period in which Jackie is infatuated with Hyde, but her feelings gradually fade. It isn't until season five, when Kelso is in California, that their romance begins. After watching The Price Is Right together all summer, the two begin making out every time they have a moment alone. When their friends discover the relationship, they each insist that they are not dating and that it is purely physical, but finally give in and admit that what they have goes deeper than just sex. They date for most of season five until Jackie sees Kelso kissing Annette and yells \\"Get off my boyfriend!\\" Hyde reacts angrily to this and grows suspicious of Jackie. When he sees Jackie holding Kelso in her arms, knowing Jackie and Kelso's long history and on-off relationship, Hyde assumes that something must be going on between her and Kelso again. Despite her pleas that she was only comforting him and that nothing untoward happened, he doesn't believe her and he takes revenge by spending the night with another woman. When he realizes that Jackie has been telling the truth, he confesses his infidelity. A heartbroken Jackie ends the relationship immediately. In the beginning of season six, Kelso and Hyde are in competition to get Jackie back because they both still love her. She decides she needs time to think about it, leaving them to wait and agonize, but chooses Hyde in the end. Their relationship goes on until Jackie is offered a job in Chicago. She is torn between her relationship and her professional ambition, but tells Hyde that she will stay if he can gives her the merest hope that they will eventually get married. Hyde has no immediate answer, and when he finally decides, he is upset to realize that she has already gone (or so he thinks). Jackie has no way out of Point Place, and in a final attempt to get an answer out of Hyde, she goes to the basement. Hiding his hurt and anger that she \\"left\\" him, Hyde tells her to have a good trip. Hyde decides he still wants her, and goes to her Chicago hotel to persuade her to take him back. During his conversation with Jackie, Kelso walks into the hotel room with a towel around his waist and a bucket of ice in his hands and implying that he and Jackie were about to have sex. Hyde goes to Las Vegas. When he comes back to Point Place, he has impulsively married a stripper named Samantha and she follows him back to Wisconsin. This effectively ends his and Jackie's relationship. Throughout season eight, Jackie remains single. She and Hyde, no longer together, have since remained good friends. However, their behavior regresses to how it was in the earlier seasons. Fez tells Jackie that Kelso intends to propose to her, and she decides that she will accept, but after considering it, she turns him down claiming that though she loves Kelso, he still has a lot of maturing to do, and now is not the time for them to be together. Feeling that she is in a low point in her life, Jackie decides to find someone that would be perfect for her and writes out a list of what she wants in a man. She is surprised to find out that Fez matches everything on the list. She denies this at first, but quickly comes around to the idea and decides to wait for Fez to come to her. Fez, however, is clueless of her attraction to him and is instead seeing other women at the time, which makes it hard for her. Jackie then chooses to go to him. She kisses him and asks if they can be together because he is the one good thing in her life right now, but Fez turns her down, feeling that she is treating him as a last resort, citing how she has already dated both Kelso and Hyde. Jackie then goes to the bathroom and cries, but immediately after vows revenge on Fez. She flushes his toothbrush, microwaves his lotion, and ruins his car with graffiti. To get back at Jackie, Fez dyes her hair green, and says that now she is ugly on the outside like she is on the inside. Hurt by Fez's words, Jackie decides to move out. However, she later learns through one of his friends that he loves her and wishes that he had never said those things. They eventually reconcile and in the final episode, Fez and Jackie finally get together and kiss atop the water tower.

There are about 940 species in this order. Description Tanaids are small, shrimp-like creatures ranging from in adult size, with most species being from . Their carapace covers the first two segments of the thorax. There are three pairs of limbs on the thorax; a small pair of maxillipeds, a pair of large clawed gnathopods, and a pair of pereiopods adapted for burrowing into the mud. Unusually among crustaceans, the remaining six thoracic segments have no limbs at all, but each of the first five abdominal segments normally carry pleopods. The final segment is fused with the telson and carries a pair of uropods. The gills lie on the inner surface of the carapace. The thoracic limbs wash water towards the mouth, filtering out small particles of food with the mouthparts or maxillipeds. Some species actively hunt prey, either as their only food source, or in combination with filter feeding. Habitat Most are marine, but some are also found in freshwater coastal habitat or estuaries. The majority of species are bottom-dwellers in shallow water environments, but a few live in very deep water, exceeding for some species . In some deep sea environment, they represent the most abundant and diverse fauna to be found. Life cycle Tanaids do not undergo a true planktonic stage. The early developmental period is spent while young are within the marsupium of the mother. Subsequently, post-larvae, called mancas, emerge as epibenthic forms. Some species are hermaphroditic.

The film was released in Mainland China on 15 April 2005 and in Hong Kong on 28 April 2005. The literal translation of, (Êó©ÁÜü) is \\"early maturity\\" and the English title, 2 Young, is a pun on the words \\"too young\\". The controversial topic of a pre-marital pregnancy of a minor is what the plot of 2 Young is framed around. Although the seriousness of the subject matter is woven throughout the film and is treated with respect, the overall objective of director, Derek Yee, was to keep the film light with moments of situational and appropriate humor. 2 Young stars Jaycee Chan and Fiona Sit with a supporting cast including Eric Tsang, Teresa Mo, Anthony Wong, and Candice Yu, who play the parents of Jaycee's and Fiona's characters respectively. Plot Ka Fu (Jaycee Chan) and Natalie (Nam) (Fiona Sit), are from two different family backgrounds. Ka Fu's father (played by Eric Tsang) is a mini-bus driver and his mother (played by Teresa Mo) is a restaurant hostess. Natalie is from a very affluent family and her parents (played by Candice Yu and Anthony Wong) are lawyers. In the beginning, Ka Fu and his two close friends, Bing and Sai wait to see Natalie outside her school every single day until she invited them to her school's Christmas party despite knowing that visitors were forbidden to go. They were eventually discovered by the school principals. While Bing and Sai successfully escaped, Ka Fu was caught but they decided to forgive him. Ka Fu took Natalie home, where they celebrated her 16th birthday, and Ka Fu spent the night there. Another contrast is that Ka Fu has a loving relationship with his parents, but Natalie's relationship with her parents is distant as they are often away on business trips. Eventually, Ka Fu and Natalie gotten close with each other as they got to know each other more. It is exactly this window of opportunity of Natalie's parents' absence that causes the two to have a weak moment in their budding love for each other, which results in Natalie getting pregnant during a camp out for New Year's Eve. Natalie eventually found out herself when her pregnancy test came back positive. Originally, they thought about getting an abortion in order to take care of the problem after getting an advice from Sai but upon seeing the operation room, Natalie decided not to and ran out in horror. Despite her anxiety of this issue, she decides to go through with the pregnancy in complete support from Ka Fu, along with Bing and Sai. However, Natalie, being underage and about two years younger than Ka Fu, causes her parents, especially her father, to fly into a rage and a lawsuit gets under way for Ka Fu and his parents. Ka Fu's parents also scold him and express that they do not want him to make the same mistakes they did. Upon knowing her pregnancy, Natalie's father's plan was for her to get an abortion, and send her to the United States to continue with her education, which Natalie aggressively objected, and she scolded her father for always making decisions for her. Her father gets angry and canceled her bank account, internet services and her cell phone. He ordered his wife to be at home and watch over her 24/7. Learning of the impending legal action, and also because of the plan on aborting the baby, Ka Fu and Natalie, with the help of Bing and Sai, run away and make out a living for themselves in the countryside, where Sai used to live. Ka Fu worked in various jobs such as construction to make money to support themselves while Natalie stays home. Because of Natalie's father, Ka Fu made the headlines, depicting him as a rapist that kidnapped Natalie. Therefore, making Ka Fu a wanted person. The young lovers are eventually discovered by Ka Fu's parents after they forced Bing and Sai to tell them. When Natalie goes into early labor, they are forced to return to the city, where she gives birth to a baby boy (prematurely, although the baby survives) and Ka Fu is arrested. During the court scene, the relationships of the parents and their son and daughter are resolved as Natalie's father decided to let it go for the sake of the baby. During court, he revealed that he gave false information to the police about Natalie being underage due to his anger and prejudice towards Ka Fu. He eventually realized that even though Ka Fu got his daughter pregnant, he did try to make up his responsibility as he truly loves Natalie so he asked the judge to release him.

Henry was unhappy working there, and so in 1893 his father arranged an apprenticeship for him at a large butchers in Bradford. Three years later he left the apprenticeship and moved to Manchester where his sister Mary was one of the managers at a cabinet making firm. Not long after this he met a local girl, Mary Buxton, and they were married at St Anne's Church in Newton Heath, Manchester on 26 December 1898.  Career as a hangman  Henry Pierrepoint, pictured in the Evening Telegraph (Dundee) in 1922. In 1901, Henry was appointed to the list of executioners after repeatedly writing to the Home Office to offer his services. He participated in his first hanging on 19 November, as an assistant to James Billington. Over the next few years, he worked primarily as an assistant to William and John Billington before becoming the principal executioner of Britain in 1905. In 1906, he carried out all eight hangings in the country. Pierrepoint later persuaded his elder brother Thomas to join the family business, and reputedly trained him in a stable with a rope and sacks of corn. Later, an interview he gave, published in a local newspaper, inspired his son Albert to do the same. In his nine-year term of office Henry carried out 105 executions. His career was finished when he arrived the day before an execution at Chelmsford Prison \\"considerably the worse for drink\\", and fought his assistant John Ellis. Ellis reported the incident to the Home Office which decided, after receiving confirmation by the warders' account of the matter, to strike Henry from the list of approved executioners. Henry was never officially \\"dismissed\\", but he was removed from the list of executioners and invitations to conduct executions ceased to arrive. Throughout his career as an executioner, Pierrepoint occupied various other jobs, such as a position in Huddersfield gasworks, to supplement the relatively low pay English hangmen received. Henry had been suffering from a terminal illness for several years and died at his home in Failsworth on 14 December 1922, aged 44, although his age was incorrectly registered as 48.

Personal life  Pierrepoint was born in Sutton Bonington, Nottinghamshire, in 1870, the second child and eldest son of Thomas Pierrepoint, a plate layer on the railway, and Ann Pierrepoint, formerly Marriott. The Pierrepoint family were still living in Sutton Bonington at the time of the 1881 census,1881 census: Sutton Bonington; RG11; Piece 3149; Folio 26; Page 3. but by the 1891 census they had moved to Clayton, near Bradford, Yorkshire, where Thomas and his father were employed as stone quarrymen. He was married to Elizabeth Binns on 5 December 1891.West Yorkshire, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1813-1935 - Ancestry.co.uk By 1914, Pierrepoint had taken on a number of \\"sidelines\\", including a carrier service founded by his brother, a small farm, and an illegal bookmaking business.  Career  Thomas Pierrepoint began working as a hangman in 1906 under the influence of his brother, Henry. His career spanned 39 years, and ended in 1946, by which time he was in his mid-seventies. During this time, he is thought to have carried out 294 hangings, 203 of which were civilians executed in England and Wales; the remainder were executions carried out abroad or upon military personnel. Among those he executed was the poisoner Frederick Seddon in 1912. During World War II he was appointed as executioner by the US Military and was responsible for 13 out of 16 hangings of US soldiers at the Shepton Mallet military prison in Somerset. In this capacity, Pierrepoint carried out executions not only for murder but also rape which, at the time, was a capital crime under US military law although not in British law. In six of these cases he was assisted by his nephew Albert - who was principal hangman for the remaining three executions. In 1940, his medical fitness for the job was questioned by a medical officer who called him \\"unsecure\\" and doubted \\"whether his sight was good\\". The Prison Commission discreetly asked for reports on his performance during executions in the following time, but evidently found no reason to take action, although one report said that Thomas Pierrepoint had \\"smelled strongly of drink\\" on two occasions when reporting at the prison. This, however, appears to clash with Thomas Pierrepoint's instruction to Albert (when the latter acted as his assistant) not to take a drink if on the job and never to accept the drink customarily given to all witnesses at executions in the Republic of Ireland. Thomas never officially retired, rather his name was removed from the list of executioners and invitations to conduct executions ceased to arrive. He died at his daughter's home in Bradford on 11 February 1954, aged 83.

He is called in the Kojiki, and or in the Nihon Shoki. In Japanese mythology, he appears with his younger brother Yamasachi-hiko (Hoori). When the fish hook he lends to his younger brother is lost at sea, he demands its return rather than to accept any compensation. Later, he is defeated and subjugated by his younger brother, who has obtained mastery of the tides with a magic jewel. Genealogy According to the Kojiki, Umisachi- hiko or Hoderi (\\"Fire Shine\\") was the eldest son of the god Ninigi and the blossom princess Konohanasakuya-hime, who gave birth to triplets during the same delivery., Kojiki, pp. 117‚Äì119, note 10 (Hoderi-no-mikoto), p. 119 (\\"a prince who got his luck on the sea\\"). The Nihon Shoki refers to the birth of the triplets redundantly several times, and the names are represented inconsistently. In the main text, the eldest is given as , Nihongi, p. 73, Nihon shoki, p. 59 in one passage, and , Nihon shoki, p. 69, Nihongi, p. 85 gives \\"Ho-no-susori\\", evidently emending to conform to the earlier spelling. in another. Either way, Ho-no-suseri is described as the one with the \\"sea- gift\\"., Nihongi, p. 92, Nihon shoki, p. 74: \\"ÁÅ´ÈóåÈôçÂëΩ„ÅØ„ÄÅ„ÇÇ„Å®„ÇÇ„Å®Êµ∑„ÅÆÂπ∏„ÇíÂæó„ÇãÂäõ„ÇíÂÇô„Åà„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü (Ho-no- susori-no-mikoto was born with the gift to obtain umi no sachi, the bounty of the sea)\\" One alternate text cited in Nihon Shoki makes him the middle brother., Nihongi, p.85: \\"In one writing.. Ho-no-akari.. next.. Ho-no-susumi no Mikoto, also called Ho-no-suseri no Mikoto\\". The blossom princess Konohanasakuya-hime, with several aliases including ,, Kojiki, p. 66, Kojiki, p. 115}} announced her pregnancy after just one day of matrimonial relationship with Ninigi. Ninigi suspected the conception was not by him (the heavenly son), but had been previously fathered by one of the earth deities (kuni-tsu-kami). Offended by the suggestion, the princess sought to prove proper paternity by undergoing ordeal by fire: she declared she would seal herself up inside a maternity house, and set it aflame; then she avowed, may no child survive the birth if they were not of the seed of the divine Ninigi. Three children were born sound and hale, though they arrived at different hours, and the eldest born when fire was most intense became Hoderi, meaning \\"Fire Shine\\" (account according to Kojiki),, Kojiki, pp. 66‚Äì67; (tr.) pp. 250‚Äì251 The Nihon Shoki differs in saying the eldest son was born when the fire started, or when it was still smoldering, but the next son was born when the fire grew more intense., Nihongi, p. 73 (first passage), p. 85 (second passage of the main text) and as already noted, goes by the different name Ho- no-susori, perhaps meaning \\"flame skirt\\"., Nihongi, p. 73, note 1, \\"Hoderi-no- mikoto\\", pp. 166‚Äì167 Hoderi is recorded in these ancient chronicles as the ancestor of hayato people of Aka (Satsuma and ≈åsumi Provinces)., Kojiki, pp. 118, note 11 (Hayabito-ata-no-kimi)., Nihongi, pp. 73 (he was the ancestor of the Hayato), 100‚Äì101 and note 1. Storyline Hoderi grew to be a handsome youth along with his brother Hoori. His father, Ninigi, bequeathed onto his eldest son Hoderi a magic hook with the luck of the sea and bestowed on to his brother, Hoori, a magic bow to ensure both sons would be successful in each of their endeavors. With the gift of the magic hook, Hoderi spent most of his days fishing, at which he excelled. Hoderi saw that his brother Hoori, with his gift could go to the woods and hunt rain or shine, whereas he could not set his boat out to fish during any rain storm or heavy weather. Jealousy overwhelmed Hoderi and he insisted that his brother had the better of the two gifts and he being the older of the two should have the greater of the two gifts. Hoderi insisted that he and Hoori exchange gifts, thus Hoderi would then have the bow and become a hunter and his brother receive the hook and then be the more unfortunate one and become the fisherman. Hoori agreed to the exchange of two gifts in order to please his older brother. While Hoderi was out hunting in the mountains his younger brother Hoori spent the day fishing and proved to be a meager fisherman and he even had the misfortune to lose his brother's magic hook. During this time Hoderi spent the entire day hunting in the woods with the magic bow and every time he drew the magic bow the arrow would miss its intended mark. Disappointed and furious, Hoderi demanded that they return each other's magic gifts to its rightful owner. Hoori revealed to his older brother that he had lost his magic hook. Upon hearing the news Hoderi became furious and demanded that his brother find and return his hook. Hoori could not find his brothers hook and took his own sword, which he held dear, and broke it to many pieces. With the fragments of his sword Hoori constructed 500 fishing hooks which he presented to his brother. With the absence of his magic hook only infuriated Hoderi more and he threatened to kill his own brother if he did not find his magic hook. In searching for his brother's magic hook he fell in love with princess Toyotama-hime, daughter of ≈åwatatsumi-no-kami, the dragon kami of the sea, and made her his wife. Hoori explained the circumstance with his brother to his father in law, who summoned all the fishes in the sea to his palace and found the lost hook for Hoori. ≈åwatatsumi-no-kami gifted his new son in law with two jewels, one to raise tides and one to lower tides and had a spell put on the hook that would give bad luck to its user. Upon seeing that his brother returned home Hoderi attacked his brother and Hoori countered his attack with the use of his jewel that raised the tide in order to make him drown. Hoderi, drowning because of the tide, pleaded to his brother to save his life, so Hoori used the other jewel to lower the tide and saved his brother‚Äôs life. Being saved by Hoori, Hoderi vowed to his brother that he and his descendants would then on serve his brother and his children for all eternity. Hoderi's descendants are the Hayato who guard the palace to this day.

Lucia's life is not well documented, in part because she never danced in the most famous female roles. She was probably born about 1854 and died shortly after 1934. Her name appears on posters of ballet performances in Berlin, Brussels, St Petersburg, Guatemala, Boston (1883) and New York City (1884). In 1889 she appeared as the Premiere Danseuse Assoluta in Cinderella; Or, Ladybird, Ladybird, Fly Away Home at Her Majesty's Theatre, London and in 1900 she danced the role of Canio in a Metropolitan Opera production of Pagliacci (Philadelphia). Because of her tall muscular frame, Lucia was several times cast as a \\"travesty dancer\\" (a woman dressed as a man) -- for example as a male pirate chief in the ballet \\"Algeria\\" in 1887, and as a sorcerer in \\"Enchantment.\\" Such roles were sometimes added for effect in ballets without being properly integrated into the plot. Lucia's greatest success was as a choreographer from about 1893 to 1911. In 1903 she choreographed a production of Carmen for the Alhambra Theatre in London. She also taught, using the stage of the Alhambra since she had no studio of her own. In 1920, she collaborated with four other great dancers -- Adeline Gen√©e, Tamara Karsavina, Edouard Espinosa, and Phyllis Bedells‚Äîto form the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing, which was later to become the Royal Academy of Dance. Between them, the five represented the principal dance training methods of the time - Gen√©e the Danish school, Karsavina the Russian school, Cormani the Italian school, Espinosa the French school, and Bedells the English school. In 1923 the Association began a series of Annual Matin√©es; ten of Cormani's students participated in the premier performance, dancing a tarantella. Her collected letters are in the London Theatre Museum and there are dozens of photographs of Cormani in the National Portrait Gallery.

The Swan River Colony, established in June 1829, was the only British colony in Australia established on the basis of land grants to settlers. Under the conditions stipulated by the Colonial Office, settlers would be granted land in proportion to the value of assets and labour that they brought to the colony. To ensure \\"productive\\" use of land, settlers were not given full title to their grants until they had been sufficiently \\"improved\\". The system of land grants continued until 1832, after which crown land was disposed of by sale at auction. Land grants for settlers Under the initial land grant conditions, settlers were granted 40 acres (162,000 m¬≤) of land for every ¬£3 of assets invested in the colony. Assessment of the value of assets was left to the discretion of the authorities, whose valuations were inaccurate and inconsistent. One settler observed a tendency to overvalue cattle while undervaluing general cargo, and Statham (1981) cites an example where two rabbits entitled a settler to a grant of 200 acres (809,000 m¬≤). For the purposes of assessing land entitlements, assets had to be physical capital applicable to land use; money was not assessed. In consequence, many settlers maximised their land entitlements by arriving with large amounts of expensive capital but very little cash. This gross overcapitalisation caused the financial ruin of many early emigrants, and had a lasting deleterious effect on the colony's economy. Moreover, much of the larger machinery that was imported was useless in Western Australian conditions. Settlers were also entitled to 200 acres (809,000 m¬≤) of land for every adult introduced at their expense, with lesser entitlements for children. This condition had the effect of encouraging settlers to bring out indentured servants, and some brought out more than they were capable of employing and supporting in the long term. Indentured servants received their keep, but earned no wages until they had paid off their passage; thus the widespread use of indentured servants tended to immobilise the labour workforce and reduce the market for goods and services. When the first settlers arrived at the colony, it was quickly discovered that the quantity of good land had been greatly exaggerated. In fact the only good farmland near the site of the colony was a narrow corridor of alluvial soil along the Swan and Canning rivers, and much of this was immediately taken up by government officials and military personnel. The vast amounts of land promised to settlers was so far out of proportion to the available good land that Stirling was obliged to limit the amount of river frontage per grant, forcing the Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe to grant long thin \\"ribbon\\" allotments each with a small amount of river frontage. Stirling also limited the amount of land that each settler could claim near Perth, with the balance of their entitlements to be claimed further out, in areas yet to be declared available for selection. Improvement conditions To ensure that land holdings were used productively, and to discourage speculation, settlers were initially granted only right of occupation. Full ownership of the land, including the right to sell, was withheld until every acre had been improved by at least one shilling and six pence, through clearing, fencing, cultivation, and so on. Settlers who failed to improve at least a quarter of their grant within three years could be fined, and land not wholly improved within ten years would be resumed by the crown. Settlers were not permitted to average their improvements over their grant; the conditions specifically stated that every acre had to be improved by 1s 6d. This was to cause much inefficient use of capital in the early years of the colony, as settlers were forced to spread their efforts across their entire grant, rather than consolidating a smaller area first. Despite the conditions, some settlers found creative ways to retain their land without working it. For example, when George Fletcher Moore arrived in the colony in 1830, he obtained half of William Lamb's grant on the Swan River, by agreeing to perform the improvements necessary to secure title to the entire grant. Other land grants Although the land grants to settlers were conditional on their meeting improvement conditions, many unconditional grants were also made. A number of important officials and capitalists were granted large areas of land as reward for service; James Stirling, Charles Fremantle and Thomas Peel were all recipients of such grants. In addition, military personnel were permitted to claim land in lieu of pay, and these grants did not have conditions attached. Much of the land obtained in this way was not developed, being instead held for speculative reasons. The large amounts of good land tied up in this way was often blamed later for the slow progress of the colony. Changes to conditions Land grant conditions changed a number of times in the following years. In 1830, in an attempt to discourage speculation, Stirling halved the rate of land grants to 20 acres (81,000 m¬≤) per ¬£3 of assets plus 100 acres (404,000 m¬≤) per adult, and reduced the time limit for improvements from ten years to four. At the end of 1830 the new settlement had granted over 1 million acres (4,000 km¬≤) to settlers, of which only 169 acres (684,000 m¬≤) were actively being farmed. In 1831, the Colonial Office published what became known as the Ripon Regulations, which declared that crown land in Australia would from 1832 onwards be sold rather than granted. In Western Australia, public opinion held that the abolition of land grants would end emigration to the colony. So concerned were the settlers that Stirling was sent to England to plead their case on this and other matters. He was largely unsuccessful, and the granting of crown land ceased in 1832. Settlers who had previously been granted land continued to be bound by the grant conditions. In 1837, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, responded to constant complaints by settlers about the strict enforcement of improvement conditions, by introducing land surrender provisions that allowed settlers to claim title to part of their grant by surrendering the remainder. Glenelg's intention was to enforce concentrated settlement in accordance with Edward Gibbon Wakefield's colonisation principles, which were in vogue at the time. However, because most settlers had elongated grants of which only a small portion was productive, the effect was to allow many settlers to secure title to their productive land by discarding the unproductive land. Being no longer obliged to improve their holdings, settlers of means could then invest their time and money in discovering and buying good land further from the settlement. Thus the effect was to further disperse the colony, and to concentrate the colony's wealth in a few hands. Effect on indigenous people In the framing of the land grant conditions, no provisions were made for the indigenous people of the area, who were incorrectly thought to be nomads with no claim to the land over which they travelled. Most settlers refused the indigenous people permission to camp on or even pass through their grants. As more and more land was granted and fenced off, the indigenous people were increasingly denied access to their sacred sites and traditional hunting grounds. For example, by 1832 the Beeliar group were unable to approach the Swan or Canning Rivers without danger, because land grants lined the banks. References * *Cameron, James (2000).

The phalanges are buoyant, and the seeds within them can remain viable for many months while being transported by ocean currents. = Leaves = The leaves of Pandanus tectorius are usually in length and in width. They possess saw-like margins. Some varieties have spines along the edges and ribs throughout the leaves. The leaves are spirally arranged at the end of the branches.  Taxonomy  Pandanus tectorius was first described by Sydney Parkinson in 1774. It is an angiosperm belonging to the genus Pandanus of the family Pandanaceae. Distribution Pandanus tectorius grows natively from the Philippines through the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. It is found in parts of Malesia (the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Java, the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Maluku Islands and the Philippines), throughout Papuasia, and in most of the tropical Pacific. In Australia, it is native to an area from Port Macquarie in New South Wales to northern Queensland. Both the US and the Hawaiian Islands recognize only one indigenous species, P. tectorius. Its exact native range is unknown due to extensive cultivation; it may be an early Polynesian introduction to many of the more isolated Pacific islands on which it occurs. These islands include Micronesia and Melanesia. In Hawaii, P. tectorius is found natively on all the main islands except Kaho ªolawe., and it is known to have predated human settlement, based on seed and pollen samples taken from Kauai's Makauwahi Cave. Habitat Pandanus tectorius naturally grows in coastal regions, such as on mangrove margins and beaches, at elevations from sea level to . It requires of annual rainfall and seasons will fluctuate from wet to dry. Pandanus tectorius is considered more drought tolerant than coconut trees. The trees have adapted to drought by reducing fruiting. Thatch Screwpine is well adapted to grow in the many soil types present on coasts, including quartz sand, coral sand, and peat, as well as in limestone and basalt. P. tectorius is salt and wind tolerant and favors slightly acidic to basic soil (pH of 6-10). The trees are strong and can typically withstand tropical storms. It prefers to grow in full sunlight, but grows well with 30-50% shade. It will not tolerate shade above 70%. Ecology There are a wide range of natural enemies that pose a threat to P. tectorius such as parasites, pathogens, and herbivores. They attack the leaves, roots, stems, and growing points. The stick insect Megacrania batesii lives and feeds only on this species.  Cultivation  Pandanus tectorius plants grown from seed tend to flower at around 15 years old versus those grown from branch cutting. Flowering from trees grown these way happen much earlier, always by 6 years old and typically by 3 to 4 years of age. (thom) The trees are either male of female. Female trees typically flower 1 to 3 times per year while male trees will flower every 2 months. It is thought to produce sexually in Hawaii, but there is some evidence that apomixis occurs. Small insects, such as bees, and wind are usually the pollinators. It takes 1 to 2 years from pollination to harvest to produce fruit on female trees. Seasons vary amongst locations and varieties. For example, in Fiji the pollination season is March to May, in Northern Australia it is April to August, and in Micronesia, there are two season December to March and July to September. Most varieties produce 8 to 12 fruits per tree every 2 years. Each fruit usually weighs between 7 and 15 kg and contains 35 to 80 edible keys. Pandanus tectorius plants are usually propagated by seed in Hawaii. Soak the keys in cool tap water for 5 days while frequently changing the water. Viable keys will float, so it is important to keep them. In Growing native Hawaiian plants: a how-to guide for the gardner, Bornhorst says to remove the fleshy layer of the key and then bury the seed half-way in planting soil. It is important to keep the soil most. P. tectorius can also be grown from large cutting. Selected forms are propagated by stem cuttings in Micronesia. Morphological traits looked for include aerial roots. Plants selected have 2/3 of their leaves trimmed off to prevent water loss. In Native Hawaiian plants for tropical seaside landscaping, Moriarty says for best results use mature branches with leaves and small aerial roots. Then root in a sand bed. Plants grown from cutting produce fruit in 4 to 6 years. Propagation by grafting is not applicable. Uses The fruit of Pandanus tectorius is edible. Some varieties and cultivars contain significant amounts of calcium oxalate, so need thorough cooking before being consumed. Other cultivars contain very little to no calcium oxalate and can be eaten raw. It is an important food source in the atolls of Micronesia and Polynesia, with the fruit commonly eaten raw or turned into a dried paste or flour. It is also one of the traditional foods of Maldivian cuisine.Eating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture The fibrous nature of the fruit also serves as a natural dental floss. It is also used in Samoan culture as a ula fala, a necklace made out of the dried fruit painted in red and is worn by the Matai during special occasions and functions. Australian Aborigines extracted the slender, edible seeds. This seed and the fruit, was an important food. The tree's leaves are often used as flavoring for sweet dishes such as kaya jam. It is also used in Sri Lankan cookery, where the leaves are used to flavor a variety of curries. Leaves were used by the Polynesians to make baskets, mats, outrigger canoe sails, thatch roofs, and grass skirts. The fragrant male flowers are used in perfumery and are also distilled to make Kewra. A large shrub or small tree of immense cultural, health, and economic importance in the Pacific, it is second only to coconut on atolls. It grows wild mainly in semi-natural vegetation in littoral habitats throughout the tropical and subtropical Pacific, where it can withstand drought, strong winds, and salt spray. It propagates readily from seed, but it is also widely propagated from branch cuttings by local people for farms and home gardens. It grows fairly quickly, and all parts are used, from the nutritious fruits of edible varieties to the poles and branches in construction to the leaves for weaving and garlands. The plant is prominent in Pacific culture and tradition, including local medicine. Hundreds of cultivated varieties are known by their local names and characteristics of fruits, branches, and leaves. At present, there is evidence that this diversity is declining, with certain varieties becoming difficult to find. The reasons include less replanting, deforestation, fire, flagging interest by the new generation, and rapid population growth leading to urbanization.http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf Culture The seal of Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii features the hala tree, in part because lauhala, the art of weaving with the leaves of that tree, is pivotal to the history of the island, with everything from houses to pillows being made in this fashion. Local legend tells of an aged Hawaiian couple who lived long ago above the present Punahou campus, and had to travel far for water. They prayed each night for a spring, but to no avail. Finally one night, in a dream answering their prayers, they were told to uproot the stump of an old hala tree. They did as they were told and found a spring of clear, sweet water, which they named Ka Punahou, the New Spring. According to legend, Punahou School's lily pond is fed by this same spring.

Though he tends to gravitate towards the genre of smooth jazz, Bromberg has released some straight-ahead jazz records in which he performs with a trio, and has even ventured into more rock-oriented jazz fusion territory as of late. His innovative and technically demanding style of playing extends to both electric and upright bass. On his acoustic bass albums, Bromberg performs jazzy interpretations of various pop and rock staples from the 1960s and '70s completely solo. Regarding his work with electric bass, Bromberg, among other bassists, helped popularize the piccolo bass, or bass with each string tuned an octave up, by releasing several albums in which he plays both the bass line and melody. For instance, upon first listen many will be surprised to learn that, although soaring guitar can be heard throughout the album, Bromberg's 2005 release Metal contains only Bromberg on two overdubbed basses, one of which is heavily effects-laden to make it sound like an electric guitar.  Biography  Bromberg was born on December 5, 1960, in Tucson, Arizona. His father and brother, David, who both played drums, influenced him to take up the instrument himself. At the age of 13, he began seriously pursuing a career as a drummer. However, at around the same time, the leader of his school orchestra steered him towards the upright bass. From then on, he committed to stick to a strict practice regimen and even \\"tested out of high school early\\" because of the rigorous schedule he set for himself. Still, plucking away in his basement was only half of the plan. It was integral for Bromberg to gain experience playing in live situations. Thus, he accepted virtually every gig he could get. It was somewhat common for Bromberg to play \\"five to seven nights a week with several different bands.\\" In 1979, Marc Johnson, the bassist working for the jazz pianist Bill Evans, heard Bromberg's playing. Johnson later suggested Bromberg to saxophonist Stan Getz, who was in search of a new bass player. Getz took the suggestion seriously, and auditioned Bromberg soon thereafter. Within only six years of picking up the bass, Bromberg found himself at the age of 19 touring internationally with Getz. Other than the thrill of playing with a world-class tenor saxophonist, more opportunities began to reveal themselves to the young bass player, who would go on to work with many big names in the music business and eventually become a producer of various artists in his genre. In March 2011, Brian partnered with Carvin Guitars to produce a signature model electric bass. The B24 and B25 were based on his own design, which was previously manufactured by Peavey and Dean. In 2014, Carvin rebranded to Kiesel for most new instruments, and the Brian Bromberg model followed suit in 2015.  Releases as a solo artist  Bromberg's first several albums were in the smooth jazz genre. He began with two records that caught smooth jazz radio's attention: A New Day in 1986 and Basses Loaded in 1988. His third album, Magic Rain (1989) \\"became the most played album on radio during the first week of its release\\".Jazz Spotlight featuring Brian Bromberg - Wood II on Artistry Music @ jazzreview.com Bromberg's fourth record, BASSically Speaking, which is his oldest material re-mastered with some new additions, reached the top 5 on the radio charts and No. 7 on the Billboard sales charts. With solid following among smooth jazz fans, he put out a straight ahead jazz album, It's About Time, The Acoustic Project. This album reached number four on the mainstream jazz charts in 1991. Bromberg recorded in a trio with Freddie Hubbard and Ernie Watts. After It's About Time, The Acoustic Project he returned to smooth jazz. The label that released Brian Bromberg (1993) went out of business the week of its release. In 1996, after a short break from recording to design basses for Peavey and touring as a clinician, Bromberg signed with Zebra Records. In February 1998, he released You Know That Feeling, which as recorded with Rick Braun, Joe Sample, Jeff Lorber, and Everette Harp. The album became Bromberg's most successful, later to be topped by Wood, and his first smooth jazz number one record of his career. You Know That Feeling had three singles in a row that each went to number three on the charts. It spent seventeen consecutive months on the charts, eight months in the top ten, nearly six months in the top five. Bromberg's album was the fifth most-played album from the top 100 albums of the year in smooth jazz. Songs from You Know That Feeling are still regularly played in smooth jazz stations across America. Additionally, in 2003, Bromberg made a record simply titled Jaco in which he performs many of Jaco Pastorius's notable songs. After You Know That Feeling, Bromberg's albums deviated from his smooth jazz roots. Wood (2002), produced by a Japanese label, was recorded with pianist Randy Waldman and brother David Bromberg on drums. Wood contains solo jazz versions of \\"Carry on My Wayward Son\\" by Kansas and \\"Let 'Em In\\" by Paul McCartney.Brian Bromberg at All About Jazz. In addition to the solo pieces, Wood and Wood 2 (with drummer Vinnie Colaiuta replacing David Bromberg) contain interpretations of music by Wayne Shorter and Woody Herman. On an even sharper turn from his smooth jazz past, Bromberg released Metal (2005) with drummer Joel Taylor. As a record producer, Bromberg has produced eight top-ten hits, seven top-five hits, and two number-one hits. Apart from his 300-year-old double bass, he uses Dean, Bob Mick, Mick Donner and Peavey basses with Epifani amplification. He also owns a signature edition Carvin bass.

It was located in Belgrade's municipality of Savski Venac to which northern section it generally corresponds today.  Location  Zapadni Vraƒçar was located in the area which today covers the northern part of the municipality of Savski Venac. It bordered the neighborhoods of Savamala and Bara Venecija to the north, Istoƒçni Vraƒçar (today Vraƒçar) to the east and Senjak and Jatagan Mala (today Mostar and Prokop) to the south. It makes the western part of the much larger former neighborhood of Vraƒçar.  History  Building of Zapadni Vraƒçar marks the start of the construction of modern Belgrade, after the Ottoman occupation. It was constructed with broad streets and boulevards, parks and monuments. It was housing all Serbian public buildings and state institutions, in the first half of the 19th century. The Christian population which lived within the moat of the medieval Belgrade's Kalemegdan fortress, overpopulated the city. Due to the Turkish presence, it was demanded that Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá spread the surroundings. The immediate surroundings comprised the villages of Savamala, Palilula, and large uninhibited reclaimed areas of what used to be the \\"Ciganska Bara\\", later renamed into Bara Venecija, broad swampy areas and vineyards). Belgrade's rich went hunting wild geese to the unnamed pool, nowadays the crossroads of Kneza Milo≈°a and Kralja Milana's streets. Where the Zeleni Venac market is today, at the beginning of the 20th century was a pool, as well as the site of an unsuccessful attempt of the construction of the National Theatre. From 1929 to 1935 a public swimming pool was built within the complex of the DIF building. It was the second such venue in Belgrade, after the 1904 pool at the Steam Bath of the Brothers Krsmanoviƒá, in the neighborhood of Dorƒáol.  Municipality  Old DIF building The municipality of Vraƒçar was officially formed in 1952 after Belgrade was administratively reorganized from districts (rejon) to municipalities. Already on September 1, 1955 Vraƒçar was divided into Zapadni Vraƒçar and Istoƒçni Vraƒçar. Year and a half later, on January 1, 1957, parts of Istoƒçni Vraƒçar merged with the municipality of Neimar and the western part of the municipality of Terazije to create new, albeit the smallest one municipality in Belgrade. Zapadni Vraƒçar merged with the municipality of Topƒçidersko Brdo to create the municipality of Savski Venac, while the easternmost section of Istoƒçni Vraƒçar became part of the municipality of Zvezdara. Zapadni Vraƒçar is still a name of the small local community within Savski Venac, with a population of 7,644 in 2002 (15,991 including neighboring local communities).  Features  The is located in the neighborhood, at 27 Deligradska Street. It is better known today as the Old DIF (Stari DIF). The building was constructed from 1929 to 1935. Original plans envisioned much more sculptural ornaments on the fa√ßade, but during the construction the project was reduced to the more plain appearance. It was designed by architect Momir Korunoviƒá, known as the \\"Serbian Gaudi\\", and is today considered his best public service object in Belgrade. The building was declared a cultural monument in 2007.

The Stockholm Codex Aureus (Stockholm, National Library of Sweden, MS A. 135, also known as the Codex Aureus of Canterbury and Codex Aureus Holmiensis) is a Gospel book written in the mid-eighth century in Southumbria, probably in Canterbury, whose decoration combines Insular and Italian elements. Southumbria produced a number of important illuminated manuscripts during the eighth and early ninth centuries, including the Vespasian Psalter, the Stockholm Codex Aureus, three Mercian prayer books (the Royal Prayer book, the Book of Nunnaminster and the Book of Cerne), the Tiberius Bede and the British Library's Royal Bible. Description Evangelist portrait of Saint John First page The manuscript has 193 surviving folios which measure . It contains the text of the four Gospels in Latin written in an uncial script on vellum leaves that alternately are dyed purple and undyed. The purple-dyed leaves are written with gold, silver, and white pigment, the undyed ones with black ink and red pigment. On some folios, the differing colours of ink are arranged to form geometric patterns. Purple parchment was, in the Roman and Byzantine Empires, reserved for Imperial manuscripts, and in the West reserved for the grandest commissions, and often only seen on a few pages.Dodwell, 157 The illustration programme includes two surviving evangelist portraits, six canon tables and seven large decorated initials. The manuscript is the oldest surviving example of initials decorated with gold leaf. The style is a blend of Insular art, as in the Chi-Rho initial shown, and Mediterranean traditions, possibly including some from early Carolingian art. In the opening shown at the start of Matthew the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace. The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of Frankish manuscripts of the period. Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles. The other surviving evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of hanging bowls.Nordenfalk, 96-107, Wilson 94 This is one of the so-called \\"Tiberius group\\" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with Kent, or perhaps the kingdom of Mercia in the heyday of the Mercian Supremacy.

The others are Ceolhard, Niclas and Ealhhun, who were presumably the monks responsible for creating the manuscript and the elaborate metalwork cover it no doubt originally possessed.Dodwell, 51-52 In the late ninth century it was looted by a Viking army and Ealdorman Aelfred (Alfred), ealdorman of Surrey, had to pay a ransom to get it back. Above and below the Latin text of the Gospel of St. Matthew is an added inscription in Old English recording how the manuscript was ransomed from a Viking army who had stolen it on one of their raids in Kent by Alfred, and given to Christ Church, Canterbury. It reads: :\\"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I, Ealdorman Alfred and W√¶rburh my wife obtained these books from the heathen army with our pure money, that was with pure gold, and this we did for the love of God and for the benefit of our souls and because we did not wish these holy books to remain longer in heathen possession. And now they wish to give them to Christ Church to the praise and glory and honour of God...\\"Nordenfalk, 106; Dodwell, 9 has the full text In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was in Spain, and in 1690 it was bought for the Swedish royal collection.

He is one of the ancestors of the Emperors of Japan as the grandfather of Emperor Jimmu. He is also known as . Mythology Hoori's legend is told in both the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki. Hoori was a hunter, and he had an argument with his brother Hoderi, a fisherman, over a fish-hook that Hoori had forced his elder brother to lend him and had lost. Hoderi claimed that Hoori should give back the fish-hook, for he refused to accept another one (due to the belief that each tool is animated and hence unique). Hoori then descended to the bottom of the sea to search, but was unable to find it. Instead, he found Toyotama-hime, the daughter of the sea god, Ry≈´jin. The sea god helped Hoori find Hoderi's lost hook, and Hoori later married Toyotama-hime. Hoori lived with his wife in a palace under the sea for three years, but after that Hoori became home-sick and wished to return to his own country. His brother forgave him after he returned the hook, and Toyotama-hime gave birth to a son named Ugayafukiaezu. During the time when Toyotamahime was giving birth to her child, she had Hoori swear not to attempt to see her real figure. But he broke his promise and discovered her true form was a dragon (specifically a wani). She was ashamed and returned to her father, never to return. Ugayafukiaezu married Toyotama- hime's sister, Tamayori-hime, who brought him up, and she gave birth to Emperor Jimmu, who was the first Emperor of Japan. Hoori reigned in Takachiho, Hyuga Province for 560 years. Hoori is often associated with both his parents and his wife. He is worshiped mainly as a god of cereals or grain. In Japanese mythology, it was said that the part of his name meant fire, but etymologically, it is a different character pronounced , which refers to crops, particularly rice. indicates a crop that is so rich, it bends under its own weight.

It was located in Belgrade's municipality of Vraƒçar to which it generally corresponds today.  Location  Istoƒçni Vraƒçar was located in the area which is today covered by the territory of the municipality of Vraƒçar and the westernmost section of the municipality of Zvezdara (local community (mesna zajednica) of Vraƒçarsko Polje) and represents the eastern part of the former, much larger neighborhood of Vraƒçar (see Zapadni Vraƒçar).  History  Istoƒçni Vraƒçar started to be built since 1880 when a Scottish businessman and Nazarene Francis Mackenzie bought a large piece of land nearby (which eventually became known as Englezovac, Serbian for Englishman's place), parcelled it out into lots for selling and donated a piece of land to the Serbian Orthodox Church for the construction of the Temple of Saint Sava. Later, Istoƒçni Vraƒçar extended to Grantovac, an area of land belonging to the American consul Edward Maxwell Grant and Krunski Venac around the Krunska street, a street starting from the Royal Park and ending with Kaleniƒá market. Kaleniƒá market is the largest open air market in Belgrade and is the commercial centre of modern Vraƒçar.  Municipality  The municipality of Vraƒçar was officially formed in 1952 after Belgrade was administratively reorganized from districts (rejon) to municipalities. On 1 September 1955, Vraƒçar was divided into Zapadni Vraƒçar and Istoƒçni Vraƒçar. A year and a half later, on 1 January 1957, parts of Istoƒçni Vraƒçar merged with the municipality of Neimar and the western part of the municipality of Terazije to create a new, albeit smaller, municipality in Belgrade. Zapadni Vraƒçar became municipality of Savski Venac, while the easternmost section of Istoƒçni Vraƒçar became part of the municipality of Zvezdara.

It is mainly attested by an inscription found on a funerary stele, termed the Lemnos stele, discovered in 1885 near Kaminia. Fragments of inscriptions on local pottery show that it was spoken there by a community.Bonfante, p. 11. In 2009, a newly discovered inscription was reported from the site of Hephaistia, the principal ancient city of Lemnos.de Simone Lemnian is largely accepted as being closely related to Etruscan. After the Athenians conquered the island in the latter half of the 6th century BC, Lemnian was replaced by Attic Greek. Writing system The Lemnian inscriptions are in Western Greek alphabet, also called \\"red alphabet\\". The red type is found in most parts of central and northern mainland Greece (Thessaly, Boeotia and most of the Peloponnese), as well as the island of Euboea, and in colonies associated with these places, including most colonies in Italy. The alphabet used for Lemnian inscriptions is similar to an archaic variant used to write the Etruscan language in southern Etruria.

Quaderni annuali dell'Istituto di Studi sulle Civilt√† italiche e del Mediterraneo antico del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. Supplemento 8], Pisa ‚Äì Roma: 2013. A relationship between Lemnian and Etruscan, as a Tyrsenian language family, has been proposed by German linguist Helmut Rix due to close connections in vocabulary and grammar. For example, * Both Etruscan and Lemnian share two unique dative cases, type-I *-si and type-II *-ale, shown both on the Lemnos Stele (Hulaie-≈°i, \\"for Hulaie\\", Œ¶ukiasi-ale, \\"for the Phocaean\\") and in inscriptions written in Etruscan (aule-si, \\"to Aule\\", on the Cippus Perusinus; as well as the inscription mi mulu Laris-ale Velœáaina-si, meaning \\"I was blessed for Laris Velchaina\\"); * A few lexical correspondences have been noted, such as Lemnian avis ('year') and Etruscan avils (genitive case); or Lemnian ≈°ialœá‚Äévis ('forty') and Etruscan ≈°ealœá‚Äéls (genitive case), both sharing the same internal structure \\"number + decade suffix + inflectional ending\\" (Lemnian: ≈°i + alœá‚Äévi + -s, Etruscan: ≈°e + alœá‚Äél + s); *They also share the genitive in *-s and a simple past tense in *-a-i (Etruscan - as in ame \\"was\\" (< *amai); Lemnian - as in ≈°ivai, meaning \\"lived\\").

Common features between Lemnian, Etruscan, and Rhaetic have been found in morphology, phonology, and syntax. On the other hand, few lexical correspondences are documented, at least partly due to the scanty number of Rhaetian and Lemnian texts. The Tyrsenian family, or Common Tyrrhenic, in this case is often considered to be Paleo-European and to predate the arrival of Indo-European languages in southern Europe.Mellaart, James (1975), \\"The Neolithic of the Near East\\" (Thames and Hudson) The Lemnian language could have arrived in the Aegean Sea during the Late Bronze Age, when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from Sicily, Sardinia and various parts of the Italian peninsula. Vowels Like Etruscan, the Lemnian language appears to have had a four-vowel system, consisting of \\"i\\", \\"e\\", \\"a\\" and \\"u\\". Other languages in the neighbourhood of the Lemnian area, namely Hittite and Akkadian, had similar four-vowel systems, suggesting early areal influence. Lemnos Stele Lemnos stele The stele was found built into a church wall in Kaminia and is now at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. The 6th century date is based on the fact that in 510 BC the Athenian Miltiades invaded Lemnos and Hellenized it.Herodotus, 6.136-140 The stele bears a low-relief bust of a man and is inscribed in an alphabet similar to the western (\\"Chalcidian\\") Greek alphabet. The inscription is in Boustrophedon style, and has been transliterated but had not been successfully translated until serious linguistic analysis based on comparisons with Etruscan, combined with breakthroughs in Etruscan's own translation started to yield fruit. The inscription consists of 198 characters forming 33 to 40 words, word separation sometimes indicated with one to three dots. The text consists of three parts, two written vertically and one horizontally. Comprehensible is the phrase avi≈° sialœávi≈° (\\"aged sixty\\", B.3), reminiscent of Etruscan avils maœás ≈õealœáisc (\\"and aged sixty-five\\").

The gameplay and visuals are similar to Super Mario Bros., but with a more bizarre and offbeat twist.  Gameplay  Player(s) take the roles of the game's titular twins, who can use a bubble gun to entrap enemies, then jump on their heads to defeat them. Enemies include monsters and ducks. Both twins can use their heads to break bricks, some of which contain power- ups, hence the name Hard Head. Levels are completed by finding a soccer ball and kicking it through a goal to finish the stage; there are 16 levels in total. The game can be played in either single player mode or cooperative mode, allowing Player 2 to control the second Hard Head twin whenever they choose to join the gameplay.  Reception  Advanced Computer Entertainment compared the game to Super Mario Bros. and called it \\"unoriginal but addicting fun.\\"\\"Hard Head review. Advanced Computer Entertainment. February 1989. p. 21 Your Sinclair also compared the game to Super Mario Bros., calling it a tribute to Nintendo's game. They also made note of the game's offbeat humor, saying that the game was a \\"good laugh\\" and \\"exactly the same as one of the funniest computer games ever.\\" They rated the game an 8 out of 10.Hard Head. Your Sinclair. March 1989. p. 78.  Legacy  In 1991, a sequel was produced, titled Hard Head 2. It was released in North America by Space Age Electronics. Unlike the first game, Hard Head 2 based on Toki. In the game's story, Hard Head is dancing with his girlfriend when the devil captures her. In between levels, the devil chews on his girlfriend, and Hard Head says \\"I am going to rescue you, may you being safe!...\\". Hard Head can take two hits from an enemy. After one hit from an enemy, Hard Head loses his overalls and runs around completely naked. Also, the function of the bubble gun has been changed: enemies can't be enclosed in the bubbles anymore, now it is just a regular gun. New weapons have been added: a club and a morning star. Also, now Hard Head can pick up wings, which make him able to glide by holding the jump button down.

The PMAG is composed of performance measurement experts representing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement. The PMAG may seek additional expertise and/or input from other national health care organizations, as necessary, for the development of Category II codes. These may include national medical specialty societies, other national health care professional associations, accrediting bodies and federal regulatory agencies. Category II codes make use of an alphabetical character as the 5th character in the string (i.e., 4 digits followed by the letter F). These digits are not intended to reflect the placement of the code in the regular (Category I) part of the CPT codebook. Appendix H in CPT section contains information about performance measurement exclusion of modifiers, measures, and the measures' source(s). Currently there are 11 Category II codes.

The AMA holds the copyright for the CPT coding system.AMA (CPT) CPT Licensing However, in Practice Management v. American Medical Association the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that while the AMA owned the copyright, it could not enjoin a competitor on the basis that the AMA had misused its copyright. Practice Management had argued that the publication of the CPT into federal regulation invalidated the copyright; the general debate around copyright and regulation access was revived in 2012 by a petition motivated by an Administrative Conference of the United States recommendation. Despite the copyrighted nature of the CPT code sets, the use of the code is mandated by almost all health insurance payment and information systems, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and HIPAA, and the data for the code sets appears in the Federal Register. As a result, it is necessary for most users of the CPT code (principally providers of services) to pay license fees for access to the code. =Limited CPT search offered by the AMA= In the past, AMA offered a limited search of the CPT manual for personal, non-commercial use on its web site.AMA (2012). \\"cpt¬Æ Code/Relative Value Search\\".

Yorick exchanging snuffboxes with Father Lorenzo: \\"having a horn snuff box in his hand, he presented it open to me.‚ÄîYou shall taste mine‚Äîsaid I, pulling out my box and putting it into his hand.\\" A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy is a novel by Laurence Sterne, written and first published in 1768, as Sterne was facing death. In 1765, Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples, and after returning determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view. The novel can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimental Travels Through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modeled the character of Smelfungus on him. The novel was extremely popular and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the second half of the 18th century. Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical learning and objective non-personal points of view, A Sentimental Journey emphasized the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments, of manners and morals over classical learning. Throughout the 1770s female travel writers began publishing significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts. Sentiment also became a favorite style among those expressing non-mainstream views, including political radicalism. The narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick, who is slyly represented to guileless readers as Sterne's barely disguised alter ego. The book recounts his various adventures, usually of the amorous type, in a series of self-contained episodes. The book is less eccentric and more elegant in style than Tristram Shandy and was better received by contemporary critics. It was published on 27 February, and on 18 March Sterne died. Plot summary The Beautiful Grisette, 1853, by William Powell Frith, showing a scene from the book. Parson Yorick‚Äîdepicted as Sterne‚Äîand the gloveseller, Grisette, are in her Paris shop. Yorick's journey starts in Calais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes. He buys a chaise to continue his journey. The next town he visits is Montreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur. During his stay in Paris, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France (Sterne traveled to Paris in January 1762, before the Seven Years' War ended), he risks imprisonment in the Bastille. Yorick decides to travel to Versailles, where he visits the Count de B**** to acquire a passport. When Yorick notices the count reads Hamlet, he points with his finger at Yorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly. Yorick returns to Paris, and continues his voyage to Italy after staying in Paris for a few more days. Along the way he decides to visit Maria‚Äîwho was introduced in Sterne's previous novel, Tristram Shandy‚Äîin Moulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves. After having passed Lyon during his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. Because there is only one bedroom, he is forced to share the room with a lady and her chamber-maid (\\"fille de chambre\\"). When Yorick can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during the night, an altercation with the lady ensues. During the confusion, Yorick accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to the chamber-maid. The last line is: \\"when I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre's...End of vol II\\". The sentence is open to interpretation. You can say the last word is omitted, or that he stretched out his hand, and caught hers (this would be grammatically correct). Another interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into the sentence, so that he grabs the Fille de Chambre's 'End'. Sequel Because Sterne died before he could finish the novel, his long-time friend John Hall-Stevenson (identified with Eugenius in the novel) wrote a continuation. It is titled Yorick's Sentimental Journey Continued: To Which Is Prefixed Some Account of the Life and Writings of Mr. Sterne. Legacy In the 1880s, American writer Elizabeth Robins Pennell and her artist husband Joseph Pennell undertook a journey following Sterne's route. Their travels by tandem bicycle were turned into the book Our sentimental journey through France and Italy (1888). Viktor Shklovsky considered Sterne one of his most important precursors as a writer, and his own A Sentimental Journey: Memoirs, 1917‚Äì1922 was indebted to both Sterne's own Sentimental Journey and Tristram Shandy.Richard Sheldon, intro. to Shklovsky, A Sentimental Journey: Memoirs, 1917‚Äì1922 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2004: ), p. xvi.

He wrote about what he called the Mathematics of History, a cyclical theory on the evolution of civilizations.  Biography  Deulofeu was born at L'Armentera in the province of Girona, Catalonia (Spain), where his father was a pharmacist. When he was three years old his family moved to Sant Pere Pescador, and then to Figueres nine years later. He attended high school in the Institut Ramon Muntaner of Barcelona. Later he studied pharmacy and chemistry in Madrid, completing his studies in chemistry in Barcelona. Once back in Figueres, after a competitive examination he was awarded a teaching post at the Institute of Figueres. At the same time, he became strongly involved in politics. First he was a leader of the Republican Nationalist Youth in Empord√† and afterwards he became a town councilor of the independentist party ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya). During the Spanish Civil War he became mayor of Figueres by chance, and while serving in this office he tried to keep the peace, and prevent looting and political witch hunts. He also served in the Republican Army as a health officer. On 5 February 1939, Deulofeu accompanied the defeated republican forces into exile where he followed several trades: working as a teacher of various subjects; experimenting with farming, particularly hydroponics inventing his own growth solutions; working as a bricklayer, as a factory worker, and as a writer and poet. He played the violin and the saxophone in several music groups, both modern and classical. After returning from exile on 22 January 1947 he dedicated himself to pharmacy, carried out research and continued to write, although he died without finishing the extended version of his main work, Mathematics of History. During his life he was friends with Francesc Pujols and Salvador Dal√≠.  Theories  Deulofeu argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles which correspond to the natural cycles of living beings. Each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. He wanted mankind to modify the cycles and bring about a universal confederation of free people. His mathematical laws related to the evolution of people can be summarized as below (Chapter III of Mathematics of History, 1967 edition): # All people pass through alternating periods of demographic division and periods of unification or imperialism. # The periods of great division last six centuries and a half. The periods of great unification last ten centuries and a half. Therefore, the evolutionary cycle comprises seventeen centuries. # During this evolutionary process people go through clearly defined phases, finding themselves at the end of the cycle in the same position as in the beginning. # The evolutionary cycle encompasses all types of human activity, besides considering political cycles we must also consider social, artistic, philosophical and scientific cycles. # All people follow the same evolution more or less rapidly depending on the geographic characteristics of each country. # Not all people display the same creative impulse. In each cycle there are periods of maximum creativity and these periods continue from one cycle to the next. In Europe, this passes in the Mediterranean from the East to West and then from the Iberian Peninsula to Gaul, then to the British Isles and on to the Germanic people and finally reaching the Northern and Slavic people. # The imperialist nuclei, which give rise to periods of strong political unification, follow identical organic processes, which last five to six centuries. # The transformation of sociopolitical regimes does not take place following a constant upward or downward trend, but by means of forward and backward steps, each being alternatively more intense than the others. This results in a broken line, which is an advancement in a given direction. It is what is called The Law of two steps forward and one backwards. Deulofeu's thoughts are related to the ideas of Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, who also theorised on the cyclical character of civilizations, but not in the same precise mathematical way as Deulofeu. A lifelong visitor of museums, temples and monuments in different countries, Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of Romanesque art, during the 9th century, in an area between Empord√† and Roussillon, which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization.

He also serves as a foil to Guo Jing, the protagonist. Birth and heritage Yang Kang's hometown is in Niu Family Village. His father, Yang Tiexin, was originally from Shandong but moved to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) after the Jurchen-led Jin Empire conquered the northern part of the predominantly Han Chinese Song Empire. Yang Tiexin met Bao Xiruo in the neighbouring town, Hongmei Village, and married her. Two years after their marriage, Yang Tiexin was apparently killed when soldiers raided the village. Bao Xiruo was heavily pregnant with Yang Kang then, and was rescued by Wanyan Honglie, the sixth prince of the Jin Empire. She gave birth to Yang Kang, who was raised as a Jurchen noble and adopted his foster father's family name, \\"Wanyan\\". He was initially known as \\"Wanyan Kang\\" before his real identity is revealed. Yang's given name, \\"Kang\\", is the complementary of his sworn brother's \\"Jing\\". Together, their given names form \\"Jingkang\\" (ÈùñÂ∫∑). Their fathers and Qiu Chuji named them as such to remind them of the Jingkang Incident and to be loyal to their native land, the Song Empire. Yang Kang is also a descendant of Yang Zaixing, a Song general who participated in the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars. Treachery and retribution Yang Kang discovers his true heritage when Yang Tiexin, who was supposedly killed many years ago, suddenly reappears in front of Bao Xiruo. Bao Xiruo tries to explain to her son that Yang Tiexin is his father. However, Yang Kang refuses to acknowledge Yang Tiexin as his father. To him, Wanyan Honglie is a fatherly figure who showers love and care on him and provides him with everything he wants. In fact, Wanyan Honglie is responsible for the deaths of Yang Kang's parents: Yang Tiexin and Bao Xiruo commit suicide after being cornered by Wanyan Honglie and his men. When Yang Kang finally meets his sworn brother, Guo Jing, the latter attempts to persuade him to take the Song Empire's side. Although Yang Kang initially agreed to join the Song Empire, he changes his mind later after witnessing how the Han Chinese society of the Song Empire is plagued by problems such as political corruption, internal conflict, and cowardice in the face of Jurchen aggression. Disgusted, Yang Kang succumbs to the temptation of being a Jurchen noble and denounces his ethnicity again. He collaborates with the Jurchens to exploit his own race (the Han Chinese) and pretends to have acknowledged his ethnicity. At one point, he attempts to kill Guo Jing by stabbing him with a dagger when Guo tries to persuade him to revert again. He murders Ouyang Ke so that he can take the latter's place as Ouyang Feng's apprentice. Yang Kang is also responsible for the deaths of five of the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\", and for framing Guo Jing for the murder of Ouyang Ke. Yang Kang gets his retribution in the Temple of the Iron Spear in Jiaxing. Huang Rong is about to reveal the truth behind the deaths of Ouyang Ke and the Freaks when Yang Kang attacks her with a palm strike in an attempt to silence her. However, he accidentally hits the spikes on her soft armour, which is stained with venom from a deadly breed of snakes. The poison seeps through the wounds into his body and kills him eventually. Ironically, the venom that killed Yang Kang was used by him to kill one of the Freaks. Ouyang Feng refuses to save Yang Kang when he learns that the latter was the one who murdered Ouyang Ke. Yang Kang dies a slow and painful death in the temple as the poison works its way through his body. Wanyan Honglie and his men abandon him for fear of being infected. Before dying, Yang Kang finally sees his mistakes after Wanyan Honglie left and blames him for his plight but is too late. When Guo Jing reaches the temple, he is horrified to see that Yang Kang's corpse had been devoured by crows and ravens. He buried whatever that is left of Yang Kang outside the temple. Yang Kang's teacher, Qiu Chuji, arrives later and constructs a tomb for his apprentice after Ke Zhen'e informed him about the incident. Qiu Chuji writes on the headstone: \\"Yang Kang, an unworthy apprentice. Erected by his untalented master, Qiu Chuji.\\" Love relationship with Mu Nianci Yang Kang meets his love interest, Mu Nianci, for the first time in a martial arts contest for a spouse. He defeats her but refuses to marry her after his victory. He is unaware that Mu Nianci's foster father, Mu Yi, is actually his biological father, Yang Tiexin. However, their romance is often strained as they have conflicting views over where their loyalties lie. Yang Kang wants to remain as a Jurchen noble and indulge in wealth, fame and power, while Mu Nianci remains loyal to the Song Empire. Mu Nianci is disappointed with Yang Kang when she recognises his treachery and stubborn refusal to acknowledge his ethnicity. She sees him as a traitor and decides to leave him for good. She never saw him again. However, she is already pregnant with his child. She gives birth to a boy, who is named \\"Yang Guo\\" by Guo Jing. Martial arts and skillsQuanzhen Sect= Qiu Chuji of the Quanzhen Sect finds Yang Kang and accepts him as a student upon learning that the boy is Yang Tiexin's son. He teaches Yang Kang some Quanzhen martial arts to prepare for an upcoming contest with Guo Jing, as well as some skills he created to counter the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\". Yang Kang also learnt an incomplete set of the Yang Family Spear Movement (Ê•äÂÆ∂ÊßçÊ≥ï) from Qiu Chuji, whose knowledge of the skill is based on recollections of his encounter with Yang Tiexin.cnnovels.net =Nine Yin White Bone Claw= Yang Kang learns from Mei Chaofeng the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' (‰πùÈô∞ÁôΩÈ™®Áà™), an unorthodox version of the skills in the Nine Yin Manual.

Lympstone tidal defence scheme complete, Exe-press News, Spring 2006 Near the village is the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM), the principal military training centre for the Royal Marines. The training centre has its own dedicated railway halt, Lympstone Commando (not in public use), on the Exeter‚ÄìExmouth branch line. Sport and leisure Lympstone AFC were formed in 1906, they have sides in the Devon & Exeter Football League. Lympstone has a non-league football club Royal Marines A.F.C. who play at Endurance Park CTCRM. They have since folded in April 2012. The Exeter‚ÄìExmouth cycle route passes through the village. The cycle route is popular for commuters and recreational cyclists. Prior to the opening of the cycle route the only direct route to cycle between Exmouth and Exeter was along the busy A376. The cycle route passes through the centre of the village bringing custom to the shop, cafe and pubs and adds to the vibrancy and sustainability of the village centre and its businesses. Despite this, a minority group is currently campaigning to change the route and are concerned it affects the village centre and could be made safer for users and villagers. The 1st Lympstone Sea Scouts Group celebrated its centenary in 2012. It currently has flourishing Scout and Cub sections. It meets in the Scout HQ on Cliff Field. Lympstone Manor is an historical house which now provides hotel and restaurant accommodation.  Notable people  * Ralph Lane, equerry to Queen Elizabeth I, was born in Lympstone.

They aim to reduce regional disparities in income, wealth and opportunities. Europe's poorer regions receive most of the support, but all European regions are eligible for funding under the policy's various funds and programmes. The current Regional Policy framework is set for a period of seven years, from 2014 to 2020. The Structural Funds are made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). Together with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up the great bulk of EU funding, and the majority of total EU spending. Apart from funds under the Cohesion policy, there are other funds that have the potential to contribute to the regional development. These are: * Funds under the CAP, namely the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) * The European fisheries fund (EFF) established for the programming period 2007‚Äì2013 with the Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006. The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up one of the largest items of the budget of the European Union. It is up to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to define the tasks, priority objectives and the organisation of the Structural Funds (the Regional Policy framework), through the ordinary legislative procedure and consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions (leading to the publication of Regulations). Sections below present information about objectives that have been defined for the programming period, which runs from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The overall budget for this period is ‚Ç¨347bn: ‚Ç¨201bn for the European Regional Development Fund, ‚Ç¨76bn for the European Social Fund, and ‚Ç¨70bn for the Cohesion Fund. The objectives setup shapes the main focus of interventions (eligible activities and costs) and the overall allocations of funds from the EU budget. The key indicator for the division of regions under singular objectives is the Gross National Product per capita (GNP p.c.) level. This is subject to criticism based on the fact that GDP p.c. is unable to reflect the real socio-economic reality of regions. Some groups (e.g. Beyond GDP) and organisations propose the creation of a set of alternative indicators that could substitute the GDP and its derivates.Beyond-GDP.eu Objectives for 2007‚Äì2013Convergence objective (formerly Objective 1)= This objective covers regions whose GDP per capita is below 75% of the EU average and aims at accelerating their economic development. It is financed by the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund. The priorities under this objective are human and physical capital, innovation, knowledge society, environment and administrative efficiency. The budget allocated to this objective is ‚Ç¨283.3bn in current prices. =Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective (formerly Objective 2)= This objective covers all regions of the EU territory, except those already covered by the Convergence objective. It aims at reinforcing competitiveness, employment and attractiveness of these regions. Innovation, the promotion of entrepreneurship and environment protection are the main themes of this objective. The funding ‚Äì ‚Ç¨55bn in current prices ‚Äì comes from the ERDF and the ESF. =European Territorial Cooperation objective (formerly Objective 3)= European Territorial Cooperation is an objective of the European Union‚Äôs Cohesion PolicyAlso called Regional Policy. After the European Single Act, with the strengthening of the cohesion feature, Regional Policy is also called Cohesion Policy. The different terminologies refer to the same Policy. for the period 2007‚Äì2013, serving its ultimate goal to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the Union. Regions and cities from different Member States are encouraged to work together, learning from each other and developing joint projects and networks. With the Convergence Objective and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective it aims at contributing to reduce regional disparities across Union's territory. The EUR 8.7 billion allocated to the European Territorial Cooperation objective represents 2.5% of the total budget for Cohesion Policy in 2007‚Äì2013 and is financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). It supports cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation programmes, helping Member States to participate in European Union (EU) external border cooperation programmes supported by other instruments (Instrument for Pre-Accession and European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument). History The European Territorial Cooperation Objective replaced the previous INTERREG Community Initiative (in the period 2000‚Äì2006) and thus many European Territorial Cooperation programmes bear the name INTERREG. The \\"objectives\\" were introduced with the Single European Act as a criterion to make the Structural Funds spending more effective as Regional Policy started to be rationalised in a perspective of economic and social cohesion. The Single European Act, that entered into force in 1987, institutionalised the goal of completing the internal market with a total borders opening, by 31 December 1992. Regional competition would be tighter and a Cohesion Policy was needed to mitigate the negative side effects of market unification. The \\"objectives\\" were then created to discipline the capture of funds in terms of economic and social cohesion across the Union's territory. In the first multiannual financial framework, 1988‚Äì1999, there were seven objectives, which have been progressively reduced. Even though European Territorial Cooperation Objective is the smallest of the three Cohesion Policy objectives (in terms of budget), it gained a critical importance to address the key challenges of the European Union, particularly with some redefinitions of the Treaty of Lisbon ( entered into force on 1 December 2009), and for contributing to achieve the goals of Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy. Institutional and legal framework In its title on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European UnionWith the Treaty of Lisbon, the Treaty Establishing the European Community was renamed to Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This Treaty and the Treaty of European Union establish the legal foundations of the Union's institutions and their relations with the Member States. establishes that ‚Äòthe Union shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion‚Äô. By introducing the concept of territorial cohesion, the Treaty of Lisbon recognised a strong territorial dimension for the cohesion policy. This territorial approach requires a unique and modern governance system, combining different levels of government (European, national, regional and local). Member States thus conduct their economic policies and coordinate them for the promotion of the ‚Äòeconomic, social and territorial cohesion‚Äô. European Territorial Cooperation is a component of the economic policy framework of the Union. The current Regional Policy framework, sustained by Structural Funds, is set for a period of seven years, from 2007 to 2013. For this period, the following regulations (and the changes in detail made to them by means of subsequent regulations) are especially important in defining the organisation of European Territorial Cooperation: * Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999. * Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. * Commission Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 of 8 December 2006, setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund. The European Territorial Cooperation Objective is financed by the European Regional Development Fund, whereas the remaining two objectives of the Cohesion Policy set for the 2007‚Äì2013 period are also financed by the European Social Fund (Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective), and, in the case with the Convergence Objective, also the Cohesion Fund. Organization As with the remaining two objectives, the European Territorial Cooperation Objective is delivered by means of multi-annual programmes aligned on the Union's objectives and priorities, expressed on the multi-annual financial framework. Each programme has a managing authority and a Joint Technical Secretariat, headquartered within the area it serves. They are responsible for the correct implementation of the programme, both from a financial and from an operational perspective. Within European Territorial Cooperation, there are three types of programmes: * Cross-border cooperation (53 programmes): These programmes help transform regions located on either side of internal or external borders of the European Union into strong economic and social poles. The main goals of these programmes are to face common problems and mitigate the negative effects of administrative, legal and physical barriers of borders. The cooperation process is stressed through joint management of programmes and projects that stimulate mutual trust and understanding. In particular, cross-border actions are encouraged in the fields of entrepreneurship, improving joint management of natural resources, supporting links between urban and rural areas, improving access to transport and communication networks, developing joint use of infrastructure, administrative cooperation and capacity building, employment, community interaction, culture and social affairs. * Transnational Cooperation (13 programmes): The transnational programmes promote cooperation among greater European regions, including the ones surrounding sea basins (e.g. Baltic Sea Region, North Sea, Mediterranean and Atlantic Area) or mountain ranges (e.g. Alpine Space), and facilitate coordinated strategic responses to joint challenges, such as flood management, transport and communication corridors, international business and research linkages, urban development and others. Special attention is given to outermost and island regions (e.g. Indian Ocean, Caribbean Area or Northern Periphery). * The interregional cooperation programme (INTERREG IVC) and three networking programmes (URBACT II, INTERACT II and ESPON) cover all 27 Member States of the Union (and, in some cases, also the cross-border cooperation programmes within the Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument, as well as cross-border cooperation with third countries, such as Norway and Switzerland). Together and in their specific fields, these programmes provide a framework for exchanging experience between regional and local bodies in different countries. The Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument are the two financial instruments dedicated to support territorial cooperation between European Member States border regions and their neighbours in accession countries and in other partner countries of the Union. The former currently finances 10 programmes and the latter 13 programmes. The FundsThe European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)= The ERDF supports programmes addressing regional development, economic change, enhanced competitiveness and territorial co- operation throughout the EU. Funding priorities include modernising economic structures, creating sustainable jobs and economic growth, research and innovation, environmental protection and risk prevention. Investment in infrastructure also retains an important role, especially in the least- developed regions. =The European Social Fund (ESF)= The ESF focuses on four key areas: increasing the adaptability of workers and enterprises, enhancing access to employment and participation in the labour market, reinforcing social inclusion by combating discrimination and facilitating access to the labour market for disadvantaged people, and promoting partnership for reform in the fields of employment and inclusion. =The Cohesion Fund= The Cohesion Fund contributes to interventions in the field of the environment and trans-European transport networks. It applies to member states with a Gross National Income (GNI) of less than 90% of the EU average. As such, it covers the 13 new member states as well as Greece and Portugal. A new strategic approach This section explains the interplay between different political levels ‚Äì European, national and regional ‚Äì in determining the priorities for the Structural Funds and the guidelines for implementing regional projects. In general, the overarching priorities for the Structural Funds are set at the EU level and then transformed into national priorities by the member states and regions. At the EU level the overarching priorities are established in the Community Strategic Guidelines (CSG). These set the framework for all actions that can be taken using the funds. Within this framework, each member state develops its own National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). The NSRF sets out the priorities for the respective member state, taking specific national policies into account. Finally, Operational Programmes for each region within the member state are drawn up in accordance with the respective NSRF, reflecting the needs of individual regions. * EU Level: Community Strategic Guidelines, * National Level: National Strategic Reference Framework for each member state, * Regional Level: Operational Programme for each region. =Community Strategic Guidelines= The Community Strategic Guidelines (CSG) contain the principles and priorities of the EU's cohesion policy and suggest ways the European regions can take full advantage of the funding that has been made available for national and regional aid programmes for the period 2007‚Äì2013. There are three priorities: * Improving the attractiveness of member states, regions and cities by improving accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential; * Encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy by supporting research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies; * Creating more and better jobs by attracting more people into employment entrepreneurial activity, improving adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital. =National Strategic Reference Framework= A National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) establishes the main priorities for spending the EU structural funding a member state receives between 2007 and 2013. Each member state has its own NSRF.National Strategic Reference Framework 2007‚Äì2013 Adopting an NSRF is a new requirement of the Structural Funds regulations for 2007 to 2013. Each NSRF functions as a high- level strategy for the Operational Programmes in the respective member state. The document provides an overview of the economic strengths and weaknesses of the member state's regions, and out the approach to future Structural Funds spending across the member state. =Operational Programmes= An Operational Programme (OP) sets out a region's priorities for delivering the funds. Although there is scope for regional flexibility, a region's priorities must be consistent with the member state's NSRF. There is an Operational Programme for each region in the EU. These OPs, just like the NSRF, have to be approved by the European Commission before any implementation.Michelle Cini (ed.), European Union politics, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.298 ( Funds management Although the Structural Funds are part of the EU budget, the way they are spent is based on a system of shared responsibility between the European Commission and the member state authorities: * The Commission negotiates and approves the NSRFs and OPs proposed by the member states, and uses these as a basis for allocating resources. * The member states and their regions manage the programmes. This includes implementing the OPs by selecting individual projects, controlling and assessing them. * The Commission is involved in overall programme monitoring, pays out approved expenditure and verifies the national control systems. Prior to 1989, funding decisions were taken by the European Commission. This was followed by a period where EU member states tried to maximize control, with little systematic project appraisal and a focus on a small number of large projects. Since 1994 more systematic, co-ordinated and complex methods of allocating resources start to be introduced. For example, most funds within the 2004‚Äì06 Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP), and its 2007‚Äì13 successor (ROP), are allocated through largely need-based project-selection mechanisms.Taylor, S., Bachtler, J. and Rooney, M. S. (2000), Implementing the New Generation of Programmes: Project Development, Appraisal and Selection.

(2007), Turning Strategies into Projects: The Implementation of 2007‚Äì13 Structural Funds Programmes, IQ-Net Thematic Paper No. 20(2). Magdeburg: European Policy Research Centre. Regions with low GDP receive more funds. However, within these regions, more funds go to relatively rich local areas with the best institutions. It has been argued that part of this can be explained by the frequent need to co-fund projects, and the needed capacity to prepare applications. New architecture for 2014‚Äì2020 thumbright400pxClassification of regions from 2014 to 2020: The European Commission has adopted a draft legislative package which will frame cohesion policy for 2014‚Äì2020. The new proposals are designed to reinforce the strategic dimension of the policy and to ensure that EU investment is targeted on Europe's long-term goals for growth and jobs (\\"Europe 2020\\"). Through Partnership Contracts agreed with the Commission, Member States will commit to focussing on fewer investment priorities in line with these objectives. The package also harmonises the rules related to different funds, including rural development and maritime and fisheries, to increase the coherence of EU action.http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/proposals_2014_2020_en.cfm See also * Budget of the European Union * Committee of the Regions * Council of the European Union * Economic and Social Committee * European legislative procedure * European Investment Bank * European Union * European Union Regional policy * ERDF * ESF * European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation * European Parliament * INTERREG * Treaty of Lisbon * Single European Act References ;General * EUR-Lex.eur.eu: Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * interact-eu.net: Cohesion: 2007‚Äì2013 Policy framework (retrieved on 10 May 2012). * interact-eu.net: Cohesion Policy: 2007‚Äì2013 regulatory framework (retrieved on 10 May 2012). * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission), Three Objectives (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission), European Territorial Cooperation (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission), Cross-border Cooperation Programmes (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission), Interregional Cooperation (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission), Structural Funds Regulations 2007‚Äì2013 (retrieved on 9 May 2012). * Single Market ‚Äì Communication from the European Commission (retrieved on 22 August 2012) * http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/treaties_singleact_en.htm (retrieved on 22 August 2012) External links * European Commission * Community Strategic Guidelines 2007‚Äì2013 * Operational Programmes for all European regions * Outcomes of European Territorial Cooperation (by INTERACT) * European Territorial Cooperation: building bridges between people (by the Directorate General for Regional Policy, European Commission) * Searchable database of European Territorial Cooperation programmes, projects, partners and statistics (KEEP) * Directorate General for Regional Policy (European Commission) * INTERACT * Category:Economy of the European Union ","title":"Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund"},{"id":"2014309","text":"The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), supporting the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA), is the government regulator for the electricity and downstream natural gas markets in Great Britain. It was formed by the merger of the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER) and Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas). Powers and duties The authority's powers and duties are largely provided for in statute (such as the Gas Act 1986, the Electricity Act 1989, the Utilities Act 2000, the Competition Act 1998, the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Energy Act 2004, the Energy Act 2008 and the Energy Act 2010) as well as arising from directly effective European Union legislation. Duties and functions concerning gas are set out in the Gas Act and those relating to electricity are set out in the Electricity Act. Its primary duty is to protect the interests of consumers, where possible by promoting competition. The Authority‚Äòs main objective is to protect existing and future consumers' interests in relation to gas conveyed through pipes and electricity conveyed by distribution or transmission systems. Consumers' interests are their interests taken as a whole, including their interests in the reduction of greenhouse gases and in the security of the supply of gas and electricity to them. Since 2010 the Authority has imposed nearly ¬£100 million in fines and redress levies against energy suppliers, including a ¬£12 million redress levy on E.ON in May 2014, and a ¬£1 million redress levy on British Gas in July 2014. Structure The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is governed by the Chairman Martin Cave, executive members as well as non-executive members. Jonathan Brearley was appointed Chief Executive of Ofgem from February 2020. Development of competition in the UK market Background: Ofgas and OFFER = The liberalisation and privatisation of the energy markets in the United Kingdom began with the Margaret Thatcher Government in the 1980s (often called the Thatcher-Lawson agenda, due to the key role of Nigel Lawson in the Thatcher government cabinet). Aspects of the Ofgem model have been adopted by EU legislation. The privatisation of the gas and electricity supply industries was enacted by Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989. Section 1 of the respective Acts created the roles of Director General of Gas Supply and the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), and the Director General of Electricity Supply and the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER). These were economic regulators independent of government, but accountable to Parliament. This arrangement separated their regulatory decisions from political control and which aimed to provide greater long term regulatory certainty and to encourage market entry and investment. The duties of the regulators were prescribed in Section 4 of Gas Act 1986 and Section 3 of the Electricity Act 1989. Starting in the 1990s, the supply of electricity and gas to end consumers in the UK has been unbundled from the rest of the industry. At the time of privatisation, British Gas and one regional public electricity supplier (PES) held a monopoly on supplying all domestic gas and electricity consumers respectively in Great Britain. Between 1996 and 1999, domestic energy consumers were gradually able to choose their supplier, and finally in May 1998, the domestic gas market was fully opened to competition, closely followed by the domestic electricity market in May 1999. = Role of Ofgem = Before there was competition on domestic markets, the regulators set price controls fixing maximum price that the monopoly suppliers could charge domestic customers. These price controls remained in place when markets started to get liberalised, and were then gradually removed between 2000 and 2002. Ofgem‚Äôs decision to remove price controls was based on the assessment that competition was developing well at that time and that the Competition Act 1998, being effective since March 2000, would deter companies from the abuse of market power, and provide Ofgem with sufficient power to tackle any abuse. Moreover, consumer surveys showed good awareness of the ability to switch, high and rising switching rates away from the former monopoly supplies, and substantial and continuing falls in their market shares. In 2000, the Social Action Strategy review group was established and the Competition Act came into force. In 2003 the Wholesale Gas Probe was published. Two years after the removal of the last price controls, in April 2004, Ofgem published a major review of the state of competition in the domestic energy supply markets, concluding that supply competition had delivered substantial benefits for all consumers and that the markets were competitive, though not yet mature. In 2005 there was the EU Energy Sector Enquiry, as well as the Supply Licence Review. The Energy Supply Ombudsman was then established in 2006 and in 2008 the Energy Supply Probe was published. Against the background of unprecedented increases in world fuel prices leading to record increases in wholesale and retail gas and electricity prices so that a typical household's energy bills more than doubled since early 2004 Ofgem undertook the Energy Supply Probe. The numbers of consumers in debt to their energy suppliers, average debt levels and disconnection rates were all rising. These energy price rises came at a time when household budgets were under pressure from the rising cost of food, petrol, mortgages and other essentials. Vulnerable consumers and those in fuel poverty were particularly affected. The Energy Supply Probe published the findings on the operation of the UK retail energy markets and set out a package of measures to tackle the issues raised. =CMA investigation= In June 2014 Ofgem announced a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into the trading practices and competitiveness of the country's major energy companies: Centrica, SSE plc, RWE npower, E.ON, Scottish Power and EDF Energy. The investigation, which took two years, followed a referral by Ofgem to the competition regulator. \\"There is near- unanimous support for a referral and the CMA investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air. This will help rebuild consumer trust and confidence in the energy market as well as provide the certainty investors have called for,\\" Ofgem CEO Dermot Nolan in announcing the investigation. In August 2016 Ofgem said that it would implement the CMA's recommendation that suppliers should be required to provide the details of customers who have been on expensive tariffs for three years or more to rival suppliers. Ofgem also said that it would impose an interim price cap on customers using pre-payment meters. Allegations of abuse of power relating to whistleblowers In September 2018, the Guardian published a report claiming that two Ofgem experts had been independently threatened with criminal sanctions if they publicly revealed information. Ofgem allegedly invoked section 105 of the Utilities Act 2000, designed to protect national security, relating to concerns about energy meters and renewable heat incentive projects.  Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)  Under the Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes Regulations 2015, if an energy company fails to resolve a complaint through their own customer service efforts they will be required to advise the consumer of an approved ADR body. Ofgem is the Competent Authority responsible for approving ADR entities in the energy sector. Ofgem has only ever approved one ADR entity; Ombudsman Services.

Boty's paintings and collages often demonstrated a joy in self-assured femininity and female sexuality, and expressed overt or implicit criticism of the \\"man's world\\" in which she lived. Her rebellious art, combined with her free-spirited lifestyle, has made Boty a herald of 1970s feminism. Life and worksEarly life and education= Pauline Veronica Boty was born in suburban south London in 1938 into a middle-class, Catholic family. The youngest of four children, she had three older brothers and a stern father who made her keenly aware of her position as a girl.Sue Watling, \\"Pauline Boty: Pop Painter\\" in Sue Watling and David Alan Mellor, The Only Blonde in the World: Pauline Boty (1938‚Äì1966), [exhibition catalogue] Whitford Fine Art & The Mayor Gallery Ltd.

Boty's mother, on the other hand, was supportive, having herself been a frustrated artist and denied parental permission to attend the Slade School of Fine Art.Watling, pp. 1‚Äì2. Boty earned an Intermediate diploma in lithography (1956) and a National Diploma in Design in stained glass (1958). Her schoolmates called her \\"The Wimbledon Bardot\\" on account of her resemblance to the French film star Brigitte Bardot. Encouraged by her tutor Charles Carey to explore collage techniques, Boty's painting became more experimental. Her work showed an interest in popular culture early on.Watling, pp. 2‚Äì3 In 1957 one of her pieces was shown at the Young Contemporaries exhibition alongside work by Robyn Denny, Richard Smith and Bridget Riley. She studied at the School of Stained Glass at the Royal College of Art (1958‚Äì61). She had wanted to attend the School of Painting, but was dissuaded from applying as admission rates for women were much lower in that department.Watling, p.4 Despite the institutionalised sexism at her college, Boty was one of the stronger students in her class, and in 1960 one of her stained glass works was included in the travelling exhibition Modern Stained Glass organised by the Arts Council. Boty continued to paint on her own in her student flat in west London and in 1959 she had three more works selected for the Young Contemporaries exhibition. During this time she also became friends with other emerging Pop artists, such as David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Peter Phillips and Peter Blake. While at the Royal College of Art, Boty engaged in a number of extracurricular activities. She sang, danced, and acted in risqu√© college reviews, published her poetry in an alternative student magazine, and was a knowledgeable presence at the film society where she developed her interest especially in European new wave cinema. She was also an active participant in Anti-Ugly Action, a group of RCA students involved in the stained glass, and later architecture, courses who protested against new British architecture that they considered offensive and of poor quality.Boty told the Daily Express, \\"I think the Air Ministry building is a real stinker, with the Farmers' Union HQ, the Bank of England [that's the huge curved block along New Change by Victor Heal], and the Financial Times as runners-up.\\" Boty, as quoted in Gavin Stamp, \\"Anti-ugly: campaigning against ugly buildings may seem admirable, but a recent call for demolitions is based on philistinism\\" in Apollo (Jan 2005). =Career= Boty was at her most productive two years after graduating from college . She developed a signature Pop style and iconography. Her first group show, \\"Blake, Boty, Porter, Reeve\\" was held in November 1961 at A.I.A. gallery in London and was hailed as one of the first British Pop art shows. She exhibited twenty collages, including Is it a bird, is it a plane? and a rose is a rose is a rose, which demonstrated her interest in drawing from both high and low popular culture sources in her art (the first title references the Superman comic, the second quotes the American expatriate poet Gertrude Stein).Watling, p. 5 The following spring Boty, Peter Blake, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips were featured in Ken Russell's BBC Monitor documentary film Pop Goes the Easel, which was aired on 22 March 1962. Although the documentary placed Boty at the centre of the nascent British Pop art movement, unlike her male peers she did not get an opportunity to speak directly and intelligently about her work during the film.Watling, p. 6 Boty's appearance in Pop Goes the Easel marked the beginning of her brief acting career. She landed roles in an Armchair Theatre play for ITV (\\"North City Traffic Straight Ahead\\", 1962) and an episode of the BBC series Maigret (\\"Peter the Lett\\", 1963). She also appeared on stage in Frank Hilton's comedy Day of the PrinceGetty Images/Hulton Archive . . Photograph: Chris Ware. at the Royal Court, and in Riccardo Aragno's (from the novel by Anthony Powell) Afternoon MenGetty Images/Hulton Archive .. Photograph: Jim Gray. at the New Arts Theatre. (Boty, a regular on the club scene in London, was also a dancer on Ready Steady Go!). Although acting was lucrative, it was a distraction from painting, which remained her main priority. Yet the men in her life encouraged her to pursue acting, as it was a more conventional career choice for women in the early 1960s.Watling, p. 7 The popular press picked up on her glamorous actress persona, often undermining her legitimacy as an artist by referring to her physical appearance. Scene ran a front-page article in November 1962 that included the following remarks: \\"Actresses often have tiny brains. Painters often have large beards. Imagine a brainy actress who is also a painter and also a blonde, and you have Pauline Boty.\\"Scene, No. 9, 8 November 1962. As quoted in Watling and Mellor. Her unique position as Britain's only female Pop artist gave Boty the chance to redress sexism in her life as well as her art. Her early paintings were sensual and erotic, celebrating female sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her canvases were set against vivid, colourful backgrounds and often included close-ups of red flowers, presumably symbolic of the female sex.David Alan Mellor, \\"The Only Blonde in the World\\", in Watling and Mellor, p. 21 She painted her male idols‚ÄîElvis, French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, British writer Derek Marlowe‚Äîas sex symbols, just as she did actresses Monica Vitti and Marilyn Monroe. Like Andy Warhol, she recycled publicity and press photographs of celebrities in her art. Her 1963 portrait of her friend Celia Birtwell, Celia and Her Heroes, shows the textile designer surrounded by a Peter Blake painting, a David Hockney portrait and an image of Elvis Presley. She exhibited in several more group shows before staging her first solo exhibition at Grabowski Gallery in the autumn of 1963. The show was a critical success. Boty continued to take on additional acting jobs. She was a presenter on the radio programme Public Ear in 1963‚Äì64, and in the following year she was typecast yet again in the role of 'the seductive Maria' in a BBC serial. In June 1963 she married the literary agent Clive Goodwin (1932‚Äì1978) after a ten-day romance.Watling (1998), p.16 Her marriage disappointed others such as Peter Blake and her married lover, the television director Philip Saville, whom she had met towards the end of her student days and had worked for. (Their affair is said to have obtained the material for a screenplay by Frederic Raphael; the movie Darling (1965).)Boty auditioned for the role that went to Julie Christie. See Bill Smith, \\"The Only Blonde in the World\\", Latest Art, February 2006, p. 1 Boty and Goodwin's Cromwell Road flat became a central hang-out for many artists, musicians, and writers, including Bob Dylan (whom Boty brought to EnglandBoty and Philip Saville brought Dylan to England, collecting him from London Airport. Dylan stayed in Boty's flat. See Smith, p. 10.), David Hockney, Peter Blake, Michael White, Kenneth Tynan, Troy Kennedy Martin, John McGrath, Dennis Potter and Roger McGough.Smith, p. 14 Goodwin, to be later a member of the founding editorial team of radical journal Black Dwarf, is said to have encouraged Boty to include political content in her paintings. Her paintings did become more overtly critical over time. Countdown to Violence depicts a number of harrowing current events, including the Birmingham riot of 1963, the Assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Vietnam War. Cuba Si (1963) references the Cuban revolution. The collage painting It's a Man's World I (1964) juxtaposes images of patriarchal icons The Beatles, Albert Einstein, Lenin, Muhammad Ali, Marcel Proust and other men. In It's a Man's World II (1965‚Äì66) she redisplayed female nudes from fine art and soft- core pornographic sources to signify newly liberated \\"female eroticism\\". Her last known painting, BUM, was commissioned by Kenneth Tynan for Oh, Calcutta! and was completed in 1966.Watling, p. 18. See also Smith, p. 14. =Death= In June 1965 Boty became pregnant. During a prenatal exam, a tumour was discovered and she was diagnosed with cancer (malignant Thymoma). She refused to have an abortion and also refused to receive chemotherapy treatment that might have harmed the foetus.Watling, p.17 Instead she smoked marijuana to ease the pain of her terminal condition. She continued to entertain her friends and even sketched The Rolling Stones during her illness. Her daughter, Katy (later Boty) Goodwin, was born on 12 February 1966. Pauline Boty died at the Royal Marsden Hospital on 1 July that year. She was 28 years old. Her daughter, Boty Goodwin, died of an overdose on 12 November 1995 aged 29. Legacy After her death Pauline Boty's paintings were stored away in a barn on her brother's farm and she was largely forgotten for nearly 30 years. Her work was rediscovered in the 1990s, renewing interest in her contribution to Pop art, and gaining her inclusion in several group exhibitions and a major solo retrospective. The current location of several of her most sought after paintings is unknown. In December 2013, Adrian Hamilton wrote in The Independent on Sunday, \\"Ignored for decades after her death ‚Äì it was nearly 30 years before her first picture was shown ‚Äì a proper retrospective has had to wait until this year with a show which originated in Wolverhampton and has now opened in the Pallant Gallery in Chichester. Looking at her pictures today, it is simply incredible that it has taken so long. [...] It's not a big exhibition. Given the paucity of her surviving work it could not be otherwise. But it is one which leaves you eager for more, more of the pictures she did paint and the ones she didn't live long enough for.\\" Boty's life and work also form a major theme in Ali Smith's 2016 novel, Autumn. In November 2019, the New York Times featured Boty in their Overlooked (obituary feature), Pauline Boty, Rebellious Pop Artist. Exhibitions A major retrospective exhibition of her work opened at Wolverhampton Art Gallery on 1 June 2013, and subsequently toured to Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex from 30 November 2013 ‚Äì 9 February 2014. * (cooperation with Wolverhampton Art Gallery)         * Filmography Film * TV     * ReferencesBibliography * Sue Tate Pauline Boty: Pop Artist and Woman (life and works) Wolverhampton Art Gallery with the Paul Mellon Foundation, 2013 Adam Smith, Now You See Her: Pauline Boty, First Lady of British Pop, 2002  * Sid Sachs and Kalliopi Minioudaki, eds.

Development On March 12, 1999 Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). A problem arose with modifying the weapons of the Polish Army to use the standard NATO ammunition. A decision was made to develop a new general-purpose machine gun. The construction was based on the design of the successful PKM machine gun that was previously produced under licence in Poland. To use the common NATO ammunition, the feeding method of the machine gun had to be fundamentally modified. The metallic disintegrating link specifically designed for ammunition belt-fed firearms and rimless 7.62√ó51mm NATO rounds used by NATO is a push-through design. The UKM machine gun extracts 7.62√ó51mm NATO rounds from open-M13 links by pushing them forward out of the link directly into the chamber for firing. The non-disintegrating closed-link metallic belt type used in the PKM machine gun is a pull-out design, which extracts the rimmed 7.62√ó54mmR rounds by pulling them rearward out of the link. In the second stage the rimmed rounds are pushed forward into the chamber for firing. The 7.62√ó54mmR machine gun feed pawl mechanism is radically different than that of 7.62√ó51mm NATO chambered machine guns based on the MG 42 machine gun feeding method, using a small, simple pivoting arm pushed out to the right side by the bolt carrier, rather than a much larger (and therefore much heavier) articulated feed cam, lever, and pawl assembly. The UKM-2000 (Uniwersalny Karabin Maszynowy, \\"Universal Machinegun\\") is a primary general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) on most vehicles used by Polish Forces in Afghanistan (Cougar H, MaxxPro Dash, M-ATV, Humvee) and is a coaxial machine gun in KTO Rosomak and Polish-modernized BRDM-2. There is a proposal of modernization of the Polish UKM-2000 GPMG fed by 7.62√ó51mm NATO to the new UKM-2013 standard. The upgraded GPMG will be equipped with a new folding and telescopic buttstock with a cheekpiece and additional grip/pod, the integrated Picatinny rail with iron sight and 3-rail forehand attached to the gas tube, new grip, new cocking handle new safety switch selector, a new 440-mm barrel (as an option) plus some additional internal changes. The Polish Army is interested in this machine gun fed from the 100-round soft ammo bag instead of a steel box. Because of external similarity to the Russian PKM GPMG chambered to the 7.62√ó54mmR some elements like a buttstock, a grip or a forehand with rails will able to be used with the Kalashnikov design. Variants *UKM-2000C(L) - coaxial version of UKM-2000, successor of the PKT. Use on KTO Rosomak and some Polish modernized BRDM-2. Modifications include the removal of the stock, a longer and heavier barrel, a gas regulator and an electric solenoid trigger. *UKM-2000D - airborne version with folding stock, limited use in Polish Armed Forces *UKM-2000P - standard GPMG version, some also equipped with MIL- STD-1913 rail. *UKM-2000Z - first attempt to modernization of UKM-2000, new telescoping stock and black polymer pistol grip.

Although the related \\"linear\\" dicarboxylic acids adipic and succinic acids are water- soluble only to a few percent at room temperature, the water-solubility of glutaric acid is over 50% (w/w). Biochemistry Glutaric acid is naturally produced in the body during the metabolism of some amino acids, including lysine and tryptophan. Defects in this metabolic pathway can lead to a disorder called glutaric aciduria, where toxic byproducts build up and can cause severe encephalopathy. Production Glutaric acid can be prepared by the ring-opening of butyrolactone with potassium cyanide to give the mixed potassium carboxylate-nitrile that is hydrolyzed to the diacid. Alternatively hydrolysis, followed by oxidation of dihydropyran gives glutaric acid. It can also be prepared from reacting 1,3-dibromopropane with sodium or potassium cyanide to obtain the dinitrile, followed by hydrolysis.

Education Batty was educated at Bingley Grammar School, a Voluntary Aided state school in Bingley, West Yorkshire. Domestic career Batty began his county career with his native Yorkshire, after playing for England Under 19's, making his County Championship debut in 1997. Due to lack of opportunities he transferred to Surrey in 1998 where he played mainly one-day games. =Worcestershire= He joined Worcestershire in 2002 where he became the main spinner and came to prominence with the national team.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/worcestershire/8218535.stm =Return to Surrey= After eight years at Worcestershire during which he won England recognition, Batty signed a contract to return to Surrey for the 2010 season.https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22774857/gareth-batty-returns- surrey Batty was involved in an unsavoury incident while deputising as captain for Surrey in a Championship match against Somerset at Taunton in 2012.

Batty was made permanent captain of Surrey in 2015 and later that year took a hat trick to send Surrey back into Division One of the County Championship after two years in Division Two. An even better year with the ball in Division One in 2016, combined with poor form for Moeen Ali, led to calls for his recall to the England test team after its draw against Pakistan. Nonetheless, when Batty was recalled later that year for the tour of Bangladesh, he described his call-up as \\"surreal\\".

However, in the following year, Manoparkorn was ousted by a coup in 1933 due to the conflicts between members of People's Party. Early life Phraya Manopakorn Nititada Kon Hutasingha was born on 15 July 1884 in Bangkok to Huad and Kaew Hutasingha (Thai: ‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Æ‡∏ß‡∏î ‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß ‡∏´‡∏∏‡∏ï‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå), both of whom were of Chinese extraction.Preston et al.

His wife, who was a favourite lady-in-waiting to the ex-Queen, was killed in a motor accident in 1929 when on an official visit to Indo-China. He received his primary education at Suankularb Wittayalai School in Bangkok. He pursued his law education at Assumption College and at the Law School of the Ministry of Justice. He then continued his studies abroad. It is claimed that he was a member at the Middle Temple, in London, England, but no evidence of his membership can be found in the Inn's admission registersSturgess, H.A.C. (1949). Register of Admissions to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, Vol. 2. . After he had finished his education, he began to work for the Ministry of Justice and climbed the traditional career ladder and was eventually granted the title Phraya and received his honorary name: \\"Manopakorn Nititada\\". In 1918, he gained a seat in the Privy Council of King Vajiravudh (or Rama VI). Revolution and premiership 1932 revolutionleft Following the Revolution of 1932, King Prajadhipok (or Rama VII) consented to a Provisional Constitution on 27 June 1932. The first People's Assembly of Siam, composed entirely of appointed members, met for the first time on 28 June. The revolutionary Khana Ratsadon Party, not wanting to appear as if it had instigated the revolution for self-aggrandizement, chose Phraya Manopakorn as President of the Committee. He was considered a largely neutral and clean figure, but at the same time respected enough to take the position. As a result, the Assembly with the advice of Pridi Panomyong, one of the leaders of the Khana Ratsadon offered Manopakorn the post of \\"President of the People's Committee\\", an early version of the post of Prime Minister. The first mission of Phraya Manopakorn's Cabinet was to draft a permanent constitution. King Prajadhipok made an observation that the term \\"President of the People's Committee\\" sounded like a communist or republican post. After a debate, the office was eventually changed to \\"prime minister\\". The first constitution of Siam was promulgated under Phraya Manopakorn's watch on 10 December 1932, now celebrated as the Thai Constitution Day. Soon after, Phraya Manopakorn became the head of the first constitutional government of Siam. The Manopakorn cabinet, or People's Committee, composed of members, half from the People's Party and half from senior civil servants and military officers, was appointed under the guidance of the party. Phraya Manopakorn in essence became the Khana Ratsadon's puppet, and the country a single-party state. Yellow Cover Dossier incident and Coup In 1933, Pridi Panomyong, by then a Minister of State, presented his Draft Economic Plan or Yellow Cover Dossier to King Prajadhipok. The dossier was an economic plan, which advocated socialist solutions to the country's many financial and economic problems. Prajadhipok even branded the dossier \\"communist\\" and attacked Pridi publicly about it. When Pridi's dossier was rejected, his status fell and caused a major disruption among the members of People's Party and the People's Committee itself. Phraya Mano rallied those who opposed the socialist plan of Pridi including Phraya Songsuradet and dissolved his own cabinet to oust Pridi, who had great support within the People's Party. To regain some stability and silence domestic critics, Phraya Manopakorn had some articles in the constitution suspended. Manopakorn barred the People's Assembly from any further meetings and the judiciary was shut down. Pridi was forced to flee to France. It was said that Manopakorn \\"led the coup with his pen\\", this event is known in Thailand as the \\"April 1933 Coup\\" (or the \\"Silent Coup\\") (Thai: ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ô ‡∏û.‡∏®. 2476). Phraya Manopakorn then approved the Anti-Communist Act, which empowered him to arrest those suspected of having communist sentiments: the entire Central Committee of the Communist Party of Siam was arrested and imprisoned. After the Yellow Dossier Incident, the degree of political freedom was greatly reduced by Phraya Manopakorn's policies. He censored many leftist activities including shutting down newspapers and publications. However the People's Party, which gave him the premiership, would eventually be his downfall. On 16 June, Phraya Pahol Polpayuhasena, the country's most powerful military leader and member of the People's Party, together with three other senior officers retired from the People's Committee, for \\"health reasons\\". Death and legacy Phraya Manopakorn Nititada's memorial in Wat Pathum Wanaram, Bangkok, Thailand The 1933 Siamese coup d'√©tat happened on 20 June, led by Phraya Pahol and other military leaders. Phraya Manopakorn was immediately removed as prime minister. Phraya Phahol appointed himself the country's second prime minister and took over the government. King Pradhipok duly accepted his appointment. Manopakorn was then exiled to Penang, British Malaya, and lived there until his death in 1948, aged 64. Phraya Manopakorn was Siam's first prime minister and the first to be ousted by a coup. He would not be the last civilian prime minister to be ousted by a military coup. His legacy is mixed: on the one hand he took over the reins of government at a difficult time (Wall Street Crash of 1929), but on the other he exceeded his powers and was not able to counter the powers of the Khana Ratsadon which became increasingly dictatorial.

He was also the leader of the Bougainville People's Congress.\\"Bougainville president Kabui dies\\", theage.com.au, 7 June 2008. Kabui was a commander in the Bougainville Revolutionary Army during the war in Bougainville in the 1990s. In June 2005, after the island gained autonomy within Papua New Guinea, he was elected as President of Bougainville by a large majority, winning 38,000 out of 69,385 votes. While in office, he granted a Canadian company, Invincible Resources, access rights to 70% of Bougainville's mineral resources, and he was widely criticized for this decision. This was announced in 2008 with no prior discussion in Parliament, and shortly before Kabui's death it was expected that a motion of no-confidence would be presented against him. In an interview shortly before his death, he said that his dream was \\"to see Bougainville [become] a Kuwait of the Pacific\\".\\"Bougainville Parliament at odds over resources deal\\", ABC News (Australia), 17 June 2008. Kabui went to Brisbane for medical treatment prior to his sudden death on 7 June 2008 at a hospital in Buka.

The Bougainville government declared a public holiday to mourn Kabui.\\"Bougainville mourns president Kabui\\", smh.com.au, 12 June 2008. Kabui was believed to have died of a heart attack. In an interview with the Port-Courier, a newspaper in Papua New Guinea, that he gave 12 hours before his death, Kabui said that he had stopped taking his heart medicine four months beforehand and was taking a water tonic instead because the medicine was too expensive. He dismissed suggestions of seeking help, saying that \\"I am not a man that would ask for things that concern me\\", and he also said that he had missed a medical check-up because he was too busy with work. His next check-up was scheduled for later in June, but he noted that the necessary trip to Australia was expensive as well. Vice-President John Tabinaman became Acting President following Kabui's death. The existing method for filling a vacancy in the presidency is to hold a new popular election, and Tabinaman described this as likely, while also noting the possibility of a constitutional amendment that would instead allow Parliament to elect one of its members as president.

James Glynn entered the United States Navy on March 4, 1815. He became a lieutenant in 1825, a commander in 1841, and served on the California coast during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was put in command of the sloop-of-war USS Preble (16 guns) and sent to China. Captain James Glynn's sloop-of-war USS Preble. In Canton, he learned from the Dutch consul about the imprisonment at Nagasaki of 15 American sailors from the whaleship Lagoda, who had been shipwrecked on the northern Japanese island of Yeso on June 7, 1848. Although the coast of Japan was poorly known, and the American Commander James Biddle, with the ships USS Columbus and USS Vincennes had been recently repelled by the Japanese in the bay of Edo (Tokyo), Glynn was ordered by David Geisinger to leave for Nagasaki, where he arrived on April 17, 1849. The sailing orders to Captain Glynn recommended both caution and firmness in his enterprise: James Glynn's USS Preble logbook describing his call to Nagasaki. The Japanese tried to block the entrance to Glynn's ship, but he forced his way through a row of boats and anchored in the middle of the bay of Nagasaki. Despite Japanese menaces, he insistently demanded the release of the prisoners, and threatened an intervention of the United States. With some help from the Dutch in the negotiations, the prisoners were finally delivered to him on April 26. The sailors had suffered throughout their internment, and after several attempts to escape were put in cages where several died of exposure. Another had hanged himself, and was left hanging in his cage for two days. Ranald MacDonald was also among the party of the rescued, although he had traveled to Japan of his own will and taught English to several Japanese during his internment in Nagasaki, becoming the first American to teach English in Japan. The Preble returned to Hong Kong and the prisoners finally returned to the United States on December 31, 1849, where the story of their harsh internment made a sensation. Following his voyage, Glynn made a proposition to the United States government to open relations with Japan through diplomacy, and, if necessary, by a show of strength. His recommendation paved the way for the expedition of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 and 1854. Glynn was made a captain in 1855.

The company briefly gained accreditation as a for-profit private university in 2001, albeit under dubious circumstances. The accreditation was rescinded in 2006 as a result of compliance issues and persistent diploma mill allegations. Imadec was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by debtors in 2010 but was permitted to restructure under court supervision. The company continues to operate and is currently offering negotiation and management seminars.  History  Imadec was founded in 1991 as the International Management Development Consulting GmbH. Founder and director was Christian Joksch, an Austrian insurance manager and sometime lecturer. From 1991 to 1996, the company operated as a consulting business. = California State partnership = In 1996, Imadec secured a partnership with the California State University, Hayward (CSUH). Acting as an overseas business program subsidiary of the university and supervised by university personnel on location in Vienna, Imadec reinvented itself as a for-profit business school and began offering an Executive MBA program. The program received accreditation from the FIBAA. Also starting in 1996 the International Gary S. Becker Prize, a prize for schlolarly excellence donated and granted by Gary Becker together with a committee of international economists and business executives, was awarded by Imadec. The partnership collapsed in August 2002. According to Jay Tontz, Dean of the CSUH Department of Business and Economics, the university decided to end the relationship because the venture had failed to turn any profit, even though the university's five other overseas MBA programs were making healthy amounts of money. The contract stipulated profit sharing as opposed to the more conventional revenue sharing; Imadec claimed it was barely breaking even but refused to either cut costs or agree to a revenue sharing arrangement. An additional problem, according to CSUH faculty, was \\"Imadec's failure to make timely payments\\" regarding salaries and expenses the company owed. According to Joksch, Imadec was canceling the contract because Kurt Leube, the partnership's academic director, had been misrepresenting his academic credentials. Leube, Joksch alleged, had been fraudulently claiming to hold a PhD in Economics that he did not in fact possess. Former Imadec faculty described Joksch's accusations as \\"ridiculous\\". Joksch had been well aware of Leube's lack of a doctorate; he had hired Leube on the strength of Leube's enthusiastic adherence to the Austrian School and his apprenticeship under Friedrich Hayek. = Private university = Schloss Laudon main entrance In May 1999, Joksch ran for the European Parliament on a Freedom Party ticket. Although he did not win a seat, the political connections he established paid off when the Freedom Party gained government responsibility and cabinet positions following the October 1999 Austrian legislative election. As a part of its general program of deregulation and liberalization, the new cabinet paved the way for the establishment of private universities in Austria. Joksch had been lobbying for legislation allowing private universities for years and appears to have played a major role in convincing the cabinet to sponsor the relevant statute. In fact, one of his employees was involved in drafting the statute. When the Accreditation Council established by the new act proved hesitant to accredit Imadec, Joksch's political allies were able and willing to bring considerable pressure to bear. Imadec was accredited effective January 2001. The new university mocked its older siblings for what it saw as their antiquated teaching methods and their fatuous insistence on maintaining research libraries. Imadec enthusiastically embraced, however, the traditional material trappings of academia. The school took up residence in the ersatz Ivy League ambience of Schloss Laudon, a baroque water castle in the outskirts of Vienna. Web sites, brochures, and commercials featured Christian Joksch and others wearing richly adorned academic robes and flamboyant medallion chains, a conspicuous departure from the comparatively sober comportment of most of Austria's other institutions of higher learning. Almost immediately, Imadec also began to refer to itself as an \\"elite\\" institution. With the heightened profile came heightened scrutiny, which Imadec did not weather well. Very soon, the institution was dogged by accusations of low standards and academic irregularities going back years. A number of politicians, political operatives, and socialites were managing to earn degrees without spending any significant amount of time in either classrooms or libraries. Notable cases include: * Theresia Zierler, Freedom Party general secretary * Ralph Vallon, Freedom Party communications director * Gerald Mikscha, long-time personal assistant to J√∂rg Haider * Sylvia Paph√°zy, Freedom Party MP and alleged life partner of Joksch at the time * Werner Amon, MP for the Austrian People's Party, the Freedom Party's coalition partner at the time. Amon was awarded an MBA even though he had never completed his secondary education and was therefore technically ineligible to enroll. Amon was not just a sitting member of parliament during his time as an Imadec MBA student, he also served on the parliamentary Science Advisory Committee and held the additional side job of being Imadec's director of resource development. * Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, friend of Haider's and fixture of the local party scene. The son of the Libyan dictator managed to earn an Imadec MBA in just twenty months, in spite of his busy social calendar and in spite of being fully fluent in neither English nor German. There is evidence that lecturers were falsifying at least some of his written exams on his behalf. * Karl von Habsburg, son of Otto von Habsburg, Honorary President of Imadec at the time. Karl was known for his affable disposition but not for his scholarly accomplishment. His decade-and-counting attempts to graduate from some law school, any law school, had gained a certain notoriety in Austria. Once at Imadec, Karl earned three separate master's degrees in the space of just five years, despite his increasingly demanding social obligations as the acting head, and later head, of the House of Habsburg. Karl's MBA, MLE, and LL.M. featured proudly in Imadec PR publications. Imadec became a subject of concern for the Science Advisory Committee. The general impression in the committee, two members went on record stating, was that Imadec was essentially simply selling its degrees and only barely bothered to pretend otherwise. When Imadec's accreditation came up for review in 2005, the national Accreditation Council refused renewal, citing numerous issues in unusually forceful language. The accreditation expired in early 2006. The school petitioned for a renewal of its accreditation in August 2006 but was rejected again. The council once more cited issues with quality assurance, academic staff structure, and financial backing. = Pretend private university = Schloss Laudon as it appeared in Imadec sales brochures and PR material At the same time, Imadec received permission to advertise its educational programs as \\"university-level curricula\\" (German: \\"Lehrg√§nge universit√§ren Characters\\") and to award symbolic degrees to students successfully completing them. The permission appears to be have been a personal favor to Joksch from Elisabeth Gehrer, the outgoing minister of education at the time. Under the unique and somewhat experimental statutory framework of the time, Imadec could legally claim that its degrees were \\"academic\\" degrees. In fact, Imadec could legally advertise its degrees as \\"master's\\" degrees even though they were distinct from actual master's degrees in several respects. Imadec made full use of the legal loopholes at its disposal and continued to award \\"master's\\" degrees for another five years. Imadec even tried to continue using the word \\"university\\" as part of its registered company name. Petitioned by the Accreditation Council, the Vienna Commercial Court ordered the company name struck from the rolls in 2007. Ignoring the order, Joksch continued to refer to his company as a \\"university\\" for several more years, apparently with impunity. Austria's actual universities quickly discovered that the deluge of substandard \\"master's\\" degrees pouring out of institutions such as Imadec threatened the country's credibility in the market. By 2007, consumer protection agencies were declaring themselves concerned. By 2011, there were 75 separate \\"university- level\\" training providers in Austria, and universities were heavily lobbying the legislature to quell the flood. It had become obvious that Austria's private tertiary education sector had acquired a questionable reputation. Encumbered by the sectors's poor prestige, private universities and \\"university-level\\" training providers were experiencing financial difficulties. Imadec was repeatedly cited as one of the reasons. Parliament ended the experiment, effective 2012. = Illegal conferment of honorary degrees = An important part of Imadec's marketing efforts was its generosity in awarding honorary degrees and other distinctions to politicians, prominent bankers, and celebrities. Notable known recipients include: * Siegbert Alber, Honorary LL.D. * Peter Blaker, Baron Blaker, Honorary Citizen * Wim Duisenberg, Honorary DBA * Franz Fischler, Honorary Citizen * Ernst Fuchs, Honorary Citizen * Otto von Habsburg, Honorary President * Hans Hass, Honorary Citizen * Claus Hipp, Honorary Senator * Alexandre Lamfalussy, Honorary DBA * Helmut List, Honorary Senator * Heinrich Neisser, Honorary Citizen * Maria Schaumayer, Honorary Citizen * Arnold Schwarzenegger, Honorary DBA * Gerhard Swarovski, Honorary Senator * Max Turnauer, Hononary Senator * Josefina V√°zquez Mota, Honorary Citizen * Franz Vranitzky, Honorary DBA * Andrew Young, Honorary Citizen All of these honors were void and their conferments illegal. Institutions that could not award regular doctorates could not award honorary doctorates either, and private universities could not award any honors at all. In 2005, Joksch was charged before the Administrative Court, convicted, and fined. Imadec honorary distinctions, the verdict confirmed, were worthless. Joksch ignored the verdict and continued to hand out honorary degrees, most notably to Vicente Fox. The former president of Mexico holds an honorary doctorate of law from Imadec, awarded in 2011. = Bankruptcy petition = On June 18, 2010, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against Imadec by one of its creditors before the Vienna Commercial Court. On August 26, 2010, the court accepted a restructuring plan that required Imadec to fully satisfy all creditors within two years' time.  Current activity  Imadec's neighborhood in 2018 , Imadec is offering seminars in \\"advanced negotiations\\" and \\"C-suite management\\". In its sales brochures, Imadec still describes itself as an \\"academic institution\\" and refers to its instructors as \\"university professors\\" in a way that suggests, although does not claim outright, that the title is due to their being employed by Imadec. Imadec's two current instructors are in fact teachers at legitimate universities; their classes at Imadec are side jobs. Imadec \\"diplomas\\", described as \\"internationally recognized\\" in Imadec brochures, can be obtained for EUR 12,800 plus ten to sixteen days' worth of attendance. Now operating out of a mid-market office building in the working class district of Margareten, the company continues to refer to its owners as \\"President and Fellows\\" and to its staff as \\"faculty\\", and continues to emphasize extravagant academic vestments in its marking materials.

The 'III' luminosity class indicates the presence of a giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is in a late evolutionary stage. The primary component of the pair, Œ∫ Sco A, is a variable star of Beta Cephei type. It is undergoing radial pulsations with a dominant frequency of 4.99922 cycles per day, or 4.8 hours per cycle. There are overlapping secondary pulsation frequencies of about 4.85 and 5.69 cycles per day. This star has about 17 times the mass of the Sun and is nearly 7 times the Sun's radius. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 23,400 K, giving it a blue- white hue. It is rotating rapidly, with an estimated period of only 1.9 days and an axis of rotation that is inclined by about 40¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. The secondary component, Œ∫ Sco B, is smaller than the primary, but still much larger than the Sun. It has about 12 times the mass of the Sun and nearly six times the Sun's radius. The effective temperature of 18,800 K is also higher than the Sun's, which is at 5,778 K. Traditional name Œ∫ Scorpii has been called Girtab , which is the Sumerian word for 'scorpion'. The name has survived through the Babylonian star catalogues, and was originally applied to an asterism comprising this star, Lambda Scorpii, Upsilon Scorpii, and Iota Scorpii. In Chinese, (), meaning Tail, refers to an asterism consisting Œ∫ Scorpii, Œº1 Scorpii, Œµ Scorpii, Œ∂1 Scorpii and Œ∂2 Scorpii, Œ∑ Scorpii, Œ∏ Scorpii, Œπ1 Scorpii and Œπ2 Scorpii, Œª Scorpii and œÖ Scorpii. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of new cars by a given manufacturer might be between 2 weeks and 6 months, depending on various particularities. One business dictionary defines \\"manufacturing lead time\\" as the total time required to manufacture an item, including order preparation time, queue time, setup time, run time, move time, inspection time, and put-away time. For make-to-order products, it is the time between release of an order and the production and shipment that fulfill that order. For make-to-stock products, it is the time taken from the release of an order to production and receipt into finished goods inventory.BusinessDictionary, Manufacturing Lead time, accessed 16 August 2019 Supply chain management A conventional definition of lead time in a supply chain management context is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of finished goods or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply identifies \\"total lead time\\" as a combination of \\"internal lead time\\" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a purchase order) and \\"external lead time\\" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any development required, manufacture, dispatch and delivery).CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, Procurement and Supply Operations, 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65 Manufacturing In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier. Shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for material requirements planning purposes. It is also possible to include within lead time the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received. The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage (\\"put-away time\\") is not trivial.Sunol, H., Warehouse Operations: Optimizing the Put-Away Process, Cyzerg Warehouse Technology, published 16 November 2018, accessed 16 August 2019 With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using Just In Time manufacturing, it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take. Lead time consists of:Lead Times. \\"Lead times in supply chain\\" Supply Chain Consultant Website. * Preprocessing Lead Time (also known as \\"planning time\\" or \\"paperwork\\"): the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item), from the time you learn of the requirement. * Processing Lead Time: the time required to procure or manufacture an item. * Postprocessing Lead Time: the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.) Example Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order. It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing. *If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part. *If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included. *If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included. In more detail Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.Rajaniemi, J. (2012) www.leadtimes.org Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing. The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times. * Order Lead Time - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered. * Order Handling Time - Time from customer order received to sales order created. * Manufacturing Lead Time - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery). * Production Lead Time - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery). * Delivery Lead Time - Time from production finished to customer order delivered. Example A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted ‚Äì Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time. Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time, the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot. When he picks it up, he begins timing the Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected. Order lead time When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate between the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar, there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : *The Actual Order Lead Time (OLTActual)Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121. The order lead-time, refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the delivery of the goods.\\"Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., & Tirtiroglu, E., 2001 \\"Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment.\\" International Journal of Operations & Production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87. *The Requested Order Lead Time (OLTRequested) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer requested delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., and Sweeney, M. 2009. \\"A process for managing manufacturing flexibility\\", International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.Silva, L., 2013, \\"Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements\\" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland. *The Quote Order Lead Time (OLTQuote) is the agreed time between the Order Entry Date and the supplier's committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract. *The Confirmed Order Lead Time (OLTConfirmed) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier confirmed delivery date of goods. OLT Definitions = OLT formulas = *OLTRequested = Wish Date ‚Äì Order Entry Date The OLTRequested will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. *OLTQuote = Quote Date ‚Äì Order Entry Date The OLTQuote will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier. *OLTActual = Delivery Date ‚Äì Order Entry Date The OLTActual will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. *OLTConfirmed = Confirmed Date ‚Äì Order Entry Date The OLTConfirmed will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier. =Average OLT based on volume= The Average OLT based on Volume (OLTV) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility. OLTV= \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \\\\cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \\\\, By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time. =Potential application areas for order lead time measurement= The correct analysis of OLT will give the company: *Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management). *Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema). *The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them. Project management In project management lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire project would be the overall duration of the critical path for the project. Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed. According to the PMBOK (4th edition) by PMI, lead is a dependency between two activities.PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). The Project Management Institute. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications. p.140 An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time. Journalism Lead time in publishing describes the amount of time that a journalist has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece. Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years. Medicine Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

However, this article is mainly concerned with the meaning of \\"an office\\" (the modern word office derives from it) or \\"bureau\\" in the sense of a dignitary's staff of administrative and other collaborators, each of whom was called an officialis (hence the modern official). The Notitia Dignitatum gives us uniquely detailed information, stemming from the very imperial chanceries, on the composition of the officia of many of the leading court, provincial, military and certain other officials of the two Roman empires c.

While the details vary somewhat according to rank, from West (Rome) to East (Byzantium) and/or in particular cases, in general the leading staff would be about as follows (the English descriptions and other modern \\"equivalents\\" are approximate): *Princeps officii was the chief of staff, permanent secretary or chef de cabinet *Cornicularius was a military title, for an administrative deputy of various generals etc. *Adiutor (literally \\"helper\\") seems to have been the chief (general) assistant, or adjutant *Commentariensis was the keeper of \\"commentaries\\", an official diary *Ab actis was the keeper of records, the archivist *Numerarius (\\"accountant\\") seems to have been the receiver of taxes *Subadiuva (\\"under-helper\\") seems to have been a general assistant *Cura epistolarum was the curator of correspondence *Regerendarius may have been a registrar *Exceptor seem to have been a secretary *Singularius has been called a notary, but the word can also refer to a bodyguard Below those \\"dignities\\", there were often a few hundred minor officials, often slaves or freedmen, doing the clerical drudgery, not deemed worthy of any more detailed mention.

R., 1988 An introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology, Kluwert Academic Publishers 666 pp. The atmospheric region most susceptible to CAT is the high troposphere at altitudes of around as it meets the tropopause. Here CAT is most frequently encountered in the regions of jet streams. At lower altitudes it may also occur near mountain ranges. Thin cirrus clouds can also indicate high probability of CAT. CAT can be hazardous to the comfort, and occasionally the safety, of air travelers. CAT in the jet stream is expected to become stronger and more frequent because of climate change,Williams, P. D. and Joshi, M. M. (2013). \\"Intensification of winter transatlantic aviation turbulence in response to climate change\\", Nature Climate Change, 3(7), pp. 644‚Äì648. . with transatlantic wintertime CAT increasing by 59% (light), 94% (moderate), and 149% (severe) by the time of CO2 doubling.Williams, P. D. (2017). \\"Increased light, moderate, and severe clear-air turbulence in response to climate change\\". Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 34(5), pp. 576‚Äì586. .  Detection  Clear-air turbulence is usually impossible to detect with the naked eye and very difficult to detect with a conventional radar,John J. Hicks, Isadore Katz, Claude R. Landry, and Kenneth R. Hardy, \\"Clear-Air Turbulence: Simultaneous Observations by Radar and Aircraft\\" Science Science 18 August 1967:Vol. 157. no. 3790, pp. 808-809 with the result that it is difficult for aircraft pilots to detect and avoid it. However, it can be remotely detected with instruments that can measure turbulence with optical techniques, such as scintillometers, Doppler LIDARs, or N-slit interferometers.F. J. Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. B. Clark, and W. E. Davenport, The N-slit interferometer: an extended configuration, J. Opt. 12, 015705 (2010). Although the altitudes near the tropopause are usually cloudless, thin cirrus cloud can form where there are abrupt changes of air velocity, for example associated with jet streams. Lines of cirrus perpendicular to the jet stream indicate possible CAT, especially if the ends of the cirrus are dispersed, in which case the direction of dispersal can indicate if the CAT is stronger at the left or at the right of the jet stream.  Factors that increase CAT probability  Detecting and predicting CAT is difficult. At typical heights where it occurs, the intensity and location cannot be determined precisely. However, because this turbulence affects long range aircraft that fly near the tropopause, CAT has been intensely studied. Several factors affect the likelihood of CAT. Often more than one factor is present. 64% of the non-light turbulences (not only CAT) are observed less than away from the core of a jet stream.Binding, A. A. \\"Association of clear-air turbulence with 300 mb contour patterns\\". The Meteorological Magazine 94 (1965): 11‚Äì19. = Jet stream = A jet stream alone will rarely be the cause of CAT, although there is horizontal wind shear at its edges and within it, caused by the different relative air speeds of the stream and the surrounding air. Rossby waves caused by this jet stream shear and the Coriolis force cause it to meander. = Temperature gradient = A temperature gradient is the change of temperature over a distance in some given direction. Where the temperature of a gas changes, so does its density and where the density changes CAT can appear.  Vertical  From the ground upwards through the troposphere temperature decreases with height; from the tropopause upwards through the stratosphere temperature increases with height. Such variations are examples of temperature gradients.  Horizontal  A horizontal temperature gradient may occur, and hence air density variations, where air velocity changes. An example: the speed of the jet stream is not constant along its length; additionally air temperature and hence density will vary between the air within the jet stream and the air outside. Air turbulence = Wind shear = Wind shear is a difference in relative speed between two adjacent air masses. An excessive wind shear produces vortices, and when the wind shear is of sufficient degree, the air will tend to move chaotically. As is explained elsewhere in this article, temperature decreases and wind velocity increase with height in the troposphere, and the reverse is true within the stratosphere. These differences cause changes in air density, and hence viscosity. The viscosity of the air thus presents both inertias and accelerations which cannot be determined in advance.  Vertical  Vertical wind shear above the jet stream (i.e., in the stratosphere) is sharper when it is moving upwards, because wind speed decreases with height in the stratosphere. This is the reason CAT can be generated above the tropopause, despite the stratosphere otherwise being a region which is vertically stable. On the other hand, vertical wind shear moving downwards within the stratosphere is more moderate (i.e., because downwards wind shear within the stratosphere is effectively moving against the manner in which wind speed changes within the stratosphere) and CAT is never produced in the stratosphere. Similar considerations apply to the troposphere but in reverse.  Horizontal  When strong wind deviates, the change of wind direction implies a change in the wind speed. A stream of wind can change its direction by differences of pressure. CAT appears more frequently when the wind is surrounding a low pressure region, especially with sharp troughs that change the wind direction more than 100¬∞. Extreme CAT has been reported without any other factor than this. = Mountain waves = Wind flow over a mountain produces oscillations (A), (B) etc. Mountain waves are formed when four requirements are met. When these factors coincide with jet streams, CAT can occur: * A mountain range, not an isolated mountain * Strong perpendicular wind * Wind direction maintained with altitude * Temperature inversion at the top of the mountain range = Gravity wave wind shear = The tropopause is a layer which separates two very different types of air. Beneath it, the air gets colder and the wind gets faster with height. Above it, the air warms and wind velocity decreases with height. These changes in temperature and velocity can produce fluctuation in the altitude of the tropopause, called gravity waves.  Effects on aircraft  In the context of air flight, CAT is sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"air pockets\\". Standard airplane radars cannot detect CAT, as CAT is not associated with clouds that show unpredictable movement of the air. Airlines and pilots should be aware of factors that cause or indicate CAT to reduce the probability of meeting turbulence. Aircraft in level flight rely on a constant air density to retain stability. Where air density is significantly different, for instance because of temperature gradient, especially at the tropopause, CAT can occur. Where an aircraft changes its position horizontally from within the jet stream to outside the jet stream, or vice versa, a horizontal temperature gradient may be experienced. Because jet streams meander, such a change of position need not be the result of a change of course by the aircraft. Because the altitude of the tropopause is not constant, an airplane that flies at a constant altitude would traverse it and encounter any associated CAT. On May 1, 2017, Boeing 777 flight SU270 from Moscow to Thailand got into clear air turbulence. The aircraft suddenly dropped and 27 passengers who were not buckled up sustained serious injuries. The pilots were able to stabilize the plane and continue the flight. All passengers who needed medical attention were taken to Bangkok hospital upon arrival. On March 5, 1966, BOAC Flight 911 from Tokyo to Hong Kong, a Boeing 707, broke up in CAT, with loss of all hands (124) on board. The sequence of failure started with the vertical stabilizer getting ripped off. = Pilot rules = When a pilot experiences CAT, a number of rules should be applied: * The aircraft must sustain the recommended velocity for turbulence. * When following the jet stream to escape from the CAT, the aircraft must change altitude and/or heading. * When the CAT arrives from one side of the airplane, the pilot must observe the thermometer to determine whether the aircraft is above or below the jet stream and then move away from the tropopause. * When the CAT is associated with a sharp trough, the plane must go through the low-pressure region instead of around it. * The pilot may issue a Pilot Report (PIREP), communicating position, altitude and severity of the turbulence to warn other aircraft entering the region. = Cases = Because aircraft move so quickly, they can experience sudden unexpected accelerations or 'bumps' from turbulence, including CAT - as the aircraft rapidly cross invisible bodies of air which are moving vertically at many different speeds. Although the vast majority of cases of turbulence are harmless, in rare cases cabin crew and passengers on aircraft have been injured when tossed around inside an aircraft cabin during extreme turbulence (and in a small number of cases, killed, as on United Airlines Flight 826 on December 28, 1997). BOAC Flight 911 broke up in flight in 1966 after experiencing severe lee-wave turbulence just downwind of Mount Fuji, Japan. = Wake turbulence = This picture from a NASA study on wingtip vortices qualitatively illustrates wake turbulence. Wake turbulence is another type of clear-air turbulence, but in this case the causes are quite different from those set out above. In the case of wake turbulence, the rotating vortex-pair created by the wings of a large aircraft as it travels lingers for a significant amount of time after the passage of the aircraft, sometimes more than a minute. When this occurs, the lingering turbulence caused by the wake of the wing tips can deflect or even flip a smaller aircraft on the ground or in the air awaiting landing. This phenomenon can also lead to accidents with large aircraft as well. Delta Air Lines Flight 9570 crashed at the Greater Southwest International Airport in 1972 while landing behind a DC-10. This accident led to new rules for minimum following separation time from \\"heavy\\" aircraft.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7303.pdf American Airlines Flight 587 crashed shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2001 due to pilot overreaction to wake turbulence from a Boeing 747.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0404.pdf Many aircraft are now made with wingtip devices to improve both the lift-to- drag ratio and fuel economy - such devices may also marginally reduce the strength of the wingtip vortices. However, such changes are not operationally significant (i.e. do not change the distances or times at which it is safe to follow other aircraft).https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-23G.pdf  See also  * Continuous gusts * Dryden Wind Turbulence Model * Ellrod index * N-slit interferometer * von K√°rm√°n Wind Turbulence Model  References  External links  * Brace for Turbulence * Clear Air Turbulence Forecast (USA) * * Category:Atmospheric dynamics Category:Weather hazards to aircraft Category:Meteorological phenomena Category:Turbulence Category:Wind ","title":"Clear-air turbulence"},{"id":"2014418","text":"Gravity models are used in various social sciences to predict and describe certain behaviors that mimic gravitational interaction as described in Isaac Newton's law of gravity.

MacLean had a big influence in getting Platinum Blonde back together after a 20-year absence, but he wouldn't live to see it come to fruition. MacLean had commented to Platinum Blonde's lead singer Mark Holmes \\"hundreds of times\\" that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes once quoted MacLean as saying, \\"Let‚Äôs get back together. Music doesn't have any rock stars anymore.\\" In November 2008, Holmes took up MacLean's long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club in Toronto, a club founded by Holmes, and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits. MacLean died of a heart related problem on November 24, 2008, after performing at the Mod Club the night before. His body was found by his sister, and recording artist Brock Burford.

Photo: ¬©2005 Hans J√∏rn Storgaard Andersen Until 1 January 2007, Ebeltoft municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in Aarhus County on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula in central Denmark. The region lies in a geographic region known as southern Djursland, and more specifically Mols. The municipality covered an area of 276 km2, and had a total population of 14.997 (2003). Its last mayor was J√∏rgen Br√∏gger. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Ebeltoft. Ebeltoft municipality ceased to exist as the result of Kommunalreformen (\\"The Municipality Reform\\" of 2007). It was merged with existing Midtdjurs, Rosenholm, and R√∏nde municipalities to form the new Syddjurs municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 693 km2 and a total population of 40,196 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland (\\"Mid-Jutland Region\\"). Facts about the former municipality The municipality itself consisted of two smaller peninsulas that jut out into the surrounding waters, one to the south, and the other to the west. The southward peninsula, which contains the town of Ebeltoft, is surrounded on the east by Hjelm Deep, which separates the area from the small island of Hjelm off its eastern coast. To the west of this peninsula is Ebeltoft Cove (Ebeltoft Vig) which forms a bay between the southward peninsula and the headland formed to the south of the westward peninsula, Helge Headland (Helgen√¶s). To the west of Helge Headland is Aarhus Bay (Aarhus Bugt). To the northwest of the westward peninsula is Knebel Cove (Knebel Vig) and Kal√∏ Cove (Kal√∏ Vig). The municipality also was home to Lake Stubbe (Stubbe S√∏) and several high elevations. The high hilly moraine landscape is called Mols Bjerge (*Mols Hills*), and is a protected as Mols Bjerge National Park. Some of the highest elevations in the area are Agri Bavneh√∏j at 137 meters, Treh√∏je at 127 meters, and Stabelh√∏jene at 135 and 133 meters in height. The area has many burial mounds, stone monuments and graves, including Porsk√¶r Stenhus, Denmark's largest stone burial chamber near the town of Knebel. Porsk√¶r Stenhus is over 2,000 years old. The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (\\"Municipality Reform\\") that combined the following parishes: Agri, Dr√•by, Ebeltoft, Egens, Fuglslev, Helgen√¶s, Hyllested, Knebel, Rols√∏, Rosmus, Tirstrup, Tved, and Vistoft parishes. The area known as Mols Mols is an area in the southern part of Djursland on Jutland's east coast with Ebeltoft as its main city. The residents of this area are known as Molboere (\\"Mols residents\\"). There have been written many fictional accounts of the stupidity of these people, referred to as Molbohistorier (\\"Stories of the Mols residents\\"). The town of Ebeltoft Ebeltoft was granted its municipal charter in 1301. The town is very picturesque, and has many well-preserved half-timbered houses and cobbled streets. Among the town's highlights are the Frigate Jylland (Fregatten Jylland), the Ebeltoft Zoo, the Ebeltoft Museum, and the Glasmuseet Ebeltoft (Ebeltoft Glass Museum). *The Frigate Jylland was launched in 1860, and served as both royal yacht and battleship before it was reduced to a barracks ship in 1892. The ship has had a 10-year restoration. *The Glass Museum houses a large collection of contemporary glass from all over the world.

She was named after Commodore Edward Preble (1761‚Äì1807). Early Service Preble first sailed for Labrador, and then went to cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in 1843. She was attached to the African Squadron in 1845. In 1846, Preble sailed for New York and joined the Pacific Squadron on the West Coast of the United States, where she participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1848, Captain James Glynn took her first to Hong Kong and then to Nagasaki, Japan, where she picked up some fourteen American and Hawaiian seamen who had become castaways in that \\"closed country\\". In November 1850, she returned to the east coast of the United States, where she became a practice ship for midshipmen until 1857, when she was placed in ordinary service. Civil War Service During the American Civil War, in July 1861, Preble joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron and participated to the blockade of the Mississippi River. She was posted at Head of the Passes on the Mississippi River on 12 October 1861 when the blockading squadron there was attacked by a Confederate States Navy force that included the first ironclad warship, CSS Manassas. Being a-sail-powered ship, she did not join the battle but rather made a swift retreat out the Southwest Pass to safety in the Gulf of Mexico. Preble was serving as a guard ship when, on 27 April 1863, while moored in Pensacola Bay off Pensacola, Florida, she caught fire due to the carelessness of a crewman. She was abandoned and exploded. In 1963, U.S. Navy divers discovered the wreck of Preble. They retrieved a number of artifacts.

Program Synopsis Genoa's primary function was intelligence analysis in order to assist human analysts. The program was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches; a policy maker could hypothesize a possible attack and use Genoa to look for supporting evidence of such a plot, or it would compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes. Human analysts would then be able to modify the diagram to test various cases. Companies such as Integral Visuals, Saffron Technology, and Syntek Technologies were involved in Genoa's development. It cost a total of $42 million to complete the program. History Genoa was conceived in late 1995 by retired Rear Admiral John Poindexter, a chief player in the Iran-Contra Affair. At the time, Poindexter was working at Syntek, a company often contracted to do work for the Department of Defense. He proposed a computer system that would help humans crunch large amounts of data in order to more effectively predict potential national security threats. Poindexter brought his ideas to former colleagues working with the United States National Security Council. That year, a team of researchers was assembled for the project and began studying various historical events to which Genoa could be applied. The Tokyo subway sarin attack in March was the primary focus. Instead of analyzing the attack itself, the researchers looked into the history of Aum Shinrikyo, the group that perpetrated the attack, to find evidence that could've suggested their intentions. In order to pitch their ideas, the researchers set up a mock crisis command center in DARPA's main building, full of monitors staffed by actors. An audience would watch as a fictitious scenario would unfold before them, guided along by an animated video segment. Poindexter called the presentation \\"A Day in the Life of an Analyst.\\" Another mock center was set up near the DARPA building with the help of a Hollywood set designer to serve the same purpose. Prominent viewers of the exhibition included Richard A. Clarke, John Michael McConnell, and James R. Clapper. Genoa was commissioned in 1996 for development overseen by DARPA and completed in the 2002 fiscal year, becoming a component of the Total Information Awareness program. It was concluded that while Genoa helped officials better understand complex situations, it operated at a slow speed. The research initiated by the project was continued in its immediate follow-on program, Genoa II. One of the goals of this successor was to increase the speed of analyses. The program was actively utilized by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

HistoryFerdinand Feghoot= The term for this storytelling model originated in a long-running series of short science-fiction pieces that appeared under the collective title \\"Through Time and Space with Ferdinand Feghoot\\", published in various magazines over several decades, written by Reginald Bretnor under the anagrammatic pseudonym of 'Grendel Briarton'. The usual formula the stories followed was for the title character to solve a problem bedeviling some manner of being or extricate himself from a dangerous situation. The events could take place all over the galaxy and in various historical or future periods on Earth and elsewhere. In his adventures, Feghoot worked for the Society for the Aesthetic Re-Arrangement of History and traveled via a device that had no name, but was typographically represented as the \\")(\\". The pieces were usually vignettes only a few paragraphs long, and always ended with a deliberately terrible pun that was often based on a well- known title or catch-phrase. \\"Through Time and Space with Ferdinand Feghoot\\" was originally published in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1956 to 1973. In 1973, the magazine ran a contest soliciting readers' feghoots as entries. The series also appeared in Fantasy and Science Fiction's sister magazine Venture Science Fiction Magazine, and later in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, Amazing Stories, and other publications. The individual pieces were identified by Roman numerals rather than titles. The stories have been collected in several editions, each an expanded version of the previous, the most recent being The Collected Feghoot from Pulphouse Publishing. Many of the ideas and puns for Bretnor's stories were contributed by others, including F. M. Busby and E. Nelson Bridwell. Other authors have published feghoots written on their own, including Isaac Asimov and John Brunner. Numerous fan- produced stories have been written, as well. Bretnor said that the idea of the name occurred to his wife and him during a game of Scrabble. He always arranged his letter tiles alphabetically; at one point, he had EFGHOOT. His wife suggested that, if the first two letters were transposed, the silly name 'Feghoot' could be formed. Bretnor did so, and began using the name in his punny stories. =Other story puns= * Myles na gCopaleen's column \\"Cruiskeen Lawn\\" in the Irish Times regularly featured feghoots, generally recounted as episodes in the lives of (fictionalised versions of) John Keats and George Chapman. * The \\"Mr. Peabody's Improbable History\\" segments on Rocky and Bullwinkle were animated feghoots, right down to the pun at the end of each episode. * In 1962, Amazing Stories published \\"Through Time and Space with Benedict Breadfruit\\" by Grandall Barretton (Randall Garrett), which all ended in a pun on the name of a famous science-fiction writer. Bretnor later paid tribute to these stories in one of his own, in which Ferdinand Feghoot assures a friend that Breadfruit was \\"conceived in our Garrett\\". * One example of a feghoot is the \\"Forty million Frenchmen\\" gag (\\"For DeMille, young fur- henchmen...\\") on page 559 of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. * The Callahan's Bar series by Spider Robinson uses \\"some of the worst puns known to man.... building up to the anticipated pun with skill and flair.\\" * Isaac Asimov used the song \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\" to form an elaborate story pun in his short story \\"Death of a Foy\\".Isaac Asimov, \\"The Winds of Change\\", Granada 1983/ Panther, 1984/Doubleday 1984, He uses the \\"Marseillaise\\" in the short story \\"Battle-Hymn\\"Isaac Asimov, \\"Battle-Hymn\\", in \\"Gold\\", Harper 1995 for the same effect. *Arthur C.

It has the Bayer designation Œ∂ Ursae Majoris (Latinised as Zeta Ursae Majoris). It forms a well-known naked eye double star with the fainter star Alcor, and is itself a quadruple star system. The whole system lies about 83 light-years away from the Sun, as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, and is part of the Ursa Major Moving Group. Nomenclature Œ∂ Ursae Majoris (Latinised to Zeta Ursae Majoris and abbreviated to Œ∂ UMa or Zeta UMa) is Mizar's Bayer designation. It also has the Flamsteed designation 79 Ursae Majoris. The traditional name Mizar derives from the Arabic ' ' meaning 'apron; wrapper, covering, cover'. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Mizar for Œ∂ UMa. According to IAU rules, the name Mizar strictly only applies to component Aa, although it is traditionally and popularly used for all four stars making up the single naked-eye star.

The multiple star system of Mizar (the double star on the right) and Alcor (left). The unrelated, fainter star Sidus Ludovicianum can be seen lower down. Mizar is a visual double with a separation of 14.4 arcseconds, each of which is a spectroscopic binary. Its combined apparent magnitude is 2.04. The two visible stars are referred to as Œ∂1 and Œ∂2 Ursae Majoris, or Mizar A and B. The spectroscopic components are generally referred to as Mizar Aa, Ab, Ba, and Bb. The stars all share a single Hipparcos designation of HIP 65378, but separate Bright Star Catalogue and Henry Draper Catalogue entries. Mizar, together with Alcor and many of the other bright stars in Ursa Major, is a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group. An easily split visual target, Mizar was the first telescopic binary discovered, most probably by Benedetto Castelli who in 1617 asked Galileo Galilei to observe it. Galileo then produced a detailed record of the double star. Later, around 1650, Riccioli wrote of Mizar appearing as a double. The secondary star (Mizar B) comes within 380 AU of the primary (Mizar A) and the two take thousands of years to revolve around each other. Mizar A was the first spectroscopic binary to be discovered, as part of Antonia Maury's spectral classification work, and an orbit was published in 1890. Some spectroscopic binaries cannot be visually resolved and are discovered by studying the spectral lines of the suspect system over a long period of time. The two components of Mizar A are both about 35 times as bright as the Sun, and revolve around each other in about 20 days 12 hours and 55 minutes. In 1908, Mizar B was also found to be a spectroscopic binary, its components completing an orbital period every six months. In 1996, 107 years after their discovery, the components of the Mizar A binary system were imaged in extremely high resolution using the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer. =Œ∂1 Ursae Majoris= Radial velocity curves for the two almost identical components The two components of Œ∂1 Ursae Majoris (Mizar Aa and Ab) are observed to be identical, with the exception of slightly different radial velocity variations which indicate very slightly different masses. The spectral lines of the two stars can be observed separately and both are given a spectral type of A2Vp. They are Ap stars, chemically peculiar due to stratification of some heavy elements in the photosphere of slowly-rotating hot stars. In this case, they show elevated abundances of strontium and silicon. With the assumption of identical physical properties for the two stars, they both have temperatures of 9,000 K, radii of , and bolometric luminosities of . They are thought to be around 370 million years old. =Œ∂2 Ursae Majoris= Œ∂2 Ursae Majoris is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and the visible spectrum is of an Am star, named for their unusually strong lines of some metals. The spectral type of kA1h(eA)mA7IV-V is in a form used for metallic-lined stars: the type is A1 based on the calcium K lines, early A based on the hydrogen lines, and A7 based on lines of other metals. The luminosity class is ranked between main sequence and subgiant. Based on the orbital properties of the system, the total mass of the two stars is approximately 2.1 solar masses, most of which is contributed by the primary star. Other names Mizar is known as Vashistha, one of the Saptarishi, in traditional Indian astronomy. Chinese Taoism personifies Œ∂ Ursae Majoris as the Lu star. In Chinese, (), meaning Northern Dipper, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper. Consequently, the Chinese name for Œ∂ Ursae Majoris itself is Bƒõi D«íu li√π, () and KƒÅi Y√°ng, (). In the Mi'kmaq myth of the great bear and the seven hunters, Mizar is Chickadee and Alcor is his cooking pot. =Military namesakes= * USS Mizar is a cargo and passenger liner converted to a United States Navy ship * USNS Mizar, a United States Navy ship See also * Mizar in fiction ReferencesExternal links * Mizar at Jim Kaler's Stars website * A New View Of Mizar (a comprehensive article about the system) * Category:A-type main-sequence stars Category:Am stars Category:Ap stars Category:Spectroscopic binaries Category:A-type subgiants 4 Category:Ursa Major Moving Group Category:Stars with proper names Ursae Majoris, Zeta Category:Big Dipper Category:Ursa Major (constellation) BD+55 1598 Ursae Majoris, 79 116656 7 065378 5054 5 ","title":"Mizar"},{"id":"2014460","text":"Statue of S√∏ren Kanne (1801-1860) in Grenaa, Denmark.

The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, who create flights of fancy via the use of power rings that draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. Space travellers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clich√©d. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th-century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in The End of All Songs.Omnibus edition, Granada. \\"Ernest Wheldrake\\" had been a pseudonym used by Algernon Charles Swinburne.Edmund Gosse, The Life of Algernon Swinburne (1917), p44. The original trilogy (An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands, and The End of All Songs) was published between 1972 and 1976. The trilogy purports to tell the last love story in human history. Other stories in this sequence include The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming (also known as A Messiah at the End of Time) which is a rewrite of the novella Constant Fire. Several short stories, some of which were included in the collection Legends from the End of Time, were published in New Worlds 7‚Äì10 (the paperback revival of the magazine). Short stories featuring Elric (\\"Elric at the End of Time\\"), and Jerry Cornelius (\\"The Murderer's Song\\") also feature characters and places from the End of Time. Main characters in the series include Jherek Carnelian, one of the few humans at the End of Time to have been born naturally, rather than created; Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from the late 19th century; the enigmatic Lord Jagged; and Miss Mavis Ming in the eponymous The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming, which also features the Fireclown. (The 1993 Millennium omnibus edition of Legends from the End of Time ostensibly assembles all the stories and The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming ‚Äì under the title Constant Fire ‚Äì but was affected by severe printing errors and omits the final six lines of Elric at the End of Time and all but the final chapter of Constant Fire. These were corrected for the 1997 Orion edition.)  The End of Time  The prologue of An Alien Heat calls it \\"a story of Jherek Carnelian, who did not know the meaning of morality, and Mrs. Amelia Underwood, who knew everything about it\\". The novel begins with a discussion between Jherek Carnelian and his mother, the Iron Orchid, about the meaning of the word virtuous. Carnelian, who has looked the word up in an ancient dictionary, finds the concept \\"bewildering\\". Jherek meets his future love, Amelia Underwood, at an extravagant party hosted by the Duke of Queens, the theme of which is \\"disaster\\". The Duke of Queens intends the centerpiece of this entertainment to be an alien, Yusharisp, who tries to warn them that the universe will soon end; the people merely find this boring, and the entertainment falls flat. My Lady Charlotina freezes Yusharisp for transport to her menagerie. Jherek is delighted when Mrs. Amelia Underwood reacts to this by exclaiming \\"Let the poor creature go! Though he is neither human nor Christian, he is still one of God's creatures and has a right to his liberty!\\" An example of how lightly sex, including incest and homosexuality, is treated at the End of Time can be found in the early chapters of An Alien Heat. In the chapter \\"A Conversation with the Iron Orchid\\" Jherek has sex with his mother, and in the chapter \\"Carnelian Conceives a New Affectation\\" he has a same-sex encounter with Lord Jagged. (Likewise, in Legends from the End of Time, the Iron Orchid makes love to My Lady Charlotina.) When Jherek decides to fall in love with Mrs. Underwood to the exclusion of everyone else, everyone applauds his original thinking.  Landscape  The landscapes at the End of Time are almost entirely artificial or illusory, created by the inhabitants and constantly being altered. In the first chapter of An Alien Heat, the Iron Orchid and Jherek Carnelian awaken after the picnic they have created to find that the sea has been turned a shade of cerise, and the cliff with two palm trees that had previously been behind them had been replaced by a twelve-story silver pagoda. Beneath the decoration, however, the Earth is a sterile wasteland lit by a dim red sun. In the short story \\"Elric at the End of Time\\" the inhabitants of the end of time attempt to entertain Elric of Melnibon√© (and amuse themselves) by creating an adventure to keep Elric occupied. Elric is no stranger to chaos and is completely convinced that he has in fact been transported to a realm of chaos. This is largely due to the unexpected, bizarre (and often instantaneous) changes which his hosts make to the landscape. PlotThe Dancers at the End of TimeAn Alien Heat The title of this volume comes from the poem \\"Hothouse Flowers\\" by Theodore Wratislaw. An alien named Yusharisp comes to Earth to warn its remaining inhabitants that the universe is coming to an end; his own planet has already disappeared, and the Earth is sure to follow. Earth's inhabitants are unfazed as they believe him to be yet another doomsayer; the End of the Earth has been predicted for centuries. Jherek is far more interested in Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from Victorian England, as he is fascinated by the Victorian era. Jherek resolves to fall in love with her. Mrs Underwood, at first repulsed by the debauchery of the End of Time, finally comes to believe that Jherek is sincere in his affections and starts teaching him about moral values. She falls in love with him at last; as they are about to embrace, however, she is returned to her own time. Jherek, heartbroken, decides to rescue her, and travels to 19th-century London, using the time machine from Moorcock's Behold the Man Jherek is inexperienced to the point of naivete about the Victorian Era, despite his interest in it, and a (temporally) local thief, Snoozer Vine, tricks him into becoming an accomplice to Snoozer's latest scam. Not surprisingly, Jherek proves to be a poor criminal, and is quickly arrested, jailed and sent to trial. To his surprise, the judge appears to be none other than his friend, Lord Jagged, but claims to be one Jagger. Jherek is sentenced to death, as the case against him is unequivocal, but he cannot understand why all the people around him are so upset; inhabitants of the End of Time are immortal, and for them death is merely transitory. Jherek is hanged, only to wake up among his friends at the End of Time, who tell him that to them, he has only been gone for a second. The Hollow Lands The title of this volume comes from the poem \\"The Last Word\\" by Ernest Dowson. Reunited at the end of Time, Jherek and the other inhabitants of the End of Time have returned to their preferred amusements of parties and games. They are interrupted by a ship of alien musician/pirates, the Lat. Hunted by the Lat, Jherek stumbles into a subterranean school built centuries ago to protect the last children of that era from the tyrant director Pecking Pa the Eighth (a reference to Sam Peckinpah). The time in the school is constantly recycled by a robot nanny so old she has started to break down, and as a result is recycling the same week repeatedly. The teacher-robot mistakes Jherek for one of her children as she has forgotten that there is anything outside her school, and keeps him. When she realises her mistake, she agrees to send him back to 1896; her ability to recycle time means that she can function as a time machine. Returned to the 19th century, Jherek heads for Bromley, where Mrs Amelia Underwood lives. On the way, Jherek meets H.G. Wells and explains that he is a time traveller, but is met only with Wells's ironic disbelief. Jherek is finally reunited with Mrs Underwood but also forced to confront her husband Mr Underwood. Mr. Underwood is so suspicious of their story that a reluctant Mrs Underwood runs away with Jherek. Chased by the police, the two are rescued by a journalist, Mr Jackson who, like Judge Jagger, bears a strong resemblance to Lord Jagged. The police catch up with the fleeing couple, but are interrupted in their attempted arrest by the appearance of the Lat, the Iron Orchid and a number of other residents of the End of Time. Chaos ensues as the police and the Lat start fighting, and the fabric of time itself begins disintegrating. The time travellers start vanishing, and Jackson, who finally reveals himself to be Lord Jagged (also Judge Jagger), takes Jherek and Mrs Underwood to a time machine that will take them to the End of Time. The machine appears to malfunction; instead of delivering them to the End of Time, it maroons them in what appears to be the Lower Devonian period. The End of All Songs The title of this volume comes from the poem \\"Dregs\\" by Ernest Dowson. Jherek and Mrs Amelia Underwood, after spending some time alone in the Devonian, meet Una Persson and Captain Oswald Bastable, who introduce themselves as members of the Guild of Temporal Adventurers. They explain the notion of the multiverse as the combination of all simultaneously existing realities before sending Jherek and Amelia back to the End of Time. There, Jherek finds all his friends who had vanished from 1896 alive and well, except for Lord Jagged who has yet to return. Amelia is now more tolerant towards the people of the End of Time, though still occasionally revolted by their lack of morals. She and Jherek resume the life they led in An Alien Heat, which is interrupted by the sudden arrival of a shell shocked, crazed Mr Underwood, Inspector Springer and a dozen policemen, and the Lat. Jherek, the Duke of Queens, the policemen, Amelia and Mr Underwood seek refuge from the Lat in one of the Lost Cities, which hold the energy used by the people of the End of Time to alter matter through their rings, and are surprised to find it crumbling, and the sun gone. They are joined by Yusharisp and the end-of-time resident Lord Mongrove, a manic-depressive giant who explains that the apocalypse has begun, and that they are the sole survivors. The group realises with horror that their energy rings are no longer working. In light of their impending doom, Amelia finally admits that her love for Jherek is more important to her than morals or convention. The Iron Orchid and Lord Jagged, by now assumed to be dead, appear. Lord Jagged reveals himself to be Jherek's father, and a time traveller from the 21st century. After learning of the Earth's impending destruction, he sought to preserve humanity by sending a \\"new Adam and Eve\\" to the beginning of time, thus creating a loop that would prevent humanity from spending thousands of years relearning the basics of civilisation. For genetic reasons, he chose Jherek and Amelia and orchestrated their meeting. Amelia and Jherek's marooning in the Devonian was not part of the plan; they did not, in fact, travel back in time, but too far into the future, past the end of the world in which they were currently residing. Upon realising this, Jagged understood that time is circular, not linear as was previously assumed, and devised a new plan. While his friends are devastated, he shows unwavering optimism and surprises everyone by creating a new sun with his energy ring. He proceeds to explain that energy can be drawn from any existing reality within the multiverse; this, combined with the technology that \\"recycled\\" time in the underground school, can be used to sustain the Earth forever. Now reassured that the Earth is safe in a time loop and provided with a new source of energy, the End of Timers resurrect their friends who died in the aborted apocalypse, and rebuild their world. Amelia, now comfortable at the End of Time, becomes popular. During a visit to Mr Underwood in the Lost City, she is faced with his conviction that she is damned when she tells him of her belief that God is dead. While she struggles with her conscience and her newfound atheism, her husband travels back to the 19th century and she decides to marry Jherek. When Lord Jagged offers to send both her and Jherek into the future, out of the time loop and after the end of the world to start a new civilisation, they accept. =Legends from the End of Time= Pale Roses begins with the destruction of the rainbow part of Werther de Goethe's creation Rain by the Everlasting Concubine, Mistress Christia, and Werther's despair. After a short interlude, Werther discovers, by the use of a parachute that closely resembles a Hot air balloon, a child (Catherine Lily Marguerite Natasha Dolores Beatrice Machineshop-Seven Flambeau Gratitude) who is the fourteen-year-old daughter of two time travellers, and deigns to take on the role of her now deceased parents. Following a masquerade with the theme of Childhood, Werther is passionately overcome and engages in sexual intercourse with Catherine. After the event, disgusted by what he perceives to be the enormity of his acts, he is even more disgusted in Catherine for having enjoyed what she describes as le petit mal. The story climaxes with Werther's suicide by jumping from his tower unaided by his parachute and his subsequent resurrection. It is then revealed that Catherine is really Mistress Christia in disguise, the series of events being an attempt to reconcile after her having destroyed his rainbow. White Stars: after discovering that he had inadvertently destroyed one of Lord Shark the Unknown's experiments with lichen, the Duke of Queens offers to duel with him to rid himself of his guilt. In Ancient Shadows, a time traveller, Dafnish Armatuce, and her son, Snuffles, arrive at the End of Time, and become involved with Miss Mavis Ming. Paperback reprint of The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming =The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming= Chronicling the transformation of Miss Mavis Ming and the parts played by Doctor Volospion, his fellow residents at the End of Time, and Mr Emmanuel Bloom, also known as The Fireclown. The ending originally involved a scene where the main character, Mavis Ming, was whipped into submission by Bloom. This was later rewritten by the author. The novel has also been published, with differences, under the titles A Messiah at the End of Time and Constant Fire. =Elric at the End of Time= \\"Elric at the End of Time\\" is one of two Elric short stories included in the eponymous collection, Elric at the End of Time. Its characters include Elric, Una Persson, and Lord Jagged. CharactersJherek Carnelian= Jherek Carnelian, son of the Iron Orchid and an unknown father (later revealed to be Lord Jagged) is the protagonist of the novels An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands and The End of All Songs. Jherek is almost unique among the natives of The End of Time, in that he was born, rather than created. Only Werther De Goethe is mentioned as also having been born, implying that this trait is something of a rarity in this time period. Jherek's childhood and adolescence subsequently provided a great deal of novelty and interest for the Iron Orchid and her clique, and left Jherek with a notable childlike freshness and creativity, compared to the majority of his contemporaries. This makes him something of a trend-setter among his peers. In particular, his fascination with the past has made him a recognised expert in the field ‚Äì the nearest thing The End of Time has to a historian. He is particularly interested in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A million or more years of lost records and misinformation have taken their toll, however, and Jherek's attempts to recreate elements of the era are often comically inaccurate. Jherek's entire existence is later revealed to be part of a complicated scheme of Lord Jagged's to survive the End of Time by selectively breeding a race of humans whose DNA renders them immune to the tendency for time to heal itself by rejecting time travellers who journey to the past, and flinging them forward to their point of origin, or beyond. This tendency is called the \\"Morphail Effect\\" and it is named after Dr. Brannart Morphail, a character in the novel. Jherek may be an incarnation of Moorcock's recurring character Jerry Cornelius. =Mrs Amelia Underwood= A denizen of 19th century Bromley, she arrives at a party hosted by the Duke of Queens under mysterious circumstances after she is kidnapped from her own age. She is married to the stuffy Mr. Underwood, who becomes a comic presence in the second and third books. She is a lovely young woman and, although her Victorian upbringing has made a strict moralist of her, she gradually begins to thaw under Jherek's influence. In her childhood, she travelled with her father, a missionary, into exotic locations: these experiences planted the seeds of tolerance. At first, her sense of duty makes her tolerate Jherek, despite his vexing romantic blandishments; she tells herself that, as a good Christian, she must indoctrinate him into the mysteries of Virtue. Later, her personality begins to blossom, and she realises she loves Jherek. =The Iron Orchid= The last woman to give birth on Earth, the Iron Orchid is Jherek's mother. Surprised that she had a child, she delights in her son, and encourages his creativity and endeavors. She is fond of Jherek's company, often having picnics with him. =Lord Jagged= Lord Jagged is a time traveller, and, unlike Jherek and the Iron Orchid, is not a native to the End of Time. He is the father of Jherek by the Iron Orchid, and is later shown to be manipulating various events that occur in the series. In the short story, Elric at the End of Time, Lord Jagged assumes the persona of the chaos Lord Arioch, returning Elric to his own realm. Una Persson later compliments him on the imitation, saying: Lord Jagged, however, does not reply to this. Instead, he \\"[puffs] on his pipe and [smiles] a secret and superior smile\\". =Werther de Goethe= Werther de Goethe is named for the main character of Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther and for Goethe himself, and is likewise angst ridden. He features as the main character in the short story \\"Pale Roses\\". Werther is the only other character from the end of time who was born, rather than created through the use of power rings. =Duke of Queens= The Duke of Queens is known throughout the End of Time for his outrageous creations. His first appearance is in An Alien Heat. After having adjusted the geography where the Iron Orchid and Jherek lunched and turning the sea into a deep pink, described as almost cerise, he is shown to be once more experimenting with artificial wings, to the chagrin of Iron Orchid, who wonders why he insists that they are a success. =My Lady Charlotina= My Lady Charlotina lives under the last permanent body of water on Earth, Lake Billy the Kid. Capricious, she often changes her skin tone to unusual colors. A jealous collector, she has one of the world‚Äôs largest menageries of time and space travelers. She is the patron of Brannart Morphail whose laboratories share her apartments under the lake. =Brannart Morphail= Brannart Morphail is a self-styled scientist who specializes in Time and time travel. He is short, ugly, and has both a club foot and a hump. The Morphail Effect, a law of time that prevents time travel paradox, is named after him. =Mistress Christia, The Everlasting Concubine= Mistress Christia is the expression of feminine beauty at the end of time. Beloved by all at the End of Time, she is a favorite at gatherings, always being the first to arrive. =Bishop Castle= Formerly known as \\"King Rook\\", Bishop Castle has interest in all thing religious. He wears a ten-foot high mitre. =Lord Mongrove= Lord Mongrove appears as a sad hulking giant. Obsessed with darker emotions, his style in clothing and dwelling are depressing, gloomy affairs. He claims he has no friends, but appreciates Werther de Goethe's aesthetic. =Li Pao= Li Pao is a time traveler from the 23rd century. He is disgusted by the decadence and excesses of the people at the End of Time, and often chastises them for their amoral ways, despite always attending their parties and gatherings. =Miss Mavis Ming= Miss Mavis Ming appears in the short story \\"Ancient Shadows\\", playing host to Dafnish Armatuce and her son, Snuffles, and also in the novel The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming, where she escapes from the machinations of Doctor Volospion. She has a small role in Moorcock's spy novel parody The Chinese Agent (1970), where she describes herself as a one-quarter Chinese former exotic dancer who used to perform a striptease under the name \\"Dawn Flower Ming, the Geisha Gusher\\".

Reed Memorial Kauri Park, Whangarei Sir Alfred Hamish Reed (30 December 1875 ‚Äì 15 January 1975), generally known as A.H. Reed, was a New Zealand publisher, author and entrepreneur. Early life Alfred Hamish Reed was born at Hayes, Middlesex, in England on 30 December 1875, the son of James William Reed and Elizabeth Reed. He was the second oldest of four children to parents who were devout Baptists and raised their children accordingly. His father James managed a brick field but in 1882 purchased his own brick business in Walthamstow and moved his family to the area. Alfred Reed was educated at a small private school and then, from 1883, Maynard Road School. The family were all avid readers, and for Reed, books would prove to be a lifelong passion. By 1886, James Reed's brick business was failing and had to close. This prompted him to migrate with his family to New Zealand. His maternal uncle lived there, in Motueka, and reported favourably on New Zealand in his letters to his sister, Alfred's mother. After a six-week voyage aboard the Arawa, the family arrived in Wellington in April 1887. They promptly travelled north to settle in Auckland but James Reed struggled to find employment. He eventually found work as a kauri gum digger in Northland while his family remained in Auckland. Elizabeth Reed supplemented the family's income through needlework. After several months, there was enough money to buy a block of land at Parahaki, to the east of Whangarei and the family moved there in late December 1887. Living conditions were crude and the family lived simply, the parents instilling a strong work ethic in their children. Unable to find a Baptist church to attend, the family went to a Wesleyan Methodist church. They rejected an Anglican church that was closer to their home on the grounds that it was too conformist. Alfred Reed attended Whangarei Primary School from early 1888 but was soon withdrawn from it in favour of another school, operated on a part-time basis. Later in the year, he severely injured his leg to the point of being bedridden, with local doctors unable to diagnose the problem for 12 months. He was later sent to hospital in Auckland where infection of the femur bone was diagnosed. He stayed in hospital for a year, away from his parents who were unable to afford to visit him, and underwent three operations. He was eventually discharged in July 1890. Returning to live with his parents, Reed was conscious of the burden that the expense of his medical care had caused his parents and in light of this, he decided to start working on the kauri gum fields alongside his father rather than finish his schooling. The work was hard, involving the extraction of gum from the ground and packing it. He also worked on the family's farmlet and would take occasional jobs cutting scrub or working on road construction. Realising he needed a skill to further himself, he decided to learn Pitman's shorthand; he hoped that this would lead to a career as a reporter. Working in Auckland By late 1895 Reed had become so proficient in shorthand he was sufficiently confident to go to Auckland to look for reporting work. Approaches made to the New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star were turned down so he took the opportunity to take typewriter lessons. For accommodation, he boarded with a couple who lived on Karangahape Road and made the acquaintance of their daughter, Harriet Isabel Fisher. Like Reed, she and her parents were English immigrants who had settled in Auckland in 1885. Known to Reed as Belle, she was nine years older and a devout Wesleyan Methodist. At the typewriting school, he made the acquaintance of T. G. DeRenzy, the co- owner and manager of the New Zealand Typewriter Company, who at the end of the year offered Reed a job as a shorthand writer and message boy. He soon parted ways with his employer to take up an Auckland agency for Remington Typewriter Company but this proved short-lived. In June 1896, he returned to the New Zealand Typewriter Company. He soon progressed from doing shorthand work to travelling around the North Island, selling and repairing typewriters. Impressed by Reed's work ethic, honesty and diligence, DeRenzy offered him the opportunity to set up an office for the company in Dunedin, a challenge that Reed accepted. Life in Dunedin In October 1897, Reed moved to Dunedin to start in his new role. In doing so he left behind a fianc√©e, having proposed to Belle earlier that year. The couple had decided Belle would stay in Auckland since they could not afford to marry. Reed quickly found suitable premises for the company's office and began retailing and repairing typewriters. Despite some hiccups, he soon began building the business and took on staff. After a year in Dunedin, and having secured a payrise, Reed returned to Auckland and married Belle at Pitt Street Methodist Church on 28 January 1899. The couple immediately travelled to Dunedin where they rented a house and settled down to life together. They lived simply and quietly, doing most things together although Reed would indulge in long solitary walks. Reed continued to work on developing the Dunedin branch, which would prove to be only profitable office for the New Zealand Typewriter Company. The couple were also heavily involved in church life; Reed took charge of a Sunday School class at the Methodist Trinity Church and in 1898 qualified as a preacher. Two years later, he took over as superintendent of the Sunday School, which had a roll of 250 children, with Belle keeping the accounts. Short of teaching materials, Reed began exporting books and literature from suppliers in the United States. Initially this was for his own school but soon other churches in Dunedin showed interest and Reed started supplying them with excess material from his own orders. He and Belle soon expanded this into a nationwide mail order business. In the meantime, DeRenzy wound up the New Zealand Typewriter Company but before doing so allowed Reed to purchase the Dunedin office on favourable terms. He and Belle continued to work on his mail order business, working out of a room at his office, with the sale and maintenance of typewriters providing regular income in the interim. While the financial reward of his day job was appreciated, Reed's passion was religious education and he saw his mail order business as doing God's work. By 1911, turnover for the business, which they called Sunday School Supply Stores, had reached ‚Ç§1,000 a year. On reaching this milestone, Reed sold his typewriter business to focus solely on the mail order business. Sunday School Supply Stores provided a range of goods, from cards, badges, clocks, hymn sheets, blackboards and the like to religious games, as well as bibles, tracts and testaments. Reed also launched into the book trade, supplying religious works for presentation to children as prizes. These were sourced from local representatives of overseas publishing houses. He took up the New Zealand agency for teaching materials for Sunday school teachers produced by an English publisher, and also was the local agent for a company that purchased religious books as publishers' remainders. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Reed joined the Territorial Force, New Zealand's part- time military reserve. While his business took up his working days, he trained in army techniques and weaponry. By 1916, with New Zealand soldiers now serving on the Western Front and in the Sinai and Palestine theatre of operations, Reed felt it his duty to volunteer for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service aboard. Assessed as sufficiently fit for overseas service, he and Belle sold the Sunday School Supply Stores business. This allowed him to clear the mortgage on the couple's residence, which they had purchased in 1901. Belle stayed on at the business, working for the new owner. Reed reported for duty on 21 September 1916, and was sent to Trentham Military Camp near Wellington for training. His contingent, the 21st Reinforcements, was the last group where all the recruits were volunteers. The New Zealand Government was to shortly introduced conscription to help maintain the flow of manpower to the NZEF. After a short period of training at Trentham, a further, more intensive, program of training commenced at Featherston Military Camp in the Wairarapa. With his strong Christian background, Reed found some aspects of military life difficult, particular the language and lurid storytelling that would occur in the camp's huts at night. He urged his fellow soldiers to avoid alcohol, blasphemy and to refrain from cursing. He even distributed a short tract to his hut mates suggesting that if they felt the need to curse, to substitute 'crimson' or 'purple' for swear words. Reed later recounted hearing a non-commissioned officer referring to a soldier as a 'crimson cow'. The 21st Reinforcements were scheduled to depart overseas in early 1917 but in December 1916, Reed's shorthand skills were discovered and he was asked to volunteer for the headquarters staff at Featherston Camp. He declined, preferring to go on active duty aboard, but was overruled and ordered to report to the camp's headquarters. Reed was dissatisfied with his posting, seeing it as one that could be easily fulfilled by a medically unfit man while he should be doing his duty at the frontlines. Publishing Reed entered the bookselling trade when he founded the firm of A. H. and A. W. Reed (later known as Reed Publishing (NZ) Ltd.), a leading publisher of New Zealand-related non-fiction and reference works, in association with his nephew Alexander Wyclif Reed. In 1932, he branched out as a publisher and in 1935 he became an author. Walking and climbing Reed also undertook walking and mountain-climbing expeditions. He climbed Mount Taranaki/Egmont (aged 80), Mount Ruapehu (aged 83), Ngauruhoe (aged 85), walked from North Cape to Bluff, now known as the Te Araroa Trail (aged 85) and from East Cape to Cape Egmont (aged 86), walked through Marlborough (aged 87) and through Otago, Canterbury, Westland, and the Haast (aged 88). Philanthropy In 1938 Reed and his wife established the Alfred and Isabel and Marian Reed Trust for the promotion of Christianity, education, literature and philanthropy for the people of New Zealand. The trust has amassed a collection of rare books and manuscripts for the Dunedin Public Libraries, including one of the most comprehensive collections of manuscripts and early printed Bibles in the Southern Hemisphere. Honours In the 1948 King's Birthday Honours Reed was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services in connexion with publication of historical and other New Zealand works. He was promoted to Commander of the same Order (CBE) in the 1962 New Year Honours, in recognition of his contribution as a writer and publisher of New Zealand historical works. In the 1974 Queen's Birthday Honours, Reed was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to literature and culture. Death and legacy Reed died at Dunedin on 15 January 1975, and his ashes were buried at Dunedin Northern Cemetery. Soon after the death of his uncle, Clif Reed wrote a short book of his experiences working with him. This was published as Young Kauri later that year. The publishing institution that he set up was eventually sold in 1983 to the Australian company Associated Book Publishers. Memorial plaque dedicated to Alfred Hamish Reed in Dunedin, on the Writers' Walk on the Octagon There are several memorials in Reed's memory: The A. H.

With an apparent magnitude of +3.3, it is the dimmest of the seven stars in the Big Dipper asterism. Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of from the Sun.  Stellar properties The Big Dipper with Delta Ursae Majoris Delta Ursae Majoris has 63% more mass than the Sun and is about 1.4 times its radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star. This star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poynting‚ÄìRobertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward. It has two faint companions, a 10th magnitude star and an 11th magnitude star, both at an angular separation of two arcminutes from the primary. Delta Ursae Majoris is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud. The space velocity components of Delta Ursae Majoris in the galactic coordinate system are [U, V, W] = [+15.35, +1.17, ‚Äì11.52]. Nomenclature Book plate by Sydney Hall depicting Ursa Major's stars Œ¥ Ursae Majoris (Latinised to Delta Ursae Majoris) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name Megrez and the historical name Kaffa. Megrez comes from the al-maghriz 'the base [of the bear's tail]'. Professor Paul Kunitzch has been unable to find any clues as to the origin of the name Kaffa, which appeared in a 1951 publication, Atlas Coeli (Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens) by Czech astronomer Anton√≠n Beƒçv√°≈ô. The Hindus knew this star as Atri, one of the Seven Rishis. In Chinese, (), meaning Northern Dipper, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper.

The character was created by Jack Kirby and made his first appearance in New Gods #7 (February 1972). Steppenwolf (which is German for \\"Steppe wolf\\") is one of the New Gods, the uncle of the supervillain Darkseid, the brother of Heggra, the great-uncle of Kalibak and Orion, and a member of Darkseid's Elite. Steppenwolf made his first live performance in the feature film Justice League of the DC Extended Universe portrayed in motion capture and voiced by Ciar√°n Hinds. Fictional character biography Steppenwolf is a New God who is the younger brother of Heggra and the uncle of Uxas (Darkseid). He is also a member of Darkseid's Elite. He leads the military forces of Apokolips and rides a hover bike that may be at the same level of technology as Orion's. Steppenwolf is one of the earliest survivors of Doomsday, the monster who once killed Superman. Two hundred and forty-five thousand years ago, Steppenwolf takes an Apokolips shuttle with Darkseid, Master Mayhem and a small crew to the planet of Bylan 5. The planet holds delicate natural materials Apokolips needs for weaponry, material which would be destroyed in the event of an invasion. The forcible marriage of Darkseid to the planet's princess comes to an end when Doomsday attacks. Master Mayhem is swiftly torn apart. Darkseid ignores Steppenwolf's orders to use omega beams and engages the creature in hand-to-hand combat. Steppenwolf sees that the destruction that has been wrought has doomed the planet, and all who live on it. He teleports Darkseid out of harm's way, agreeing with Darkseid not to mention this to anyone. Doomsday escapes by stowing away on the Apokolips shuttle.Doomsday: Year One Annual Most of Steppenwolf's appearances under the pen of Jack Kirby are in flashbacks: his debut, in New Gods #7, was a flashback story where he is introduced and helped Darkseid murder the wife of Darkseid's hated rival, Highfather. Highfather later tracks down and kills Steppenwolf in retaliation as the murder reignites the war between the two sides.New Gods #7 After later showing up alive and well in the seemingly non- canon (despite Jack Kirby's involvement) 1985 Super Powers mini-series, Steppenwolf's entry in Who's Who in the DC Universe clarified that he had been resurrected by Apokoliptian technology.Who's Who in the DC Universe #22 Steppenwolf appears later when Mister Miracle gains godlike powers over life and death. He torments Scott Free over his role in killing Scott's mother (or alleged mother figure as is claimed) and in return is physically tortured. Free ends up healing him, instead of killing him as he desires. He is sent away with Darkseid's legions.Mister Miracle #4 (July 1996) He is seen in New Gods V2 #6, with a new costume (a Kirby redesign for the figure's Super Power action figure). Though considered a \\"mockery\\", Steppenwolf is given the job of running Darkseid's military forces. He is later seen fighting the Flash (Barry Allen) and the Justice League of America.The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #9 In the pages of Terror Titans #2, Steppenwolf appears as a member of the board of the Dark Side Club. He is killed by Clock King, who was using the club for gladiator fights and simple cruel amusements. =The New 52= With The New 52 reboot that takes place following the 2011 Flashpoint limited series, a new version of Earth-2 (home of the Justice Society of America) is introduced. In the continuity of that parallel world, Steppenwolf leads a massive invasion of the planet by Darkseid's parademons. Ultimately, Earth's heroes manage to successfully repel the invaders, but the Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman of that world are all killed in battle.Earth 2 #1 (July 2012). Five years later, Steppenwolf is apparently hiding on Earth-2 and there is a $300 million reward for him. He is eventually killed by that world's version of Bizarro, whom Steppenwolf had employed as a soldier and indoctrinated into fighting for Apokolips. Steppenwolf also appears briefly in an issue of Justice League within The New 52 taking part in the torturing of Superman on the Prime Earth.Justice League Vol. 2 #6 (April 2012) Steppenwolf is seen as support for Darkseid when he moves to attack the Anti-Monitor.Justice League #43‚Äì45 (2015) Powers and abilities Steppenwolf is an immortal with vast superhuman strength, endurance and speed, capable of lifting about one hundred tons and jumping huge distances easily. Also, he has superhuman reflexes and a high degree of invulnerability, which increases with his battle armor and allows him to resist most physical and energetic attacks. He is an experienced military leader, having served as the head of Apokolips's armed forces, and when going into battle personally often commands units of the dog cavalry - warriors riding enormous dogs, known for the carnage and mass deaths he causes when he leads forces. Steppenwolf wields several weapons, including a cable- snare in which he can entrap opponents and from which he can fire lethal radion beams. His main weapon is his electro-axe. He is a master swordsman and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant forged in hundreds of battles.

Steppenwolf also appears in \\"Death Race to Oblivion\\". He raced on Mongul's behalf against the other heroes and villains for the fate of Earth. After losing the race to Batman, Mongul blasts Steppenwolf for his failure. *Steppenwolf appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Under a Red Sun\\", voiced by Peter Jessop. He is visually depicted similarly to the way he is in STAS. In a plot to become a legend on Apokolips, Steppenwolf transports himself and Superman to a planet where the sun is red. As Superman's powers don't work under a red sun, he had to use every tactic to fight Steppenwolf. After injuring his leg, Superman was able to knock Steppenwolf into the river where Superman subdued him by electrifying the water. By the time Batman and Big Barda track him down, Superman is using his cape as a cast and has a defeated Steppenwolf tied up. =Film= * An alternative universe version of Steppenwolf makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in Justice League: Gods and Monsters.

After he failed to conquer Earth millennia ago after his forces were defeated by an army of humans, Amazons, Atlanteans, the Olympian Gods, and members of the Green Lantern Corps, Steppenwolf was exiled by his nephew and master Darkseid. When the three Mother Boxes that he had used in his original invasion attempt to reactivate in the present day, and with the absence of the Green Lantern Corps, the recent death of Superman, and the factions of the army that had defeated him now drifted apart, Steppenwolf sees the perfect chance of regaining Darkseid's favor and retaking his place on Apokolips. Returning to Earth with what remains of his army, he searches for the Mother Boxes to take over the planet. In his final fight against the Justice League, he overpowers the majority of them with ease, but finds himself to be no match for the resurrected Superman. When Superman's Arctic breath compromises his axe and Wonder Woman destroys it, Steppenwolf gives in to a newfound sense of fear, which his Parademons pick up on. His minions attack and overwhelm him, and they are all sucked up into a boom tube to be teleported back to Apokolips. * Steppenwolf will appear once again in Zack Snyder's Justice League with him appearing in his original design. https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-confirms-original-steppenwolf/ =Video games= * Steppenwolf appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced by Peter Jessop, reprising his role from Justice League Action.

History The Stalwart was a private venture by Alvis that was adopted and entered service with the British Army in 1966 as a general transport truck in preference to the FV431, the load carrier variant of the FV430 series. It was one of the same line of vehicles that included the Alvis Saracen, Saladin and Salamander. The high mobility and amphibious capabilities were considered ideal for resupplying units in the field, particularly those of the British Army of the Rhine. Design The hull is the vehicle chassis, the engine is situated under the load deck in the rear of the hull and the gearboxes with differentials and transfer boxes forward of this. The load deck is open-topped with large drop down panels on either side. Waterproof seals ensure that these will not leak when in the water. The three-person cab has the driver's position in the centre and a seat for a passenger on either side. The cab can only be entered through roof hatches. The Stalwart can carry 5 tonnes of stores, or tow 10 tonnes. In the water it can be driven at about 6 knots by vectored thrust water-jet propulsion units. The drive system, which includes the all-wheel drive, multiple gearboxes, and the water propulsion units, is complex and needed a lot of maintenance. When the amphibious qualities became unnecessary, it was common for the water jets to be removed to reduce weight and maintenance. The Stalwart's over-terrain capabilities come from the fact that the six-wheel-drive system lacks differentials, using simple bevel gears to transmit drive. A centre mounted no-spin differential allows a certain amount of slip between the two sets of wheels on each side of the vehicle on hard surfaces, but there is no allowance for rotational speed differences between front and rear. The centre no-spin unit allows the wheels on either side of the vehicle with most grip to drive when off-road. This has the effect of making the vehicle appear to crab (move from side to side) when negotiating muddy conditions, thus making the Stalwart a true six-wheel-drive vehicle, with three wheels locked together and turning at the same speed. However, this system causes \\"wind up\\" in the transmission (inter-component stress) as all the wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed, which during cornering is impossible. This led to rapid wear and breakage of the tracta joints within the drive train if the vehicle was used on firm surfaces, such as tarmac or concrete - in off-road conditions, the natural 'slip' of a loose surface, such as mud or gravel, reduced wind up. This problem is of special concern for modern-day Stalwart owners - to get a vehicle to a show requires moving it by low-loader or driving it on the road, risking damage to the transmission. Alternatively, the front and rear driveshafts can be removed, eliminating wind up at the expense of off-road capability. During military use, the problem of transmission wind up was solved by laying out railway sleepers (railroad ties) in a grid on flat ground and driving over them on long road moves; this allowed the transmission to unwind. On more than one occasion, servicemen drove Stalwarts into car parks and used the kerbstones separating parking bays for the same purpose. Another problem with the transmission was that the vehicle was designed to be driven loaded. Driving the vehicle unloaded caused increased wear on the drivelines to the wheels as a result of the increased angle of mesh of the joints. Variants Mk1 Alvis Stalwart, showing the early pattern windows Stalwart FV620 ;FV620 Stalwart Mk 1 load carrier Stalwart FV622 ;FV622 Stalwart Mk 2 load carrier. This had a two-man crew although a third seat could be fitted to the right of the driver as a field modification. It could also carry 38 fully equipped troops or the Gloster SARO bulk refueling pack as alternatives to the five tonnes of cargo. The jet drive units in all the Mk 2 variants were much more efficient, giving a claimed 9 knots. The most obvious visible difference between Mk 1 and Mk 2 variants is that the lower edges of the cab windows were now angled downwards rather than horizontal. This was to improve visibility at close-range, particularly when being marshalled by a banksman standing nearby. A total of 970 Mk 2 FV622, FV623 and FV624 Stalwarts were produced, of which the British Army purchased 946, with 24 sold to other countries. Stalwart FV623 ;FV623 Stalwart Mk 2 limber. An artillery ammunition supply vehicle for the Abbot self-propelled gun. There was an extra seat in the cab for the crane operator plus four rear-mounted seats for a seven-man crew. An Atlas 3001/66 hydraulic crane capable of lifting three tons was added to the cargo area to lift palletised loads of ammunition. The rear crew folding seats were separated from the main cargo area by a wooden divider, and protected from inclement weather by two folding PVC hoods on metal hoops. A total of 269 Mk 2 Stalwart limbers were produced. ;FV624 Stalwart Mk 2 REME fitters' vehicle, based on the Mk 2 Stalwart. Two extra rear-mounted seats were added to the main cargo area for a four-man crew. An Atlas 3001 hydraulic crane capable of lifting three tons was added to the cargo area. This differed from that of the FV623 variant by having hydraulic anti-creep check valves fitted. This modified crane was more stable (and safer) for lifting and holding engine, transmission, and other heavy equipment whilst manoeuvring them into position. A total of 60 Mk 2 Stalwart fitters' vehicles were produced. OperatorsMilitary operators= Swedish \\"Amfibiebil 101c\\" (Stalwart Mk 2) * - Austrian Army Pioneers (flood relief): 3 Mk2.

Horgan and Gordon D'Arcy parading the Heineken Cup trophy in 2009 Early life He was born on 18 July 1978 in Bellewstown, County Meath, to an Irish mother, Ursula (n√©e Campbell) from County Kildare whose parents before her originated from Midfield Co. Mayo and a New Zealand father, John. When Horgan was young he played for Boyne RFC. He also played Gaelic football at Minor (U18) level with the Meath county team. He was educated at a boys' Catholic school, St. Mary's Diocesan School in Drogheda, and was active in their rugby team. Horgan joined Lansdowne on leaving school in 1997. Club career Horgan made his debut for Leinster in 1998. He played for Leinster 87 times in the Heineken Cup, ranking fifth in career Heineken Cup appearances. He scored 27 tries during his Heineken Cup career, ranking him fourth on the list of most career tries scored in Heineken Cup competition. His most prolific Heineken Cup season was 2004‚Äì05, when Horgan was the leading try scorer with 8 tries. He was a member of a Leinster backline which included Brian O'Driscoll, Gordon D'Arcy, Denis Hickie, Felipe Contepomi, Isa Nacewa, Rob Kearney and Jonathan Sexton. International career Horgan made his debut for the Ireland senior side against Scotland in the 2000 Six Nations Championship, scoring a try in the process. In the following game against Italy he scored 2 tries and added another one against Wales during the tournament. He was selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. He was used as a substitute during all three tests. After scoring the winning try against England at Twickenham in the 2006 Six Nations Championship to secure the Triple Crown for the second time in three years, he became a new national hero. Horgan added to his following in 2007 when he scored a try against England in Croke Park by executing a Gaelic football style catch from a Ronan O'Gara crossfield kick. Horgan is known by the Irish media and rugby fans as \\"Shaggy\\". Horgan showed a return to something near the levels of performance of his earlier career in early 2011 but injury towards the end of the club season forced him to miss out on the 2011 Rugby World Cup. On 28 March 2012, Horgan announced his retirement with immediate effect having failed to regain full fitness following surgery on a long-term knee injury. Personal life Horgan has three older sisters Maria, Sharon and Lorraine and one younger brother, Mark. He is a second cousin of Jockey Leighton Aspell and his brother Paddy.

From 1986 to 1990 he was the Commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), and Supreme Commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces from 1987 to 1990. In 1990 he founded the New Aspiration Party which he led until 2002. He was Thailand's 22nd Prime Minister from 1996 to 1997. At various times he has held the positions of Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Labour and Leader of the Opposition.  Education and military career  Chavalit is of Sino-Thai, Lao, and Persian descent. His father was an infantry captain. Chavalit attended Triam Udom Suksa School and graduated from Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, being appointed second lieutenant in 1953. He served in the RTA Signal Corps and completed advanced training courses at the RTA Signal Corps School, as well as at Fort Monmouth, a US Army Signal Corps School, and with the US IX Corps in Okinawa. In 1963 he graduated from the RTA Command and General Staff College, and one year later from the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. During the 1960s and 1970s, Chavalit served in the communist insurgency suppression campaign in the jungles of Thailand, and prepared Thai soldiers for their operations in the Vietnam War. During the period after the October 1973 popular uprising, he was considered close to the Thahan Prachathippatai (\\"Democratic Soldiers\\") group, even though he did not openly identify as a member of the group. In 1979, Chavalit was promoted to major-general and Director of Army Operations. Intending to outwit Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) guerillas, he created the pro-government Thahan Phran (\\"hunter soldiers\\"), paramilitary units who would use guerilla tactics against the CPT. They took over a significant share of the army's counterinsurgency missions by 1982. However, Chavalit believed that the communists could not be defeated by purely military means, but that combating the political, economic and social causes of the insurgency was also necessary to destroy their popular support. He helped to author cabinet orders 66/2523 (1980) and 65/2525 (1982) of Prem Tinsulanonda's government, which offered amnesty and a return to civil life to surrendering communist fighters. The orders contributed significantly to the demise of the CPT and the end of the insurgency. In 1982, Chavalit was promoted to lieutenant-general and assistant chief-of-staff, and one year later deputy chief-of-staff of the army. Chavalit's rise to the army's top posts was unusual for a signal corps officer, as its leading positions were traditionally reserved for infantrymen, artillerymen, and \\"cavalrymen\\" (i.e., tankers). He owed his exceptional career partly to his close relationship to Prime Minister Prem, being one of his core supporters in the army, but also to his military, strategic, and political acumen. In 1986 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the RTA, and one year later the supreme commander of the armed forces. Under his leadership, the army began projects for rural development. These included the Isan Khiao (\\"Green Isan\\") programme in the underdeveloped northeastern region, and the Khwam Wang Mai (\\"New Hope\\") programme in the conflict-ridden southern provinces. These projects were based on the ideas of the former \\"Democratic Soldiers\\" and cabinet order no. 66/2523: that economic development and relief of regional disparities involved national security, and were therefore tasks for the army. Also printed in For these projects Chavalit provided large corporations with lucrative contracts, including the leading Thai agribusiness corporation Charoen Pokphand. Chavalit retired from military service in 1990, at the age of 58. Political career Chavalit began his political activity while still serving in the military. From 1984 to 1987, during the \\"Semi-Democratic\\" phase, he was an appointed member of the Senate. In 1987 he publicly proposed to have a prime minister directly elected by the people; he was accused of attempting to undermine the monarchy's role, temporarily discrediting his public image. In 1990 he was appointed Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the administration of Chatichai Choonhavan. During the early 1990s, Chavalit controlled 126 military-run radio stations and two of the country's five television networks. Chavalit agreed to make military stations available for an anti-AIDS campaign. He also agreed to help Meechai Viravaidya spearhead a three-year blitz to halt the spread of the disease. In 1990, he launched his own party, the New Aspiration Party. His plan was to make it a dominant ruling party, modelled on the Golkar party of Indonesia's President Suharto. The party was backed by the Charoen Pokphand group and its chairman Dhanin Chearavanont. Chavalit used contacts from his time as army commander and head of the \\"Green Isan\\" programme to recruit former soldiers, civil servants, and local officials in the Northeast as members of his party. In March 1992, Chavalit was elected a member of the House of Representatives for a constituency in Nonthaburi Province. Being the leader of the largest non-government coalition party, he was sworn in as Leader of the Opposition. He then served as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Chuan Leekpai from 1992 to 1994, and was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the government of Banharn Silpa- archa from 1995 to 1996. Premiership Following the Royal Decree of Parliament Closure a general election was held on 17 November 1996. Chavalit's New Aspiration Party won the most seats. With the support of five coalition parties‚ÄîNational Development, Social Action, Thai Citizens', Liberal Integrity and Mass Party‚ÄîChavalit was appointed by royal decree as the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand on 25 November 1996. However, during his premiership he encountered pressure from many political movements, who forced him to resign on 6 November 1997, in the midst of the Asian financial crisis. On 14 May and 15 May 1997, the Thai baht, which was then pegged to the US dollar, was hit by massive speculative attacks. Chavalit announced he would not devalue the baht, but in July 1997 the government had no choice but to devalue the currency. This sparked the Asian financial crisis, due to the Thai government's failure to defend the baht against international speculators. At the time, Thailand had acquired a burden of foreign debt that made the country effectively bankrupt even before the collapse of its currency. Thailand's booming economy ground to a halt amidst massive layoffs in finance, real estate, and construction, resulting in huge numbers of workers returning to their villages in the countryside and 600,000 foreign workers being sent back to their home countries. The baht devalued swiftly and lost more than half of its value, and the Thai stock market dropped 75% in 1997. Due to this crisis, Chavalit stepped down in November 1997. According to some observers, King Bhumibol Adulyadej distrusted Chavalit as he saw him as a threat to his so-called \\"network monarchy\\", an informal alliance of politicians and officials favoured by the palace.  Later life  Chavalit then once again became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. The New Aspiration Party quickly lost popularity, as well as the support of the Charoen Pokphand Group, which began supporting Thaksin Shinawatra and his new Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT). After New Aspiration's electoral defeat in 2001, Chavalit abandoned it and switched over to the TRT, taking most party members and lawmakers with him. Subsequently, Chavalit served as Deputy Prime Minister responsible for internal security under Thaksin's premiership from 2001 to 2005 and as Minister of Defence from 2001 to 2002. After holding the position of deputy prime minister in Somchai Wongsawat's cabinet, on 7 October 2008, he resigned, admitting partial responsibility for violence because of police use of tear gas at a Parliament blockade, injuring 116 protesters. His resignation letter stated: \\"Since this action did not achieve what I planned, I want to show my responsibility for this operation.\\"reuters.com, 6-Thai deputy PM quits after Bangkok clashesap.google.com, Thai deputy prime minister resigns bloomberg.com, Thai deputy prime minister resigns On 2 October 2009, Chavalit joined the Pheu Thai Party, which is composed of loyalists to Thaksin Shinawatra.

He reigned from 1881 to 1943. He was the son of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Mukarram Shah and Wan Hajar. During his reign, the Sultan had asked for a $2,500,000 loan from Siam during a state financial crisis in 1905. The loan was extended with the proviso that a Financial Advisor from the court of Siam be accepted and a State Council be created to assist the Sultan in the administration of all public affairs. This resulted in the promulgation of a new constitution on 29 July 1905. The state council were run by his brothers followed by their sons. The formation of the State Council thus curbed the Sultan's administrative powers. His reign marked the transition from Siamese suzerainty over Kedah to the British Protectorate of Unfederated Malay States following the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. The Sultan had several wives and partners; Che Manjelara, Che Sofiah, Sharifah Fatimah Binti Syed Idrus, Sharifah Seha Binti Syed Hussein, Che Spachendra, Sharifah Mariam and Che Laraseh. The Sultan's seventh son and twentieth child with Makche Manjelara, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who would later become the first Prime Minister of Malaysia.

This building was destroyed due to attacks by the Bugis armada (1770) and Siamese (1821). The refurbishment was spearheaded by Muhammad bin Lebai Tambi, an architect with the Public Works Department of Kedah State. The wedding ceremony of the Sultan's five princes and princesses was held here in 1904 and the celebrations were carried out over a 90-day period. Besides the wedding ceremony, the Balai Besar was also used for installation ceremonies, and State Council Conferences from 1905 until 1973. Balai Nobat Sultan Abdul Hamid also built a new building for the Balai Nobat using concrete and metal in 1906. The architecture is the same as the previous wooden building. The height was three-story and the dome at its apex represents the Islamic element such as those found on mosques. It was during Sultan Abdul Hamid's reign that Masjid Zahir was officially opened on Friday, 15 October 1915. The Sultan also led the Friday prayers on the auspicious day. The architecture of the mosque was inspired by the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura, Langkat Sultanate (present-day North Sumatra). This mosque is enhanced with five prime large domes symbolising the Five Pillars of Islam.

It was first released in 1989 and had its last update in 1993.. It runs on top of the Human68k disk operating system, similarly to how Windows 3.1 runs on top of MS-DOS. History SX-Window was introduced for X68000 in 1989, and came preinstalled on the X68000 EXPERT model. It was developed by Hudson. The final release was 3.1 in 1993. In 2000, Sharp released the system software for the X68000 into the public domain, including SX-Window. Technical details The look and feel of the GUI is like that of the NeXTSTEP operating system, and its API is similar to the Macintosh Toolbox. It uses non-preemptive multitasking with the event-driven paradigm.

The festival date is set with the solar cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, as the first day of the Tamil month Chithirai. It therefore falls on or about 14 April every year on the Gregorian calendar. The same day is observed by Hindus elsewhere as the traditional new year, but is known by other names such as Vishu in Kerala, and Vaisakhi or Baisakhi in central and northern India. On this day, Tamil people greet each other by saying \\"PuthƒÅa·πádu vƒÅazhthugal!\\" () or \\"I·πâiya puthaandu nalvƒÅazhthugal!\\" (), which is equivalent to \\"Happy new year\\". The day is observed as a family time. Households clean up the house, prepare a tray with fruits, flowers and auspicious items, light up the family Puja altar and visit their local temples. People wear new clothes and children go to elders to pay their respects and seek their blessings, then the family sits down to a vegetarian feast. Puthandu is also celebrated by Tamil Hindus outside Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, such as in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Reunion, Mauritius and other countries with Tamil diaspora., Quote: \\"The key festivals celebrated by Sri Lankan Tamils in Canada include Thai Pongal (harvest festival) in January, Puthuvarusham (Tamil/Hindu New Year) in April, and Deepavali (Festival of Lights) in October/November.\\" Origin and significance A traditional arrangement of festive foods for Puthandu. The Tamil New Year follows the spring equinox and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. The day celebrates on the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The same date is observed as the traditional new year in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tripura, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka also celebrate the same day as their new year, likely an influence of the shared culture between South and Southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE. There are several references in early Tamil literature to the April new year. Nakkirar, Sangam period author of the Ne·π≠unalvƒÅ·π≠ai, wrote that the sun travels from Mesha/Chitterai through 11 successive signs of the zodiac.JV Chelliah: Pattupattu: Ten Tamil Idylls.

There were subsequent inscriptional references in Pagan, Burma dated to the 11th century CE and in Sukhothai, Thailand dated to the 14th century CE to South Indian, often Vaishnavite, courtiers who were tasked with defining the traditional calendar that began in mid-April.G.H. Luce, Old Burma ‚Äì Early Pagan, Locust Valley, New York, Page 68, and A.B. Griswold, 'Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art, Bangkok 1967, pages 12‚Äì32 Celebration Tamil people celebrate Puthandu, also called Puthuvarusham, as the traditional \\"Tamil/Hindu New Year\\", states Peter Reeves. This is the month of Chittirai, the first month of the Tamil solar calendar, and Puthandu typically falls on 14 April. In some parts of Southern Tamil Nadu, the festival is called Chittirai Vishu. On the eve of Puthandu, a tray arranged with three fruits (mango, banana and jack fruit), betel leaves and arecanut, gold/silver jewellery, coins/money, flowers and a mirror. This is similar to the Vishu new year festival ceremonial tray in Kerala. According to the Tamil tradition, this festive tray is auspicious as the first sight upon waking on the new year day. Home entrances are decorated elaborately with colored rice powder. These designs are called kolams. In the temple city of Madurai, the Chitterai Thiruvizha is celebrated in the Meenakshi Temple. A huge exhibition is held, called Chitterai Porutkaatchi. On the day of the Tamil New Year, a big Car Festival is held at Tiruvidaimarudur near Kumbakonam. Festivals are also held at Tiruchirapalli, Kanchipuram and other places. Tamil Hindus decorate their homes with various auspicious colorful geometric designs from rice powder called Kolam. Sri Lankan Tamils observe the traditional new year in April with the first financial transaction known as the Kai-vishesham. In this transaction children go to elders to pay their respect, and elders give their blessings and gift pocket money to the children in return. The event is also observed with the 'arpudu' or the first ploughing of the ground to prepare for the new agricultural cycle. The game of 'por-thenkai' or coconut wars between youth is played in villages through the Tamil north and east of the island while cart races are also held. The festive Puthandu season in April is a time for family visits and the renewal of filial bonds.Sivanandini Duraiswamy, Remembering Hindu Traditions, M.D. Gunasena and Co Ltd, 1997, pages 41‚Äì48. It coincides with the Sinhalese new year season. Later in the day, families enjoy a feast. A special dish called Mangai-pachadi is prepared from a variety of flavors, similar to pacchadi of new year foods of Ugadi and Vishu.A new year, and flavours to match, Ranjani Ranjendra, The Hindu (23 March 2017) It is made from sweet jaggery, astringent mustard, sour raw mango, bitter neem, and red chilies. These complex dish is ritually tasted by Tamils, as similar multi-flavors are by Hindus elsewhere on the new year. Such traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them. In Malaysia and Singapore, Tamils join Sikhs, Malayalees and Bengalis to celebrate the traditional new year in mid-April with leaders across the political spectrum wishing the ethnic Indian community for the new year. Special religious events are held in Hindu temples, in Tamil community centers and Gurdwaras. Cultural programs and media events also take place. Its a day of celebration for the Indian community.http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/4/15/nation/12971969&sec;=nationhttp://www.singaporeunited.sg/cep/index.php/web/News- Room/PM-Lee-celebrates-Tamil-New-Year The 2019 Tamil New Year name is ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æ∞‡ØÄ ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æø. Controversy A Puthandu decoration at a Hindu temple The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Government of Tamil Nadu had declared in 2008 that the Tamil new year should be celebrated on the first day of Tamil month of Thai (14 January) coinciding with the harvest festival of Pongal. The Tamil Nadu New Year (Declaration Bill 2008) was enacted as the state law by the DMK assembly members and its Tamil Nadu Government on 29 January 2008. This law of the DMK majority-led government was subsequently rescinded by a separate act of legislation in the Tamil Nadu Assembly with an AIADMK majority-led government on 23 August 2011. Many in Tamil Nadu ignored the DMK government legislation that rescheduled the festival date, and continued the celebration of their traditional Puthandu new year festival in mid-April. The Governor and Chief Minister of the Indian Union Territory of Puducherry, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, felicitated the public for the Tamil new year in April 2010. The legislative reach to change the traditional religious new year by the DMK government was questioned by Hindu priests and Tamil scholars. The law was met with resistance by Tamils in the state and elsewhere. It was also challenged in court. The then opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) in Tamil Nadu subsequently condemned the decision of the DMK Government in that state and urged their supporters to continue celebrating the traditional date in mid-April. Tamils in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and Canada continued to observe the new year in mid-April. The previous state government in Tamil Nadu in an effort to placate popular sentiment announced that the same day will be celebrated as a new festival renamed as \\"Chithirai Tirunal\\" (the festival of Chithirai). The day remained a public holiday in Tamil Nadu under the DMK government, but not as Tamil new year, but purportedly to commemorate Dr. B.R Ambedkar, who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of Indian Constitution. All television channels in Tamil Nadu, including the pro-DMK Sun TV, continued to telecast festive \\"Chithirai Tirunal Special Programs\\" on 14 April 2010. The leader of the AIADMK, Jayalalitha refused to recognize the repackaged festival, and felicitated the Tamil people for the traditional Tamil New Year. The MDMK leader Vaiko, followed suit. The controversy between the two dates subsided, the official celebrations during the traditional new year in April revived and the public holiday as the Tamil New Year restored. Related festivals The Puthandu new year day is celebrated elsewhere but referred to by other names. For example, it is called Vaisakhi by Hindus and Sikhs in north and central India, which too marks the solar new year.Crump, William D. (2014), Encyclopedia of New Year's Holidays Worldwide, MacFarland, page 114 Some examples include: #Vishu in Kerala #Vaisakhi in central and north India #Pohela Sankranti in Odisha #Pohela Boishakh in West Bengal and Tripura, as well as Bangladesh #Rongali Bihu in Assam #Bikram Samwat / Vaishak Ek in Nepal #Aluth Avuruthu in Sri Lanka (Sinhalese New Year festival). However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For others, the new year falls on Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, which falls a few weeks before Puthandu. =Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka= The same day every year is the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of Southeast Asia such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE. According to a 1957 publication by Gunasegaram, the new year celebrated in Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Champa (Vietnam) is the Tamil New Year with roots in the practices of Mohenjo-daro (Indus Valley Civilization).Tamil cultural influences in South East Asia (1957) by Samuel Jeyanayagam Gunasegaram, Ceylon Printers p.18Tamil Culture, Band 6 (1957), Academy of Tamil Culture p.79 According to Nanacuriyan, this may be from the medieval era Tamil influence in Southeast Asia.An introduction to Tamil culture, Kirusna Nanacuriyan (1984), Institute for International Tamil Renaissance p.81 According to Jean Michaud and other scholars, the new year celebration traditions in Southeast Asian Massif have two roots. One is China, and this influence is found for example in Vietnam and southeastern China. These Sino- influenced communities celebrate the new year in the first or second lunar month after the winter solstice in December. The second group of people in the Massif celebrate the new year in mid April, much like most of India. This group consists of northeastern Indians, northeastern Myanmar, Tai speakers of Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam and southern Yunnan. The festival is celebrated in the Massif in some ways unlike Puthandu. It is marked by an occasion to visit family and friends, splashing others with water (like Holi), drinking alcohol, as well as later wearing jewelry, new clothes and socializing. The new year festival is called regionally by different names: #Aluth Avuruthu in Sri Lanka (Sinhalese New Year). #Chol Chnam Thmey in Cambodia #Songkan / Pi Mai Lao in Laos #Songkran in Thailand #Thingyan in Burma See also *Tamil culture References Category:Festivals in India Category:New Year in India Category:April observances Category:Festivals in Tamil Nadu Category:Public holidays in Sri Lanka Category:Tamil festivals ","title":"Puthandu"},{"id":"2014595","text":"Humor Risk, also known as Humorisk, is a lost unreleased 1921 silent comedy short film that was the first film to star the Marx Brothers. The print may have been accidentally thrown away when left in the screening box overnight.Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers (Hardcover), Simon Louvish. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition (2000). Another version of the story says that Groucho Marx, unhappy with the film's quality, intentionally burned the negative after a particularly bad premiere screening. Humor Risk was directed by comedy film director Dick Smith (1886-1937), and was the first film written by Jo Swerling, who later co-wrote It's a Wonderful Life, Gone with the Wind and many other films. It was filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The film's title was a spoof of the Fannie Hurst drama Humoresque, one of the biggest film hits of 1920. The Marx Brothers would finally find success in motion pictures with The Cocoanuts (1929). Cast Four of the five Marx Brothers are known to have been in this short film. Jobyna Ralston is most often mentioned as the female lead. However, some sources say that Mildred Davis‚Äîstar and later wife of Harold Lloyd‚Äîwas also in the film.

Harpo played the hero, a detective named Watson who \\"made his entrance in a high hat, sliding down a coal chute into the basement\\". Groucho played an \\"old movie\\" villain, who \\"sported a long moustache and was clad in black\\", while Chico was probably his \\"chuckling [Italian] henchman\\". Zeppo portrayed a playboy who was the owner of a nightclub in which most of the action took place, including \\"a cabaret, [which allowed] the inclusion of a dance number\\".

Before becoming Lord Mayor in 2017 he was a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from September 2001 to October 2014, representing the Darwin-based electorate of Casuarina. He was Minister for Business and Economic Development, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Defence Support, Minister for Sport and Recreation, Minister for Essential Services, Minister for Health, Minister for Mines and Energy, Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries and Minister for Children and Families. On 30 July 2014, Vatskalis announced that he would be resigning from the Legislative Assembly at the end of the August sittings, which triggered a 2014 Casuarina by-election. In the 2017 local government elections in the Northern Territory, Vatskalis was elected Lord Mayor of Darwin. Early years Vatskalis was born in Greece, and studied public health in Athens. He became involved in student politics while there, becoming a student representative at the Athens Higher Vocational School and taking part in the 1970s pro-democracy protests, where he witnessed people being arrested for speaking freely. He married an Australian woman, Linda Cotton in 1982, and in 1983, they emigrated to Western Australia. Once they had arrived in Perth, Vatskalis found that his Greek qualifications were not recognised, and was forced to start again, beginning a degree in environmental health at Curtin University, where he also joined the Labor Party. After graduating in 1985, he worked as an environmental health officer and surveyor in the Western Australian towns of Port Hedland and Wanneroo from 1986 to 1993. This period was also marked by personal tragedy, however; his wife died in 1988. In 1992, not long before leaving Western Australia, Vatskalis completed post-graduate studies this time in environmental science from Murdoch University. In 1993, Vatskalis secured a job managing the NT Health Department's Darwin Environmental Health Unit, which meant relocating to the Northern Territory. He quickly became involved in Darwin's multicultural community, taking up a position hosting a Greek community radio show the same year, and going on to present a weekly nationwide Greek news segment on SBS Radio. Vatskalis also served a stint on the Northern Territory Police's Ethnic Advisory Committee. Election to parliament Vatskalis left the Environmental Health Unit in 1999, taking up a position at Danila Dilba, the indigenous health service in Darwin. However, this was to be short-lived, as he soon nominated for Labor Party pre-selection to contest the seat of Casuarina at the 2001 election. Vatskalis was successful in gaining preselection, but was not widely expected to be elected. Not only had the ALP ever won Casuarina, but Vatskalis was facing incumbent MP and Arts, Sciences and Ethnic Affairs Minister Peter Adamson. However, in an unexpected result, a massive Labor wave swept through Darwin, allowing the party to win government for the first time ever. Notably, Labor took every seat in the northern portion of the capital‚Äîamong them Casuarina, for the first time ever. Vatskalis took the seat on a swing of 13 percent. Initial success as a minister Though he had not even been tipped to win the seat, Vatskalis was immediately appointed to the ministry upon entering parliament, with new Chief Minister Clare Martin selecting him as her Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, Housing, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. He sparked brief controversies in October and November, when he oversaw the sale of a large public housing complex in Alice Springs and then attempts at compulsorily acquiring homes in Berry Springs, which were dumped after a public outcry. Despite these hiccups, he was widely seen to be an effective minister, and was subsequently appointed to three additional portfolios‚ÄîTransport, Infrastructure and Essential Services in a reshuffle on 16 November. He also began to win praise from several sectors over his handling of a number of issues, including opening up a large number of new housing blocks and both introducing speed limits on the Lasseter Highway and funding road repair projects in an attempt to curb the number of road deaths. He was also responsible for closing Darwin's Lake Leanyer after a coronial inquest into a death there. In February 2002, the Northern Territory News suggested that Vatskalis had \\"consistently been one of the Government's better performers\\", though they also criticised him for not appointing \\"new blood\\" to his departments. The usually conservative tabloid made similar comments in their report on the performance of the Martin ministry on the first anniversary of the election in August, suggesting that he had \\"impressed observers with his willingness to confront his new responsibilities.\\" Difficulties and demotion It was around this point, however, where Vatskalis' initial positive stint ended, and he began to face serious difficulties in his position. He was criticised for the sacking without explanation of one of the Territory's most senior public servants, the head of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Dr Bill Freeland, and had recurring problems surrounding the planned gas plant at Wickham Point on Darwin Harbour. As the contracts had already been signed by the Burke Country Liberal Party government, Vatskalis had little choice but to continue supporting the construction of the gas plant, despite significant pressure from angry community groups. In October 2002, Vatskalis had to be placed under police protection when he received death threats from residents angry over a decision to approve the construction of a private school in a suburban street. In January 2003, Vatskalis‚Äîallegedly unilaterally‚Äîbanned flights over the Katherine Gorge, but was forced to remove the ban less than a month later after a public outcry. He also became embroiled in a nasty stoush with the taxi industry over planned reforms, clashed with environmentalists over land- clearing around the Daly River area, and was the subject of a damaging A Current Affair report over his handling of the impact on pastoralists from the Alice Springs‚ÄìDarwin Railway. These controversies were amplified by a personal scandal in August 2003, when Vatskalis was found to be offering paid translation services over the internet while an MP. Not long after, the Northern Territory media reported a number of concerns about a taxpayer-funded trip taken by Vatskalis and Chief Minister Martin in August‚ÄìSeptember. While he had also had some successes in this period, cracking down on antisocial behavior by youths in cars, forcing licenses upon the building industry after a series of scams, and attempting to convince the federal government to hand Kakadu National Park back to the NT government‚Äîa move soon supported by MPs on both sides of NT politics‚Äîthe series of incidents throughout 2003 had severely tarnished Vatskalis' reputation. December 2003 Ministerial reshuffle In the December 2003 ministerial reshuffle sparked by the axing of Health Minister Jane Aagaard, Vatskalis was severely demoted, losing all his portfolios except Ethnic Affairs, and being given the new responsibilities of Mines and Energy and Primary Industries and Fisheries. Although the reshuffle had seen Vatskalis demoted, the new portfolios allowed him to move away from the areas in which he had been under siege. In his new portfolio, he signed several new resource exploration permits and launched several programs attempting to promote the Northern Territory to mining companies, in the hope of boosting the industry. He launched a significant shakeup of mining laws, blocked proposals to create a second mine in the Kakadu National Park, and oversaw the proposal to clean up the environmental damage from the abandoned Mount Todd gold mine, near Katherine. In 2006 he instigated the \\"China and Japan Investment attraction strategy\\" targeting China and Japan for the Territory's mineral resources. He led a number of delegations to China and presented the Territory's mineral wealth to mining companies and investors in China. This led to the attraction of significant investment in the mining sector by Chinese companies making China the number 1 trade partner of the territory. The success of this strategy was highlighted by the 2010 Darwin visit of the then Vice President (and current President) of China Xi Jinping.Vatskalis also won favour from the recreational fishing community, banning commercial fishing in the Adelaide River and rejecting proposals to introduce fishing licenses in the Territory. Vatskalis faced his first electoral test at the 2005 election, and despite having won the seat from the CLP for the first time ever in 2001, was easily elected with a massive swing in his favour,2005 Election results amidst a landslide result across the Territory.CLP suffers crushing Territory defeat He comfortably retained the seat again in 2008, albeit with a 4.2% swing against him, but still holding a 14% majority.2008 results Another cabinet reshuffle on 4 February 2009 saw Vatskalis take the Government's Health portfolio from Dr Chris Burns while remaining the Minister for Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources.NT health, education ministers dumped In December 2009 he added the child protection portfolio to his duties.Chief Minister reshuffles his Cabinet again ReferencesExternal links * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Darwin Category:Greek emigrants to Australia Category:Curtin University alumni Category:Murdoch University alumni Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Kon Vatskalis"},{"id":"2014626","text":"The Mask Trilogy refers to three award-winning German-style board games designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling.

Some of the Sabbath are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon.

After the first season in the top level Col√≥n finished 16th,Argentina 1966 on RSSSF but the following year the structure of Argentine football was changed so as there were two championships each season, the Metropolitano and the Nacional, with entrance to the latter originally only available to the higher placed Metropolitano teams. Colon did not qualify for the Nacional until 1968, although the squad did then managed a 6th place finish. Col√≥n finished 2nd in their group in the 1972 Nacional. In 1975 the team made a good campaign in the Metropolitano, finishing in 6th place. This got better two years later, when Col√≥n finished 5th in the Metropolitano, although the team then struggled in the Nacional. In 1978 Col√≥n reached the knockout stages of the Nacional but was beaten in the quarter-finals by Independiente. Colon was relegated from the Metropolitana in 1981 having won only 6 games that season It was to take 14 years for Col√≥n to return to the top division (for the 1995‚Äì96 season). During the intervening period the team came close to promotion on a number of occasions, and lost Promotion Play-off games in 1988‚Äì89 to arch-rivals Union 3‚Äì0 on aggregate, and in 1992‚Äì93 Col√≥n lost the championship play-off, being defeated by Banfield and then failed to qualify through the secondary play-offs. After a few mid- table finishes Col√≥n was placed 2nd in the 1997 Clausura tournament, which is team's highest placed finish to date. As River Plate won both titles that season, a play-off was required between the two runners-up. In December 1997 Col√≥n defeated Independiente 1‚Äì0 to qualify for the Copa Libertadores 1998.

The drillship was designed by Global Marine Inc. (now Transocean Inc.) specifically for a long term contract with the American National Science Foundation and University of California Scripps Institution of Oceanography and built by Levingston Shipbuilding Company in Orange, Texas.Ocean Drilling Program: Glomar Challenger drillship Launched on March 23, 1968, the vessel was owned and operated by the Global Marine Inc. corporation. Glomar Challenger was given its name as a tribute to the accomplishments of the oceanographic survey vessel . Glomar is a truncation of Global Marine.  Accomplishments  Starting from August 1968, the ship was embarked on a 15-year-long scientific expedition, the Deep Sea Drilling Program, criss-crossing the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa and drilling core samples at specific locations. When the age of the samples was determined by paleontologic and isotopic dating studies, this provided conclusive evidence for the seafloor spreading hypothesis, and, consequently, for plate tectonics. During 1970, when doing research in the Mediterranean Sea while supervised by Kenneth Hsu, geologists aboard the vessel brought up drill cores containing gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater. These were the first solid evidence for the ancient desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, the Messinian salinity crisis.  Scrapping  After being operated for fifteen years, Glomar Challenger's active duty was ended during November 1983 and she was later scrapped. Her successor, JOIDES Resolution, was launched during 1985. The ship was a success in collecting rock samples and helped to confirm the Messinian Salinity Crisis theory.  Purpose  Glomar Challenger was made to help Harry Hess with the theory of Seafloor Spreading by taking rock samples confirming that the farther from the Mid-ocean ridge, the older the rock was.

The prince asked for a drink of water and made a gesture of spitting jewels into the vessel. The princess was captivated by his beauty. Her sea deity father recognized him as the descendant of the heavenly gods and arranged a banquet. Toyotama married the prince, and they lived in the place for three years., pp. 121‚Äì122 At the end of three years, Toyotama's husband let out a sigh and revealed his unfinished quest for the lost fish hook, which needed to be returned to his brother.

The mosque's name is also variably rendered as Jami' al- Kutubiyah, Kutubiya Mosque, Kutubiyyin Mosque, and Mosque of the Booksellers. It is located in the southwest medina quarter of Marrakesh, near the famous public place of Jemaa el-Fna, and is flanked by large gardens. The mosque was founded in 1147 by the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min right after he conquered Marrakesh from the Almoravids. A second version of the mosque was entirely rebuilt by Abd al-Mu'min around 1158, with Ya'qub al-Mansur possibly finalizing construction of the minaret around 1195. This second mosque is the structure that stands today. It is considered a classic and important example of Almohad architecture and of Moroccan mosque architecture generally. The minaret tower, in height, is decorated with varying geometric arch motifs and topped by a spire and metal orbs. It likely inspired other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat, which were built shortly after in the same era.Hattstein, Markus and Delius, Peter (eds.)

Geography Jemaa el-Fnaa with the Kutubiyya's minaret in the distance (circa 1930-31). Koubba of Lalla Zohra. The mosque is located about west of the city‚Äôs the Jemaa El Fna souq, a prominent market place which has existed since the city's establishment. It is situated on the Avenue Mohammed V, opposite Place de Foucauld. During French occupation, the network of roads was developed with the mosque as the central landmark, in the ville nouvelle. To the west and south of the mosque is a notable rose garden, and across Avenue Houmman-el-Fetouaki is the small mausoleum of the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin, one of the great builders of Marrakesh, consisting of a simple crenelated structure. In the mosque's esplanade, which backs onto Jemaa el Fna, the ruins of the first Kutubiyya Mosque can be seen. A part of the perimeter of the Ksar al-Hajjar, the original stone fortress built in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the Almoravid founder of the city, was also uncovered on the northern side of the original mosque. Also visible today at the northeast corner of these ruins is a part of Bab 'Ali, the monumental stone gate of Ali ibn Yusuf's former palace which was completed in 1126 next to the fortress before being demolished by the Almohads to make way for their new mosque. Also on the same esplanade is a small white domed building, the Koubba (or Qubba) of Lalla Zohra. This is the tomb of Fatima Zohra bint al-Kush (also called Lalla Zohra), a female mystic who died in the early 17th century and was buried here near the mosque.  Origin of name  All the names and spellings of Kutubiyya Mosque, including Jami' al- Kutubiyah, Kotoubia, Kutubiya, and Kutubiyyin, are based on the Arabic word kutubiyyin (), which means \\"booksellers\\". The Koutoubia Mosque, or Bookseller's Mosque, reflects the honorable bookselling trade practiced in the nearby souk. At one time as many as 100 book vendors worked in the streets at the base of the mosque. History left = Almohad conquest and reform of Marrakesh = alt= Almoravid minbar, commissioned by Ali Bin Yusuf Bin Tashfin al-Murabiti 1137 for his great mosque in Marrakesh (the Ben Youssef Mosque), now partially restored and held at the Badi Palace. The city of Marrakesh was founded around 1070 by the Almoravid dynasty to be their capital, but was captured in 1147 by the Almohads under their leader Abd al-Mu'min. While the Almohads decided to make Marrakesh their capital too, they did not want any trace of religious monuments built by the Almoravids, their staunch enemies, as they considered them heretics. They reportedly demolished all the mosques in the city, including the main mosque, the Ben Youssef Mosque, arguing that the Almoravid mosques were not aligned with the proper qibla (direction of prayer). Since the former Almoravid grand mosque (i.e. the original Ben Youssef Mosque) was already closely integrated into the surrounding urban fabric, it was not practical for the Almohads to rebuild an entirely new mosque with a significantly different orientation on the same site. It's possible that they did not even demolish the mosque but merely left it derelict. The Almohads may have also wished to have the city's main mosque located closer to the kasbah and royal palaces, as was common in other Islamic cities. As a result, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build the new mosque right next to the former Almoravid kasbah, the Ksar el-Hajjar, which became the site of the new Almohad royal palace, located west of the city's main square (what is today the Jemaa el-Fnaa).  The question of the Almohad versus Almoravid qibla alignement  The issue of the qibla alignement of the Kutubiyya and other Almohad mosques (and even of medieval Islamic mosques generally) is a complex one which is often misunderstood. The justification given by the Almohads for the destruction of existing Almoravid mosques was that their qibla was aligned too far to the east, which the Almohads judged to be incorrect as they preferred a tradition that existed in the western Islamic world (the Maghreb and al-Andalus) according to which the qibla should be oriented towards the south instead. This alignment was actually further away from the \\"true\\" qibla which points directly towards Mecca and which is used in modern mosques everywhere today. Qibla orientations varied throughout the medieval period of Morocco but the Almohads generally followed an orientation between 154¬∞ and 159¬∞ (numbers expressed as the azimuth from the true north), whereas the \\"true\\" qibla (i.e. the exact direction of Mecca) in Marrakesh is 91¬∞ (nearly due east). This true qibla was eventually adopted in modern times and is evident in more recent mosques including the current Ben Youssef Mosque which was rebuilt in 1819 with a qibla of 88¬∞ (slightly too far north but very close). The Almohad qibla was similar to the qibla orientation of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Qarawiyyin Mosque of Fes, both founded at an early period in the late 8th to 9th centuries. This traditional qibla was based on a saying (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad which stated that \\"What is between the east and west is a qibla\\" (most likely in reference to his time in Medina, north of Mecca), which thus legitimized southern alignments. This practice may also have sought to emulate the orientation of the walls of the rectangular Kaaba building inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, based on another tradition which considered the different sides of the Kaaba as being associated with different parts of the Muslim world. In this tradition the northwest face of the Kaaba was associated with al-Andalus and, accordingly, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was oriented towards the southeast as if facing the Kaaba's northwestern facade, with its main axis parallel to the main axis of the Kaaba structure (which was oriented from southeast to northwest). This architectural alignment was typically achieved by using astronomical alignments to reproduce the appropriate orientation of the Kaaba itself, whose minor axis is aligned with the direction of sunrise at the summer solstice. That being said, medieval Muslims did in fact possess sufficient mathematical knowledge to calculate a reasonably accurate \\"true\\" qibla pointing directly towards Mecca. A more easterly qibla orientation (which points approximately towards Mecca) was already evident in the royal mosque of Madinat al-Zahra (just outside Cordoba) built later in the 10th century, as well as in the orientation of the original Almoravid Ben Youssef Mosque (founded in 1126), estimated to be 103¬∞. The Almohads, who rose to power after these periods, apparently chose a qibla orientation which they saw as more ancient or traditional, or as emulating the prestigious Great Mosque of Cordoba. Whether their interpretation of the qibla was a true and rigorously followed directive or a mostly symbolic argument to differentiate themselves from the Almoravids is still questioned by scholars. = The first Kutubiyya Mosque = Remains of the mihrab area of the first Kutubiyya Mosque, on the exterior northern wall of the current mosque. Abd al- Mu'min began construction of the first Kutubiyya Mosque in 1147, the same year that he had conquered the city. Adjoined to the walls of the former Almoravid kasbah, the mosque may have also been built on top of some of the former Almoravid palace's annexes and maybe even over a royal cemetery or mausoleum. The date of the first mosque's completion is unconfirmed, but is estimated by historians to have been around 1157, when it is known with some certainty that prayers were conducted in the mosque. It was in 1157 that a celebrated copy of the Qur'an attributed to the hand of Caliph Uthman, previously kept in the Great Mosque of Cordoba, was transferred to the mosque. Abd al-Mu'min also transferred to his mosque the famous Almoravid minbar of the Ben Youssef Mosque, originally commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf from a workshop in Cordoba. The mosque was likely connected to the adjacent royal palace via a passage (sabat) which allowed the Almohad caliph to enter it directly from his palace without having to pass through the public entrances (not unlike a similar passage which existed between the caliph's palace and the Great Mosque of Cordoba). This passage likely passed through the imam's chamber behind the southeastern qibla wall and therefore may have disappeared when the second mosque was built over this area. Modern archeological excavations have also confirmed the existence in the first Kutubiyya Mosque of a near-legendary mechanism which allowed the wooden maqsura (a screen separating the caliph and his entourage from the rest of the crowd during prayers) to rise from a trench in the ground seemingly by itself, and then retract in the same manner when the caliph left. Another semi-automated mechanism also allowed the minbar to emerge and move forward from its storage chamber (next to the mihrab) seemingly by itself. The exact functioning of the mechanism is unknown, but may have relied on a hidden system of counterweights. The new Almohad mosque was thus imbued with great political and religious symbolism, being closely associated with the ruling dynasty, and made subtle references to the ancient Ummayyad caliphate in Cordoba, whose great mosque was a model for much of subsequent Moroccan and Moorish architecture. It is unknown if the first Kutubiyya Mosque had a minaret, though some historians have suggested that a former bastion of the Almoravid kasbah (Ksar el-Hajjar) on the mosque's northeastern corner may have been converted into the mosque's first minaret, whose remains might have been visible even as late as the beginning of the 19th century. It is unclear when exactly the first Kutubiyya Mosque disappeared, but its layout is well-known thanks to modern excavations starting in 1923. The excavated foundations of the mosque, as well as the outline of its mihrab and qibla wall, are still visible today on the second mosque's northwestern side. Also visible today nearby are the uncovered vestiges of the Ksar el-Hajjar to which the mosque was adjoined. = The second (current) Kutubiyya Mosque = alt=The minaret tower has a main shaft and a secondary tower above it with a dome, and a left Aerial view of the mosque and its surrounding circa 1930-31. At some point, Abd al-Mu'min decided to build a second mosque directly adjoined to the southeastern (qibla) side of the first mosque. The reasons for this unusual decision are still not fully understood. The most popular historical narrative asserts that Abd al-Mu'min discovered, possibly during its construction, that the initial mosque was misaligned with the qibla (presumably according to Almohad criteria). The second mosque is indeed aligned slightly further to the south, at an azimuth of 159¬∞ or 161¬∞ from the true north, compared to the 154¬∞ alignment of the first mosque, which actually makes the second mosque 5 to 7 degrees further out of alignment with respect to the \\"true\\" or modern qibla. Why this slightly different alignment was preferred is unclear; it may be that the first mosque was aligned with the walls of the Ksar el-Hajjar and that this was judged sufficient at the time, but that the alignment of the second mosque more closely matched that of the Tinmal Mosque (an important Almohad religious site) which had been built in the meantime. Other possible motivations for the construction of the second mosque may have been to accommodate a growing population, to double the building's size to make it more impressive, or even as an excuse to make one of the mosques exclusive to the ruling elites while the other was used by the general population. The construction dates of the second mosque are also not firmly established. One historical chronicle, reported by al-Maqqari, claims that construction began on the second mosque in May 1158 (Rabi' al-Thani 553 AH) and was completed with the inauguration of the first Friday prayers in September (Sha'ban) of the same year. However, this construction period seems implausibly short and it is likely that construction either began before May 1158 or (perhaps more likely) continued after September 1158. As mentioned, it is not known when the first mosque was actually deserted, or even whether it was abandoned and allowed to deteriorate or if it was consciously demolished at some point. Scholars believe that the two mosques most likely coexisted for a time as one large mosque. For example, the mosque's current minaret appears to have been integrated into the fabric of both mosques, as evidenced by the remains of an arcade belonging to the first mosque and yet still integrated into the base of the minaret today. Gaston Deverdun, in his heavily-cited 1959 book on the history of Marrakesh, suggested the possibility that the first mosque was only abandoned after Ya'qub al-Mansur built a new royal citadel (the current Kasbah district) further south. As part of this citadel, al-Mansur had raised the new Kasbah Mosque, completed in 1190, which subsequently served as the main mosque of the caliph and the ruling elites. This would have thus made the old Kutubiyya less useful, particularly the first mosque which was attached to the former, now abandoned, royal palace. It is even possible that the first Kutubiyya was dismantled in order to reuse its materials in the construction of the new kasbah and its mosque. The famous minaret of the mosque, which is visible today, is also not conclusively dated. Some historical sources attribute it to Abd al-Mu'min (who reigned up until 1163) while others attribute it to Ya'qub al-Mansur (who reigned between 1184 and 1199). According to some historians (including Deverdun), the most likely scenario is that the minaret was begun before 1158 and largely built by Abd al-Mu'min, or at the very least designed on his commission. It is plausible, however, that Ya'qub al-Mansur either finished the work in his time, or that he added the small secondary \\"lantern\\"-tower at its summit in 1195. The second Kutubiyya Mosque was built almost identical to the first except for its adjusted orientation. The layout, architectural designs, dimensions and materials used for construction were almost all the same. The only architectural differences are in a few details and in the fact that the second mosque was slightly wider than the first. The mosque's floor plan is also slightly irregular due to the fact that its northern wall is still the old southern wall of the first mosque, which is at a slightly different angle from the second mosque (due to the different qibla orientation, as explained above). The mosque, and more specifically its minaret, was the forerunner of two other structures built on the same pattern, the \\"Tour Hassan\\" in Rabat (a monumental mosque begun by Ya'qub al-Mansur but never finished) and the Great Mosque of Seville, Spain, whose minaret is preserved as the Giralda. This structure thus became one of the models for subsequent Moroccan-Andalusian architecture. = Present day = Today, the mosque is still active and non-Muslims are not allowed inside. However, it is possible to visit the Tin Mal Mosque, built along the same lines, which is inactive but preserved as a historic site south of Marrakesh. The mosque and its minaret were restored at the end of the 1990s. In 2016 the mosque was fitted with solar panels, solar water heaters, and energy-efficient LED lights as part of an effort to make state-run mosques more dependent on renewable green energy. Architecture left Architectural details of the first mosque and the new mosque are almost identical except for the orientation. Hence, what is true of one holds true for the other, though the first mosque is now only visible as archaeological remains. The mosque is a characteristic Almohad design, and its various elements resemble those of many other mosques from the same period. =Exterior= alt=The mosque is located in a large plaza with gardens, and is floodlit at night. The building, of bricks and sandstone, measures in width towards the east and to the west along a north to south direction. Brick work is found in the columns, arcades, middle of the qibla wall, and niche of the mihrab. Sandstone is used for the external walls built in the southern, eastern and western directions. The stone wall on the northern side of the first mosque abutted the old Almoravid fortress wall (the Ksar el-Hajjar). The surfaces are enlivened by simple designs. All window sections have horseshoe-shaped and multifoil arches, arranged within a rectangle. A diamond shape is formed in the upper part as result of overlapping arches in woven design. Faience strips are provided with bricks in turquoise colour projecting out of the wall, in smaller decorative forms. Austere kufic script is also seen. The sahn or courtyard is wide, the same width as the nine central naves. There is an ablution fountain at the center of the courtyard. There are four entrances to the mosque, of which three open directly into the prayer hall while one opens into the courtyard. There is also an additional public entrance to the sahn from the north wall, along the central axis. The front elevation faces the street where book shops were located, hence the name \\"Booksellers' Mosque\\". There are two other private entrances to the mosque, one for the imam on the left side of the mihrab and the other for the Prince to enter directly into the maqsura. =Interior= The main prayer hall is a hypostyle hall with more than 100 pillars which support horseshoe-shaped arches along the parallel naves. The hall is large, to the south, and abuts the courtyard at its northern end. It is also a \\"T\\"-shape prayer hall, in that the nave along the qibla wall and the perpendicular central nave leading towards the mihrab are wider than other naves. The mihrab niche is on the qibla wall in the prayer hall along the widened central nave, for which entry is from the courtyard. There is a wide transverse nave that is aligned along the qibla wall at the south end of the prayer hall. Three wide central naves are aligned perpendicular to the hall to the north. The central naves are flanked by seven smaller parallel naves. In all, there are seventeen parallel naves. The longitudinal naves, about in length, are six times the width of the large transverse nave. The extensions of these naves are from the four outermost naves on either side of the prayer hall annexes and the courtyard. =Minaret= Northeastern facade of the minaret The minaret is designed in Almohad style and was constructed with rubble masonry using sandstone. It was historically covered with Marrakshi pink plaster, but in the 1990s, experts opted to expose the original stone work and removed the plaster. The minaret tower is in height, including the spire, itself tall. Each side of the square base is in length. The minaret is visible from a distance of . Its prominence makes it a landmark structure of Marrakesh, which is maintained by an ordinance prohibiting any high rise buildings (above the height of a palm tree) to be built around it. The mu'azzin calling the faithful for the adhan (prayer), is given from the four cardinal directions at the top of the minaret. Its design includes a high square shaft (which takes up about four fifths of its height) and another smaller square shaft standing on top of it, capped by a dome. Many features of the minaret are also found in other religious buildings in the country, such as a wide band of ceramic tiles near the top and the alternation between different but related motifs on each facade of the minaret, including Moorish- style polylobed arch patterns. The latter motifs form prominent compositions carved into the stone around the windows. These carved compositions also originally featured polychrome painted decoration of geometric and plant motifs, of which only traces remain today. The white and green mosaic tilework near the top of the minaret is cited by Jonathan Bloom as the earliest reliably-dated example of zellij in Morocco. Above this, the top edge of the minaret's main shaft is crowned by stepped merlons. At this level there is an outdoor platform which can reached from inside the tower, and on which the smaller second shaft of the minaret stands. Inside the main shaft are six rooms in succession, one above the other, and the whole tower could be ascended via a wide interior ramp that allowed the mu'azzin to ride a horse to the top. The different arrangements on the exterior facade of the minaret correspond to the positions of the window openings situated at different points along the ascending ramp inside. The chambers inside are also enlivened with varying degrees of decoration, with the topmost (sixth) chamber being especially notable for its ornamental ribbed dome ceiling (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Cordoba) with muqarnas squinches and geometric patterns. The minaret is topped by a spire or finial (jamur). The finial includes gilded copper balls, decreasing in size towards the top, a traditional style of Morocco. A popular legend about the orbs, of which there are variations, claims that they are made of pure gold. The legend was originally associated with the minaret of the Kasbah Mosque further south (which has a similar finial), but is nowadays often associated with the Kutubiyya instead. One version of the legend claims that there were at one time only three of them and that the fourth was donated by the wife of Yaqub al-Mansur as penance for breaking her fast for three hours one day during Ramadan. She had her golden jewelry melted down to form the fourth globe. Another version of the legend is that the balls were originally made entirely of gold fashioned from the jewellery of the wife of Saadian Sultan Ahmad al- Mansur. There is a flag pole next to the copper balls forming the spire, which is used for hoisting the religious green flag of the Prophet, which the mu'azzin does every Friday and on religious occasions.  Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque The Almoravid minbar, on display at the El Badi Palace. Detail of the geometric motif on the flanks of the minbar, centered around a recurring eight-pointed star. The spaces are filled with inlay and wood-carved arabesque pieces. = History = The Kutubiyya Mosque's original minbar (pulpit) was commissioned by Ali ibn Yusuf, one of the last Almoravid rulers, and created by a workshop in Cordoba, Spain (al-Andalus). Its production started in 1137 and is estimated to have taken seven years. It is regarded as ‚Äúone of the unsurpassed creations of Islamic art‚Äù. Its artistic style and quality was hugely influential and set a standard which was repeatedly imitated, but never surpassed, in subsequent minbars across Morocco and parts of Algeria. It is believed that the minbar was originally placed in the first Ben Youssef Mosque (named after Ali ibn Yusuf, but entirely rebuilt in later centuries). It was then transferred by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min to the first Kutubiyya Mosque and was later moved to the second incarnation of that mosque. It remained there until 1962, when it was moved to the El Badi Palace where it is now on display for visitors. = Description = A part of the Kufic Arabic inscription which runs along the upper edge of the minbar's sides. The minbar is an essentially triangular structure with the hypotenuse side occupied by a staircase with nine steps. It is long, wide, and tall. The main structure is made in North African cedar wood, although the steps were made of walnut tree wood and the minbar's base was made with fir tree wood. The surfaces are decorated through a mix of marquetry and inlaid sculpted pieces. The large triangular faces of the minbar on either side are covered in an elaborate and creative motif centered around eight-pointed stars, from which decorative bands with ivory inlay then interweave and repeat the same pattern across the rest of the surface. The spaces between these bands form other geometric shapes which are filled with panels of deeply-carved arabesques, made from different coloured woods (boxwood, jujube, and blackwood). There is a wide band of Quranic inscriptions in Kufic script on blackwood and bone running along the top edge of the balustrades. The other surfaces of the minbar feature a variety of other motifs. Notably, the steps of the minbar are decorated with images of an arcade of Moorish (horseshoe) arches inside which are curving plant motifs, all made entirely in marquetry with different colored woods. = Mechanism moving the minbar and the maqsura= Historical accounts describe a mysterious semi-automated mechanism in the Kutubiyya Mosque by which the minbar would emerge, seemingly on its own, from its storage chamber next to the mihrab and move forward into position for the imam's sermon. Likewise, the maqsura of the mosque (a wooden screen that separated the caliph and his entourage from the general public during prayers) was also retractable in the same manner and would emerge from the ground when the caliph attended prayers at the mosque, and then retract once he left. This mechanism, which elicited great curiosity and wonder from contemporary observers, was designed by an engineer from Malaga named Hajj al- Ya'ish, who also completed other projects for the caliph. Modern archaeological excavations carried out on the first Kutubiyya Mosque have found evidence confirming the existence of such a mechanism, though its exact workings are not fully established. One theory, which appears plausible from the physical evidence, is that it was powered by a hidden system of pulleys and counterweights.

P. Dutton was an American book publishing company. It was founded as a book retailer in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1852 by Edward Payson Dutton.  Creator  Edward Payson Dutton (January 4, 1831 ‚Äì 1923) was a prominent American book publisher. In 1852, Dutton founded the E. P. Dutton bookselling company in Boston, Massachusetts. The business sold fiction and non-fiction, and within a short time expanded into the selling of children's literature. In 1864, he opened a branch office to sell books in New York City and in 1869 moved his company's headquarters there and entered the book publishing business. From 1888 onward, he started working with Ernest Nister. In 1906, Dutton struck what proved to be a significant deal with the English publishing company of J. M. Dent to be the American distributor of the Everyman's Library series of classic literature reprints. Edward Dutton died in 1923, aged 92, but his company continued to flourish and today is an imprint of the Penguin Group. History Dutton expanded to New York City in 1864, where it began publishing religious books. In 1906, Dutton made a deal with English publishing company J. M. Dent to be the American distributor of the Everyman's Library series of classic literature reprints. John Macrae joined the company in 1885 as an office boy, and in 1923 was named president. In 1928, the publishing and retail divisions were split into two separate businesses with Macrae acquiring the publishing side, operating as E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc. It published children's books under the Unicorn imprint, with some books published in the 1990s. Dutton Children's Books continues today. In 1975, Dutton was acquired by the Dutch publisher Elsevier. The following year, Dutton bought Hawthorn Books from W. H. Allen & Co.. Dutton lost money under Dutch ownership, and the company was sold to the buyout firm Dyson-Kissner- Moran in 1981. The paperback publisher New American Library acquired Dutton in 1985. New America Library was acquired by Penguin Group in 1986, and split into two imprints: Dutton and Dutton Children's Books. Dutton is now a boutique imprint within Penguin Group, publishing approximately 40 books for adults per year, half of them fiction and half non-fiction. After the acquisition by Penguin, books to which Penguin acquired the rights as part of the acquisition of Dutton were published in paperback under the imprint Puffin Unicorn (because Puffin has been the longtime paperback imprint for the Penguin Group).

He was later captured in Tahiti, tried and condemned to death as a mutineer, but subsequently pardoned. He resumed his naval career and eventually retired with the rank of post- captain, after 29 years of honourable service. The son of a prominent Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined Bounty under Lieutenant William Bligh at the age of 15. Although unranked, he was granted the privileges of a junior officer. Bounty left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that Bounty remained in Tahiti. Shortly after the ship began its homeward voyage, Christian and his discontented followers seized Bligh and took control of the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791, Heywood and his companions were met in Tahiti by the search vessel and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other sailor welcomed the Pandora in canoes, relieved to be rescued. However, they were arrested; the captain, Edward Edwards, had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an box built for the purpose on deck. During their subsequent journey, Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. Four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned; Heywood survived. In September 1792, Heywood was court-martialed and with five others was sentenced to hang. However, the court recommended mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune, he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career, received a series of promotions that gave him his first command at the age of 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence and who lacked legal counsel.  Family background and early life  The Nunnery, Douglas, Isle of Man, where Peter Heywood was born in 1772. Peter Heywood was born in 1772 at the Nunnery, in Douglas, Isle of Man. He was the fifth of the 11 children (six boys and five girls) of Peter John Heywood and his wife Elizabeth Spedding. The Heywood ancestry can be traced back to the 12th century; a prominent forebear was Peter \\"Powderplot\\" Heywood, who arrested Guy Fawkes after the 1605 plot to blow up the English parliament.Alexander, pp. 64‚Äì65. On his mother's side, Peter was distantly related to Fletcher Christian's family, which had been established on the Isle of Man for centuries.Alexander, pp. 62‚Äì63. In 1773, when Peter was a year old, Peter John Heywood was forced by a financial crisis to sell The Nunnery and leave the island. The family lived for several years in Whitehaven, England before the father's appointment as agent for the Duke of Atholl's Manx properties brought them back to Douglas. Heywood's family had a tradition of naval and military service. In 1786, at the age of 14, Heywood left St Bees School in England to join , a harbour-bound training vessel at Plymouth. In August 1787, Heywood was offered a berth on the Bounty for an extended cruise to the Pacific Ocean under the command of Lieutenant William Bligh. Heywood's recommendation came from Richard Betham, a family friend who was also Bligh's father-in-law. The Heywood family at this time was in deep financial trouble, Peter John Heywood having been dismissed by the Duke for gross mismanagement and embezzlement of funds. Betham wrote to Bligh: \\"his Family have fallen into a great deal of Distress on account of their father losing the Duke of Atholl's business\\", and urged Bligh not to desert them in their adversity. Bligh was happy to oblige his father-in-law, and invited the young Heywood to stay with him in Deptford while the ship was prepared for the forthcoming voyage.Alexander, p. 66.  On HMS Bounty  Outward journey = Map showing Bounty's movements in the Pacific Ocean, 1788‚Äì1790. Bounty's mission was to collect breadfruit plants from Tahiti for transportation to the West Indies as a new source of food for the slave plantations. Bligh, a skilled navigator, had travelled to Tahiti in 1776, as Captain James Cook's sailing master during the explorer's final voyage. Bounty was a small vessel, in overall length,Hough, p. 64. with a complement of 46 men crammed into limited accommodation. Heywood was one of several \\"young gentlemen\\" aboard ship who were mustered as able seamen but ate and slept with their social equals in the cockpit.Alexander, pp. 44‚Äì46. His distant kinsman Fletcher Christian served as master's mate on the voyage.Hough. p. 75. Bligh's orders were to enter the Pacific by rounding Cape Horn. After collecting sufficient breadfruit plants from the Tahitian islands he was to sail westward, through the Endeavour Strait and across the Indian Ocean. Entering the Atlantic he would continue on to the West Indies, incidentally completing a circumnavigation.Alexander, p. 48.Bligh, Ch. 1. Bounty left London on 15 October 1787, and after being held at Spithead awaiting final sailing orders was further delayed by bad weather; it was 23 December before the ship was finally away.Hough, pp. 78‚Äì80. This long hiatus caused Bounty to arrive at Cape Horn much later in the season than planned and to encounter very severe weather. Unable to make progress against westerly gales and enormous seas, Bligh finally turned the ship and headed east. He would now have to take the alternative, much longer route to the Pacific, sailing first to Cape Town and then south of Australia and New Zealand, before working northwards to Tahiti.Hough, pp. 92‚Äì95. Following its new route, Bounty reached Cape Town on 24 May 1788. Here, Heywood wrote a long letter to his family describing the voyage to date, with vivid descriptions of life at sea. Initially, Heywood relates, sailing had been \\"in the most pleasurable weather imaginable\\". In describing the attempts to round Cape Horn he writes: \\"I suppose there never were seas, in any part of the known world, to compare with those we met ... for height, and length of swell; the oldest seamen on board never saw anything to equal that ...\\" Bligh's decision to turn east was, Heywood records, \\"to the great joy of everyone on board\\".Dening, p. 68. Historian Greg Dening records a story, unmentioned in Heywood's letter, that at the height of the Cape Horn storms Bligh had punished Heywood for some minor wrongdoing by ordering him to climb the mast and to \\"stay there beyond the point of all endurance\\"; this, Dening concedes, was possibly a later fabrication to discredit Bligh.Dening, pp. 67‚Äì69. = In Tahiti = Sections of the breadfruit plant, from Bligh's voyage account, drawn by an artist only identified as \\"Mackenzie\\". Bounty sailed from Cape Town on 1 July 1788, reached Tasmania on 19 August 1788, and arrived at Matavai Bay, Tahiti, on 26 October 1788. The latter stages of this voyage, however, saw signs of trouble between Bligh and his officers and crew; rows and disagreements grew steadily more frequent.Hough, pp. 96‚Äì102. On arrival, Heywood and Christian were assigned to a shore camp which would act as a nursery for the breadfruit plants.Hough. p. 112. They would live here throughout the Tahiti sojourn, a \\"situation of comfort and privilege\\" which, according to historian Richard Hough, was much envied by those required to spend their nights on the ship.Alexander, p. 108.Hough, p. 115. Whether crew were ashore or on board, however, duties during Bounty's five months' stay in Tahiti were relatively light. Some men took regular partners from the native women, while others led promiscuous lives; both Christian and Heywood are listed among the officers and men treated for venereal infections.Alexander, p. 112.Hough, pp. 122‚Äì25. Despite the relaxed atmosphere, relations between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain‚Äîoften in front of the crew and the native Tahitians‚Äîfor real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment.Alexander, pp. 115‚Äì20. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them. As the date for departure from Tahiti grew closer, Bligh's outbursts against his officers became more frequent.Alexander, pp. 124‚Äì25. One witness reported that \\"Whatever fault was found, Mr Christian was sure to bear the brunt.\\"Hough, p. 132. Tensions rose among the men, who faced the prospect of a long and dangerous voyage that would take them through the uncharted Endeavour Strait, followed by many months of hard sailing. Bligh was impatient to be away, but in Hough's words he \\"failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea ... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti\\".Hough, p. 128. On 5 April 1789, Bounty finally weighed anchor and made for the open sea.  Mutiny  Seizure of Bounty = Lieutenant William Bligh, captain of the Bounty. For three weeks, Bounty sailed westward, and early on 28 April 1789 was lying off the island of Tofua in the Friendly Islands (Tonga). Christian was officer of the watch; Bligh's behaviour towards him had grown increasingly hostile, and Christian was now prepared to take over the ship, with the help of a group of armed seamen who were willing to follow him. Shortly after 5:15 am local time, Bligh was seized and brought on deck, naked from the waist down, wearing only his nightshirt, and with his hands bound.Alexander, p. 140. There followed hours of confusion as the majority of the crew sought to grasp the situation and decide how they should react. Finally, at about 10 am, Bligh and 18 loyalists were placed in the ship's launch, a open boat, with minimal supplies and navigation instruments, and cast adrift. Heywood was among those who remained on board.Alexander, pp. 134‚Äì41.Hough, pp. 160‚Äì62. Not all the 25 men who remained on Bounty were mutineers; Bligh's launch was overloaded, and some who stayed with the ship did so under duress. \\"Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England\\", Bligh is reported as saying.Hough, p. 158. With regard to Heywood, however, Bligh was convinced that the young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood (a mere boy not yet 16) as \\"one of the ringleaders\\", adding: \\"I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man.Alexander, p. 152. Natives of the Isle of Man are known as \\"Manxmen\\". Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard.Bligh, Ch. 13. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: \\"His baseness is beyond all description.\\"Alexander, p. 168. The mutineers turning Bligh and loyal officers and crew adrift, 29 April 1789. Members of the crew would later provide conflicting accounts of Heywood's actions during the mutiny. Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will.Hough, p. 279. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours‚Äîhe had been seen unwittingly resting his hand on top of a cutlass‚Äîwas due to his youth and the excitement of the moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself.Alexander, pp. 244‚Äì46. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had \\"laughed, turned round and walked away\\". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.Alexander, pp. 240‚Äì41. After the departure of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward in search of a remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement.Dening, pp. 88‚Äì90. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.Alexander, pp. 152‚Äì56. = Fugitive = Poedooa, a Tahitian woman, circa 1777, by John Webber A month's sailing brought Bounty to Tubuai on 28 May 1789. Despite a hostile reception from the island's natives Christian spent several days surveying the land and selecting a site for a fort before taking Bounty on to Tahiti.Hough, pp. 194‚Äì96. When they reached Matavai Bay Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods, and on 16 June the well-provisioned Bounty sailed back to Tubuai with nearly 30 Tahitians, some of whom had been taken aboard by deception.Dening, p. 90. The attempt to establish a colony on Tubuai was unsuccessful; the repeated raids by the mutineers for \\"wives\\" and the near- mutinous dissatisfaction of the duped Tahitians wrecked Christian's plans.Hough, pp. 197‚Äì200. On 18 September 1789, Bounty sailed back to Matavai Bay for the final time. Heywood and 15 others now decided that they would remain in Tahiti and risk the consequences of discovery,Hough, p. 201. while Christian, with eight mutineers and a number of Tahitian men and women, took off in Bounty for an unrevealed destination. Before departing, Christian left messages for his family with Heywood, recounting the story of the mutiny and emphasising that he alone was responsible.Hough. pp. 201‚Äì03. On Tahiti Heywood and his companions set about organising their lives. The largest group, led by James Morrison, began building a schooner, to be named Resolution after Cook's ship.Dening, pp. 215‚Äì17. Matthew Thompson and former master-at-arms Charles Churchill chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives which ended in the violent deaths of both.Hough, pp. 219‚Äì22. Heywood preferred quiet domesticity in a small house with a Tahitian wife, studying the Tahitian language and fathering a daughter.Alexander, p. 188. Over a period of 18 months (from September 1789 through 1790 to March 1791), he gradually adopted native manners of dress, and was heavily tattooed around the body. Heywood later explained: \\"I was tattooed not to gratify my own desires, but theirs\\", adding that in Tahiti a man without tattoos was an outcast. \\"I always made it a maxim when I was in Rome to act as Rome did.\\"Tagart, pp. 81‚Äì84 (letter from Heywood to his mother, 15 August 1792). What Dening describes as an \\"arcadian existence\\"Dening, p. 217. ended on 23 March 1791, with the arrival of the search ship . Heywood's first reaction to the ship's appearance was, he later wrote, \\"the utmost joy\\". As the ship anchored, he rode out in a canoe to identify himself. However, his reception, like that of the others who came aboard voluntarily, was frosty. Captain Edward Edwards, Pandora's commander, made no distinctions among the former Bounty men; all became prisoners, and were manacled and taken below.Dening, pp. 238‚Äì39.  Prisoner  Pandora voyage = Within a few days, all of the 14 surviving fugitives in Tahiti had surrendered or been captured. Among Pandora's officers was former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward. Heywood's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed. Hayward, \\"... like all worldlings raised a little in life, received us very coolly, and pretended ignorance of our affairs.\\"Tagart, p. 30 (letter from Heywood to his mother, 20 November 1791). Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on Bounty's whereabouts.Hough, p. 226. A cell was built on Pandora's quarterdeck, a structure known as \\"Pandora's Box\\" where the prisoners, legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs, were to be confined for almost five months. Heywood wrote: \\"The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the scuppers, and produced maggots in a short time ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render our situation truly disagreeable.\\"Hough, pp. 226‚Äì27. , wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef; an etching based on a sketch by Peter Heywood. Pandora left Tahiti on 8 May 1791 to search for Christian and the Bounty among the thousands of southern Pacific islands. Apart from a few spars‚Äîwhich had probably floated from Tubuai‚Äîdiscovered at Palmerston Island (Avarau), no traces of the ship could be found.Alexander, pp. 15‚Äì18. Physical attacks from natives were frequent; early in August Edwards abandoned the search and headed for the Dutch East Indies via the Torres Strait. Knowledge of these waters and the surrounding reefs was minimal; on 29 August 1791, the ship ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef and began to fill with water. Three of the prisoners in \\"Pandora's Box\\" were let out and ordered to assist the crew at the pumps. In the subsequent struggle to save the ship the rest of the men in \\"Pandora's Box\\" were ignored as the regular crew went about their efforts to prevent the ship from foundering. At dawn it was clear that their efforts were in vain; the officers agreed that the vessel could not be saved and orders were then given to abandon ship. The armourer was ordered into the \\"box\\" to knock off the remaining prisoners' leg irons and shackles; however, the ship sank before he had finished. Heywood, stripped naked, was one of the last to get out of the cell; four prisoners, including Heywood's best friend George Stewart, were drowned, as were 31 of the regular crew. The 99 survivors, including ten prisoners, recovered on a nearby island where they stayed for two nights before embarking on an open-boat journey which largely followed Bligh's course of two years earlier. The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot on the slow passage to Coupang, which they reached on 17 September 1791.Alexander, pp. 22‚Äì26.Hough, pp. 227‚Äì30. Throughout this long ordeal Heywood somehow managed to hang on to his prayer book, and used it to jot down details of dates, places and events during his captivity.Alexander, p. 35. He recorded that at Coupang he and his fellow-prisoners were placed in the stocks and confined in the fortress before being sent to Batavia (now Jakarta) on the first leg of the voyage back to England. During a seven-week stay in Batavia confined aboard a Dutch East India Company ship, most of the prisoners, including Heywood, were allowed on deck only twice.Alexander, pp. 27‚Äì30. On 25 December 1791 they were taken aboard a Dutch ship, Vreedenberg, for passage to Europe via Cape Town. Still in the charge of Captain Edwards, the prisoners were kept in irons for most of the way. At the Cape they were eventually transferred to a British warship, , which set sail for England on 5 April 1792.Alexander, pp. 31‚Äì33. On 19 June the ship arrived in Portsmouth where the prisoners were moved to the guardship . = Portsmouth = Hester \\"Nessy\\" Heywood, Peter Heywood's devoted older sister. Bligh had landed in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly promoted to post- captain. In the following months he wrote his account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.Hough, pp. 216‚Äì18.Alexander, pp. 164‚Äì79. Following Heywood's arrival in Portsmouth his family sought help from their wide circle of influential friends, and set out to secure the best available legal counsel. Most active on Heywood's behalf was his older sister Hester (\\"Nessy\\"), who gave her brother unqualified support, writing to him on 3 June: \\"If the transactions of that day were as Mr. Bligh represented them, such is my conviction of your worth and honor that I will without hesitation stake my life on your innocence. If on the contrary you were concerned in such a conspiracy against your commander, I shall be firmly convinced that his conduct was the occasion of it.\\"Tagart, p. 41 (letter from Nessy Heywood to Peter Heywood, 3 June 1792). Heywood sent his personal narrative of the mutiny to the Earl of Chatham, who was First Lord of the Admiralty and brother to the prime minister, William Pitt. This was a step Heywood subsequently regretted; he had not consulted his lawyers, and his narrative contained statements that Heywood later rescinded on the grounds that they were \\"the errors of an imperfect recollection\\".Alexander, p. 252. On 8 June Nessy was advised by her and Heywood's uncle, Captain Thomas Pasley, that on the basis of information from the returned Pandora crew \\"...your brother appears by all account to be the greatest culprit of all, Christian alone excepted ... I have no hope of his not being condemned.\\"Tagart, p. 47 (letter from Thomas Pasley to Nessy Heywood, 8 June 1792). Later, however, Pasley was able to offer some comfort; Captain Montagu of Hector, where Heywood was held, was Pasley's \\"particular friend\\". By chance another Heywood naval relative by marriage, Captain Albemarle Bertie, was in Portsmouth Harbour with his ship , moored alongside Hector. Mrs Bertie, and Edgar's officers, were frequent visitors to Heywood, bringing gifts of food, clothing and other comforts.Alexander, pp. 190‚Äì91. Pasley secured the services of Aaron Graham, an experienced and clever advocate, to direct Heywood's legal strategy.Alexander, pp. 204‚Äì05. Between June and September Heywood and his sister exchanged a stream of letters and ardent poems; Nessy's final letter, just before the court martial, exhorted: \\"May the Almighty Providence, whose tender care has hitherto preserved you, be still your bountiful Protector! May he instil into the hearts of your judges every sentiment of justice, generosity and compassion ... and may you at length be restored to us.\\"Tagart, pp. 94‚Äì95 (letter from Nessy Heywood to Peter Heywood, September 1792). = Court martial = Admiral Lord Hood, who presided over the Bounty court martial. The court martial opened on 12 September 1792 aboard in Portsmouth Harbour. Accused with Heywood were Joseph Coleman, Thomas McIntosh and Charles Norman, all of whom had been exonerated in Bligh's account and could confidently expect acquittal, as could Michael Byrne, the nearly blind ship's fiddler. The other accused were James Morrison, Thomas Burkitt, Thomas Ellison, John Millward and William Muspratt. The court martial board was presided over by Lord Hood, naval commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, and included Pasley's friend George Montagu and Heywood's relative by marriage, Albemarle Bertie.Hough, p. 276.Alexander, pp. 214‚Äì15.Alexander, p. 220. The testimonies of the boatswain Cole, the carpenter Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood was with the mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in laughing and turning away from the captive Bligh‚Äîthough Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.Tagart, pp. 11‚Äì12 (letter from John Hallett to Nessy Hayward, 29 March 1792). Heywood opened his defence on 17 September 1792 with a long prepared statement read by one of his lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to \\"appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance\\". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent.Alexander, pp. 252‚Äì54. First, Heywood pleaded his \\"extreme youth and inexperience\\" as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that \\"...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears.\\" Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured \\"by the least addition to their Number\\". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: \\"...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented.\\" Under further questioning, Cole confirmed his belief that Heywood had been detained against his will. William Peckover, Bounty's gunnery officer, affirmed that if he had stayed aboard the ship in the hope of retaking her, he would have looked to Heywood for assistance. Witnesses from the Pandora attested that Heywood had surrendered himself voluntarily, and that he had been fully cooperative in providing information. On the issue of his alleged laughing at Bligh's predicament, Heywood managed to cast doubts on Hallett's testimony, asking how Hallett had managed \\"to particularise the muscles of a man's countenance\\" at some distance and during the hurly-burly of a mutiny. Heywood concluded his defence with what Alexander terms an \\"audacious\\" assertion that had Bligh been present in court he would have \\"exculpated me from the least disrespect\\".Alexander, pp. 256‚Äì59. = Verdict and sentences = On 18 September 1792, Lord Hood announced the court's verdicts. As expected, Coleman, McIntosh, Norman, and Byrne were acquitted. Heywood and the other five were found guilty of the charge of mutiny, and were ordered to suffer death by hanging. Lord Hood added: \\"In consideration of various circumstances, the court did humbly and most earnestly recommend the said Peter Heywood and James Morrison to His Majesty's Royal Mercy.\\"Alexander, p. 283. Heywood's family were quickly reassured by the lawyer Aaron Graham that the young man's life was safe and that he would soon be free.Alexander, pp. 284‚Äì94. As the weeks passed, Heywood calmly occupied himself by resuming his studies of the Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family‚ÄîNessy in particular‚Äîbusied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms.Tagart, pp. 152‚Äì53 (letter from Nessy Haywood to the Earl of Chatham). Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October 1792, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: \\"I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service.\\"Alexander, pp. 297‚Äì98. According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition was accompanied by a \\"flood of tears\\".Rotterdamsche Courant 8 November 1792. William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel,Alexander, p. 212. was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793. Three days later, aboard , Millward, Burkitt and Ellison were hanged from the yardarms. Dening calls them \\"a humble remnant on which to wreak vengeance\\".Dening, pp. 37‚Äì42. There was some unease expressed in the press, a suspicion that \\"money had bought the lives of some, and others fell sacrifice to their poverty.\\" A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded; nevertheless, Dening asserts that \\"in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference.\\" Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment,Alexander, pp. 300‚Äì02. while others speak of their \\"manly firmness that ... was the admiration of all\\".Dening, p. 48. = Aftermath = On the specific recommendation of Lord Hood, who had offered the young man his personal patronage, Heywood resumed his naval career as a midshipman aboard his uncle Thomas Pasley's ship .Tagart, pp. 164‚Äì71. In September 1793, he was summoned by Lord Howe, commander of the Channel Fleet, to serve on , the fleet's flagship. Hough observes that a pardon, followed by promotion, for one of Bligh's chief targets was \\"a public rebuke to the absent captain, and everyone recognised it as such\\".Hough, p. 282. Although Bligh had departed on his second breadfruit expedition in August 1791 as a national hero, the court martial had revealed damaging evidence of his erratic and overbearing behaviour. The families of Heywood and Christian, noting the leniency that had acquitted four and pardoned three of the ten accused, began their own campaigns for vindication, and for revenge on Bligh.Hough, p. 284. When Bligh returned in August 1793 he found that opinion had turned sharply against him. Lord Chatham, at the Admiralty, refused to receive his report or even see him‚Äîalthough Nathaniel Portlock, Bligh's lieutenant, was given a meeting.Alexander, p. 318. Bligh was then left unemployed, on half-pay, for 19 months before his next assignment.Alexander, p. 379. Shortly after his release, Heywood had written to Edward Christian, Fletcher's older brother, that he would \\"endeavour to prove that your brother was not that vile wretch, void of all gratitude ... but, on the contrary, a most worthy character ... beloved by all (except one, whose ill report is his greatest praise)\\".Alexander, p. 321. This statement, published immediately after Heywood's pardon in a local Whitehaven newspaper as an open letter to Edward Christian, contradicted the respect Heywood had accorded Bligh in the courtroom,Alexander, p. 322. and, in turn, it led to the publication in late 1794 of Edward Christian's Appendix to the court martial proceedings. Presented as an account of the \\"real causes and circumstances of that Unhappy Transaction\\", the Appendix was said by the press to \\"palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh\\".Alexander, pp. 340‚Äì41. In the controversy that followed, Bligh's rebuttals could not silence doubts as to his own conduct, and his position was further undermined when William Peckover, a Bligh loyalist, confirmed that the allegations in the Appendix were substantially accurate.Hough, p. 286.  Subsequent career  Early stages = engaging the French fleet off Ushant, 1 June 1794 ‚Äì the \\"Glorious First of June\\". Heywood served on Queen Charlotte until March 1795, and was aboard her when the French fleet was defeated at Ushant on 1 June 1794, the occasion known as the \\"Glorious First of June\\".Alexander, pp. 389‚Äì92. In August 1794 he was promoted acting lieutenant. In March 1795, doubts about his eligibility as a convicted mutineer for further promotion were set aside and his advancement to full lieutenant's rank was approved, despite his lacking the stated minimum of six years' service at sea. Among those who supported the promotion was Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian, a relative of Fletcher Christian.Alexander, pp. 338‚Äì39. In January 1796, Heywood was appointed third lieutenant to and sailed with her to the East Indies. He was to remain in this station for nine years. By the end of 1796 he was Fox's first lieutenant, and remained so until mid-1798 when he transferred to . On 17 May 1799, Heywood was given his first command, , a brig-of-war. In August 1800, Heywood was appointed commander of a bomb ship, the Vulcan, in which he visited Coupang where he had been held prisoner eight years earlier. At this time he began the hydrographic work that would mark the remainder of his naval career.Tagart (1832), p. 171. = Hydrographer = In 1803, after a succession of commands, Heywood was promoted to post-captain. In command of , Heywood conducted a series of surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India, areas that had not been studied previously, and produced what Alexander describes as \\"beautifully drafted charts\\".Tagart, p. 173. In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco, the River Plate area of South America, parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north-west Australia, and other channels and coastlines.Alexander, p. 340. His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh's tutelage in the earlier stages of the Bounty voyage. Bligh, an accomplished draughtsman, had written of Christian and Heywood: \\"These two had been objects of my particular regard and attention, and I had taken great pains to instruct them.\\"Tagart, pp. 175‚Äì76. James Horsburgh, who was hydrographer to the East India Company, wrote that Heywood's work had \\"essentially contributed to making my Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been.\\"Tagart, p. 332. The extent of Heywood's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818, after he had retired from the sea. He declined, and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood's recommendation. = Later service = After a brief period ashore in 1805‚Äì06 Heywood was appointed flag captain to Rear- Admiral Sir George Murray, aboard . In March 1802 Murray's squadron was employed in the transportation of troops from the Cape of Good Hope to South America, in support of a failed British attempt to capture Buenos Aires from the Spanish, who were allied to the French during the Napoleonic wars. Polyphemus remained in the River Plate area, carrying out surveying and merchant vessel protection duties. 1808 saw Heywood back in England, in command of , which in the following year was part of a squadron that attacked and destroyed three French frigates in the Bay of Biscay, an action for which he received the Admiralty's thanks. After taking command of HMS Nereus in May 1809, Heywood served briefly in the Mediterranean under Admiral Lord Collingwood; after Collingwood's death in March 1810 Heywood brought his commander's body back to England. He then took Nereus to South America where he remained for three years, earning the gratitude of the British merchants in that region for his work in protecting trade routes. Heywood's last command was , in which he acted as escort to King Louis XVIII on the latter's return to France in May 1814. He remained with Montagu for the rest of his naval service. Alexander suggests that throughout his later career Heywood suffered a sense of guilt over his pardon,Alexander, pp. 397‚Äì98. knowing that he had \\"perjured himself\\" in saying that he was kept below and therefore prevented from joining Bligh. She believes that Pasley and Graham may have bribed William Cole to testify that Heywood had been held against his will, echoing Thomas Bond, Bligh's nephew, who had asserted in 1792 that \\"Heywood's friends have bribed through thick and thin to save him\\".Alexander, p. 319. John Adams, the last survivor of Christian's Bounty party that sailed to Pitcairn Island, was discovered in 1808. In 1825, interviewed by Captain Edward Belcher, Adams maintained that Heywood was on the gangway, not below, and \\"might have gone [in the open boat] if he pleased.\\" = Retirement and death = On 16 July 1816, Montagu was paid off in Chatham and Heywood finally retired from the sea.Tagart, p. 301. Two weeks later he married Frances Joliffe, a widow whom he had met ten years earlier, and settled with her at Highgate, near London. The couple had no children but, apart from his daughter in Tahiti, there is a suggestion in a will which he signed in 1810 that Heywood had also fathered a British child‚Äîthe will makes provision for one Mary Gray, \\"an infant under my care and protection\\".Alexander, p. 392. In May 1818, Heywood declined command of the Canadian Lakes with the rank of commodore. As he had become content with shore life, he said he would only accept another appointment in the event of war.Tagart, pp. 306‚Äì08 (letter from Heywood to Lord Melville, 19 May 1818). In retirement Heywood published his dictionary of the Tahitian language, wrote papers relating to his profession, and corresponded widely.Tagart, p, 309. He enjoyed a circle of acquaintances which included the writer Charles Lamb, and was a particular friend of the hydrographer Francis Beaufort.Alexander, p. 394. He destroyed much of his writing shortly before his death, but a document from 1829 survives, in which he expresses his views on the unfitness for self- government of Greeks, Turks, Spaniards and Portuguese, the iniquities of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and the doubtful benefits of Catholic emancipation in Ireland.Tagart, pp. 312‚Äì15. Of strong religious convictions, Heywood was increasingly interested in spiritual matters during the last years of his life. His health began to fail in 1828, and he died after suffering a stroke, aged 58, in February 1831.Tagart, pp. 318‚Äì24. He was interred in the vault of Highgate School chapel, where a memorial plaque was dedicated on 8 December 2008. Nessy Heywood had died on 25 August 1793, less than a year after Heywood's pardon. Heywood's adversaries John Hallett and Thomas Hayward both died at sea within three years of the court martial. William Muspratt died in Royal Navy service in 1797 as did James Morrison in 1807. William Bligh served in the battles of Camperdown and Copenhagen before, in 1806, he was appointed Governor of New South Wales. He returned to London in 1810 having suffered a further rebellion by local army officers who opposed Bligh's attempts to reform local practices, as well as his rule by fiat; Bligh was again court-martialed and acquitted. On his retirement he was promoted to rear admiral; he died in 1817. Fletcher Christian, who had taken the Bounty to Pitcairn Island and founded a colony there with a group of hard core mutineers and conscripted Tahitians, was killed in September 1793 during a feud. Christian's last recorded words, supposedly, were \\"Oh, dear!\\"Hough, p. 257.

The palace was first begun by Si Musa, grand vizier of Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman, in 1859 and then continued and expanded by his son Si Ba Ahmed ibn Musa, grand vizier of Sultan Moulay Abdelaziz between 1894 and 1900. Today it is a well-known historic monument and tourist attraction in the city.  History  The Grand Riad of the palace (built by Si Musa), photographed in 1930-31. = 19th century construction = Si Musa was descended from a family of black slaves which served the Moroccan makhzen (royal government) and reached the highest offices in the country. He was first hajib (similar to a chamberlain) then grand vizier under Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman, who reigned from 1859 to 1873. He began the construction of the palace in 1859 and continued during the 1860s. Today, the \\"Grand Riad\\" or large riad garden and its adjoining rooms in the northern part of the palace date from Si Musa's time and are also consequently known as the Dar Si Moussa. The two grand chambers on the east and west sides of the garden contain an inscription which dates their construction to 1866-67. Ba Ahmed ibn Musa (known simply as Ba Ahmed) was hajib to Sultan Moulay Hassan and, upon the latter's death, ensured his son Abdelaziz's accession to the throne in 1894, earning him a promotion to grand vizier. As Abdelaziz was only sixteen, Ba Ahmed became the effective ruler of Morocco until his own death from disease in 1900. He progressively expanded his father's palace throughout these years as grand vizier (1894-1900), adding to it piece by piece as new land became available for purchase. During his tenure, he was also supported by his two brothers Si Sa'id and Idris (who passed away with him in 1900). Si Sa'id built his own palace north of here during that time, the Dar Si Said, which today serves as a museum. Ba Ahmed is responsible for constructing most of the Bahia Palace's southern parts, which included various smaller courtyards and riad gardens. On the east side of this palace complex he also created a vast private park and garden, complete with a central water basin and an access point via a bridge over the adjacent street linking it to the palace. His architect was a man named Muhammad ibn Makki al-Misfiwi, originally from Safi, who was born in 1857 and died in 1926. The palace's growth overtook much of the previously existing neighbourhood north of the Mellah and resulted in major changes in the local street layout. The growing palace housed Ba Ahmed's servants (including his own slaves) and his harem (private family residence), and the name al-Bahia (), meaning \\"the Brilliant\\", was reportedly the name of his favourite wife. The entire palace was built on one level, possibly as Ba Ahmed's own physique (which was described as stout and obese) made it more difficult for him to go up and down stairs. = 20th century to present day = After Ba Ahmed's death his palace became royal property. Mere hours after his passing, Sultan Abdelaziz (who subsequently took full power over the country) reportedly ordered the palace to be looted for valuable items. In 1908 Madani el-Glaoui, brother of Thami el-Glaoui, took control of the palace and used it to entertain foreign guests. He added an upper floor for the first time to some parts of the palace. Then, in 1912, after the installation of the French Protectorate in Morocco, the palace was converted into the residence of the French resident-general (Lyautey) in the city. After Moroccan independence, the palace was again used as a royal residence for King Mohammed V before being transferred to the Moroccan Ministry of Culture under King Hassan II, which turned it into a tourist attraction. Today the palace is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Morocco; the government counted 410,141 visitors from January to April 2019, more than any other heritage site in the country. The palace is occasionally still used by the King of Morocco to receive foreign dignitaries or host events.  Architecture  Layout = The palace's labyrinthine layout, which does not reveal a clear unified plan, is due to the fact that it was expanded in a piecemeal fashion in different stages over many years. It comprises a number of inner courtyards and riad gardens (interior gardens with a symmetrical four-part division), around which are arranged various rooms and chambers. The main palace complex today covers almost 2 hectares. The palace is entered via a horseshoe-arch doorway from the main street, beyond which a long garden path leads to the palace. A minor courtyard leads into the Small Riad (Petit Riad), a square courtyard garden divided by walkways along its two central axes and surrounded by richly decorated galleries and chambers. One of the chambers was Ba Ahmed's diwan or Council Chamber. A second floor apartment above this riad was added by Madani el-Glaoui after Ba Ahmed's death. East of the Small Riad is a small inner courtyard (sometimes simply called the \\"Small Courtyard\\") surrounded by ornate chambers. East of this is the Grand Courtyard or Large Courtyard (also known in French as the Cour d'Honneur), the most impressive part of the palace. Measuring 50 by 30 meters, it is paved with Italian Carrara marble and surrounded by an elegant and colourful wooden gallery. These galleries give access to some 80 rooms which are believed to have been part of Ba Ahmed's harem and the residences of his concubines. At the east end of this courtyard is a grand hall (lknown as the Salle d'Honneur in French), measuring 20 by 8 meters and featuring a high ceiling with some of the best painted decoration in the palace. An inscription dates the construction of this chamber to 1896-1897, which was probably the last major expansion of the palace. West of the Grand Courtyard (more or less between the Small Courtyard to the south and the Great Riad to the north) is a private apartment built by Ba Ahmed in 1898 for his first wife, Lalla Zaynab. North of the Grand Courtyard areas is another vast courtyard known as the Grand Riad or Large Riad. Along with its adjoining rooms, it is the oldest part of the palace and dates from the time of Ba Ahmed's father, Si Musa. The courtyard is occupied, as its name implies, by a very large riad garden which is still planted with trees from the 19th century. The garden is flanked to the east and the west by two grand halls with excellent decoration and an inscription which dates their construction to 1866-67. Further east, beyond the main palace, are the remains of a series of gardens and parks created by Ba Ahmed. Among other elements, they contained a large water basin. On the south side of the palace are other annexes includes stables and a mosque with a minaret. = Decoration = The palace is most famous for its decoration. Its walls feature stucco carved with Arabic inscriptions, geometric patterns, arabesques, and muqarnas. Its floors are paved with marble and zellij tiles. Among its most famous elements are the cedar-wood ceilings painted with colourful floral patterns, along with the carved and painted wooden canopies of major doorways. The materials for this decoration were imported by Ba Ahmed from all over Morocco, including marble from Meknes (possibly from former Moroccan royal palaces), cedar wood from the Middle Atlas, and tiles from Tetouan. Artisans from all across the country were also employed for the job.

Zia al-Din Mas'ud b. Mosleh Shirazi (1236‚Äì1311) () was a 13th-century IranianEncyclopaedia Britannica \\"Qu·π≠b ad-Dƒ´n ash-Shƒ´rƒÅzƒ´ Persian scholar\\" polymath and poet who made contributions to astronomy, mathematics, medicine, physics, music theory, philosophy and Sufism.Sayyed  øAbd-AllƒÅh AnwƒÅr, Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"QO·π¨B-AL-DIN ≈†IRƒÄZI, Ma·∏•mud b. ≈ªiƒÅ æ- al-Din Mas øud b. Mo·π£le·∏•\\", Biography He was born in Kazerun in October 1236 to a family with a tradition of Sufism. His father, Zia' al-Din Mas'ud Kazeruni was a physician by profession and also a leading Sufi of the Kazeruni order. Zia' Al-Din received his Kherqa (Sufi robe) from Shahab al-Din Omar Suhrawardi. Qutb al-Din was garbed by the Kherqa (Sufi robe) as blessing by his father at age of ten. Later on, he also received his own robe from the hands of Najib al-Din Bozgush Shirazni, a famous Sufi of the time. Qu·π≠b al-Din began studying medicine under his father. His father practiced and taught medicine at the Mozaffari hospital in Shiraz. After the passing away of his father (when Qutb al-Din was 14), his uncle and other masters of the period trained him in medicine. He also studied the Qanun (the Canon) of the famous Persian scholar Avicenna and its commentaries. In particular he read the commentary of Fakhr al-Din Razi on the Canon of Medicine and Qutb al-Din raised many issues of his own. This led to his own decision to write his own commentary, where he resolved many of the issues in the company of Nasir al- Din al-Tusi. Qutb al-Din lost his father at the age of fourteen and replaced him as the ophthalmologist at the Mozaffari hospital in Shiraz. At the same time, he pursued his education under his uncle Kamal al-Din Abu'l Khayr and then Sharaf al-Din Zaki Bushkani, and Shams al-Din Mohammad Kishi. All three were expert teachers of the Canon of Avicenna. He quit his medical profession ten years later and began to devote his time to further education under the guidance of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. When Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, the renowned scholar-vizier of the Mongol Holagu Khan established the observatory of Maragha, Qutb al-Din Shirazi became attracted to the city. He left Shiraz sometime after 1260 and was in Maragha about 1262. In Maragha, Qutb al-din resumed his education under Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, with whom he studied the al- Esharat wa'l-Tanbihat of Avicenna. He discussed with al-Tusi the difficulties he had understanding the first book of the Canon of Avicenna. While working in the new observatory, he studied astronomy under al-Tusi. One of the important scientific projects was the completion of the new astronomical table (zij). In his testament (Wasiya), al-Tusi advises his son ·π£il-a-Din to work with Qutb al-Din in the completion of the Zij. Qutb-al-Din's stay in Maragha was short. Subsequently, he traveled to Khorasan in the company of al-Tusi where he stayed to study under Najm al-Din Katebi Qazvini in the town of Jovayn and become his assistant. Some time after 1268, he journeyed to Qazvin, Isfahan, Baghdad and later Konya in Anatolia. This was a time when the Persian poet Jalal al-Din Muhammad Balkhi (Rumi) was gaining fame there and it is reported that Qutb al-Din also met him. In Konya, he studied the Jam'e al-Osul of Ibn Al-Athir with Sadr al-Din Qunawi. The governor of Konya, Mo'in al-Din Parvana appointed him as the judge of Sivas and Malatya. It was during this time that he compiled the books the MeftƒÅ·∏• al-meftƒÅh, EkhtiƒÅrƒÅt al-mo·∫ìaffariya, and his commentary on SakkƒÅki. In the year 1282, he was envoy on behalf of the Ilkhanid Ahmad Takudar to Sayf al-Din Qalawun, the Mamluk ruler of Egypt. In his letter to Qalawun, the Ilkhanid ruler mentions Qutb al-Din as the chief judge. Qutb al-Din during this time collected various critiques and commentaries on Avicenna's Canon and used them on his commentary on the KolliyƒÅt. The last part of Qutb al-Din's active career was teaching the Canon of Avicenna and the Shefa of Avicenna in Syria. He soon left for Tabriz after that and died shortly after. He was buried in the ƒåarandƒÅb cemetery of the city. Shirazi identified observations by the scholar Avicenna in the 11th century and Ibn Bajjah in the 12th century as transits of Venus and Mercury. However, Ibn Bajjah cannot have observed a transit of Venus, as none occurred in his lifetime. Qutb al-Din had an insatiable desire for learning, which is evidenced by the twenty-four years he spent studying with masters of the time in order to write his commentary on the KolliyƒÅt. He was also distinguished by his extensive breadth of knowledge, a clever sense of humor and indiscriminate generosity. He was also a master chess player and played the musical instrument known as the Rabab, a favorite instrument of the Persian poet Rumi.

He was born in Hackney, where his father, Francis Hayward M.D., was a noted physician. Hayward's oldest sister, Ann, was a close friend of Betsy Betham, who married William Bligh. Through Betsy, Hayward managed to obtain a position as a midshipman on the Bounty. His service on the Bounty seems to have been lacklustre, but he remained loyal to Bligh and a staunch opponent of Fletcher Christian, who disliked him immensely. He was the second person ordered into the boat carrying the loyalists, the first being Bligh himself. Heywood also disliked Hayward, calling him a 'worldling', raised a little in society, as a result of which he typically affected airs and graces beyond his station. Upon returning to England with Bligh, Hayward set out as third lieutenant under Captain Edward Edwards on . Although they succeeded in finding some of the mutineers on Tahiti, and Hayward evidently performed well, it was an unfortunate voyage, ending with Pandora shipwrecked, and for the second time in as many years Hayward found himself without a ship, in an open boat making for safety. He eventually returned to England with other survivors from the Pandora, after which his career is uncertain. It has been suggested, based mainly on nearly illegible papers, that Hayward commanded the sloop HMS Swift. If so, he drowned when the ship was lost with all hands in a typhoon in the South China Sea in 1797 or 1798. Hayward is frequently confused with Peter Heywood ‚Äì a fellow Bounty midshipman ‚Äì because of their similar-sounding names. ReferencesFurther reading * Conway, Christiane (2005).

In May 2012 it was declared a national park. Flora and fauna The forest is mainly savannah covered with tall elephant grasses. The main attraction of the park is the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The park holds the largest rhino population in India after Kaziranga National Park in Assam. Other animals in the park include Indian leopard, Indian elephants, sambar, barking deer, spotted deer, hog deer, wild boars, and gaur. Jaldapara is a paradise for bird watchers. It is one of the very few places in India, where the Bengal florican is sighted. The other birds to be found here are the crested eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, shikra, Finn's weaver, jungle fowl, peafowl (peacock), partridge, and lesser pied hornbill. Pythons, monitor lizards, kraits, cobras, geckos, and about eight species of fresh water turtles can also be found here. Many of the animals in the park are endangered, like the Indian one-horned rhino and elephants.

It is known for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and occasionally bad behaviour, including vandalism of restaurants and students' rooms. The club is known to select its members not only on the grounds of wealth and willingness to partake but also by means of education. Former pupils of public schools such as Eton, Harrow, Radley, Shrewsbury, Rugby, Westminster, Charterhouse, St. Paul's, and Winchester form the bulk of its membership. The Bullingdon was originally a sporting club, dedicated to cricket and horse-racing, although club dinners gradually became its principal activity. Membership is expensive, with tailor-made uniforms, regular gourmet hospitality, and a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. The club has attracted controversy, as some members have gone on to become leading figures within Britain's political establishment. These include former Prime Minister David Cameron, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and current Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Bullingdon is regularly featured in fiction and drama, sometimes under its own name, and sometimes easily recognisable under another. History The Bullingdon Club was founded more than 200 years ago. Petre Mais claims it was founded in 1780 and was limited to 30 men,Stuart Petre Brodie Mais, The Story of Oxford, 1951; p. 70 and Viscount Long, who was a member in 1875, described it as \\"an old Oxford institution, with many good traditions\\". Originally it was a hunting and cricket club, and Thomas Assheton Smith the Younger is recorded as having batted for the Bullingdon against Marylebone Cricket Club in 1796.Aubery Noakes, Sportsmen in a Landscape, 1971; p.61 In 1805 cricket at Oxford University \\"was confined to the old Bullingdon Club, which was expensive and exclusive\\". This foundational sporting purpose is attested to in the Club's symbol. The Wisden Cricketer reports that the Bullingdon is \\"ostensibly one of the two original Oxford University cricket teams but it actually used cricket merely as a respectable front for the mischievous, destructive or self-indulgent tendencies of its members\\". By the late 19th century, the present emphasis on dining within the Club began to emerge. Long attested that in 1875 \\"Bullingdon Club [cricket] matches were also of frequent occurrence, and many a good game was played there with visiting clubs. The Bullingdon Club dinners were the occasion of a great display of exuberant spirits, accompanied by a considerable consumption of the good things of life, which often made the drive back to Oxford an experience of exceptional nature\\". A report of 1876 relates that \\"cricket there was secondary to the dinners, and the men were chiefly of an expensive class\\".James Pycroft in London Society, v.30, 1876 (James Hogg, Florence Marrayat ed.); p. 197 The New York Times told its readers in 1913 that \\"The Bullingdon represents the acme of exclusiveness at Oxford; it is the club of the sons of nobility, the sons of great wealth; its membership represents the 'young bloods' of the university\\". =Today= Today, the Bullingdon is primarily a dining club, although a vestige of the Club's sporting links survives in its support of an annual point to point race. The Club President, known as the \\"General\\", presents the winner's cup, and the Club members meet at the race for a champagne breakfast. The Club also meets for an annual Club dinner. Guests may be invited to either of these events. There may also be smaller dinners during the year to mark the initiation of new members or in celebration of other occasions. The club often books private dining rooms under an assumed name, as most restaurateurs are cautious of the Club's reputation as being the cause of considerable drunken damage during the course of their dinners. In 2007, a photograph of the Bullingdon Club taken in 1987 was discovered ‚Äì making British headlines because two of the posing members, Boris Johnson and David Cameron, both of whom had gone on to careers in politics and were, at the time, Mayor of London and Leader of the Conservative party respectively. The copyright owners have since declined to grant permission to use the picture. In recent years, following negative media attention and the Club's apparent depiction in the play Posh and its film adaptation The Riot Club, membership has been supposed to have dwindled: in 2016 it was claimed there were only between four and six members left, all of them postgraduates, with no new undergraduate members joining the previous year; although many consider it more likely that the club has simply resorted to more covert operation in recent times. Many Oxford students cited an unwillingness to be associated with \\"ostentatious wealth celebration\\". In June 2017, members of the Club attempting to shoot their annual Club Photo on the steps of Christ Church were escorted out by college porters for not securing permission for the shoot. Nearby non-member students heckled the club as they left, with one even playing \\"Yakety Sax\\" (the theme song for The Benny Hill Show). Reputation Peckwater Quad, vandalised in 1894 and 1927 The club has always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and boisterous rituals, including the vandalisation of restaurants, public houses, and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. Its ostentatious displays of wealth attract controversy, since some ex-members have subsequently achieved high political stations, most notably the former British Prime Minister David Cameron, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the current Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all the glass of the lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927. As a result of such events, the Club was banned from convening within 15 miles of Oxford. While still Prince of Wales, Edward VIII had a certain amount of difficulty in getting his parents' permission to join the Bullingdon on account of the Club's reputation. He eventually obtained it only on the understanding that he never join in what was then known as a \\"Bullingdon blind\\", a euphemistic phrase for an evening of drink and song. On hearing of his eventual attendance at one such evening, Queen Mary sent him a telegram requesting that he remove his name from the Club. Andrew Gimson, biographer of Boris Johnson, reported about the club in the 1980s: \\"I don't think an evening would have ended without a restaurant being trashed and being paid for in full, very often in cash. [...] A night in the cells would be regarded as being par for a Buller man and so would debagging anyone who really attracted the irritation of the Buller men.\\" In December 2005, Bullingdon Club members smashed 17 bottles of wine, \\"every piece of crockery,\\" and a window at the 15th century White Hart pub in Fyfield near Oxford. The dinner was organised by The Honourable Alexander Fellowes, son of Baron Fellowes and nephew to Diana, Princess of Wales; four members of the party were arrested. A further dinner was reported in 2010 after damage to a country house. In the last few years, the Bullingdon has been mentioned in the debates of the House of Commons in order to draw attention to excessive behaviour across the British class spectrum, and to embarrass prominent Conservative Party politicians who are former members of the Bullingdon. Johnson has since tried to distance himself from the club, calling it \\"a truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness.\\" Dress Bullingdon Colours The Club's colours are sky blue and ivory. Members dress for their annual Club dinner in bespoke tailored tailcoats in dark navy blue, with a matching velvet collar, offset with ivory silk lapel revers, brass monogrammed buttons, a mustard waistcoat, and a sky blue bow tie. There is also a Club tie, which is sky blue striped with ivory. These are all provided by the Oxford branch of court tailors Ede and Ravenscroft. In 2007 the full uniform was estimated to cost ¬£3,500. Traditionally when they played cricket, members \\"were identified by a ribbon of blue and white on their straw hats, and by stripes of the same colours down their flannel trousers\\".Michael MacDonagh, The English king: a study of the monarchy and the royal family, 1929; p. 94 Relationship with the University The Bullingdon is not currently registered with the University of Oxford, 25 March 2009 but members are drawn from among the members of the University. On several occasions in the past, when the club was registered, the University proctors suspended it on account of the rowdiness of members' activities, including suspensions in 1927 and 1956. John Betjeman wrote in 1938 that \\"quite often the Club is suspended for some years after each meeting\\".John Betjeman, An Oxford University Chest, 1938; p. 30 While under suspension, the club has been known to meet in relative secrecy. The club was known to be active in Oxford in 2008/9, although not registered with the University. In his retirement speech as proctor, Professor of Geology Donald Fraser noted an incident which, not being on University premises, was outside their jurisdiction: \\"some students had taken habitually to the drunken braying of ‚ÄòWe are the Bullingdon‚Äô at 3 a.m. from a house not far from the Phoenix Cinema. But the transcript of what they called the wife of the neighbour who went to ask them to be quiet was written in language that is not usually printed\\". In October 2018, the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) announced that members of the Bullingdon Club would be banned from holding office within the Association. OUCA president, Ben Etty, outspokenly stated that the Club's \\"values and activities had no place in the modern Conservative Party'\\". This decision was overturned several weeks later \\"on a constitutional technicality\\", although Etty was confident that \\"that ban will be re-proposed very soon\\". The ban was later re-implemented on appeal to OUCA's Senior Member and remains in effect.  Photographs of club members  A number of the Club's annual photographs have emerged over the years, with each giving insight into its past members. A photograph taken in 1987 depicting David Cameron and Boris Johnson among other members of the club, including Jonathan Ford of the Financial Times, is the best-known example. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, David Cameron said that the photograph was an embarrassment. BBC Two's Newsnight commissioned a painting to recreate the photograph because the photographers who own the copyright objected to its being published on commercial grounds. A photograph taken in 1988, also depicting the future British Prime Minister David Cameron, this time as Club President and standing in the centre of the group, later emerged. It was found by the student newspaper, VERSA, amongst over a dozen other photographs of the club dated between 1950 and 2010 hanging on the wall of the tailor that is believed to have made the members‚Äô suits, and led to a number of other past members being identified. Gillman and Soame, the photographers who own the copyright to the image, withdrew permission for it to be reproduced. VERSA, which discovered the photographs, commissioned sketches to reproduce the scenes depicted in them. A photograph of the club taken in 1992 depicted George Osborne, Nathaniel Philip Rothschild, David Cameron's cousin Harry Mount and Ocado founder Jason Gissing. In 2013, a new photograph emerged of club members flying by private jet to a hunting expedition in South Africa. The photograph is believed to have been taken the previous year. Pictured in the photograph are Hon. Michael Marks, Cassius Nicholas Green, Timothy Aldersly, Charles Clegg and Hon. George Farmer ‚Äì the son of the former treasurer of the Conservative Party, Michael Farmer, Baron Farmer. Documentary David Cameron's and Boris Johnson's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in the UK Channel 4 docu-drama When Boris Met Dave, broadcast on 7 October 2009 on More 4. An Observer Magazine article in October 2011 reviewed George Osborne's membership of the club. Cultural references The Bullingdon is satirised as 'the Bollinger Club' (Bollinger being a notable brand of champagne) in Evelyn Waugh's novel Decline and Fall (1928), where it has a pivotal role in the plot: the mild-mannered hero is blamed for the Bollinger Club's destructive rampage through his college and is sent down. Tom Driberg claimed that the description of the Bollinger Club was a \\"mild account of the night of any Bullingdon Club dinner in Christ Church. Such a profusion of glass I never saw until the height of the Blitz. On such nights, any undergraduate who was believed to have 'artistic' talents was an automatic target.\\"Carpenter, Humphrey. The Brideshead Generation: Evelyn Waugh and his Friends, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1989. Waugh mentions the Bullingdon by name in Brideshead Revisited.Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited, \\"Et in Arcadia ego\\": Chapter Two; Chapman and Hall, 1945. In talking to Charles Ryder, Anthony Blanche relates that the Bullingdon attempted to \\"put him in Mercury\\" in Tom Quad one evening, Mercury being a large fountain in the centre of the Quad. Blanche describes the members in their tails as looking \\"like a lot of most disorderly footmen\\", and goes on to say: \\"Do you know, I went round to call on Sebastian next day? I thought the tale of my evening's adventures might amuse him.\\" This could indicate that Sebastian was not a member of the Bullingdon, although in the 1981 TV adaptation, Lord Sebastian Flyte vomits through the window of Charles Ryder's college room while wearing the famous Bullingdon tails.YouTube ‚Äì Brideshead Revisited ‚Äì Lord Sebastian is sick at youtube.com The 2008 film adaptation of Brideshead Revisited likewise clothes Flyte in the Club tails during this scene, as his fellow revellers chant \\"Buller, Buller, Buller!\\" behind him. A fictional Oxford dining society inspired by clubs like the Bullingdon forms the basis of the play Posh by Laura Wade, staged in April 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre, London. Membership of the club while still a student is depicted in the play as giving a student admission to a secret and corrupt network of influence within the Tory Party later in life. The play was later adapted into the 2014 film The Riot Club. The TV series Trinity, set in a \\"Trinity College\\" in a fictional English city, featured an elite \\"Dandelion Club\\" whose members wore yellow waistcoats like those of the Bullingdon Club and behaved in a similar manner.

BiographyEarly years= The fifth of six children, Edward Edwards was born in Water Newton, a village near Peterborough, to Richard Edwards of Water Newton and Mary Fuller of Caldicot. He was born in 1742 and christened in St Remegius' Church, Water Newton. He never married. On 7 September 1759, age 17, he was commissioned as a lieutenant. To qualify for this commission he would have been required, in addition to passing a lieutenant‚Äôs exam, to produce evidence of at least six years of sea time. No documents have been located to date which would establish exactly when, and under whose patronage, he started his naval career. It is likely he first went to sea as a captain's servant when about 10 years old and subsequently completed at least part of the required sea time as a midshipman. A signature, 'Edwd Edwards‚Äô, inscribed on a document witnessing the Will of one Isaac Bishopbridge serving \\"on Board His Majestys Ship of Warr the Devonshire,\\" suggests that Edwards may have sailed under Captain John Moore on HMS Devonshire in April 1756. His naval career after he was commissioned included service in the following ships, before being appointed to Pandora: * , a 64-gun third rate, as fourth lieutenant * , a 32-gun fifth rate, as second lieutenant * HMS Zephyr, a 14-gun sloop, as first lieutenant, under Captain J. Inglis * HMS Ferret, a 14-gun sloop, as first lieutenant * , a 28-gun sixth rate, as second lieutenant * , a 60-gun fourth rate, as third lieutenant, later promoted to first lieutenant * , a 64-gun third rate, as first lieutenant, under Captain Francis Reynolds (later the Earl of Ducie) * , an 8-gun bomb vessel, 22 April 1778 ‚Äì 5 December 1780, commanding officer * HMS Hornet, a 14-gun sloop, commanding officer; service in the Caribbean. Promoted to post captain on 25 April 1781, and transferred to command HMS Narcissus * , a 20-gun sixth rate, (25 May 1781), paid off on 27 March 1784 =Pandora and the Bounty= He spent the following six years on half-pay after the end of the American Revolutionary war; until 6 August 1790, when he was appointed to take command of the frigate Pandora. He received new orders on 11 August to prepare his new command for a journey to \\"remote parts\\", on a mission in pursuit of the Bounty mutineers. With the help of former Bounty midshipman Thomas Hayward - a Bligh loyalist recently returned to England from the South Pacific - Edwards succeeded in finding fourteen men (Bligh had stated that four of these were loyal but could not be accommodated on the over-full launch with the other loyal men; so Edwards found ten mutineers), but the Pandora foundered on the Great Barrier Reef on 29 August 1791 during the journey home from the South Pacific. Four of the ten mutineers and 31 of Pandoras crew died in the destruction of the ship. After an arduous open boat voyage from the wreck to Timor and on to Batavia (Jakarta), only 78 men of Pandoras original 134-strong crew eventually reached England, accompanied by six mutineers and four loyalists. For Hayward this was the second time in as many years that had he found himself in an open boat making for a safe haven in the Dutch East Indies.Alexander, Caroline. The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty. Penguin Books 2004 Edwards was court-martialed on 17 September 1792 for the loss of the Pandora. Immediately prior to the proceedings, he submitted to the Admiralty his account of the events leading up to the sinking. All of his officers supported Edwards' contention that the frigate had been lost due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. The court- martial was attended by William Dillon, then a midshipman, who later became a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and described Edwards in his memoirs as a \\"fine, venerable- looking officer. His appearance completely absorbed all my attention during the trial, and I felt an inward satisfaction at the result, after all the hardships and dangers he had overcome\\". Captain Edwards and his officers were exonerated and subsequently Edwards served for a few years as a 'regulating' captain (recruiting officer) in Argyll and Hull and then resigned himself to inactivity on the half pay list. However, he was promoted to vice- admiral in 1809 and eventually ended his career as Admiral of the White, titularly the third most senior officer in the Royal Navy. He died in his native place - Stamford, Lincolnshire - aged 73, in 1815. Edwards was buried in St Remigius Church in Water Newton, a village in Huntingdonshire. His reputation and character were effectively blackened by members of the Heywood family, who were unable to forgive him for what they perceived as excessively harsh treatment of their son, Bounty midshipman Peter Heywood, who was tried and convicted as a mutineer and pardoned. Yet Edwards had staunch supporters among other officers who had served under his command and he was also remembered by his niece as a \\"sweet old man\\", often out on a walk in the country lanes around his native Water Newton and Uppingham where he owned several farms. According to an obituary in the Lincoln, Stamford & Rutland Mercury (21 April 1815), he suffered for the rest of his life from the effects of the hardships he endured during the open boat voyage to Timor after the loss of the Pandora. This could be the reason the Admiralty never appointed him to a seagoing command after his court-martial in 1792. Legacy Notwithstanding his niece's fond memories, Edwards' conduct on the Pandora has been regarded in some circles as every bit as cruel as popular opinion claims that William Bligh was on the Bounty.Queensland Museum HMS Pandora Edwards, as ordered, kept his captives in close confinement, as if they had already been convicted, in spite of the fact that four of them had been identified by Bligh as being innocent and were subsequently acquitted at the court martial in Portsmouth. Edwards was accused of being excessively callous when it came to the captives' well-being - for instance by refusing to let them use an old sail to prevent them from being sunburned on a sand cay, and also by collectively referring to, and treating them all as mutineers and pirates. Indeed, one of his officers, Lieutenant John Larkan (1746‚Äì1830), is alleged to have been \\"brutal\\" to the prisoners, which Edwards allegedly condoned. One of Edwards' main detractors was Commodore Sir Thomas Pasley, uncle of convicted mutineer Peter Heywood, whose measured tone in one of his letters to Heywood leaves no doubt about his disapproval of 'that fellow' Edwards; he was especially critical of the prisoners' confinement in 'Pandora's Box'. Pasley omits to mention how he would have handled the situation had command been his. Presumably he might have occasionally let the prisoners out of their captivity location; thus, midshipmen Stewart and Heywood might have been allowed to spend some time walking the quarterdeck, as Peter Heywood was permitted to do after his transhipment to HMS Gorgon in Cape Town during the last stage of his voyage home. Much was made of this by Heywood‚Äôs friends and defenders during his court martial, as if to underscore their plea that Edwards' conduct towards the prisoners had been excessively harsh and that Heywood had already suffered disproportionately and therefore had, in fact, already been punished. Most damningly, Edwards is often accused of excessive callousness towards the prisoners by keeping all of them locked up in the prison cell after the frigate had run aground. Moreover, besides the fact that three prisoners were immediately ordered out of the cell to help the crew man the pumps; while several hours later, after the decision had been made to abandon ship because she could not be saved, it is not certain that Edwards gave orders to release the remaining prisoners. Some saved themselves only because Joseph Hodges, the armourer's mate, knocked off the prisoners irons, but he was not able to complete the job because the ship sank very quickly. Even though six of the captives were found guilty of mutiny, only three of them ‚Äì Millward, Burkitt and Ellison ‚Äì were eventually executed; William Muspratt was acquitted on a legal technicality and the remaining two, Peter Heywood and James Morrison were subsequently pardoned by the King. Edwards' search for the mutiny ringleaders ultimately proved fruitless, but his voyages might have provided clues to the fate of one of the 18th century's greatest mysteries, the fate of the Lap√©rouse expedition. When passing Vanikoro, Santa Cruz Islands in the Pacific Ocean on 13 August 1791, smoke signals were observed rising from the island. However Edwards, who was only interested in prisoners, reasoned that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, so he ignored the smoke and sailed on. Sven Wahlroos, in his 1989 book, Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas, suggests that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lap√©rouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time; three years after the Boussole and Astrolabe had foundered in 1788.Wahlroos, Sven. Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas, Salem House Publishers, c/o Harper & Row, New York, NY, 1989 Later life Edwards is said to have retired to Cornwall; according to a story linking him to the 'Pandora Inn' along Restronguet Creek near Mylor, which he is alleged to have owned and renamed after retiring from the Navy. However, there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. Rather, together with a story about a figurehead adorning the Inn's stairwell, said to be based on an 18th-century original from the Pandora; this claim can be confidently refuted and relegated to the realm of creative copy-writing to advertise the inn, which according to cadastral records was called 'The Passage House' until 1851, following the death of Alexander Luben, tenant and Restronguet Passage boatman from 1823 until his death in 1848.

Japanese mythology. This Japanese dragon symbolized the power of the ocean, had a large mouth, and was able to transform into a human shape. He is considered a good god and patron of Japan, since the Japanese population has for several centuries lived off the sea and seafood. Ry≈´jin is also credited with the challenge of a hurricane that sunk the Mongolian flotilla sent by Kublai Khan. Ry≈´jin lived in Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç, his palace under the sea built out of red and white coral, from where he controlled the tides with magical tide jewels. Sea turtles, fish and jellyfish are often depicted as Ry≈´jin's servants. Ry≈´jin was the father of the beautiful goddess Toyotama-hime who married the hunter prince Hoori. The first Emperor of Japan, Emperor Jimmu, is said to have been a grandson of Otohime and Hoori's. Thus, Ry≈´jin is said to be one of the ancestors of the Japanese imperial dynasty. Alternative legends According to legend, the Empress Jing≈´ was able to carry out her attack into Korea with the help of Ry≈´jin's tide jewels. Upon confronting the Korean navy, Jing≈´ threw the into the sea, and the tide receded. The Korean fleet was stranded, and the men got out of their ships. Jing≈´ then threw down the and the water rose, drowning the Korean soldiers. An annual festival, called Gion Matsuri, at Yasaka Shrine celebrates this legend. Another legend involving Ry≈´jin is the story about how the jellyfish lost its bones. According to this story, Ry≈´jin wanted to eat monkey's liver (in some versions of the story, to heal an incurable rash), and sent the jellyfish to get him a monkey. The monkey managed to sneak away from the jellyfish by telling him that he had put his liver in a jar in the forest and offered to go and get it. As the jellyfish came back and told Ry≈´jin what had happened, Ry≈´jin became so angry that he beat the jellyfish until its bones were crushed.

It is the chief town of the province of the same name, and is noted for its buildings in shades of blue. Chefchaouen is situated just inland from Tangier and T√©touan. History The city was founded in 1471https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg;=PA208#v=onepage&q;=morocco&f;=false A history of the Maghreb in the Islamic period as a small kasbah (fortress) by Moulay Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a descendant of Abd as-Salam al-Alami and Idris I, and through them, of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Al-Alami founded the city to fight the Portuguese invasions of northern Morocco.Fiche technique de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Chefchaouen , ÿ¥ŸÅÿ¥ÿßŸàŸÜ Along with the Ghomara tribes of the region, many Moriscos and Jews settled here after the Spanish Reconquista in medieval times.Espa√±a y Marruecos, ejemplos de Interculturalidad a trav√©s de la lengua - by Francisco Moscoso Garc√≠a After eight years of the creation of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco the Spanish Army could effectively take Chaouen, when General D√°maso Berenguer occuppied the city on 14 October 1920. Following the , Chaouen was part of the Republic of the Rif (led by Abd el- Krim el-Khattabi) from 1924 to 1926. In September 1925, in the middle of the Rif War, a rogue squadron of American volunteer pilots, including veterans of World War I, bombarded civilians in Chaouen. Colonel Charles Michael Sweeney had proposed the idea to French Prime Minister Paul Painlev√©, who \\"warmly welcomed the Colonel‚Äôs request.\\" After al-Khattabi was defeated with the help of the French, he was deported to R√©union. The Spanish Army retook the city in 1926. Background hamam in Chefchaouen Chefchaouen ‚Äì or Chaouen, as it is often called by Moroccans ‚Äì is a popular tourist destination because of its proximity to Tangier and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. There are approximately two hundred hotels catering to the summer influx of European tourists. One distinction possessed by Chefchaouen is its blue-rinsed houses and buildings. Chefchaouen is a popular shopping destination as well, as it offers many native handicrafts that are not available elsewhere in Morocco, such as wool garments and woven blankets. The goat cheese native to the area is also popular with tourists. The countryside around it has a reputation for being a prolific source of kief. The Chefchaouen region is one of the main producers of cannabis in Morocco. A nearby attraction is the Kef Toghobeit Cave, one of the deepest caves in Africa. Chefchaouen's blue walls are a popular subject of interest. There are several theories as to why the walls were painted blue. One popular theory is that the blue keeps mosquitos away. The blue is said to symbolize the sky and heaven, and serve as a reminder to lead a spiritual life. However, according to some locals, the walls were mandated to be painted blue simply to attract tourists at some point in the 1970s. The growing tourist industry is geared especially towards Spanish tourists, who are numerous during great Catholic feasts like Semana Santa and Christmas. Places of worship The city's oldest and historically most important mosque is the Great Mosque located at Place Uta Hammam at the heart of the medina. On a hill overlooking the town to the east there is also a disaffected mosque built by the Spanish in the 1920s, now a popular lookout point. Also of great historical and religious importance to the city is the mausoleum dedicated to the patron saint of northern Morocco's Jebalah region, Moulay Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami. His tomb and the village surrounding it is roughly 50 kilometers northwest of from Chefchaouen on the old road to Larache.  Tourism  A souvenir from Chaouen The beauty of Chefchaouen's mountainous surroundings are enhanced by the contrast of the brightly painted medina (old town). It is this beauty and the relaxed atmosphere of the town that makes Chefchaouen very attractive to visitors. The main square in the medina is lined with cafes and filled to the brim with locals and tourist mingling easily. Another reason why backpackers love Chefchaouen is the easy availability of drugs. Tourism in Chaouen is driven by its reputation as center of the marijuana plantations region in north Morocco. During the summer approximately 200 hotels cater to the influx of European tourists.

It was created on 25 May 1810, as a result of the events of the May Revolution. The Junta initially had representatives from only Buenos Aires. When it was expanded, as expected, with the addition of the representatives from the other cities of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, it became popularly known instead as the Junta Grande (Grand Council). The Junta operated at El Fuerte (the fort, where the modern Casa Rosada stands), which had been used since 1776 as a residence by the Viceroys. Creation This Junta‚Äîofficially named the Junta Provisional Gubernativa de las Provincias del R√≠o de la Plata a nombre del Se√±or Don Fernando VII (Provisional Governing Junta of the Provinces of R√≠o de la Plata in the Name of Lord Don Ferdinand VII)‚Äîallegedly meant to govern in the name of the King of Spain, while he was imprisoned by Napoleon Bonaparte. Juntas were a form of transitional or emergency government, which attempted to maintain Spanish sovereignty, that emerged during the Napoleonic invasion in Spanish cities that had not succumbed to the French. The most important for Spanish America was the Junta of Seville, which claimed sovereignty over the overseas possessions, given the fact that the province of Seville historically had enjoyed exclusive rights to the American trade. Its claims had been rejected by Spanish Americans, and its authority was quickly superseded by a Supreme Central Junta of Spain, which included American representation. Open cabildo of 22 May decided to replace the viceroy with a Junta. When the Supreme Central Junta abolished itself in 1810, the politically active inhabitants of Buenos Aires saw no better moment than this to establish a local government. They had been influenced by the recent democratic and republican philosophical wave, and were also concerned about the commercial monopoly exerted by the Spanish crown, which was suffocating the local economy. Historically Buenos Aires province had partially mitigated this problem through contraband. Local politicians, such as former council member and legal advisor to the viceroy, Juan Jos√© Castelli, who wanted a change towards self-government and free commerce, cited traditional Spanish political theory and argued that the King being imprisoned, sovereignty had returned to the people. The people were to assume the government until the King returned, just as the subjects in Spain had done two years earlier with the establishment of juntas. The Viceroy and his supporters countered that the colonies belonged to Spain and did not have a political relationship with only the King. Therefore, they should follow any governmental body established in Spain as the legal authority, namely the Supreme Central Junta of Spain and its successor, the Council of Regency. The meeting of a Buenos Aires cabildo abierto (an extraordinary meeting of the municipal council with assistance of over 200 notables from government, the church, guilds and other corporations) during 22 May 1810, came under strong pressure from the militias and a crowd that formed in front of the cabildo hall on the Plaza Mayor (today the Plaza de Mayo), up to 25 May. The crowd favored the stance of the local politicians, and the cabildo ended up creating the Primera Junta, the first form of local government in the territory that would later become Argentina. Spain would never recover its dominion over that territory. From the very beginning of the new government, two factions manifested their differences, a more radical one, whose visible leader was the Junta's Secretary, Mariano Moreno, and the conservative wing that supported the Junta's President, Cornelio Saavedra. In general the principles of the May Revolution were popular sovereignty, the principle of representation and federalization, division of powers, the maintenance of the mandates, and publication of the government's actions Personnel 1897 lithograph of the members of the Primera Junta. President * Cornelio Saavedra Secretaries: * Mariano Moreno * Juan Jos√© Paso Committee member * Manuel Alberti * Miguel de Azcu√©naga * Manuel Belgrano * Juan Jos√© Castelli * Domingo Matheu * Juan Larrea  Duration and transformation  Mariano Moreno, Secretary of War, was one of the most important members of the Primera Junta. Despite the replacement of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, the Royal Audience and the Cabildo stood with the authorities that existed before the revolution, who opposed the Junta since its first day. The Audience refused at first to swear allegiance to the Junta, and when they finally did, prosecutor Caspe did so with clear gestures of contempt. Caspe would be later ambushed near his home, in retaliation for this.Galasso, Norberto, pp. 6‚Äì7 The Cabildo imposed a time limit on the Junta: if the General Congress was not formed in six months, the Cabildo would reassume government. The Junta answered the same day, rejecting such requirements. The Audience then requested that the Junta submitted to the Regency Counsel, but the Junta refused, on the grounds that Cisneros did not so submit and the Audience did not request him to. The Audience itself swore allegiance to the Counsel shortly after, and they were all banished in response. Together with the ex-viceroy Cisneros, they were forced to take the ship Dart that left them at the Canary Islands; the exceptions were M√°rquez del Plata, who was at the Banda Oriental at the time, and the octogenarian Lucas Mu√±oz Cubero.Galasso, Norberto, pp. 11 From the early days of the Primera Junta there was a strong rivalry between Saavedra and Moreno. According to Ignacio N√∫√±ez, the Morenists accused Saavedra of plotting to restore the tyranny of the viceroys in his office, while the Saavedrists accused Moreno of usurping government roles that were not intended for him.Galasso, Norberto, pp. 12 Matheu would also point in his memories that the Morenists were upset because they perceived that Saavedra enjoyed receiving honors and distinctions that they had chosen to avoid. The Junta was received with mixed reactions from the other cities of the viceroyalty. Santa Fe, Entre R√≠os, Misiones, Corrientes and Mendoza supported the change, others did not. Upper Peru, which greatly benefited from the system of mita to exploit the mines in Potosi, supported the absolutist system for a long time. Javier De El√≠o in Montevideo denied recognition to the Junta. Paraguay was torn between supporters of either side, but royalists prevailed. However, the most immediate danger to the Junta came from Cordoba, where Santiago de Liniers came out of his retirement and started to organize an army to lead a counter-revolution against Buenos Aires. The Junta ordered Ortiz de Ocampo to stand against those counter-revolutionaries and bring the leaders as prisoners to Buenos Aires. A later ruling requested instead to execute them, but after defeating Liniers, Ortiz de Ocampo decided to ignore the latter and instead to follow the first ruling. The Junta removed Ocampo from his duty for this act of disobedience, and replaced him with Juan Jos√© Castelli. Castelli ordered the execution of the counter-revolutionaries by August, 26, with the exception of the priest Orellana. By this time, Mariano Moreno was popularly regarded as the leader of the revolution, whose resolution permitted the radical changes to the absolutist system that the Junta had managed so far.Galasso, Norberto, pp. 22 There's some controversy among historians about the authenticity of the Operations plan, a secret document attributed to Mariano Moreno, that set a harsh government policy in the fields of economics, politics and international relations. Military authorities, fearing the loss of power by Saavedra, pressured the Junta to control Moreno. Moreno, on the other hand, succeeded in getting the approval of decrees that limited Saavedra and others. By December 1810 tension had reached its peak. Saavedra got the support of deputies sent by the interior provinces that had not yet been allowed to join the Junta. With this backing, Saavedra gave Moreno his most serious political setback: he forced Moreno to present his resignation on 18 December. With this resignation, the integration of the deputies from the other provinces to the Junta became possible. Created on 25 May 1810, the Primera Junta was thus transformed on 18 December of the same year into the new Junta Grande by the introduction of representatives from other provinces of R√≠o de la Plata. Foreign policy The Primera Junta was concerned with the risk of Portuguese expansionism towards La Plata, either directly or through the Carlotist project. The diplomacy in Spain attempted to prevent the dispatch of a punitive army, limiting the armed conflicts to the royalists in Paraguay, the Upper Peru and the Banda Oriental. The Junta declared itself a natural ally of any city that revolts against the royalists; either those that did so in support of the May Revolution or those who revolted on their own (Chile, and Paraguay shortly after Belgrano's defeat).Abad de Santill√°n, p. 571 Britain, allied with Spain in the Napoleonic Wars, stayed neutral in the conflicts between patriots and royalists. Nevertheless, the British policy towards the conflict was to favour British trade as long as it did not conflict with the neutral policy. Bibliography * * Halper√≠n-Donghi, Tulio.

History  Scan of Figure 2, from Darwin's Descent of Man, second edition, illustrating Darwin's tubercle This atavistic feature is so called because its description was first published by Charles Darwin in the opening pages of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, as evidence of a vestigial feature indicating common ancestry among primates which have pointy ears. However, Darwin himself named it the Woolnerian tip, after Thomas Woolner, a British sculptor who had depicted it in one of his sculptures and had first theorised that it was an atavistic feature.  Prevalence  The feature is present in approximately 10.4% of the Spanish adult population, 40% of Indian adults, and 58% of Swedish school children. This acuminate nodule represents the point of the mammalian ear. The trait can potentially be bilateral, meaning present on both ears, or unilateral, where it is present on only one ear. There is mixed evidence in regard to whether the bilateral or unilateral expression is related to population, or other factors. Some populations express full bilateral, while others may express either unilateral or bilateral. However, bilateral appears to be more common than unilateral as it pertains to the expression of the trait.  Inheritance  The gene for Darwin's tubercle was once thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance, meaning that those who possess the allele (version of a gene) will not necessarily present with the phenotype. However, genetic and family studies have demonstrated that the presence of Darwin's tubercle may be more likely to be influenced by one's environment or developmental accidents than it is by genetics alone. There is no clear argument for whether the trait has significance in sexual dimorphism studies or age related studies. In some studies, there is clear data that Darwin's tubercle is not associated with sex. In contrast, others indicate that there is a correlation with sexual dimorphism between men and women, where men tend to have the tubercle more than women in some populations. Two studies indicate that older men tend to have greater expression of Darwin's tubercle than do older women.

The channel features programming focusing on the fields of wilderness survival, ufology, manufacturing, construction, technology, space, prehistory and animal science. As of February 2015, Science is available to approximately 75.5 million pay television households (64.8% of households with at least one television set) in the United States. History In November 1994, Discovery Networks announced plans for four digital channels set to launch in 1996. Discovery originally named the network under the working title Quark!; this was changed before its launch to the Discovery Science Network. Discovery Science launched in October 1996 as part of the simultaneous rollout of the new channel suite (alongside Discovery Home & Leisure, Discovery Kids and Discovery Civilization). In 2007, adult shows began airing around the clock weekdays, while younger children shows began airing around the clock weeknights. The channel has undergone various rebrandings throughout its history. Its name was first modified to the Discovery Science Channel in 1998, and then was renamed The Science Channel in 2002, as the first network in the Discovery Networks digital suite to drop the \\"Discovery\\" brand from its name (however, international versions of the channel continue to use the \\"Discovery Science\\" name). The channel later shortened its name to just Science Channel in 2007 as part of a rebrand that included the introduction of a new logo based on the periodic table; in 2011, the network rebranded as simply Science, introducing a new logo and graphics package designed by Imaginary Forces.Science Channel Rebranding As Science Broadcasting & Cable April 5, 2011 In 2008, the channel changed its programming to adult-oriented, and removing all shows for elementary children. NewsFlash.com April 3, 2008 =High definition= The channel launched a high definition simulcast feed that broadcasts in 1080i; it was launched on September 1, 2009, along with Discovery Channel HD, TLC HD and Animal Planet HD. Programming This is a list of programs broadcast by the Science Channel. Science broadcasts a number of science-related television series originally produced by or aired on Discovery Channel, such as Beyond Tomorrow, among others. Discovery Communications has also produced a few programs specifically for Science, such as MegaScience and What The Ancients Knew. Programs from other Discovery Networks channels, PBS and the BBC are either regularly or occasionally aired on the network. Television series produced in the 1990s, such as Discover Magazine and Understanding, are carried on the network's weekday schedule. Science also broadcasts programs such as Moments of Impact and An Idiot Abroad. The channel has infrequently added reruns of several science fiction series like Firefly, Helix and Fringe to its schedule. International International versions of Science currently exist in Southeast Asia, Europe, France, United Kingdom, Italy, India, Sweden, Turkey, Canada, Latin America and Australia.

The present-day Kanha area is divided into two protected areas, Hallon and Banjar, of , respectively. Kanha National Park was created on 1 June 1955 and was designated a tiger reserve in 1973. Today, it encompasses an area of in the two districts Mandla and Balaghat. Together with a surrounding buffer zone of and the neighbouring Phen Sanctuary, it forms the Kanha Tiger Reserve, which is one of the biggest in the country. This makes it the largest national park in central India. The park hosts Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, sloth bear, barasingha and dhole. It is also the first tiger reserve in India to officially introduce a mascot, Bhoorsingh the Barasingha.  Flora  Kanha Tiger Reserve is home to over 1000 species of flowering plants. The lowland forest is a mixture of sal (Shorea robusta) and other mixed-forest trees, interspersed with meadows. The highland forests are tropical moist, dry deciduous type and of a completely different nature from bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) on slopes. A notable Indian ghost tree (Davidia involucrata) can also be seen in the dense forest. Fauna Kanha Tiger Reserve hosts populations of tiger, leopard, wild dog, foxes and jackals. Barasingha (Cervus duavcelli branderi) is adapted to hard ground. Gaur (Bos gaurus) inhabits meadows and waterholes in the park. Blackbuck has become very rare.A. P. Dwivendi: Protected Areas of Madhya Pradesh, Government printing Press, Bhopal 2003 The reserve hosts around 300 species of birds and the most commonly seen birds are the black ibis, bee-eaters, cattle egret, blossom-headed parakeets, pond herons, drongos, common teal, crested serpent eagle, grey hornbill, Indian roller, lesser adjutant, little grebes, lesser whistling teal, minivets, Malabar pied hornbill, woodpeckers, pigeon, paradise flycatchers, mynas, Indian peafowl, red junglefowl, red-wattled lapwing, steppe eagle, Tickell's blue flycatcher, white-eyed buzzard, white-breasted kingfisher, white-browed fantail, wood shrikes, and warblers, vultures among many more. Reintroduction of barasingha An exciting conservation effort in this national park is the reintroduction of barasingha. The gaur will be relocated to Bandhavgarh and some barasingha will be relocated to Satpura Tiger Reserve The objective of this project is to introduce about 500 barasingha in this national park to eight or nine different locations. There is also a project to capture about twenty tigers and relocate them to Satpura Tiger Reserve.sala Reintroduction of Barasingha: Kanha National Park ‚Äì Satpura Tiger Reserve  Tiger conservation and the Baiga tribe  Members of the Baiga tribe, a semi- nomadic tribe of central India that is reliant on the forest, lived in 28 villages that had been within the Kanha National Park until 1968, when they were relocated. The relocation was part of an effort to maintain a critical tiger habitat. The land to which they were relocated is barren and they now suffer from alcoholism and malnourishment, and beg to support themselves. The last of the villages to be relocated for the tiger habitat is in the core zone of the Kanha Tiger Reserve. The area is the ancestral home of the Gond and Baiga tribes. In January 2010, Baiga tribe were illegally evicted from the park without proper compensation from the government, according to Survival International. In its efforts to maintain and restore tiger habitats, WWF- India has worked to create corridors that support the tigers and their prey, thereby stabilizing the tiger population. This includes efforts to prevent loss of life or property of humans, reduce human dependency on the forest, and reduce retaliatory killings of tigers when people have experienced losses. However, Kanha's frontline staff continue to receive support, training and equipment from WWF, even as they carry out the eviction of the 22,000 residents who are to be forcibly resettled from tiger reserves in the region. Transportation and access The Jabalpur Airport / 04:30hrs) has direct flights to and from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Belgaum and Bhopal, with AirIndia, SpiceJet and Indigo operating daily flights. Nagpur (Mukki and Raipur (Mukki ) have other airports. Jabalpur is major railway stations with train connectivity across India. From Jabalpur, the best way to travel is via Mandla, which has a tourist taxi service to the park, and one can reach up to Chiraidongri the newly added Broad Gauge stationIndian Railway via jabalpur, Nainpur railway route to enter national park through Kanha gate. In pre-planned journey one of shortest road route is Jabalpur-Bargi Dam- Ganhsor-Thanwar Dam-Chiraidongri-Kanha National Park. Other route Jabalpur to Mandla (via NH-30)-Chiraidongri- Kanha route is preferred when arrival permission is to be taken from National Park authority at Mandla. This National Park can also be approached from Raipur - Gandai - Malanjkhand - Baihar highway route via Mukki Gate to National Park. M.P. Tourism and Private owners has hotels, resorts near to Mukki Gate. Similar stay facilities is also available at Khatia and Kanha Gate. There are three gates for entrance into the park. The Kanha/Kisli gate is best accessed from Jabalpur and stops at the village Khatia, inside the buffer area. The second gate is at Mukki and the third, most recently opened, gate is at Sarhi. Ecosystem valuation An economic assessment study of Kanha Tiger Reserve estimated that the tiger reserve provides flow benefits worth 16.5 billion rupees (0.80 lakh / hectare) annually. Important ecosystem services from the tiger reserve include gene- pool protection (12.41 billion year), provisioning of water to downstream regions (558 million) and provisioning of fodder in buffer areas (546 million). Other services included recreation value (384 million), provision of habitat and refugia for wildlife (319 million) and sequestration of carbon (219 million).

The South-Western front of the Red Army supported a similar Galician Revolutionary Committee (Galrevkom), seated in Tarnopol in Eastern Galicia. The TKRP was met with relative enthusiasm in Bia≈Çystok which had about 75% Jewish and working class majority. However as the Red Army moved on towards Warsaw, it and Polrewkom had little support from the Polish population. Ronald Grigor Suny, The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States, Oxford University Press, , Google Print, p.106 On 22 August 1920 the Polrevkom moved out of Bia≈Çystok to Minsk with the defeat of the Red Army, and was dissolved soon afterwards. A significant number of the key persons involved were later instrumental in creation of the Polish Autonomous District within the Soviet Union.

It appears on the album Astral Weeks, released in 1968. The song features Morrison performing the vocals and acoustic guitar. It also features a double bass, flute, drums, vibraphone, and a string quartet. Recording and composition \\"Madame George\\" was recorded during the first Astral Weeks session that took place on 25 September 1968, at Century Sound Studios in New York City with Lewis Merenstein as producer.Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p. 518 The main theme of the song is about leaving the past behind. The character of Madame George is considered by many to be a drag queen, although Morrison himself denied this in a Rolling Stone interview.1970 Rolling Stone Interview He later claimed that the character was based on six or seven different people: \\"It's like a movie, a sketch, or a short story. In fact, most of the songs on Astral Weeks are like short stories. In terms of what they mean, they're as baffling to me as to anyone else. I haven't got a clue what that song is about or who Madame George might have been.\\"Uncut Magazine July 2005 issue Van Morrison, speaking to biographer Ritchie Yorke about the writing and meaning of the song, said in part: > \\"Madame George\\" was recorded live. The vocal was live and the rhythm section > and the flute too and the strings were the only overdub. The title of the > song confuses one, I must say that. The original title was \\"Madame Joy\\" but > the way I wrote it down was \\"Madame George\\". Don't ask me why I do this > because I just don't know. The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, > as is \\"Cyprus Avenue\\"...\\"Madame George\\" just came right out. The song is > basically about a spiritual feeling.Yorke, Into the Music, pp. 60‚Äì61 An earlier recording with slightly altered lyrics and a much swifter tempo changes the tone considerably from the Astral Weeks recording, which is downbeat and nostalgic; the earlier recording is joyous, and seems to be from the point of view of a partygoer who sees the titular character. This version surfaced on the 1973 release T.B. Sheets, which compiled unreleased recordings Morrison had made for Bang Records in 1967. This song contains a number of references to places and events in Van Morrison's native Belfast: Cyprus Avenue (also the title of another song on Astral Weeks) is a tree lined, up- market residential street in east Belfast; \\"throwing pennies at the bridges down below\\" was a practice of Northern Irish Unionists as they travelled on the train from Dublin to Belfast where the train crossed the River Boyne (site of the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); the train from Dublin arrived in Belfast at one end of Sandy Row, a working class staunchly Unionist/Protestant street and neighbourhood. Fitzroy may be a reference to Fitzroy Avenue, a narrow residential street in Belfast between the Ormeau Road and Rugby Road. Comedian Frankie Boyle suggested it was a song about Van Morrison's mother in a video on Instagram. This is suggested by the line \\"With a childlike vision leaping into view Clicking, clacking of the high heeled shoe.\\" Boyle suggests this is a child walking behind his mother down the street. This, according to Boyle is why Van Morrison is so miserable, as no one understands what he is saying. Reception The rock journalist Lester Bangs wrote in 1979 that the song \\"is the album's whirlpool. Possibly one of the most compassionate pieces of music ever made, it asks us, no, arranges that we see the plight of what I'll be brutal and call a lovelorn drag queen with such intense empathy that when the singer hurts him, we do too.\\" Bangs also remarks that \\"Morrison has said in at least one interview that the song has nothing to do with any kind of transvestite ‚Äì at least as far as he knows, he is quick to add ‚Äì but that's bullshit.\\" Indeed, the lyrics contain the lines \\"In the corner playing dominoes in drag/The one and only Madame George\\". Artist Mark Wallinger said of \\"Madame George\\": \\"The sense of desire and loss expressed in this song is so sad because it dares one to try to hear it again as if for the first time. It describes our exile from our past. Radical, allusive, heartbreaking, and the ultimate three-chord trick.\\" In 1974, after he had recorded eight albums, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke when he asked him what he considered his finest single track and the one that he enjoyed the most that it was: \\"Definitely 'Madame George', definitely. I'm just starting to realize it more and more. It just seems to get at you... it just lays right in there, that whole track. The vocals and the instruments and the whole thing. I like that one.\\"Yorke, Into the Music, p. 169 Influence Always a favorite of rock critics, \\"Madame George\\" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and it was listed as No. 467 on the All Time 885 Greatest Songs compiled in 2004 by WXPN (88.5 FM) from listener's votesAll Time 885 Greatest Songs and No. 356 in 2014.885 All Time Greatest Songs Madame George appears in the \\"Black Boys on Mopeds\\" lyrics of Sin√©ad O'Connor: \\"England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses\\" suggesting that she is a legendary figure. David Gray pays tribute to the song on the final track of his album White Ladder, with his cover version of the Soft Cell song, \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\", which ends similarly and even borrows lyrics \\"Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow, say goodbye. Get on the train, the train and say goodbye\\". In David A. Stewart and the Spiritual Cowboy's song \\"Out of Reach\\", from the album Honest, there is a line that goes: \\"Madame George got played today, she almost forgot she could feel that way\\". Although not a direct imitation, the riff that the string quartet repeats at the end of the song is mimicked at the end of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" (one of several indicators that Morrison had great influence on Springsteen), confirmed by Springsteen himself on Desert Island Discs talking to Kirsty Young. The American rock band Hat On, Drinking Wine takes their name from a lyric from the song: \\"He's much older now/With hat on, drinking wine.\\" When singer- songwriter Joan Armatrading appeared on Desert Island Discs talking to Sue Lawley on 29 January 1989, \\"Madame George\\" was selected as one of the eight records she would like to take to her desert island, and also as the one favoured record she would most want to save if the other seven were lost.Sue Lawley's Desert Island Discussions, Hodder and Stoughton, 1990, 112‚Äì8, 193.

Such considerations generally come into play after the contract is formed but before buyer receives goods, something bad happens. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), there are four risk of loss rules, in order of application: # Agreement - the agreement of the parties controls # Breach - the breaching party is liable for any uninsured loss even though breach is unrelated to the problem. Hence, if the breach is the time of delivery, and the goods show up broken, then the breaching rule applies risk of loss on the seller. # Delivery by common carrier other than by seller. ##Risk of loss shifts from seller to buyer at the time that seller completes its delivery obligations ##If it is a destination contract (FOB (buyer's city)), then risk of loss is on the seller. ##If it is a delivery contract (standard, or FOB (seller's city)), then the risk of loss is on the buyer. # In cases not covered by the foregoing rules, if the seller is a merchant, then the risk of loss shifts to the buyer upon buyer's \\"receipt\\" of the goods.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's seinen magazine Big Comic Spirits. The first volume was released by Shogakukan on July 30, 2003, the last volume on April 28, 2011. Plot Trepanation is the procedure of drilling a hole in the skull. It is said to increase the blood circulation and improve pressure inside the skull. It is also said to bring out a person's sixth sense, including the ability to use ESP, see ghosts, and move objects with one's mind. This is speculative fiction based on the concept of trepanation. Susumu Nakoshi is a 34-year-old homeless man living out of his car. For two weeks, he declines his fellow homeless men's invitations to set up a tent with them, preferring to sleep in his car. One day he is accosted by a strange-looking man searching for participants to subject themselves to trepanation. Nakoshi tells the man to leave, and discards the flier the man placed on his windshield. However, when his car is towed, he agrees to let medical student Manabu Itoh drill a hole in his skull in exchange for 700,000 yen. Itoh claims to be interested in trepanation for the sake of science; he is interested in humans, fascinated with ESP and the sixth sense, and wants to disprove the existence of the occult. Itoh's father owns a lab facility, as his father is a rich hospital director. Itoh performs the trepanation surgery on Nakoshi and does a variety of ESP tests. When Nakoshi reveals that he sees distorted humans when using only the left side of his body, Itoh researches and discovers that Nakoshi can see homunculi. Itoh explains psychoanalytic theory to Nakoshi after the yakuza incident. Characters * Susumu Nakoshi is a 34-year-old man. At the beginning of the series, he is shown to be recently homeless and living out of his car. He is living between two worlds, that of the upper class and that of the homeless. He is a former employee of a foreign bank, and a pathological liar. After the trepanation procedure he gains the ability to see peoples homunculi, or \\"distortions\\". * Manabu Itoh is the 22-year-old medical student who proposes the trepanation experiment and investigates material relevant to Nakoshi's reports.

Dodd was born and brought up in Wrexham, Denbighshire, where his father Charles was a headmaster at Victoria School. It was a family of modest means but studious inclinations; one of his three brothers, C. H. Dodd, achieved particular distinction as a New Testament scholar. Having attended Grove Park Grammar School in the town he went up to New College, Oxford in 1911, and after graduating in history, joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (2nd West Lancashire Field Ambulance) in 1914 with whom he saw active service in France. Dodd was appointed lecturer in history at University College, Bangor in 1919, and succeeded Sir John Edward Lloyd as professor of history there in 1930, a post he retained until his retirement in 1958. He also taught in the Extra- Mural Department, and was stalwart of the WEA (Workers' Educational Association) and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. In retirement he was curator of Bangor Museum, and taught at Bangor Normal College (now part of the University of Wales, Bangor). He was a founder member of the Denbighshire Historical Society and edited a history of Wrexham to coincide with the Borough Centenary Celebration in 1957. He was made a freeman of the Borough of Wrexham in 1963. A centenary celebration of his birth was held in Wrexham in 1991. Though not a native speaker, Dodd was a supporter of the Welsh language and brought up his children as Welsh speakers, at a time when the language had far less social status than now.

Operations history The Arlington plant was opened in 1954 to assemble both automobiles and aircraft, but has focused on the former use for most of its history. Early automobile production included models like the Chevrolet Bel Air and Pontiac Chieftain. The factory would continue to produce many large GM cars through the 1990s including products from Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac. Arlington Assembly was the last GM B-body manufacturing facility when GM decided to consolidate operations and convert the plant to SUV production. The plant occupies 250 acres (1,000,000 square meters). The first GM factory in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area was originally built in 1917 to build the Chevrolet Series 490 on the south side of West Seventh Street and Slayton Street just west of Trinity Park. Due to a flood of the Trinity River in 1922 and flood control taxes levied by the local government, GM closed the factory in 1924.

She lived in what was then Wilkes County, Georgia, now Elbert County, Georgia. In an 1820 letter she was said to be the \\"biggest and tallest\\" black woman the writer had ever seen and had \\"proven herself to be a strong, a kindly, a never failing friend to Colonel Heard and his family.\\"McIntosh, John H., History of Elbert County, Georgia, 1790-1935, p. 221. Of pure African descent, she claimed to be the daughter of a great king. Heard suffered a great deal at the hands of the Tories. They forced his wife out into a snowstorm, and she and their young, adopted daughter died from exposure. Then he was captured by the British and sentenced to death. Ostensibly to care for his needs, Kate followed him to his prison. One morning she presented herself with a large covered basket on her head. Telling the sentry on duty that she was there to pick up Colonel Heard's soiled linen, she was admitted to his cell. There she put Heard, who was a small man, in the basket and calmly sauntered past the guard with him in the basket balanced on her head. The previous night she had secreted two of Heard's fine Arabian horses‚ÄîLightfoot and Silverheels‚Äîon the outskirts of Augusta, where he was imprisoned. She carried Heard to where she had hidden the horses, and she and Heard rode away. It is said that on the ride he offered to set her free, but she responded by telling him that he could set her free, but she was never going to set him free. He gave her freedom and a deed to a small tract of land and a four-roomed house, but she continued to work for the Heard family, turning over on her death-bed her children to his family.McIntosh, p. 23.

The Psions first appeared in Tales of the New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #4 (September 1982) and were created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. The earliest uncredited appearance of the Psions was in The Witching Hour #13 (March 1971) written by Marv Wolfman. Fictional biographyOrigins= Billions of years ago, on the planet Maltus, the Maltusian immortals studied all aspects of life. They took a local reptile for testing and discovered one part of the lizard's mind had the potential for much greater complexity. They enhanced the creatures and found the new developments were passed to each succeeding generation. The reptiles were released back into the wild to chart their survival rate. The Maltusians eventually left their world in a great exodus. The enhanced reptiles evolved into the Psion race. The early Psions investigated the Maltusian labs and mimicked their creators. They went as far as cutting off their tails to look more like the Maltusians (and, as a result, disavowing their original background). After several millennia, the Psions left Maltus to follow their creators, now known as the Guardians of the Universe, who were on Oa. When the two discovered each other, things were not quite what the Psions expected. The Oans regretted their decision not to destroy their equipment before leaving Maltus. The Psions wished to learn more from the Guardians, but were forbidden to travel to Oa. Though the Psions had mastered the technology, they had gained little understanding. The Guardians felt responsible for the Psions and sent them to a distant galaxy where they could strive for comprehension. The Guardians ordered the Psions to stay within their assigned area so they would not be disturbed. The Guardians hoped the Psions would achieve their own greatness. The Green Lantern Corps would not be allowed to interfere with the Psions as part of the process. The Guardians' great hope has not come to fruition. Discovering their creators and then feeling humiliated by the same, the Psions buried the truth. As a species they forgot their background and began anew their scientific work. As scientists, the Psions asked the questions all thinkers ask, such as \\"Where are we from?\\" Again and again, the Psions discovered the truth about their origins, and every time they suppressed the knowledge. The Psions refuse to acknowledge that their creators did not want them or believe in them. When hearing the truth, in pain, they go into shock and incapacitate themselves. This process also suppresses their knowledge of their genesis. =Invasion= The Psions were among the many alien races that took part in invading Earth after the Dominators became worried about humanity's ability to produce super- powered individuals. Part of their contribution to the war effort included creating sedatives for prisoners in the Gulag that the Alliance maintained in deep space. A science team also worked out of Alliance Headquarters in conquered Australia. This team was killed when an effort to send a bomb through a JLI transporter backfired. A Psion was part of the Paradocs crew during the Our Worlds at War crossover. While helping tend to a gravely injured Wonder Woman, he openly stated she was most likely beyond saving and that he should start dissecting her. Fortunately, Hippolyta took over treatment for her daughter. =Current status= The Psions maintain vast floating laboratories where studies continue. There they exploit the life forms they found in the Vegan star system. Working with their science, they created the many species of Vega's twenty-five worlds, subconsciously replicating their own origins. Active against them are the Omega Men, an interstellar group of rebels drawn from the Vegan worlds. Psion experiments accidentally created the Vegan goddess X'Hal. The Green Lantern Corps has been barred from entering or interfering within the Vegan star system due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild. However, the fourth law of the rewritten book of Oa by the Guardians of the Universe states that the Vega System is no longer outside of Green Lantern Corps' jurisdiction. Green Lanterns Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner planned to breach Vegan space in order to retrieve recruit Soranik Natu. The mission was successful, thanks to the skills shown by Soranik, leading to the defeat of the Spider Guild.

The terminals are normally used to connect a laptop computer to broadband Internet in remote locations, although as long as line-of-sight to the satellite exists, the terminal can be used anywhere. The value of BGAN terminals is that, unlike other satellite Internet services which require bulky and heavy satellite dishes to connect, a BGAN terminal is about the size of a laptop and thus can be carried easily. The network is provided by Inmarsat and uses three geostationary satellites called I-4 to provide almost global coverage. BGAN Terminals, such as this Hughes 9202, are portable and can connect to the Internet from almost anywhere on the globe.  Details  Downlink speeds of high-end BGAN terminals are up to 492 kbit/s and upload speeds are also up to 492 kbit/s - Best Effort as BGAN Background IP (BIP) is a contended (shared) channel. As with all geosynchronous satellite connections, latency is an issue. Common latency is 1‚Äì1.5 seconds round trip for the Background IP service. It is slightly better for the Streaming services at 800 ms ‚Äì 1 second. This latency is mainly due to the great distance that has to be traveled before a packet can reach the Internet, but is slightly exacerbated by the back-end technology as normal latency over a Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) system is roughly 550 ms. BGAN users frequently use PEP software or other TCP packet accelerators to improve performance, and the BGAN user is often assigned a non-routable IP address and routed through a NAT server; this increases security and helps control usage costs. BGAN terminals are made by multiple manufacturers. They all have similar capabilities. The main two that apply to basic BGAN usage are the Standard Background IP (Internet) and Telephone Voice. Data costs from the many ISPs that offer BGAN service average about per Background Megabyte. Voice calling is on average US$1 per min and varies slightly based on the destination of the call (Land lines, Cell phones, other Satellite phones which are the most expensive). BGAN can be easily set up by anyone, and has excellent voice calling quality. It uses the L band, avoiding rain fade and other issues affecting satellite systems operating at higher frequency bands. =Signal acquisition= The actual process of connecting a BGAN terminal to the satellite is fairly straightforward. The BGAN terminal needs to find its position using GPS, before it can negotiate with the satellite, so a clear view of the sky is necessary to begin with. Once the GPS position is obtained, it does not need to do that again unless it is moved to a different region. Obtaining the initial GPS position can take a few minutes. The terminal then needs a line- of-sight to the geostationary satellite so a user would normally be outside, and have a general idea of what direction the satellite would be (with a compass if necessary). Turning the terminal slowly by hand, it will give some indication when the satellite is found. Then usually with the touch of one button, the terminal auto-negotiates with the satellite and connects. The average pointing time for a BGAN unit is 2 minutes, under a minute with an experienced user and a good signal. BGAN is being used in the world today for disaster response, telemedicine, business continuity, remote site monitoring (telemetry), military use, and recreational use.  Terminals  Terminal manufactures are Thrane & Thrane, Hughes Network Systems, and Addvalue. Terminal cost is between US$1800 and US$5000 varying based on class and capabilities of the various systems. Depending on terminal type users can connect their computers via USB, Bluetooth, WiFi, or Ethernet connection(s). This allows them to access the Internet, check e-mail, download files, or any other Internet activity they might do at a home or office. Many come equipped with a regular RJ11 Phone Jack for making PSTN calls, using an ordinary telephone handset, and many terminals have an ISDN connection to do ISDN phone calls. Some BGAN terminals have both so users can make either type of phone call. Users can also send faxes or SMS text messages. Most BGAN terminals can support a router or switch device so users can plug in multiple computers or even VOIP phones and set up a mobile office.  Coverage and availability  The BGAN service is accessible globally, excluding the poles.  Service types  There is more than one kind of BGAN service available from Inmarsat for BGAN terminals. =Standard = The Standard BGAN service from Inmarsat provides Internet, phone, SMS texting, Fax, ISDN and streaming services. It is designed for use with all BGAN terminals except the Hughes 9502 which uses the BGAN M2M service (below). =Standard + = The Standard + Plus BGAN service introduced by Inmarsat in May 2017 provides unlimited Internet use for a low fixed monthly price using consumer grade routing. While not as high priority routing as Standard BGAN service, Standard + does have the same priority as the IsatHub Inmarsat network which is used worldwide. Standard + has a low monthly subscription that includes 5 Megabytes each month, and then bills at a fixed \\"tier\\" rate on if more than 5 Megabytes are used each month. =M2M = BGAN M2M Service, launched in February 2012, is a low-bandwidth service for remote SCADA or M2M (machine to machine) equipment monitoring and control. BGAN M2M service is offered in 2, 5, 10 and 20 Megabyte monthly service plans. BGAN M2M service does not charge for overhead communication, and the smallest billing increment is 1 kilobyte, which is ideal for M2M communication (standard BGAN service has a 50 Kilobyte minimum transfer increment). BGAN M2M service is currently only available to the Hughes 9502 BGAN terminal. =Link= BGAN Link, launched in March 2012, is for fixed locations that require 5 to 30 Gigabytes of data transferred per month. In late 2013, Inmarsat introduced Unlimited BGAN Link \\"GEO\\" plans for certain countries/regions including Central and South America, Australia and lower Africa. Service fees with BGAN Link are far less than standard BGAN service, making this service more comparable to VSAT satellite dish services. One advantage of BGAN terminals are their low power usage (4 watts idle to 22 watts burst transmitting) which is much less than satellite dish systems that use 90 to 150 watts when idle or transmitting. BGAN Link service is only available with Class 1 BGAN terminals (the Hughes 9201 or the Explorer 700/710) and service terms are 3 and 12 months terms. Terminals may move 4 times per year with 30 days notice with a US +$1,000 transfer cost, and must be at location for no less than 3 months. All standard BGAN services are available with BGAN Link (Internet, phone, SMS texting, FAX, Streaming). While BGAN Link service is global, approval by Inmarsat for activation is required.  Variants  BGAN terminals are allowed to be used on the open ocean on a moving vessel. But because the vessel will be moving there is great chances to lose the signal and then the connection. Inmarsat informed DPs that the Core network is not blocking these connections. Inmarsat has created the FleetBroadband service that uses the I4 satellites for maritime communication. Standard BGAN terminals cannot be used on moving aircraft due to doppler shift effects. An alternative service using more intelligent terminals to talk to the I4 satellites, named SwiftBroadband, has been developed for aircraft use.  News coverage  Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford used BGAN equipment to provide live coverage, from a moving truck, of the news network's coverage of the liberation of Tripoli, Libya, in August 2011. This was done by the producer continuously readjusting the BGAN terminal to track the BGAN satellite. In-Motion BGAN satellite terminals are often used by media outlets for streaming video on the move. Another advantage to in-motion BGAN systems are for saving precious minutes when arriving at a live event. A media vehicle equipped with an in-motion system does not require pointing time since the in- motion BGAN terminal is already locked on satellite.  High Data Rate  Since late 2013 the service is available in an enhanced form known as HDR. HDR can exceed symmetric 700 kbit/s on select terminals and also support bonding for a total bandwidth exceeding 1 Mbit/s. As of 2016 the only terminal to support the full set of modes and bonding is the Cobham Explorer 710.

History  After being joined a couple months later by lead singer Chris Shaffer, also a Ball State student, the band played a few gigs as Emerald City. Adams left Emerald City in 1991 and was replaced by drummer Charlie Bushor in 1992. That same year, the band switched to a new name, The Why Store, the name of a former Muncie haberdashery. In 1993, the band independently recorded Welcome to the Why Store. One year later the band recorded Inside the Why Store. Both albums were huge regional successes, and The Why Store began getting attention from record labels. At this time, touring keyboard player Jeff Pedersen was made an official member of the group, and in 1995 The Why Store signed to MCA's subsidiary Way Cool Music for their first major‚Äìlabel effort, a self‚Äìtitled LP, which was released in 1996. The song \\"Lack of Water\\", the band's most successful single, received steady airplay on Alternative Radio and reached #1 for two weeks on the Billboard AAA charts. In 1997, The Why Store toured the country opening for John Mellencamp's successful \\"Mr. Happy Go Lucky\\" tour, and made an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The band released Two Beasts in June 1998, and in 1999 released the double‚Äìdisc concert set Live at Midnight. The Why Store split up in 2000 citing creative differences, though each member has continued onto different projects. Chris Shaffer recorded several solo discs as well as recording with his first post-Why Store band, Shaffer Street. Michael David Smith recorded with his new project with Gregory Gardner and Charlie Bushor, Lost in Lodi, releasing the CD \\"Elvador\\" in 2001. Jeff Pedersen continued his education, eventually receiving a PhD in Education Curriculum Design and operates Connecting Learning Assures Successful Students as V.P. of Operations. The band reunited in April 2005 to play a handful of reunions shows, which were well received by fans and critics alike. The band played their last gig together on December 31, 2005 before separating again. In 2007 Shaffer resurrected the band name, billing his own group first as \\"Chris Shaffer's Why Store,\\" then simply as \\"The Why Store\\" at various venues around the region. In 2011 Greg Gardner will release a solo album under the name \\"Gregory Shock\\". Michael David Smith eventually moved to Meridian, Mississippi to take the role of Product Development Manager for Peavey Electronics Corporation's MI division. Omar Adams now owns and operates a recording studio in Indianapolis called \\"The Purple Room.\\" In 2016, Live at The Slippery Noodle was released, featuring six previously unreleased songs.

Plot The tale tells of a merchant whose wife enjoys revelry and socializing, on which she spends money. A young monk, who is close friends with the merchant, comes to stay with them. After confessing that she does not love her husband, the wife asks the monk for one hundred franks to pay her debts. The monk, without her knowledge, borrows the money from the merchant to give to the wife, at which point she agrees with the monk: :\\"That for thise hundred frankes he sholde al nyght :Have hire in his armes bolt upright;\\" (lines 315-316) The monk volunteers the information that he has returned the loan back to the wife a few days after he had borrowed it, and then leaves town. When the merchant asks his wife about the money, she says it has been spent on clothing and blames the monk saying that she thought the money was in payment for him being such a long house guest. Instead of giving her husband the money back she says she will repay the debt in bed. As the wife is tallying her debt in bed the story ends on a bawdy pun that all should \\"tally\\" the rest of their lives. Themes Apart from a criticism of the clergy, a common theme of Chaucer's, the tale also connects money, business and sex. Similar tales often end with both the wife and husband being conned, but the addition of the wife, in turn, conning her husband seems to be Chaucer's own embellishment. The use of the pronouns \\"us\\" and \\"we\\" when talking from a woman's perspective, along with the wife's success at the end of the tale, has led scholars to suggest that the tale was originally written for the Wife of Bath but as that character developed she was given a more fitting story and the Shipman took on this tale. In the line \\"he moot us clothe, and he moot us array,\\" (line 12) and others, \\"us\\" and \\"we\\" are used, in a way that could be interpreted as a married woman speaking for other wives. It is also possible The Shipman may simply be imitating a female voice, but the epilogue of the Man of Law's Tale in some manuscripts suggest it should be followed by the Shipman's tale rather than the Wife of Bath, whose tale usually follows. The changes give some insight into Chaucer's development of the tales and the connections between them. =Historical context= It is likely that the career of the late-14th century Dartmouth-based privateer John Hawley provided Chaucer with the historical basis for his character. BBC adaptation In the BBC1 adaptation of \\"The Shipman's Tale\\" (renamed \\"The Sea Captain's Tale\\"), setting is changed to modern England and the protagonists are an Indian family. The monk's role is played by the merchant's business partner, who has come from India to set up a shop in England. The wife, beset by money problems, sleeps with this man, who learns of her previous affairs through the merchant. The business partner breaks up with the wife, and she, feeling jilted, smashes his shop. The merchant subsequently sends the other man back to India with a warning, and at the end he reaches across the bed to touch his wife's hand, a hint of possible reconciliation.

It stars Sean Connery (in the midst of his James Bond roles), Joanne Woodward, Jean Seberg, Patrick O'Neal, and Clive Revill. It was directed by Irvin Kershner. Plot Samson Shillitoe (Sean Connery), a poet, lives in Greenwich Village area of New York City with Rhoda (Joanne Woodward), a waitress who stands by him through all his troubles. When Samson cannot find the inspiration to finish his latest poem, he becomes belligerent and depressed. Samson is continually pursued by a debt collector after his late alimony payments to a previous wife; if Samson doesn't pay he will be arrested. Samson eventually assaults a police detective who accompanies the debt collector. Samson has other troubles when he loses his job as an office cleaner when he has sex with a secretary (Sue Ane Langdon) whilst his carpet cleaning machinery fills the office with soap suds. However, Samson does earn a $200 fee for doing a recital of his poetry to a woman's group that ends in disaster. On Samson's behalf, but unknown to him, Rhoda seeks the help of psychiatrist Dr. West (Patrick O'Neal), who claims to be able to cure writer's block. Rhoda gives Dr. West the $200 she collected for Samson's lecture to treat Samson for what she fears will become suicidal depression if he can't finish his poem. Dr. West reluctantly agrees to see him, and when Samson confronts the Doctor about the return of his money, West is fascinated by Shillitoe and persuades him to become a patient. In order for Samson to be away from the chaos of his life in the city that he might finish his poem, Dr. West arranges a stay for him in a sanitarium upstate. Another doctor at the sanitarium, Dr. Menken (Clive Revill) is also interested in Samson, but for the purpose of experimenting on him with a new surgical technique to quell his violent temper. He persuades Rhoda to agree to the surgery. Dr. West and two other colleagues vehemently oppose such a procedure, as it is too close to a lobotomy to be safe. Dr. West's wife, Lydia (Jean Seberg), is frustrated with their marriage. He is a popular TV guest for his pop psychiatric methods and views, and she sees very little of him. Eventually she runs into Samson at the sanitorium. Samson does not know she is married to Dr West but recalls her when she walked out of his women's club lecture. In his usual manner Samson immediately seduces her and the two have sex in a therapeutic bath. Dr. West, looking for Samson, secretly sees them in the tub. When it comes time for the clinic senior staff to vote on allowing the surgical technique to be performed on Samson, Dr. West, having seen Samson with his wife, changes his vote, enabling Dr. Menken to go ahead. Lydia finds out about the surgery and rushes to stop it, but arrives just after it has been completed. When Samson awakes from the surgery, at first his voice is so low and quiet he cannot be understood. As Dr. Menken leans in to listen, Samson throws a punch that lands the doctor on the floor. The operation has had no effect, and Samson returns to New York. Rhoda quickly learns of his arrival, and rushes to rejoin him. Samson has finally been served with his subpoena, so he must pay his ex-wife or go to jail. Rhoda prevents him from pummeling the civil servant, until Lydia appears and pays him the amount owed. Lydia informs Samson she is leaving Dr. West and hints that she would like to be with her new lover, Samson. Rhoda protests, as Samson invites her to come live with them both. Lydia, disgusted by the idea, becomes hysterical and rushes out, presumably never to speak to Samson again. Rhoda pleads with Samson as he goes charging off down the street, before informing him that she is pregnant. He accidentally punches her and the movie ends with him fighting off an angry mob of indignant spectators.

It is the city's only main plant after the closure of Buick City. The Flint factory produces full-size GM pickup trucks. History The first factory location was in Flint, Michigan at the corner of Wilcox (now Chevrolet Avenue) and Kearsley Street, now known as \\"Chevy Commons\\",At coordinates along the Flint River, across the street from Kettering University. The plant, at G 3100 Vanslyke Road, was built in 1947. In 1953 the first 300 Chevrolet Corvettes were hand built here before production was moved to St. Louis in 1954. This factory also produced some of the second-generation Chevrolet Bel Airs for the North American market. Encouraged to do a collaboration by the nearby Emily Pottery Company, GM shared some of the colors used for the car, such as sky blue, and as of 2020, the pottery manufacturer still makes ceramics using those colors, albeit in limited quantities. Production was split between Fisher Body and Chevrolet. The Fisher operations were halted on June 24, 1970, with the entire factory turned over to Chevrolet. For much of the 1970s, Flint was home to the large Chevrolet K5 Blazer and Chevrolet Suburban, with pickup truck production moved to Pontiac Assembly Center in Pontiac, Michigan in May 1987. On August 31, 1991, production of the large SUVs was moved to Janesville Assembly in Wisconsin. All laid-off workers returned to the plant on August 10, 1992 as production began. After the closure of Lordstown Van Assembly in 1993, Flint began to produce the former Lordstown Vans. The full-size van division was moved to Wentzville Assembly in Missouri in July 1996, but a new product, the GMT480, began at Flint the previous year. The large commercial General Motors C/K trucks began production in 1997. GM began production of GMT800 based Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra HD pickup trucks and chassis cabs at the plant in 2005. The factory's previous product, the GMT900-based trucks, began in February 2007. The factory also produced GM medium-duty trucks, which were phased out in 2009 after GM discontinued that division. In 2010, GM produced the light duty crew cab pickups here. In May 2013, GM began production on the successor to the GMT 900 platform series, the GMT K2XX, for its next generation of light duty crew cab trucks for the 2014 model year. In May 2016, General Motors invested $900 million for an addition to the Flint Truck Assembly complex. GM has spent an additional $2.8 billion on the complex since 2009. On October 12, 2017, GM announced it would invest $79 million to bring a new trim shop to the complex. As of 2020, Flint Truck Assembly currently produces the Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD Regular and Crew Cab models.https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/flint.html See also *List of GM factories *Flint, Michigan auto industry *History of General Motors ReferencesExternal links * UAW Local 598 web site Category:General Motors factories Category:Economy of Flint, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Flint, Michigan Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in Michigan ","title":"Flint Truck Assembly"},{"id":"2015081","text":"Ogneslav Kostoviƒá Stepanoviƒá Ognjeslav Stepanoviƒá Kostoviƒá (Serbian Cyrillic: –û–≥—ö–µ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—õ –ö–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∏—õ) (1851 - 16 December 1916) was a Serbian-Russian inventor.

The architect Horace Trumbauer (1868‚Äì1938) designed it for the coal baron Edward Julius Berwind (1848‚Äì1936), taking inspiration from the 18th century Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res in Asni√®res-sur-Seine, France. 'Guide du ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res', Site of the city of Asni√®res-sur-Seine.The Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res was designed by Jacques Hardouin-Mansart, the grandson of Jules Hardouin-Mansart and nephew of Robert de Cotte; it was built in 1750-53. C. H. Miller and E. W. Bowditch, working closely with Trumbauer, designed the gardens and landscape. The Preservation Society of Newport County purchased The Elms in 1962, and opened the house to the public. The Elms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. The estateThe house= The Elms was constructed from 1899 to 1901 and cost approximately 1.5 million dollars to build. Like most Newport houses of the Gilded Age, the house was built with non-combustible materials: the house was built around a structural steel frame; the interior partitions, plaster over terra cotta blocks, sit on reinforced concrete floor slabs; the exterior walls are made of brick masonry and clad with limestone. On the main floor, the principal axis leads from the eastern entrance porch, into an entrance hall with a grand staircase and a marble floor, then into the ballroom, and then out to the garden beyond. The wing to the south contains a dining room, breakfast room, and serving pantry (the kitchens were in the basement), while the wing to the north contains a drawing room, library, and conservatory. The second floor contains bedrooms for the family and guests as well as a private sitting room. The third floor contains bedrooms for the indoor servants. =The grounds= In keeping with the French architecture of the house, the grounds of The Elms, among the best in Newport, were designed in French eighteenth-century taste and include a sunken garden. The original American elms having succumbed to Dutch elm disease, the striking shade trees are now weeping beeches. =Ancillary buildings= Trumbauer built a large carriage house and stables on the edge of the property, with apartments above for the gardners and stable hands. in 1910, after the Berwind family began using automobiles, the carriage house and stables were replaced by a new garage, clad in limestone, long by deep, one of the largest private garages in America, with a central indoor track, and two gasoline tanks. When automobiles replaced horse-drawn carriages, the Berwind's head coachman became the chauffeur, but because he could not learn to back out of the garage, an automobile turntable had to be installed. Inspiration Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res - garden fa√ßade. H√¥tel Porg√®s - garden fa√ßade. The Elms is considered to be a reinterpretation of the Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res, an 18th century house in the town of Asni√®res-sur-Seine in Hauts-de-Seine, France. Nevertheless, it is not a replication; there are significant differences: the flanking sections of ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res are five bays wide, whereas and those at Trumbauer's house are four bays wide. The balustrade at The Elms is taller, but simpler in detail. Furthermore, the pediment on Trumbauer's garden facade is likely a variation of the pediment at H√¥tel Porg√®s, 18 avenue Montaigne in Paris, built in 1892 by the architect Ernest Sanson. There is no pediment at Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res. History Edward Julius Berwind. The Berwind family began spending summers in Newport in the 1890s. By 1898, it was clear that their original property (a small traditional beach cottage) was too small for the grand parties the Berwinds were having, and so they had the place torn down. Berwind hired Horace Trumbauer to build a much larger house, better fitting his status. Like many of the grandest summer residents of Newport, Edward Berwind was \\"new money\\" (his parents were middle-class German immigrants); by 1900 his friends included Theodore Roosevelt and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany as well as many high-ranking government leaders from Europe and America. At this time Berwind was hailed as \\"one of the 58 men who rule America\\", making him one of Newport's most important summer residents. Berwind was interested in technology, and The Elms was one of the first houses in America to be wired for electricity with no form of backup system. The house also included one of the first electrical ice makers. It was one of the most sophisticated houses of the time. When The Elms opened in 1901 the Berwinds held a huge party. During the next 20 years, Berwind's wife, Sarah, would spend the summers there, the season being from the 4th of July to the end of August; Berwind would come out only on weekends, for his coal-mining interests kept him in New York during the week. Though the Berwinds had no children, their nephews and nieces would come out to visit on a regular basis. On January 5, 1922, Mrs. Berwind died, and Edward asked his youngest sister Julia A. Berwind to move in and become the hostess of The Elms. In 1936, when he died, he willed the house to Julia, who, not being interested in technology, continued to run the house in the same way for the next twenty five years: washers and dryers were never installed at the Elms. Julia was well known in Newport. She would invite children from the nearby Fifth Ward (a working-class immigrant neighborhood) to the estate for milk and cookies. She had a love for cars and would drive around Newport every day in one of her luxury cars. This was somewhat shocking to the rest of Newport society, where it was considered unladylike for women to drive themselves. It was rumored that her social secretary would perform the \\"white glove test\\" to make sure there was no dust on the steering wheel before Julia got into the driver's seat. Preservation Staircase and Entrance Hall In 1961 when Julia Berwind died, The Elms was one of the very last Newport cottages to be run in the fashion of the Gilded Age: forty servants were on staff, and Miss Berwind's social season remained at six weeks. Childless, Julia Berwind willed the estate to a nephew, who did not want it and fruitlessly tried to pass The Elms to someone else in the family. Finally the family auctioned off the contents of the estate and sold the property to a developer who wanted to tear it down. In 1962, just weeks before its date with the wrecking ball, The Elms was purchased by the Preservation Society of Newport County for $116,000. The price included the property along with adjacent guest houses. Since then, the house has been open to the public for tours. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. In addition to a self-guided audio tour, The Elms offers a Servant Life Tour, which brings guests to the basement to view the coal-fired furnaces and the tunnel from which the coal is brought into the basement from a nearby street. The tour shows the lengths to which Mr. Berwind went to keep the servants out of view from guests on all floors of the mansion. Visitors on the Servant Life Tour view the laundry room, steamer trunk storage area, the giant circuit breaker box, ice-makers, galley, and wine cellar below the main floor, and climb the service staircase to the servants' quarters on the third floor. The tour then proceeds out on the level tiled roof and a small aluminum platform, with a view of the rear lawn, shade trees and gardens, and the vista of Newport harbor in the distance.Roof Tour See also *List of Gilded Age mansions *List of National Historic Landmarks in Rhode Island *National Register of Historic Places listings in Newport County, Rhode Island *Edward J.

Sir Robert Brown Black (, 3 June 1906 ‚Äì 29 October 1999) was a British colonial administrator. Born in Edinburgh and educated at George Watson's College and the University of Edinburgh, he would spend three decades overseas and return to Britain in the 1960s. He was Governor of Hong Kong from 1958 ‚Äì 1964, Governor of Singapore from 1955 ‚Äì 1957 and as Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1952 ‚Äì 1955. Colonial administration career Sir Robert Brown Black served in the administration of Britain's colonies for more than 30 years. Entering the colonial service, Black was assigned to Trinidad, but the remainder of his postings were in Asia. During his posting in North Borneo Black was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps and involved in guerilla resistance against the Japanese. He was captured in 1942 and spent the remainder of World War II in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. After the war ended, he returned to the colonial service and served in North Borneo and Hong Kong before moving on to Singapore as Governor (1955‚Äì57). Subsequently, he became Governor of Hong Kong from 1958 to 1964. =Governor of Hong Kong= During his governorship, Hong Kong became increasingly prosperous. At the same time, many tens of thousands of refugees were illegally crossing the border from China every year, driven in part by widespread famine in China during the years 1958‚Äì1961. Some were stopped and sent back, but almost all of the hundreds of thousands who reached Kowloon were allowed to stay. This influx placed an enormous burden on the colonial authorities, but the needs of the refugees were met by a programme of public housing construction and public health measures. Robert Black had been dealing with the patriotic Hong Kong Chinese in a heavy-handed way. On 18 April 1958, a raid was conducted on the library of the Pui Kiu Middle School (PKMS). The officer-in-charge of the Hong Kong Island Section of the Inspectorate of Education visited the school with five assistants. Nineteen books were confiscated and four were used as evidence of the 'mismanagement of the school' in a warning letter addressed to the school supervisor on 13 May. On the basis of these and other accusations, such as hiring of unregistered teachers and discussion of political issues in school meetings, To Pak-fui (Êùú‰ºØÂ•é), the principal of PKMS, was deported on 6 August, to Lo Wu.Hong Kong socialist experimentation in the colonial era: Patriotic schools, 1946-1976, by Lau Chui-Shan, Hong Kong Baptist University, tracylau@hkbu.edu.hk Hong Kong experienced a prolonged drought of unanticipated severity during the last two years of his tenure, which led to a serious water shortage. Water rationing was imposed in May 1962 and continued through August 1964. From June 1963 until late May 1964 (when the arrival of Typhoon Viola ended the drought) the water supply was restricted to a single four-hour period every four days. Black helped establish the Chinese University of Hong Kong by uniting several smaller institutions.Sir Robert BlackTough Scot sorting out the end of Britain's empire He served as Chancellor of both the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong during his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong. He was knighted (KCMG) in 1955 and promoted to GCMG in 1962. Post-governorship Black returned to Britain in 1964. He was active with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Royal Commonwealth Society, and served as chairman of the Clerical Medical and General Life Assurance Society in the 1970s. He died on 29 October 1999, having been predeceased some years earlier (in 1986) by his wife Anne. He was survived by their two daughters, Barbara and Kathryn.

She was of Hispanian Roman descent. During her marriage to Theodosius, she gave birth to two sons ‚Äì future Emperors Arcadius and Honorius ‚Äì and a daughter, Aelia Pulcheria. She was titled Augusta, as her coinage shows. Family According to Laus Serenae (\\"In Praise of Serena\\"), a poem by Claudian, both Serena and Flaccilla were from Hispania.Claudian, \\"Laus Serenae\\", 1922 translation A passage of Themistius (Oratio XVI, De Saturnino) has been interpreted as identifying Flavius Claudius Antonius, Praetorian prefect of Gaul from 376 to 377 and Roman consul in 382, to be her father. However the relation is considered doubtful.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology In 1967, John Robert Martindale, later one of several article writers in the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, suggested that the passage actually identifies Antonius as the brother-in-law of Theodosius. However the passage is vague enough to allow Flavius Afranius Syagrius, co-consul of Antonius in 382, to be the brother-in-law in question. The only kin clearly identified in primary sources was her nephew Nebridius, son of an unnamed sister. He married Salvina, a daughter of Gildo. Their marriage was mentioned by Jerome in his correspondence with Salvina. They had a son and a daughter.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, article \\"Gildo\\" Marriage In about 375‚Äì376, Flaccilla married Theodosius I, a son of Count Theodosius.Roman Catholic Encyclopedia (1909), article \\"√Ülia Flaccilla\\" by J.P. Kirsch At the time Theodosius had fallen out of favor with Valentinian I and had withdrawn to civilian life in Cauca, Gallaecia.David Woods, \\"Theodosius I (379‚Äì395 A.D.)\\" Their first son Arcadius was born prior to the elevation of his parents on the throne. Their second son Honorius was born on 9 September 384. Their daughter Pulcheria has been suggested to have been born prior to the elevation of her parents to the throne due to another passage of Laus Serenae. She predeceased her parents as mentioned in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa. A younger Gratian ‚Äì mentioned alongside the imperial children by Ambrose ‚Äì has at times been suggested as a third son; however, Gregory of Nyssa reports the existence of only three imperial children and other sources do not mention Gratian. Gratian was possibly a relation of some sort but not an actual member of the Theodosian dynasty. Empress Valens, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire was killed in the Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378). He was survived by his wife Albia Dominica and his daughters Anastasia and Carosa. He had however survived his only son, Valentinianus Galates. His nephew Gratian, Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was his heir and assumed control of the Eastern Empire with his younger half-brother Valentinian II as his nominal co- ruler. On 19 January, Gratian declared Theodosius, magister militum per Illyricum, to be his new colleague in the Eastern Roman Empire. Theodosius seems to have been the senior officer of Roman origins available for promotion at the time. Merobaudes and Frigeridus, the two magistri militum in praesenti were probably not considered due to their Germanic origins. Several other equivalent positions remained vacant since the deaths of their last holders in Adrianople. At this point Flaccilla became the Empress consort. She was a fervent supporter of the Nicene Creed. Sozomen reports her preventing a conference between Theodosius and Eunomius of Cyzicus who served as figurehead of Anomoeanism, the most radical sect of Arians, who believed that Jesus was in no way similar to the Father. Ambrose and Gregory of Nyssa praise her Christian virtue and comment on her role as \\"a leader of justice\\" and \\"pillar of the Church\\". Theodoret reports on her works of charity, personally tending to the disabled. He quotes her saying that \\"To distribute money belongs to the imperial dignity, but I offer up for the imperial dignity itself personal service to the Giver.\\" She died early in 386. Her death is mentioned by (among others) Claudian, Zosimus, Philostorgius and Joannes Zonaras. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the Palatium Flaccillianum of Constantinople was named in her honor. A statue of her was placed within the Byzantine Senate.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 2 Sainthood She is commemorated as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church, her feast day being 14 September.Orthodox Saints commemorated in September ReferencesExternal links * Aelia Flaccilla ‚Äì Catholic Encyclopedia article * Her profile in the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire * Her entry in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology * Coins of Aelia Flaccilla and Numismatic information.

The most common circumstances leading to this are either a civil war, where control of the capital is contested, or during an invasion, where the designated capital is taken or threatened.  Historical  Examples include: * During the Hungarian War of Independence (1848-1849) the government moved from Pest-Buda to Debrecen.Antal Papp: Magyarorsz√°g (Hungary), Panor√°ma, Budapest, 1982, , p. 860, pp. 463-477 * During the Colombian Civil War (1860‚Äì1862), Pasto was declared temporary capital by the leaders of the Colombian Conservative Party.MOSQUERA, Tom√°s Cipriano de, The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition 2006 * During the lead-up to and the early weeks of the American Civil War, the provisional government of the Confederate States of America met in Montgomery, AlabamaCaplan, p. 57.before relocating to Richmond, Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederacy. Likewise, after the fall of Richmond in 1865, the government evacuated to Danville, Virginia before Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House.Hansen, Harry. The Civil War: A History. Signet Classics, 2002. . * During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), France's Government of National Defence maintained two temporary capitals. President Louis-Jules Trochu led government ministries in besieged Paris, while Interior Minister L√©on Gambetta evacuated other ministries to Bordeaux. * During the British Raj rule of India, some parts of the administration temporarily moved each summer to Simla, where the weather is cooler. * The First Philippine Republic government under Emilio Aguinaldo had four different temporary capitals throughout the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonization and subsequent American occupation: Malolos, Bacolor, Cabanatuan, and Palanan. * During the Serbian Campaign in World War I, the government of the Kingdom of Serbia temporarily moved its seat from Belgrade to Ni≈° (1914-1915) and Corfu (1916-1918). * During World War I, the government of Romania moved to Ia≈üi after the fall of Bucharest to the Central powers * The Pan-Russian \\"White\\" regime of Alexander Kolchak in Omsk during the Russian Civil War. * During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Vaasa served as the temporary capital of White Finland when the Red Guards controlled the capital de jure, Helsinki. Vaasa continued to serve as the capital until the Battle of Helsinki. * Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended fighting in World War I, Berlin as the capital was considered too dangerous for the National Assembly to use as a meeting place, because of its street rioting after the German Revolution. Therefore, the calm and centrally located Weimar was chosen as the temporary capital (see Weimar Republic). * Lithuania in Kaunas rather than Vilnius during the interwar period when Poland controlled the latter city (see Temporary capital of Lithuania). * During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists initially had a temporary capital at Burgos; once the Nationalists started to besiege Madrid, the Republicans maintained temporary capitals first at Valencia then at Barcelona. The capital returned to Valencia when Barcelona fell to the Catalonia Offensive. * During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the capital of the Republic of China at Nanking was captured by the Empire of Japan, forcing the Republic of China to relocate to Chungking. * At the height of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China evacuated its central government, military, and many loyal citizens‚Äîtotalling at around 1.2 to 2 million individuals‚Äîto the city of Taipei, located on the island of Taiwan. Taiwan has been controlled by the Republic of China since the Japanese surrender at the end of the Second Sino- Japanese War in 1945. To this day, Taipei's official status is that of a \\"provisional capital\\", whereas Nanjing remains as the \\"de jure capital\\" of the Republic of China. * The Parliament of Finland moved from Helsinki to Kauhajoki during the Winter War. * During World War II due to evacuation actions following Nazi Germany's invasion and the Battle of Moscow the Soviet Union had different de facto capitals: ** Kuybyshev (now Samara) ‚Äî planned temporary capital in case of occupation of Moscow and de facto temporary administrative and diplomatic capital ** Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) ‚Äî de facto temporary industrial capitalAndrew Nagorski: The Greatest Battle, 2007, pp. 165-166 ** Kazan ‚Äî de facto temporary scientific capital ** Tyumen ‚Äî de facto temporary spiritual capital * During the First Indochina War (1946‚Äì1954) the government moved from Hanoi to Vi·ªát B·∫Øc. * Germany after 1945 considered Berlin to remain the German capital. But due to the onset of the Cold War Berlin itself was divided and 161 kilometers (100 miles) beyond the Inner German Border within the Soviet-controlled zone that would soon become the German Democratic Republic. As a result, Bonn was established as a temporary capital for the Federal Republic of Germany until the two countries reunited in 1990. The Federal Republic of Germany's government and the bulk of its offices has since moved to Berlin, but a large portion of its offices remain in Bonn. (The German Basic Law has only mentioned the capital since 2008.) * During the Korean War, the South Korean government temporarily moved its capital to Pusan (Busan) before the Korean People's Army advance which conquered and occupied Seoul. South Korea reestablished Seoul as the permanent capital of South Korea after the Korean War Armistice. North Korea also claimed in its 1948 Constitution that Seoul was its de jure capital, and that Pyongyang is a temporary capital. * During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh declared Mujibnagar as the temporary capital, even though the seat of the government in exile remained in Calcutta for most of the war. * The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic claimed temporary capitals previously in Bir Lehlou and currently in Tifariti, in contrast to its de jure capital of La√¢youne, which is controlled by Morocco. Its de facto headquarters is in Tindouf, Algeria. * The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia met in various locations within its territory rather than Mogadishu while the latter was deemed too dangerous to meet in. * During the Libyan Civil War, the National Transitional Council (NTC) declared its base of operations in Benghazi to be the temporary capital of the Libyan Republic, as the NTC had previously declared its capital to be Tripoli, controlled by Muammar Gaddafi's Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. * In the wake of the 2014‚Äì15 Yemeni coup d'√©tat, ousted President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi declared Aden the provisional capital of Yemen while Sana'a is controlled by the rebel Houthis. * The Turkish cabinet used ƒ∞zmir as a temporary capital for a short while after coup attempt in 15 July 2016.

Inveresk Lodge is now privately leased, but the adjacent Inveresk Lodge Garden belongs to the National Trust for Scotland, and its west facing gardens overlooking the river Esk are open to the public. This was formerly the mansion of James Wedderburn who had made his fortune as a slave-owning sugar plantation owner in Jamaica. When his son by one of his slaves, Robert Wedderburn, travelled to Inveresk to claim his kinship he was insultingly rejected by his father who gave him some small beer and a broken or bent sixpence. This experience turned Robert Wedderburn to radicalism.

It dates back to the thirteenth century when Trabzon was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond. It is located near the seashore and two miles west of the medieval town's limits. It is one of a few dozen Byzantine sites extant in the area. It has been described as being \\"regarded as one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture.\\"\\"Religion in Turkey: Erasing the Christian past.\\" The Economist. July 25, 2013.

Other scholars suggest it was not converted until 1584, being spared the initial transformation because it stood several kilometers outside the city walls. The monastery next door continued to be used by monks as late as 1701, when Tournefort found them still in residence. It is likely that the monks gradually abandoned a building that failed to protect them from harassment and predation, and the Turks assumed its use without needing to expel them.Millet, Les monast√®res, p. 433 During World War I and for a brief period afterward, the city was occupied by the Russian military and used as a makeshift hospital and depot. Afterwards it was put back into use as a mosque, until 1964 when it was turned into a museum - which it remains to this day. Between 1958 and 1964 the surviving frescoes were uncovered and the church consolidated with the help of experts from the University of Edinburgh and the General Directorate of Foundations; one expert involved in the work estimated no more than one- sixth of the original decorations had survived.Some details of the preservation can be read in David Winfield, \\"Sancta Sophia, Trebizond: A Note on the Cleaning and Conservation Work\\", Studies in Conservation, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Nov., 1963), pp. 117-130. All that did survive, however, are thought to be original works done just after its construction, and are considered part of the Byzantine 'Palaiologic Renaissance'. The Hagia Sophia church is an important example of late Byzantine architecture, being characterised by a high central dome and four large column arches supporting the weight of the dome and ceiling. Below the dome is an Opus sectile pavement of multicolored stones. The church was built with a cross-in-square plan, but with an exterior form that takes the shape of a cross thanks to prominent north and south porches. The structure is 22 metres long, 11.6 metres wide and 12.7 metres tall. The late 13th-century frescos, revealed during the University of Edinburgh restoration, illustrate New Testament themes. External stone figurative reliefs and other ornamenting is in keeping with local traditions found in Georgia. 24 metres to the west of the church is a tall bell tower, 40 metres high. It was built in 1427 and houses a small chapel on its second floor. The internal walls of the bell tower are covered in frescoes. It was also used as an observatory by local astronomers. =Mosque conversion= In 2012, the religious authorities (Diyanet) filed a lawsuit against the ministry of culture, claiming the ministry had been 'illegally occupying' the church for some decades. The Diyanet won the case, getting ownership of the building. On 5 July 2013, the former church was partially converted for a while into a mosque according to the local Vakif Direction of Trabzon, which is the owner of the estate. The reconstruction works were started\\"Mosque conversion raises alarm.\\"\\"Bartholomew I: Do not transform Hagia Sophia in Trabzon into a mosque.\\", in which some frescoes were veiled and the floor covered by a carpet. The mufti of the Turkish province Trabzon said that ‚Äúthe works for opening the Hagia Sophia mosque in the city to practice prayers again are going on,‚Äù and claimed that ‚Äúduring the prayer the mural paintings will be covered by curtains\\". The local union of architects from Trabzon filed a lawsuit against the ministry of religious affairs' conversion plan. A local judge ruled the transformation of the former church to be illegal, and ordered it to be maintained as a museum.Hagia Sophia to remain museum Kerknet, 6 November 2013 However, it has remained a mosque. Between 2013 and 2018 the fresco's and opus sectile floor mosaic in the prayer hall were covered by immovable curtains and carpets, while the fresco's in the narthex remained uncovered. During renovation works from 2018 to 2020 the building was closed to visitors. A report drafted by the local union of architects heavily criticized the 2013 mosque conversion, and a court ordered the ministry of religious affairs to fulfill its promise and make the frescoes visible outside prayer time. In 2020 a retractable suspended ceiling was put in place underneath the dome, and a glass floor was placed over the opus sectile mosaic. Cultural significance The church figures prominently and has key significance for the author's spiritual development in Rose Macaulay's novel The Towers of Trebizond.

In the United States, six to eight million animals are brought to shelters each year, of which an estimated three to four million are subsequently euthanized, including 2.7 million considered healthy and adoptable. Euthanasia numbers have declined from the 1970s, when U.S. shelters euthanized an estimated 12 to 20 million animals. Most humane societies, animal shelters and rescue groups urge animal caregivers to have their animals spayed or neutered to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters that could contribute to this dynamic. Global effects Dealing with a population of unwanted domestic animals is a major concern to animal welfare and animal rights groups. Domestic animal overpopulation can also be an ecological concern. It is also a financial problem: capturing, impounding and eventual euthanasia costs taxpayers and private agencies millions of dollars each year. Unwanted pets are also commonly released to the wild, sometimes contributing to severe damage to ecosystems (e.g., the effect of introduction of exotic snakes to Florida's Everglades). StatisticsBahrain= In Bahrain the number of stray dogs has been increasing since early 2000s with the situation getting out of hand in late 2010s which caused a lot of controversy regarding the case from people claiming to be bothered and attacked by stray dogs and stray dogs puppies being inhumanely murdered (or burned). On the other hand, since 2014 an act has been put by the Bahrain Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) and made a plea to the government to help keep the Catch, Neuter and Return programme (CNVR) running. Frequent attacks on farms also happened, Sheikha Marwa bint Abdulrahman Al Khalifa also contributed to the case and decided to build a shelter (welfare) for the strays to neuter and rehabilitate them to prevent further attacks while also cooperating with the Bahrain stray dogs society group. =Canada= The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies (CFHS) has been collecting statistics from Canadian animal shelters since 1993. A survey in 2013 included data from 100 of 186 humane societies and SPCAs. However, municipal animal services agencies were not included, hence \\"the data in this report represents only a fraction of homeless companion animals in Canada.\\" In 2012, the surveyed shelters took in just over 188,000 animals, and euthanized 65,423 animals, representing 35% of all intakes. Six times as many cats were euthanized as dogs, or 41% of cats and 15% of dogs. The report said a gradually improving trend, but that cats have a far worse outcome than dogs: \\"More than twice as many cats enter shelters than dogs, and though adoption rates for cats are similar to those for dogs, fewer cats are reclaimed and many more are euthanized.\\"In 2013, half a million unwanted pets were euthanized in Quebec =United States= Estimates of animals brought to shelters and of animals subsequently euthanized in the U.S. have issues with their reliability. The Humane Society of the United States provides shelter statistics with this caution: \\"There is no central data reporting system for U.S. animal shelters and rescues. These estimates are based on information provided by the (former) National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy.\\" The HSUS provided numbers of 6 to 8 million animals taken to shelters, 3 to 4 million animals euthanized, and 2.7 million of the euthanized animals being healthy and adoptable, as estimates for 2012‚Äì2013, and also for annual figures in an August 2014 article. The National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy conducted a survey over four years, 1994‚Äì1997, and cautions against the use of their survey for wider estimates: \\"It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate the numbers of animals entering animal shelters in the United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters.\\" Summary statistics from the survey said that in 1997, 4.3 million animals entered the surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals. These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats. The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals provides alternate numbers, saying that there are about 13,600 community animal shelters in the US. \\"There is no national organization monitoring these shelters\\", and \\"no government institution or animal organization is responsible for tabulating national statistics for the animal protection movement.\\" However, national estimates are provided of 7.6 million animals entering shelters each year, with 2.7 million of them euthanized. The American Humane Association said the difficulties in estimating numbers, and provides a higher figure, saying that in 2008, an estimated 3.7 million animals were euthanized in shelters. A 1993 study of US dog populations considered a wider range of sources than animal shelters.\\"Are there too many dogs and cats?: Pet overpopulation myths and Facts\\", Norma Bennett Woolf, National Animal Interest Alliance, March 19, 1997, referring to Gary J. Patronek and Andrew N Rowan, \\"Determining Dog and Cat Numbers and Population Dynamics\\", Anthrozoos Vol. 8, No. 4, (1995), pp. 199-205; that article referred to the original 1993 study: \\"Development of a Model for Estimating the Size and Dynamics of the Pet Dog Population\\", Gary J. Patronek, Anthrozoos, Vol. 12, 1993; No. 7(1), pp. 25-42. The study found that 4 million dogs entered shelters, with 2.4 million (or 60%) euthanized (p. 203). Reasons for relinquishment Unwanted dogs and cats may have been acquired from any source. Large numbers of animals are placed in shelters by pet owners each year for reasons such as moving, allergies, behavioral problems, and lack of time or money, or the pet animal giving birth to young. Another common reason for surrendering a pet is because of milestones, like marriage or the birth of a new baby. Purebred animals The American Pet Products Association says that since purebreds are only 5% to 6% of the US pet cat population, the overpopulation problem is mainly due to mixed or random bred animals, and avoiding purebred cats would make little difference. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) says that 25% of the dogs who enter animal shelters are purebred. The American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) say the benefits of purebred dogs or cats include that they have been developed over time to show specific traits that are useful for hunting, rescue, assistance and other needs. Animal buyers, including pet owners, may choose a purebred to ensure they know ahead of time the size and other characteristics a young animal will grow into. The CFA also says that purebred cats may make better pets because they have a weaker hunting instinct. The HSUS says that a pedigree is not a guarantee of health and temperament, and that mixed breed dogs and cats often show good characteristics of both breeds, and may be less likely to have genetic defects. The AKC says breeders offer services and information about the animals they sell, such as a detailed pedigree, and expertise in the health and temperament of the breed they specialize in. The HSUS says animal shelters may offer animals that have already had necessary veterinary procedures, such as spaying or neutering, vaccination, deworming, and microchipping. The best practices set by the AKC for responsible breeders include screening customers so animals are placed in a good home, and follow up services including collecting long term health and development data about animals they have bred, and guaranteeing to take back any animals if their situation is not mutually beneficial for the pet and the owner, and then placing them in a new home. The AKC says that their organization serves to prevent animal cruelty by suspending the benefits of their breed registry and other services from members convicted of animal cruelty, and that their inspection program actively uncovers cases of inhumane treatment of dogs. The HSUS says the AKC has lobbied against laws to stop puppy mills, and that many of the breeders certified as humane by AKC inspectors were later convicted of animal cruelty offenses, while the AKC says it has favored legislation that is necessary, but worked to stop well-intentioned laws that are unenforceable or counterproductive, such as kennel population limits that may harm genetic diversity. The HSUS does not advocate banning breeding but encourages prospective pet owners to seek a breed rescue organization rather than buying directly from a breeder. Backyard breeding and puppy mills are motivated by profit and the perceived high demand for a particular breed, often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through pet stores or directly from the breeders themselves. The AKC says that negligence and cruelty to animals is illegal throughout the US, and that the solution to irresponsible breeding is more effective enforcement of the law, rather than blaming responsible breeders or the demand for purebred animals. The CFA's legislative stance is similar to the AKC. The CFA also says that cat overpopulation is due to free roaming, unaltered pet cats, and feral cats, not purebreds. The CFA says that animal control agencies have failed to publicize complete statistics on the killing of dogs and cats that are dangerously aggressive, concealing the degree to which pet animal euthanasia will always be unavoidable. Opposition to premise Nathan Winograd of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a promoter of no-kill shelters, says that overpopulation is a myth and logical fallacy, which many animal control agencies use to avoid criticism for high numbers of killings and low numbers of adoptions. Winograd says that traditional shelters kill animals primarily out of habit and convenience, even when space is available for the animals. He says that using trap-neuter-return (TNR) for stray and feral cats, his organizations have been able to save all healthy and treatable animals, and raise their save rates to at least 90% of all impounded animals. He says there are enough homes for all the homeless animals: \\"Based on the number of existing households with pets who have a pet die or run away, more homes potentially become available each year for cats than the number of cats who enter shelters, while more than twice as many homes potentially become available each year for dogs than the number of dogs who enter shelters.\\" Winograd says his methods, including TNR for stray and feral cats, and comprehensive changes in animal control, rescue, shelter and community efforts have succeeded in saving all healthy and treatable animals, amounting to at least 90% of all impounded animals. Winograd says that hundreds of No Kill Communities have been created across the U.S., and they are increasing in number throughout the world. In October 2014, the website \\"Out the Front Door\\" documented 212 communities in the U.S. saving more than 90% of impounded animals. Christie Keith, social media adviser for animal welfare organizations, said in 2012 that the use of the term \\"overpopulation\\" to justify shelter killings involves the logical fallacy of a tautology. If a shelter with no adoption program was able to save more animals when a program was added and then enhanced, was the improvement in save rates due to a \\"Reduction in 'pet over-population'? Or improvement in shelter management practices?\\" When communities are able to save more than 90% of the animals admitted, Keith asks, \\"Did they reduce 'pet over-population,' or did they become a no-kill community by implementing modern, proven, progressive sheltering practices?\\" In a 2008 article, dog advocate Loretta Baughan said that underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. She said that the great majority of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.\\"Pet underpopulation: The Pet Shortage in the U.S. by Loretta Baughan\\", Loretta Baughan, Spaniel Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 4, Jan.-Feb. 2008.

It is similar to SimPark, except that the park is set in Africa rather than in North America, and therefore has African animals and plants. Gameplay The game is divided into three different zones, the nature park, the tourist grounds, and the African village. The ultimate aim is for the players' park to reach five stars, although like most Sims games the player can continue playing indefinitely. To gain five stars, the player needs to make sure each zone is being run properly. The player can control tourism and staff. * The park was where the player can buy animals and made sure they were not being over-eaten or underfed. The player can control the species of animals, grasses, shrubs, and trees that were built here. The game has information on every species in it, with short animations for the animals. Natural disasters can occur, like fires, droughts, locusts, and twisters. * The Camp, also known as the Tourist Ground, is where tourists stay. The player can build restaurants, hotels, swimming pools, cottages, tents, etc. for guests. The buildings are staffed by workers hired from the village. * In the village the player can hire drivers, naturalists, guides, cooks, and attendants to staff your tourist grounds. The more staff are hired, the better the village does. The village poaches your park's animals if the player does not hire enough staff. If things go very badly, the village might even stop working for you altogether. The player has the least control over the village because it is up to the AI to decide what to build. There are several scenarios, including one where the park is overrun by rabbits and another where the camp is burned down.

The game is an expanded version of the 1954 game Mille Bornes (itself based on the 1906 game Touring) with the theme altered from car racing to cannabis dealing, with many of the cards essentially the same in their effects. Cards * Peddle Cards are cards which make up the money in the game, indicating the sale of cannabis to a particular value. There are six types: Home Grown, Mexico, Colombia, Jamaica, Panama, and Dr. Feelgood. Each of these has a different monetary value. * Heat on cards represent police activity and are made up of 4 different varieties: Bust, Detained, Felony, and Search and Seizure. A Heat on card played on another player's \\"Market open\\" card prevents that player from peddling cannabis (until the corresponding \\"Heat off\\" card is played). * Heat off cards are made up of Immunity, Hearsay Evidence, Charges Dropped, and A Breeze To Fly. Any of these cards played on the corresponding \\"Heat on\\" card will remove the heat and enable the player to continue putting down peddle cards. * Market open cards enables the player to add peddles of cannabis to their stash (provided there is no heat). In order to end the current hand/round, any player may play a \\"Market close\\" on their own \\"Market open\\" (provided there is no heat). The money for the round is totalled and a new hand is dealt to each player. * Skim cards allow a player to steal peddle cards on the table from other players. Steal Your Neighbour's Pot allows the player to take any peddle card from another player, and The Banker allows the player to steal 20 percent of every player's unprotected tabled peddle money at the end of the round. * Protection cards allow a player to protect their peddle cards against skim cards. There are three types: Grab a Snack ($25,000), Catch a Buzz ($25,000) and Lust Conquers All ($50,000). Dr Feelgood, the highest valued peddle card, may never be protected. * Pay Fine cards function as heat off cards, but require the player to sacrifice a peddle card in their stash to play them. * Nirvana Cards give bonuses to players. There are two types: Stonehigh and Euphoria. Either of these cards will provide extra turns (Stonehigh: 1 turn. Euphoria: 2 turns) and cancel any \\"heat on\\" card active on the player. In addition, the player receives a peddle card from every other player: Stonehigh requires every player to hand over their lowest tabled peddle, whereas Euphoria requires player to hand over their highest tabled peddle. * Paranoia Cards give penalties to players. Each of these cards imposes a penalty on the player who plays it. However, if the cards are found unplayed in a player's hand at the end of a hand, a score penalty is assessed: ($25,000 for Sold out; $50,000 for Double Crossed; and $100,000 for Utterly Wiped Out), it is up to the player to decide which is worth less. Further, whenever any of these cards are played on the discard pile, each player must pass a card from their hand to their neighbour: this can allow the play of one of the less dangerous Paranoia cards to enable a player to pass on a more dangerous one. If these cards are played on a person's peddle pile, Sold out forces the player to skip a turn and lose their lowest peddle; Doublecrossed forces the player to skip two turns and lose their highest peddle; and Utterly Wiped Out forces the player to skip three turns and destroys all unprotected peddle cards and their market open card.

The Constitution explicitly assigns the president the power to sign or veto legislation, command the armed forces, ask for the written opinion of their Cabinet, convene or adjourn Congress, grant reprieves and pardons, and receive ambassadors. The president shall take care that the laws are faithfully executed and the president has the power to appoint and remove executive officers. The president may make treaties, which need to be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, and is accorded those foreign-affairs functions not otherwise granted to Congress or shared with the Senate. Thus, the president can control the formation and communication of foreign policy and can direct the nation's diplomatic corps. The president may also appoint Article III judges and some officers with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. In the condition of a Senate recess, the president may make a temporary appointment.  Commander-in-chief  The president of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and as such exercises supreme operational command over all national military forces of the United States. In this capacity, the president has the power to launch, direct, and supervise military operations, order or authorize the deployment of troops (in foreign countries), unilaterally launch nuclear weapons, and form military policy with the Department of Defense and Homeland Security.

The president and the secretary of defense collectively, form the National Command Authority. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated from the president to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through its secretary.

The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout American history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority. There is broad consensus that the framers of the Constitution intended Congress to declare war and the president to direct the war; Alexander Hamilton said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have \\"the direction of war when authorized or begun\\". Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution of 1973, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war, but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989. The amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied dramatically.Andrew J. Polsky, Elusive Victories: The American Presidency at War (Oxford University Press, 2012) online review George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion‚Äîa conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \\"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\\", although James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in the defense of Washington D.C. during the War of 1812. President Abraham Lincoln advising with his Generals during the American Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in strategy development and day-to-day military operations during the American Civil War, 1861‚Äì1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.James M. McPherson, Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln As Commander in Chief (2009) On the other extreme, Woodrow Wilson paid very little attention to operational military details of World War I and had very little contact with the War Department or with General John J. Pershing, who had a high degree of autonomy as commander of the armies in France.John Milton Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) ch 18 As president during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt worked closely with his generals and admirals, and assigned Admiral William D. Leahy as \\"Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief\\".Eric Larrabee, Commander in Chief: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, His Lieutenants, and Their War (2004) Harry S. Truman believed in a high amount of civilian leadership of the military, making many tactical and policy decisions based on the recommendations of his advisors‚Äîincluding the decision to use atomic weapons on Japan, to commit American forces in the Korean War, and to terminate Douglas MacArthur from his command. Lyndon B. Johnson kept a very tight personal control of operations during the Vietnam War, which some historians have sharply criticized.Larry Berman, Lyndon Johnson's War: The Road to Stalemate in Vietnam (1991) The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the ensuing Gulf War in 1991 saw George H. W. Bush assemble and lead one of the largest military coalitions of nations in modern times. Confronting a major constitutional issue of murky legislation that left the wars in Korea and Vietnam without official declarations of war, Congress quickly authorized sweeping war-making powers for Bush. The leadership of George W. Bush during the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War achieved mixed results. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda, the subsequent War on Terror that followed, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq due to Iraq's alleged sponsorship of terrorism and possession of weapons of mass destruction, the speed at which the Taliban and Ba'ath Party governments in both Kabul and Baghdad were toppled by an overwhelming superiority of American and allied forces defied the predictions of many military experts. However, insufficient post-war planning and strategy by Bush and his advisors to rebuild those nations were costly. During the 20th century, certain regional commanders came to be called commander-in-chief.CINCLANTFLT navy.mil As of 2011, there are nine combatant commanders; six have regional responsibilities, and three have functional responsibilities. Before 2002, the combatant commanders were referred to in daily use as commanders-in-chief (for instance \\"Commander in Chief, U.S. Central Command\\"), even though the positions were in fact already statutorily designated as \\"combatant commander\\" (CCDR). On 24 October 2002, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld announced his decision that the use of commander- in-chief would thereafter be reserved for the president only. \\"CINC\\" Is Sunk, American Forces Press Service, 25 October 2002. Retrieved on 2016-05-04. The president, as commander-in-chief, may also call into federal service individual state units of the National Guard. In times of war or national emergency, the Congress may grant the president broader powers to manage the national economy and protect the security of the United States, but these powers were not expressly granted by the Constitution.  Executive powers  Within the executive branch itself, the president has broad powers to manage national affairs and the priorities of the government. The president can issue rules, regulations, and instructions called executive orders, which have the binding force of law upon federal agencies but do not require approval of the United States Congress. Executive orders are subject to judicial review and interpretation. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 put additional responsibilities on the presidency for the preparation of the United States federal budget, although Congress was required to approve it. The act required the Office of Management and Budget to assist the president with the preparation of the budget. Previous presidents had the privilege of impounding funds as they saw fit, however the United States Supreme Court revoked the privilege in 1998 as a violation of the Presentment Clause. The power was available to all presidents and was regarded as a power inherent to the office. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed in response to large-scale power exercises by President Nixon. The act also created the Congressional Budget Office as a legislative counterpoint to the Office of Management and Budget.  Powers related to legislation  The president has several options when presented with a bill from Congress. If the president agrees with the bill, he can sign it into law within ten days of receipt. If the president opposes the bill, he can veto it and return the bill to Congress with a veto message suggesting changes unless the Congress is out of session then the president may rely on a pocket veto. Presidents are required to approve all of a bill or none of it; selective vetoes have been prohibited. In 1996, Congress gave President Bill Clinton a line-item veto over parts of a bill that required spending federal funds. The Supreme Court, in Clinton v. New York City, found Clinton's veto of pork-barrel appropriations for New York City to be unconstitutional because only a constitutional amendment could give the president line-item veto power. When a bill is presented for signature, the president may also issue a signing statement with expressions of their opinion on the constitutionality of a bill's provisions. The president may even declare them unenforceable but the Supreme Court has yet to address this issue. Congress may override vetoes with a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The process has traditionally been difficult and relatively rare. The threat of a presidential veto has usually provided sufficient pressure for Congress to modify a bill so the president would be willing to sign it. Much of the legislation dealt with by Congress is drafted at the initiative of the executive branch. The president may personally propose legislation in annual and special messages to Congress including the annual State of the Union address and joint sessions of Congress. If Congress has adjourned without acting on proposals, the president may call a special session of the Congress. Beyond these official powers, the U.S. president, as a leader of his political party and the United States government, holds great sway over public opinion whereby they may influence legislation. To improve the working relationship with Congress, presidents in recent years have set up an Office of Legislative Affairs. Presidential aides have kept abreast of all important legislative activities.  Before taking office, the president-elect and his transition team must appoint people to more than 6,000 federal positions. The appointments range from top officials at U.S. government agencies, to the White House Staff, and members of the United States diplomatic corps. Many, but not all, of these positions at the highest levels are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The president also nominates persons to fill federal judicial vacancies, including federal judges, such as members of the United States courts of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. These nominations require Senate confirmation, and this can provide a major stumbling block for presidents who wish to shape the federal judiciary in a particular ideological stance. As head of the executive branch, the president appoints the top officials for nearly all federal agencies. These positions are listed in the Plum Book which outlines more than seven thousand appointive positions in the government. Many of these appointments are made by the president. In the case of ten agencies, the president is free to appoint a new agency head. For example, it is not unusual for the CIA's director or NASA's administrator to be changed by the president. Other agencies that deal with federal regulation such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission have set terms that will often outlast presidential terms. For example, governors of the Federal Reserve serve for fourteen years to ensure agency independence. The president also appoints members to the boards of directors for government-owned corporations such as Amtrak. The president can also make a recess appointment if a position needs to be filled while Congress is not in session. In the past, presidents could appoint members of the United States civil service. This use of the spoils system allowed presidents to reward political supporters with jobs. Following the assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, Congress instituted a merit-based civil service in which positions are filled on a nonpartisan basis. The Office of Personnel Management now oversees the staffing of 2.8 million federal jobs in the federal bureaucracy. The president must also appoint his staff of aides, advisers, and assistants. These individuals are political appointments and are not subject to review by the Senate. All members of the staff serve \\"at the pleasure of the President\\".https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive- order/11183.html Executive Order 11183--Establishing the President's Commission on White House Fellowships Since 1995, the president has been required to submit an annual report to Congress listing the name and salary of every employee of the White House Office. The 2011 report listed 454 employees. 2011 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff  Executive clemency  Article II of the United States Constitution gives the president the power of clemency. The two most commonly used clemency powers are those of pardon and commutation. A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime. Once a pardon is issued, all punishment for the crime is waived. A person seeking executive clemency by pardon, reprieve, commutation of sentence, or remission of fine shall execute a formal petition. The petition shall be addressed to the president of the United States and shall be submitted to the pardon attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, except for petitions relating to military offenses. A person accepting the pardon through execution of a formal petition must, however, acknowledge that the crime did take place. The president can only grant pardons for federal offences. The president maintains the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice to review all requests for pardons. The president can also commute a sentence which, in effect, changes the punishment to time served. While the guilty party may be released from custody or not have to serve out a prison term, all other punishments still apply. Most pardons are issued as oversight of the judicial branch, especially in cases where the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are considered too severe. This power can check the legislative and judicial branches by altering punishment for crimes. Presidents can issue blanket amnesty to forgive entire groups of people. For example, President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to Vietnam draft dodgers who had fled to Canada. Presidents can also issue temporary suspensions of prosecution or punishment in the form of respites. This power is most commonly used to delay federal sentences of execution. Pardons can be controversial when they appear to be politically motivated. President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of White House staffer Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby and President Donald Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone.  Foreign affairs  Under the Constitution, the president is the federal official that is primarily responsible for the relations of the United States with foreign nations. The president appoints ambassadors, ministers, and consuls (subject to confirmation by the Senate) and receives foreign ambassadors and other public officials. With the secretary of state, the president manages all official contacts with foreign governments. On occasion, the president may personally participate in summit conferences where heads of state meet for direct consultation. For example, President Wilson led the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 after World War I; President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Allied leaders during World War II; and every president sits down with world leaders to discuss economic and political issues and to reach agreements. Through the Department of State and the Department of Defense, the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiate treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two- thirds of the Senate. The president may also negotiate executive agreements with foreign powers that are not subject to Senate confirmation.  Emergency powers  The Constitution does not expressly grant the president additional powers in times of national emergency. However, many scholars think that the Framers implied these powers because the structural design of the Executive Branch enables it to act faster than the Legislative Branch. Because the Constitution remains silent on the issue, the courts cannot grant the Executive Branch these powers when it tries to wield them. The courts will only recognize a right of the Executive Branch to use emergency powers if Congress has granted such powers to the president. Emergency presidential power is not a new idea. However, the way in which it is used in the twenty- first century, presents new challenges. A claim of emergency powers was at the center of President Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus without Congressional approval in 1861. Lincoln claimed that the rebellion created an emergency that permitted him the extraordinary power of unilaterally suspending the writ. With Chief Justice Roger Taney sitting as judge, the Federal District Court of Maryland struck down the suspension in Ex parte Merryman, although Lincoln ignored the order. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt similarly invoked emergency powers when he issued an order directing that all Japanese Americans residing on the West Coast be placed into internment camps during World War II. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this order in Korematsu v. United States. Harry Truman declared the use of emergency powers when he nationalized private steel mills that failed to produce steel because of a labor strike in 1952. With the Korean War ongoing, Truman asserted that he could not wage war successfully if the economy failed to provide him with the material resources necessary to keep the troops well- equipped. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, refused to accept that argument in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, voting 6-3 that neither commander-in- chief powers nor any claimed emergency powers gave the president the authority to unilaterally seize private property without Congressional legislation. Congressional legislation gives the President powers to commandeer states and governors of states, if the President deems they are engaged in insurrection. 10 USC Sections 252, 253https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/252https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/253 According to research conducted by the Brennan Center at New York University Law School, administrations since Eisenhower have drafted secret Presidential Emergency Action Documents (PEADs) that assert what one government document described as \\"extraordinary presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations.\\" These secret powers appear to be exempt from congressional oversight. PEADs undergo periodic revision, and although their current contents were not known as of 2020, previous PEADs included emergency powers to detain \\"alien enemies\\" and other \\"dangerous persons\\"; invoke various forms of martial law; authorize a general warrant permitting search and seizure of persons and property; suspend production of the Federal Register; and censor news reports. The Brennan Center found that 56 PEADs were in effect as of 2018.https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research- reports/presidential-emergency-action-documents  Executive privilege  Executive privilege gives the president the ability to withhold information from the public, Congress, and the courts in national security and diplomatic affairs. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, Washington's action created the precedent for privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed audio tapes to a special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that privilege was not absolute. The Court reasoned that the judiciary‚Äôs interest in the ‚Äúfair administration of criminal justice‚Äù outweighed President Nixon‚Äôs interest in keeping the evidence secret. Later President Bill Clinton lost in federal court when he tried to assert privilege in the Lewinsky affair. The Supreme Court affirmed this in Clinton v. Jones, which denied the use of privilege in cases of civil suits.  Constraints on presidential power  Because of the vast array of presidential roles and responsibilities, coupled with a conspicuous presence on the national and international scene, political analysts have tended to place great emphasis on the president's powers. Some have even spoken of \\"the imperial presidency\\", referring to the expanded role of the office that Franklin D. Roosevelt maintained during his term. President Theodore Roosevelt famously called the presidency a \\"bully pulpit\\" from which to raise issues nationally, for when a president raises an issue, it inevitably becomes subject to public debate. A president's power and influence may have limits, but politically the president is certainly the most important power in Washington and, furthermore, is one of the most famous and influential of all Americans. Though constrained by various other laws passed by Congress, the president's executive branch conducts most foreign policy, and their power to order and direct troops as commander-in-chief is quite significant (the exact limits of a president's military powers without Congressional authorization are open to debate). The Separation of Powers devised by the founding fathers was designed to do one primary thing: to prevent the majority from ruling with an iron fist. Based on their experience, the framers shied away from giving any branch of the new government too much power. The separation of powers provides a system of shared power known as \\"checks and balances\\". For example, the president appoints judges and departmental secretaries, but these appointments must be approved by the Senate. The president can veto bills, or deny them. If he does that, the bill is sent back to Congress.

In 1992, the NIH recommended that the term \\"dysplastic nevus\\" be avoided in favor of the term \\"atypical mole\\". An atypical mole may also be referred to as an atypical melanocytic nevus, atypical nevus, B-K mole, Clark's nevus, dysplastic melanocytic nevus, or nevus with architectural disorder. Dysplastic nevi often grow to larger than ordinary moles, and may have irregular and indistinct borders. Their color may not be uniform, and may range from light pink to very dark brown. They usually begin flat, but parts may be raised above the skin surface. See ABCDE and \\"ugly duckling\\" characteristics below. Dysplastic nevi can be found anywhere, but are most common on the trunk in men, and on the calves in women. There is some controversy in the dermatology community as to whether or not the \\"dysplastic\\"/\\"atypical\\" nevus exists. Some have argued that the terms \\"dysplastic\\" and \\"atypical\\" only refer to diagnostic uncertainty, as opposed to biologic uncertainty, and that the lesion is either a nevus or melanoma from the very beginning, as opposed to some kind of \\"premalignant stage\\"; it is only the clinician who is unsure. Some have also argued that even if such nevi do exist, studies have shown that clinicians are unable to reliably identify them anyway, meaning there is no point to even using the concept.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX3kyvFOhakhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db65kKIegeYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRJql5gED74 Cancer risk As seen in Caucasian individuals in the United States, those with dysplastic nevi have a lifetime risk of developing melanoma of greater than 10%, compared to less than 1% for those without any dysplastic nevus. Last updated: January 20, 2019 Precaution for individuals with dysplastic nevi A dermatoscope. A modern polarized dermatoscope. Although there are limited data to support its efficacy, skin self-examination is frequently recommended for preventing melanoma (by identifying atypical moles that can be removed) or for early detection of existing tumors. Examination by a dermatologist has been shown to be beneficial for early melanoma detection. Some dermatologists recommend that an individual with either histologic diagnosis of dysplastic nevus, or clinically apparent atypical moles should be examined by an experienced dermatologist with dermatoscopy once a year (or more frequently). Melanoma on left foot The abbreviation ABCDE has been useful for helping health care providers and laypersons remember the key characteristics of a melanoma (see \\"ABCDE\\" mnemonic below). Changes (in shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) should be brought to the attention of a dermatologist . A popular method for remembering the signs and symptoms of melanoma is the mnemonic \\"ABCDE\\": * Asymmetrical skin lesion. * Border of the lesion is irregular. * Color: melanomas usually have multiple colors. * Diameter: moles greater than 6 mm are more likely to be melanomas than smaller moles. * Evolution: The evolution (i.e. change) of a mole or lesion may be a hint that the lesion is becoming malignant. The E is sometimes omitted, as in the ABCD guideline. A weakness in this system is the D. Many melanomas present themselves as lesions smaller than 6 mm in diameter. An astute physician will examine all abnormal moles, including ones less than 6 mm in diameter. Unfortunately for the average person, many seborrheic keratoses, some lentigo senilis, and even warts may have ABCD characteristics, and cannot be distinguished from a melanoma without a trained eye or dermatoscopy. A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the \\"Ugly Duckling Sign\\". It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an \\"Ugly Duckling\\", and a dermatologist exam is required. The \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" sign suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might prove more challenging. These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present with easy to observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope (dermatoscopy) very difficult. A dermatoscope must be used to detect \\"ugly ducklings\\" among those with light skin or blonde/red hair. People with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of dysplastic nevus syndrome (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma. Biopsy differential diagnoses of pigmented skin lesions, including dysplastic nevus, showing the relative incidence of biopsied lesions, and malignancy potential. When an atypical mole has been identified, a skin biopsy takes place in order to best diagnose it. Local anesthetic is used to numb the area, then the mole is biopsied. The biopsy material is then sent to a laboratory to be evaluated by a pathologist. A skin biopsy can be a punch, shave, or complete excision. The complete excision is the preferred method, but a punch biopsy can suffice if the patient has cosmetic concerns (i.e. the patient does not want a scar) and the lesion is small. A scoop or deep shave biopsy is often advocated, but should be avoided due to risk of a recurrent nevus, which can complicate future diagnosis of a melanoma, and the possibility that resulting scar tissue can obscure tumor depth if a melanoma is found to be present and re-excised. Most dermatologists and dermatopathologists use a system devised by the NIH for classifying melanocytic lesions. In this classification, a nevus can be defined as benign, having atypia, or being a melanoma. A benign nevus is read as (or understood as) having no cytologic or architectural atypia. An atypical mole is read as having architectural atypia, and having (mild, moderate, or severe) cytologic (melanocytic) atypia. Usually, cytologic atypia is of more important clinical concern than architectural atypia. Usually, moderate to severe cytologic atypia will require further excision to make sure that the surgical margin is completely clear of the lesion. The most important aspect of the biopsy report is that the pathologist indicates if the margin is clear (negative or free of melanocytic nevus), or if further tissue (a second surgery) is required. If this is not mentioned, usually a dermatologist or clinician will require further surgery if moderate to severe cytologic atypia is present ‚Äì and if residual nevus is present at the surgical margin. Dysplastic nevus syndrome \\"Dysplastic nevus syndrome\\" refers to individuals who have high numbers of benign moles and also have dysplastic nevi. A small percent of these individuals are members of melanoma kindreds. Inherited dysplastic nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary condition. Dysplastic nevi are more likely to undergo malignant transformation when they occur among members of melanoma families. At least one study indicates a cumulative lifetime risk of nearly 100% in individuals who have dysplastic nevi and are members of melanoma kindreds. Roughly 70% of melanomas arise \\"de novo\\" on clear skin growth, whereas the rest arise within atypical moles. Those with dysplastic nevi have an elevated risk of melanoma. Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones. In 40-50% of cases, the disorder has been linked with germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene, which codes for p16 (a regulator of cell division).

It was owned by Robert P. Adams, who served as its president and general manager.Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 83 In 1972, KUTE was sold to the Progress Radio Network (which changed its name to Tracy Broadcasting one year later) and changed hands again in 1979 to Inner City Broadcasting Corporation, a black-owned radio company based in New York City. It was during this tenure that KUTE shifted to a Disco format under Inner City's first year of ownership. =KUTE - Urban Contemporary and The Quiet Storm= Under Inner City's ownership, KUTE became one of the original stations in the United States to launch a format that would later be called urban contemporary (after shifting away from Disco in 1980), playing the latest R&B;, funk and soul music, featuring local DJs such as \\"Humble Harve\\", Brian Roberts and \\"Lucky Pierre.\\" KUTE was also the starting point for many successful radio careers, including veteran PD Rick Thomas, who was hired in 1982 to do weekends on air by then PD Lucky Pierre. During this time, mornings were hosted by Brian Roberts, afternoon drive by Charlie Fox and evenings with Joe Greene. Weekends also featured Ed Mann, Buster Jones, Scott Lockwood and Strawberry Jan Marie. At 2:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings, KUTE 102 would host an hour of disco/dance mixes, usually pre-mixed vinyl albums specially created for DJs. KUTE 102 was one of the first radio stations to air a \\"mega-mix\\" when the \\"Michael Jackson Mega-Mix\\" debuted in the summer of 1983, capitalizing on the success of Jackson's Thriller album earlier in the year. DJ Mario Flores later hosted a disco dance DJ 12\\" specialty show Sunday mornings from 2:00 am to 3:00 am featuring 15-minute disco mixes, mixed by well known DJs around the U.S. KUTE was quite successful in this format and became a template for the Urban Adult Contemporary stations of today. In late 1983, KUTE changed its format and name to \\"The Quiet Storm\\", playing very mellow, soft, contemporary smooth jazz. Just two years later, in August 1985, Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters, which owned AM 710 KMPC (now KSPN), bought KUTE in the range between $10 and $16 million. =KMPC - \\"Full Spectrum Rock\\"= Golden West initially maintained the Quiet Storm format, but its ratings plummeted by 50% in 1987, prompting the station to fire its airstaff and prepare for a new direction. On October 4, 1987, KUTE changed its call sign to KMPC-FM with a format dubbed \\"Full Spectrum Rock\\", a mixture of classic rock, adult album alternative and progressive rock. Many of the DJs who were let go from the defunct KMET that same year could be heard again on this radio station, including Paraquat Kelley, Cynthia Foxx and Jim Ladd. J.J. Jackson, veteran of KLOS throughout the 1970s, and one of the original MTV VJs in the early 1980s, was program director at this time. =The short-lived KEDG - \\"The Edge\\"= In March 1989, the call letters were once again changed, this time to KEDG, referred to by listeners as \\"The Edge.\\" KEDG continued the same rock format as its predecessor, KMPC, until May 12, 1989, when its call letters and format were once again changed. =KLIT - \\"K-Lite\\"= On May 12, 1989, the call letters were changed to KLIT, and the station referred itself as \\"K-Lite,\\" adopting a soft adult contemporary format. =FM 101.9 - \\"LA's Finest Rock\\"= On July 1, 1994, at 5 p.m., KLIT reverted to KMPC's and KEDG's adult album alternative (\\"AAA\\") format as \\"FM 101.9,\\" featuring the Dr. Demento show in the afternoons. Also added to the already eclectic playlist were the then new folk-rock artists that became very popular during the resurgence of that genre in the 1990s. These artists included Sheryl Crow, Jewel, Sarah McLachlan, The Wallflowers, Suzanne Vega and Shawn Colvin.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-06-24.pdf Upon FCC approval, the call sign switched to KSCA on September 1, 1994. FM 101.9 was known as \\"Southern California's Album Alternative\\"https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Other- Documments/LA-Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1995-01-02.pdf which later morphed into \\"LA's Finest Rock\\". Mike Morrison joined as Program Director from WXPN, Philadelphia. Nicole Sandler, formerly with LA rock station KLOS and The Mark & Brian Show, joined for middays. The station later hired Chuck Moshontz, also from KLOS and paired him with Nicole to do mornings. After the first year, Nicole Sandler was promoted to Music Director. Others on the staff included Mimi Chen, Rich Guzm√°n, Terry Gladstone, Anita Gevinson and Merilee Kelly. The \\"KSCA Music Hall\\" (the hallway outside the deejay booth) hosted live performances by dozens of artists, some of whom had their debuts there before going on to superstardom, including the Dave Matthews Band. This format lasted until midnight on February 5, 1997, when Golden West Broadcasting sold off its last radio property. The last song on FM 101.9 was \\"Her Majesty\\" by The Beatles, which was preceded by a brief monologue from general manager of KSCA, Bill Ward.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-02-07.pdf =Switch to Spanish-language programming= KSCA was bought by the Heftel Broadcasting Corporation in February 1997 for $112.5 million.Broadcasting Yearbook 2000 page D-45 At 12:01 a.m. on February 5, the station signed off the air for about six hours; around 6:15 that evening, following a 12-hour loop of a laugh track, KSCA became \\"La Nueva 101.9,\\" switching to a Spanish-language Ranchera music format, aimed at Los Angeles' growing Mexican-American population. At the time, Southern California only had a couple of full power FM stations broadcasting in Spanish, 107.5 KLVE, airing a Latin Soft AC format, and 97.9 KLAX-FM, which was also broadcasting Regional Mexican music. KSCA's morning host, Eddie \\"Piol√≠n\\" Sotelo, co-sponsored a large immigration rally in Los Angeles on March 25, 2006, along with other local radio personalities including KLAX's \\"El Cucuy\\" Ren√°n Almendar√≠z. An estimated half-million protesters marched through Downtown LA. The morning show is now called \\"El Bueno, La Mala y El Feo\\" (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly). On September 16, 2011, KSCA rebranded from \\"La Nueva 101.9\\" to \\"LA 101.9\\". On March 1, 2016, the station rebranded again, to \\"Zona MX 101.9\\".

The operation to insert the tube involves a myringotomy and is performed under local or general anesthesia. The tube itself is made in a variety of designs. The most commonly used type is shaped like a grommet. When it is necessary to keep the middle ear ventilated for a very long period, a \\"T\\"-shaped tube may be used, as these \\"T-tubes\\" can stay in place for 2‚Äì4 years. Materials used to construct the tube are most often plastics such as silicone or Teflon. Stainless steel tubes exist, but are no longer in frequent use. Medical uses Ear tubeTubes of a more permanent style, unlike those typically used in the United States. These tubes remained in place for four years until one spontaneously left the ear drum. The other was removed with tweezers after having partially disengaged from the ear drum. The removal process can cause significant pain for several minutes. Inserting grommets is a common surgical procedure for treating children around the world. Grommets are most commonly used to help improve hearing for children who have a condition commonly called \\"glue ear\\" (persistent otitis media with effusion) in both ears, and for preventing ear infections in children who have frequent middle ear infections. Grommets are temporary and often fall out after 12‚Äì14 months as the ear heals. Guidelines state that tubes are an option in: * Recurrent acute otitis media: three ear infections in six months or four infections in a year. The evidence for this recommendation; however, is weak. * Chronic otitis media with persistent effusion for six months (one ear) or three months (both ears). * Persistent eustachian tube dysfunction * Barotrauma: Especially for prevention of recurrent episodes (e.g., after air travel, hyperbaric chamber treatment). *Grommets should not be inserted in children who have only one episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) that lasts less than 3 months., which cites *  Adverse effects  Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is common in 25‚Äì75% of children after grommets are inserted. Treatments to prevent this discharge before it occurs should be limited to children who have a higher risk of otorrhoea and it is not clear which preventative treatment is better. The risk of having persistent tympanic membrane perforation following the procedure may be low, and has been estimated at 2%. Other adverse effects are estimated at: blockage of the tympanostomy tube (7%), formation of granulation tissue (4%), grommet falls out too early (4%), and the tympanostomy tube may move towards the middle ear (0.5%). There is also a risk related to general anesthesia. Long term effects include visible changes to the tympanic membrane. These changes usually resolve on their own and do not usually require medical treatment or result in hearing problems that are clinically significant.  Mechanism of action  Grommets work by improving drainage in the ear and allow air to circulate in the ear. Grommet placement has been shown to improve hearing in children with glue ear and may lead to fewer middle ear infections in children who have regular episodes of acute otitis media. Grommets can be used to apply antibiotics drops in children with persistent middle ear infections. Procedure Although myringotomy with tube insertion can be performed under local anesthesia during a regular doctor's appointment in co-operative adults, patients requiring tube insertion are very often young children. Since damage to the ear is possible unless the patient stays quite still while being manipulated, any patient who may have difficulty lying still during the procedure typically undergoes myringotomy and tube insertion under general anesthesia. The insertion of tympanostomy tubes is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on children. In the United States, the procedure accounts for more than 20% of all ambulatory surgery in children under 15 years. For children with ear discharge, antibiotic ear drops may be more effective than antibiotics taken by mouth. It is not clear if antibiotic drops are better than rinsing the ear with saline. It is usually suggested that children keep their ears dry for the first two weeks after having the procedure. It is not thought to be necessary for children to wear ear plugs when swimming or keep their ears dry after the first two weeks as the potential benefit is very small. It is approximated that a child would need to wear ear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one additional ear infection. Outcome Tympanostomy tubes generally remain in the eardrum for six months to two years, with T-tubes lasting up to four years. They generally spontaneously fall out of the eardrum as the skin of the eardrum slowly migrates out towards the ear canal wall over time. The eardrum usually closes without a residual hole at the tube site but in a small number of cases a perforation can persist. There is debate among clinicians as to whether long- lasting tubes are associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes, such as persistent perforation, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerosis and others, as opposed to tubes designed to last for shorter durations.

Like Sodom before him, he first appeared as a boss character in Final Fight, but later evolved into a playable fighter in Street Fighter Alpha 2. Appearances Rolento made his debut appearance as the fourth stage's boss in the original Final Fight. He is a former member of the fictional Red Beret special forces unit and serves as the supervisor of the Mad Gear gang's weapons plant. When defeated, instead of just fading away while lying on the ground like most enemies in the game, he stands up and blows himself up with his own grenades, fading away completely scorched. Rolento and his \\"Industrial Area\\" stage were not included in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System port of Final Fight, nor in its re-release Final Fight Guy, but were included in other ports of the game, such as the Sega CD and Game Boy Advance versions (if the player confronts Rolento as \\"Alpha Cody\\" in the GBA version, Cody will joke about Rolento's omission in the SNES version). In the SNES-exclusive sequel Final Fight 2, Rolento serves as the boss of the fifth stage, Italy (his name is transliterated as \\"Rolent\\" both in the game and in the instruction booklet). His debut as a playable fighter was in the fighting game Street Fighter Alpha 2 in 1996, in which he seeks to build a military utopia following the downfall of the Mad Gear gang and wants to recruit his former ally and nemesis, Sodom and Guy respectively, to his cause. Rolento's ending in Alpha 2 depicts him invading the streets of Metro City after forming his own army. In Street Fighter Alpha 3, Rolento tries to persuade Cody, another former nemesis, to join his army. In his ending, Rolento attempts to infiltrate Shadaloo's underground base to gain M. Bison's secret weapon, the Psycho Drive, only to destroy it with Sodom's help.All About Capcom Head-to- Head Fighting Game 1987‚Äì2000, page 345. His Alpha series' incarnation also appears as a playable character in the 2002 crossover fighting game Capcom vs. SNK 2, as well as in the 1999 fighting game Final Fight Revenge which follows his backstory from the Alpha series. Rolento returns as a playable character in the 2012 crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken, where his official tag partner is the ninja girl Ibuki. In 2013, he was announced to appear as a playable character in Ultra Street Fighter IV. =Other appearances= Rolento made his first appearance outside the Final Fight series in the original Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, where he makes a cameo in Sodom's ending among other former Mad Gear members gathered by Sodom to help rebuild the gang. Although he does not appear in Street Fighter EX, Rolento also plays a role in Doctrine Dark's backstory in this game, as the one responsible for physically crippling him and causing his psychotic breakdown. He also makes a cameo appearance in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, is available in the SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash series, and appears in Capcom World 2. Outside of video games, Rolento appears in the Street Fighter animated series, in the anime OAV miniseries Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, in the Street Fighter comic book Street Fighter II Turbo, and in the manga Sakura Ganbaru. In 2012, Rolento returned to boss role in the platform game Street Fighter X Mega Man, as an enemy of Mega Man. Design and gameplay Rolento was created by Neo_G (Ishizawa Hidetoshi) and his name was supposed to be \\"Laurence\\" (arguably \\"Laurent\\") in the concept stages, but due to the confusion between \\"l\\" and \\"r\\" and additions of vowels at the end of words in transliteration, \\"Laurence\\" became \\"Rolento\\". In Street Fighter, Rolento wears a militant outfit with weapon belts (where he keeps his grenades) going over his shoulders and a red beret on his head. He has a red scarf under his worn yellow military outfit and fights with a stick. This is a change from how he originally appeared in Final Fight, in which he wore a Tiger Stripes colour scheme uniform and wielded a brown club. Tekken character Nina Williams received a Rolento-style alternate costume in an update for Street Fighter X Tekken.http://www.capcom.co.jp/sfxtk_en/system.html In Final Fight, he fights using a rod and resorts to throwing grenades when he is low on energy. Rolento's fighting style in the Street Fighter games is based broadly on his Final Fight counterpart. He uses his stick and grenades from Final Fight, as well as throwing knives and wires. One of Rolento's super combos in the Alpha series, \\"Take No Prisoners\\", involves his opponent being hooked to the ceiling by either El Gado or Holly Wood, enemy characters from Final Fight who appear to be working for Rolento during the Alpha series.All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987‚Äì2000, page 303All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987‚Äì2000, page 333.

Texas Republican Congressman Lamar S. Smith introduced the Act on 8 June 2005.Dennis Crouch, Patent Reform: Patent Act of 2005, blog entry, Patently-O, June 9, 2005 Smith called the Act \\"the most comprehensive change to U.S. patent law since Congress passed the 1952 Patent Act.\\" The Act proposed many of the recommendations made by a 2003 report by the Federal Trade CommissionFederal Trade Commission, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy, A Report by the Federal Trade Commission, October 2003 (pdf) and a 2004 report by the National Academy of Sciences.National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Intellectual Property Rights in the Knowledge-Based Economy, A Patent System for the 21st Century , Stephen A. Merrill, Richard C. Levin, and Mark B. Myers, editors, 2004, The 109th Congress concluded on January 3, 2007 without enacting H.R. 2795. Much of the proposed Act was carried into the proposed Patent Reform Act of 2007 (, ), which was introduced in the 110th Congress on 18 April 2007. A similar act was introduced as the Patent Reform Act of 2009 in the 111th Congress.  Proposed changes in U.S. patent law  H.R. 2795 would have harmonized American patent law with the patent laws of the rest of the world by making the following changes in U.S. patent law: = Switch from first to invent to first to file = The United States is currently the only country in the world that gives priority to the application that claims the earliest invention date, regardless of which application arrives first. The first-to-invent system is thought to benefit small inventors, who may be less experienced with the patent application system. Critics of the first-to-file system also contend it will create a \\"race to the mailbox,\\" and result in sloppier, last-minute patent applications. The first- to-invent system, however, requires the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to undertake lengthy and complicated \\"interference\\" proceedings to try to determine who invented something first when claims conflict. The first-to-file system, supporters contend, would inject much-needed certainty into the patent application process. Finally, because every other country is on a first-to-file system, supporters claim that the majority of patent applicants and attorneys are already operating on a first-to-file basis. A first-to-file priority rule does not permit one individual to copy another's invention and then, by virtue of being the first to file a patent application, be entitled to a patent. All patent applicants must have originated the invention themselves, rather than derived it from another person. In order to police this requirement, the proposed H.R. 2795 provided for \\"inventor's rights contests\\" that would have allowed the USPTO to determine which applicant is entitled to a patent on a particular invention. = Expand prior user rights = Even under a first-to-invent system, the first-inventor-in- fact does not always obtain entitlement to a patent. If, for example, a first- inventor-in-fact maintained his invention as a trade secret for many years before seeking patent protection, he may be judged to have \\"abandoned, suppressed or concealed\\" the invention. Well-established patent law provides that an inventor who makes a secret, commercial use of an invention for more than one year prior to filing a patent application at the USPTO forfeits his own right to a patent. If an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an invention, and another person independently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection, then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement. Many foreign patent regimes, on the other hand, protect prior user rights, which are often seen as assisting small entities that may lack the sophistication or resources to pursue patent protection. The American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 established a \\"first inventor defense,\\" but limited the defense to patents on \\"methods of doing or conducting business;\\" H.R. 2795 would have extended it to all subject matter. = Publish patent applications = Outside the United States, pending patent applications are published 18 months after they are filed, which forewarns competitors that a patent is pending. Prior to 2000, American patent applications were never published. The American Inventors Protection Act allowed pre-grant publication 18 months after filing unless the inventor certified that he would not be seeking patent protection abroad. H.R. 2795 would have closed this loophole. = Allow pre-issuance protests by third parties = Historically, interested individuals could enter a \\"protest\\" against a pending patent application. Critics contended that protests serve mainly to permit third parties to slow down the process for competitors. On the other hand, protests are the only way for third parties to challenge a patent prior to approval, when recourse is only available through the court system. The American Inventors Protection Act severely limited protests, but H.R. 2795 would have eliminated those limitations. = Expand use of post- issuance reexamination and opposition proceedings = Since 1981, the U.S. patent system has incorporated \\"reexamination\\" proceedings, during which third parties can submit information challenging the validity of a patent. In order to discourage abuse of these proceedings, third-party participants may not later assert that a patent is invalid \\"on any ground that [they] raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination proceedings.\\" Some observers believe that this estoppel dissuades potential requesters from use of reexamination, forcing them into federal court. H.R. 2795 would have deleted the phrase \\"or could have raised\\" from the statute, so that reexamination requesters would be limited only with respect to arguments that they actually made before the USPTO. H.R. 2795 would have also established post-grant opposition proceedings, a feature that is common in foreign patent regimes. Oppositions allow a wide range of potential invalidity arguments and are conducted through adversarial hearings that resemble courtroom litigation, but because they limit discovery and involve a lower burden of proof, oppositions are cheaper and faster than lawsuits. = Eliminate the \\"best mode\\" requirement = Patent applications are currently required to \\"set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.\\" This requirement is unique to American patent law, and was identified in the 2004 National Academy of Sciences report as one of the three subjective elements that contribute to high patent litigation costs. H.R. 2795 would have eliminated it. = Modify the patent law doctrine of willful infringement = In patent infringement cases, treble damages are currently available if the court finds the infringement was \\"willful.\\" This is the second subjective factor that has been identified as increasing the length and cost of patent infringement suits. To avoid an allegation of willful infringement, many inventors purposely ignore learning about new patents, which contravenes one of the central purposes of the patent system, the dissemination of scientific knowledge. H.R. 2795 would have limited treble damages to cases in which the plaintiff notified the defendant of the patent, claims and violation, and permit pleading willful infringement only after a court finds that the patent was valid, enforceable, and infringed. = Modify the patent law doctrine of inequitable conduct = Defendants in infringement suits are currently allowed to allege that the patent is unenforceable because the patent holder did not operate honestly and in good faith when it applied for a patent. This is the third subjective factor that has been identified as increasing the length and cost of infringement suits. H.R. 2795 would have eliminated this defense, instead codifying a duty of candor for all parties in proceedings before the USPTO, and providing authority for the PTO to investigate allegations of inequitable conduct and impose civil penalties. = Allow patent applications to be submitted by an assignee = Most foreign countries already allow patent applications to be submitted by an assignee as long as the oath of invention is signed. H.R. 2795 would have adopted a similar rule in the United States. = Limit access to injunctions= Injunctions are currently awarded in patent infringement cases if the plaintiff satisfies a four-part test. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies are not available at law; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserviced by a permanent injunction. H.R. 2795, as originally introduced, would have required a court to consider the \\"fairness\\" of an injunction in light of all the facts and the relevant interests of the parties, and allow an injunction to be stayed pending appeal upon an affirmative showing that the stay would not result in irreparable harm to the owner. This is among the most controversial issues in patent reform. Software and information technology companies generally support limiting injunctions, because their products often involve hundreds or thousands of patents, and a dispute over any of them can result in an injunction that halts production on the entire item. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, generally oppose limiting injunctions, because the items they manufacture are easily analyzed and reproduced and generally involve only one or two patents.

A. The Gal4 transcription factor gene produces a two-domain protein (BD and AD) essential for transcription of the reporter gene (LacZ). B,C. Two fusion proteins are prepared: Gal4BD+Bait and Gal4AD+Prey. Neither of them are usually sufficient to initiate transcription (of the reporter gene) alone. D. When both fusion proteins are produced and the Bait part of the first fusion protein interacts with the Prey part of the second, transcription of the reporter gene occurs. Two-hybrid screening (originally known as yeast two- hybrid system or Y2H) is a molecular biology technique used to discover protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs) and protein‚ÄìDNA interactions by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively. The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA- binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.  History  Pioneered by Stanley Fields and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the technique was originally designed to detect protein‚Äìprotein interactions using the Gal4 transcriptional activator of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Gal4 protein activated transcription of a gene involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection. Abstract is free; full-text article is not. Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein‚ÄìDNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different host organisms such as Escherichia coli or mammalian cells instead of yeast.  Basic premise  The key to the two- hybrid screen is that in most eukaryotic transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding. This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected. The most common screening approach is the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this approach the researcher knows where each prey is located on the used medium (agar plates). Millions of potential interactions in several organisms have been screened in the latest decade using high-throughput screening systems (often using robots) and over thousands of interactions have been detected and categorized in databases as BioGRID. This system often utilizes a genetically engineered strain of yeast in which the biosynthesis of certain nutrients (usually amino acids or nucleic acids) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. This mutant yeast strain can be made to incorporate foreign DNA in the form of plasmids. In yeast two-hybrid screening, separate bait and prey plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the mutant yeast strain or a mating strategy is used to get both plasmids in one host cell. The second high-throughput approach is the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach. Plasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library. If the bait and prey proteins interact (i.e., bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype. The challenge of separating cells that express proteins that happen to interact with their counterpart fusion proteins from those that do not, is addressed in the following section. Fixed domains In any study, some of the protein domains, those under investigation, will be varied according to the goals of the study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein‚Äìprotein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as Zif268. A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263‚Äì352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation and residues 58‚Äì97 of yeast Gal4, respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly. The AD chosen must be able to activate transcription of the reporter gene, using the cell's own transcription machinery. Thus, the variety of ADs available for use in yeast- based techniques may not be suited to use in their bacterial-based analogues. The herpes simplex virus-derived AD, VP16 and yeast Gal4 AD have been used with success in yeast whilst a portion of the Œ±-subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase has been utilised in E. coli-based methods. Whilst powerfully activating domains may allow greater sensitivity towards weaker interactions, conversely, a weaker AD may provide greater stringency. Construction of expression plasmids A number of engineered genetic sequences must be incorporated into the host cell to perform two-hybrid analysis or one of its derivative techniques. The considerations and methods used in the construction and delivery of these sequences differ according to the needs of the assay and the organism chosen as the experimental background. There are two broad categories of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells of types of cell. This library can be ligated into a construct so that it is attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette mutagenesis. Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. =E. coli- specific considerations= By placing the hybrid proteins under the control of IPTG-inducible lac promoters, they are expressed only on media supplemented with IPTG. Further, by including different antibiotic resistance genes in each genetic construct, the growth of non-transformed cells is easily prevented through culture on media containing the corresponding antibiotics. This is particularly important for counter selection methods in which a lack of interaction is needed for cell survival. The reporter gene may be inserted into the E. coli genome by first inserting it into an episome, a type of plasmid with the ability to incorporate itself into the bacterial cell genome with a copy number of approximately one per cell. The hybrid expression phagemids can be electroporated into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells which after amplification and infection with VCS-M13 helper phage, will yield a stock of library phage. These phage will each contain one single-stranded member of the phagemid library. Recovery of protein information Once the selection has been performed, the primary structure of the proteins which display the appropriate characteristics must be determined. This is achieved by retrieval of the protein-encoding sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype. =E. coli= The phagemid used to transform E. coli cells may be \\"rescued\\" from the selected cells by infecting them with VCS-M13 helper phage. The resulting phage particles that are produced contain the single-stranded phagemids and are used to infect XL-1 Blue cells. The double-stranded phagemids are subsequently collected from these XL-1 Blue cells, essentially reversing the process used to produce the original library phage. Finally, the DNA sequences are determined through dideoxy sequencing. Controlling sensitivity The Escherichia coli-derived Tet-R repressor can be used in line with a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) the expression of a previously mentioned reporter such as HIS3, through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R. Sensitivity may also be controlled by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for his3-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for aadA dependent cells. Selection-gene-dependency may also be controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3-gene product and may be used to titrate the minimum level of HIS3 expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media. Sensitivity may also be modulated by varying the number of operator sequences in the reporter DNA. Non-fusion proteins A third, non-fusion protein may be co-expressed with two fusion proteins. Depending on the investigation, the third protein may modify one of the fusion proteins or mediate or interfere with their interaction. Co-expression of the third protein may be necessary for modification or activation of one or both of the fusion proteins. For example, S. cerevisiae possesses no endogenous tyrosine kinase. If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a tyrosine kinase gene. The non-fusion protein may mediate the interaction by binding both fusion proteins simultaneously, as in the case of ligand-dependent receptor dimerization. For a protein with an interacting partner, its functional homology to other proteins may be assessed by supplying the third protein in non-fusion form, which then may or may not compete with the fusion-protein for its binding partner. Binding between the third protein and the other fusion protein will interrupt the formation of the reporter expression activation complex and thus reduce reporter expression, leading to the distinguishing change in phenotype. Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid One limitation of classic yeast two-hybrid screens is that they are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein‚Äìprotein interactions between insoluble integral membrane proteins. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation. In the split- ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different ubiquitin moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\\"Cub\\", residues 35‚Äì76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\\"Nub\\", residues 1‚Äì34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific proteases. Upon bait‚Äìprey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes.  Fluorescent two-hybrid assay  Zolghadr and co-workers presented a fluorescent two-hybrid system that uses two hybrid proteins that are fused to different fluorescent proteins as well as LacI, the lac repressor. The structure of the fusion proteins looks like this: FP2-LacI-bait and FP1-prey where the bait and prey proteins interact and bring the fluorescent proteins (FP1 = GFP, FP2=mCherry) in close proximity at the binding site of the LacI protein in the host cell genome. The system can also be used to screen for inhibitors of protein‚Äìprotein interactions.  Enzymatic two-hybrid systems: KISS  While the original Y2H system used a reconstituted transcription factor, other systems create enzymatic activities to detect PPIs. For instance, the KInase Substrate Sensor (\\"KISS\\"), is a mammalian two-hybrid approach has been designed to map intracellular PPIs. Here, a bait protein is fused to a kinase-containing portion of TYK2 and a prey is coupled to a gp130 cytokine receptor fragment. When bait and prey interact, TYK2 phosphorylates STAT3 docking sites on the prey chimera, which ultimately leads to activation of a reporter gene. One-, three- and one-two-hybrid variantsOne- hybrid= The one-hybrid variation of this technique is designed to investigate protein‚ÄìDNA interactions and uses a single fusion protein in which the AD is linked directly to the binding domain. The binding domain in this case however is not necessarily of fixed sequence as in two-hybrid protein‚Äìprotein analysis but may be constituted by a library. This library can be selected against the desired target sequence, which is inserted in the promoter region of the reporter gene construct. In a positive-selection system, a binding domain that successfully binds the UAS and allows transcription is thus selected. Note that selection of DNA-binding domains is not necessarily performed using a one-hybrid system, but may also be performed using a two-hybrid system in which the binding domain is varied and the bait and prey proteins are kept constant. =Three-hybrid= Overview of three- hybrid assay. RNA-protein interactions have been investigated through a three- hybrid variation of the two-hybrid technique. In this case, a hybrid RNA molecule serves to adjoin together the two protein fusion domains‚Äîwhich are not intended to interact with each other but rather the intermediary RNA molecule (through their RNA-binding domains). Techniques involving non-fusion proteins that perform a similar function, as described in the 'non-fusion proteins' section above, may also be referred to as three-hybrid methods. =One-two-hybrid= Simultaneous use of the one- and two-hybrid methods (that is, simultaneous protein‚Äìprotein and protein‚ÄìDNA interaction) is known as a one-two-hybrid approach and expected to increase the stringency of the screen. Host organism Although theoretically, any living cell might be used as the background to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often do not have the same post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium. =S. cerevisiae (yeast)= The yeast S. cerevisiae was the model organism used during the two-hybrid technique's inception. It is commonly known as the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced- state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment. The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known. Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures. A number of yeast strains have been created specifically for Y2H screens, e.g. Y187 and AH109, both produced by Clontech. Yeast strains R2HMet and BK100 have also been used. = Candida albicans= C. albicans is a yeast with a particular feature: it translates the CUG codon into serine rather than leucine. Due to this different codon usage it is difficult to use the model system S. cerevisiae as a Y2H to check for protein-protein interactions using C. albicans genes. To provide a more native environment a C. albicans two-hybrid (C2H) system was developed. With this system protein-protein interactions can be studied in C. albicans itself. A recent addition was the creation of a high-throughput system. =E. coli= Bacterial two hybrid methods (B2H or BTH) are usually carried out in E. coli and have some advantages over yeast-based systems. For instance, the higher transformation efficiency and faster rate of growth lends E. coli to the use of larger libraries (in excess of 108). The absence of requirements for a nuclear localisation signal to be included in the protein sequence and the ability to study proteins that would be toxic to yeast may also be major factors to consider when choosing an experimental background organism. The methylation activity of certain E. coli DNA methyltransferase proteins may interfere with some DNA-binding protein selections. If this is anticipated, the use of an E. coli strain that is defective for a particular methyltransferase may be an obvious solution. The B2H may not be ideal when studying eukaryotic protein-protein interactions (e.g. human proteins) as proteins may not fold as in eukaryotic cells or may lack other processing. =Mammalian cells= In recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment.https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/promega- notes/66/the-checkmatetm-mammalian-two-hybrid-system.pdf?la=en Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions. Using a mammalian cell line to study mammalian protein-protein interactions gives the advantage of working in a more native context. The post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system. It is also possible with the mammalian two-hybrid system to study signal inputs. Another big advantage is that results can be obtained within 48 hours after transfection. =Arabidopsis thaliana= In 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of A. thaliana protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible. The system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system. =Aplysia californica= The sea hare A californica is a model organism in neurobiology to study among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two- hybrid system has been developed in A californica neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system. =Bombyx mori= An insect two-hybrid (I2H) system was developed in a silkworm cell line from the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, Bombyx mori (BmN4 cells). This system uses the GAL4 BD and the activation domain of mouse NF-Œ∫B P65. Both are under the control of the OpIE2 promoter. ApplicationsDetermination of sequences crucial for interaction= By changing specific amino acids by mutating the corresponding DNA base-pairs in the plasmids used, the importance of those amino acid residues in maintaining the interaction can be determined. After using bacterial cell-based method to select DNA-binding proteins, it is necessary to check the specificity of these domains as there is a limit to the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA). =Drug and poison discovery= Protein‚Äìprotein signalling interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due to their specificity and pervasiveness. The random drug discovery approach uses compound banks that comprise random chemical structures, and requires a high-throughput method to test these structures in their intended target. The cell chosen for the investigation can be specifically engineered to mirror the molecular aspect that the investigator intends to study and then used to identify new human or animal therapeutics or anti-pest agents. =Determination of protein function= By determination of the interaction partners of unknown proteins, the possible functions of these new proteins may be inferred. This can be done using a single known protein against a library of unknown proteins or conversely, by selecting from a library of known proteins using a single protein of unknown function. =Zinc finger protein selection= To select zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) for protein engineering, methods adapted from the two-hybrid screening technique have been used with success. A ZFP is itself a DNA-binding protein used in the construction of custom DNA-binding domains that bind to a desired DNA sequence. By using a selection gene with the desired target sequence included in the UAS, and randomising the relevant amino acid sequences to produce a ZFP library, cells that host a DNA-ZFP interaction with the required characteristics can be selected. Each ZFP typically recognises only 3‚Äì4 base pairs, so to prevent recognition of sites outside the UAS, the randomised ZFP is engineered into a 'scaffold' consisting of another two ZFPs of constant sequence. The UAS is thus designed to include the target sequence of the constant scaffold in addition to the sequence for which a ZFP is selected. A number of other DNA-binding domains may also be investigated using this system. Strengths *Two-hybrid screens are low-tech; they can be carried out in any lab without sophisticated equipment. *Two-hybrid screens can provide an important first hint for the identification of interaction partners. *The assay is scalable, which makes it possible to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the matrix approach. *Yeast two-hybrid data can be of similar quality to data generated by the alternative approach of coaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS). Weaknesses *The main criticism applied to the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein‚Äìprotein interactions are the possibility of a high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often found very small overlap in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems. The reason for this high error rate lies in the characteristics of the screen: *Certain assay variants overexpress the fusion proteins which may cause unnatural protein concentrations that lead to unspecific (false) positives. *The hybrid proteins are fusion proteins; that is, the fused parts may inhibit certain interactions, especially if an interaction takes place at the N-terminus of a test protein (where the DNA-binding or activation domain is typically attached). *An interaction may not happen in yeast, the typical host organism for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a mammalian protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing phosphorylation), which can also lead to false results. *The Y2H takes place in the nucleus. If test proteins are not localized to the nucleus (because they have other localization signals) two interacting proteins may be found to be non-interacting. *Some proteins might specifically interact when they are co-expressed in the yeast, although in reality they are never present in the same cell at the same time. However, in most cases it cannot be ruled out that such proteins are indeed expressed in certain cells or under certain circumstances. Each of these points alone can give rise to false results. Due to the combined effects of all error sources yeast two- hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein‚Äìprotein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as gene ontology annotations or certain network topologies), have homologous interactions in other species.

Founded in 1992 as the Western Reds, they entered into the Australian Rugby League competition in 1995 before defecting to the rival Super League competition in 1997, where they rebranded themselves as the Perth Reds. However, by the end of the year the Reds had become a casualty of the Super League War peace deal and were shut down. The name Reds was named after the native Red Kangaroos. The Reds entered a state of limbo for the next decade but were revived as a lower-level club in 2006 by the WARL and ARL, under the name WA Reds. HistoryWestern Reds (1992‚Äì1996) = The Reds had recruited well in 1993‚Äì94, and signed Peter Mulholland as their first coach. St. George fullback Michael Potter (twice winner of the Dally M Award), 1992 Rookie of year and CLEO bachelor of the year Matthew Rodwell, and Australian and NSW rep player Brad Mackay were three of the major signings. Their first game, played at the WACA, was watched by a record 24,392, with the Reds defeating St George 28‚Äì16. When News Limited began its \\"blitzkrieg\\" in April 1995, the Reds aligned themselves with Super League along with nine other Australian Rugby League clubs. That season the Reds were the best performing of the three expansion teams introduced, winning 11 of their 22 games, including 8 at home, which drew an average crowd of around 13,000, larger than that of many Sydney teams. The Reds even recruited local identity and decorated WAFL and West Coast Eagles (AFL) player Adrian Barich. Barich, having grown up in Canberra reverted from Australian rules football to rugby league, finishing his career with seasons with the Reds, however he never played in first grade. After declaring that the club may not have the financial resources to compete in the 1996 ARL Optus Cup, a major sponsorship with the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sunday Times gave the club some much needed money. By mid 1996 club support had dwindled to just over 6,000. =Perth Reds (1997)= In 1997 the Reds became one of eight ARL teams to join the rival Super League during the dispute known as the Super League war. They changed their name to the Perth City Reds for the 1997 Super League season,\\"League greats back return to WA\\" Paul Barbieri Sportal 13 February 2009 and adopted a jersey of red, white and black. Although the club had made some promising signings, such as Rodney Howe and Robbie Kearns, the crushing $10 million debt that hung over the club (from having to pay the airfares for all visiting teams) at the end of the season led to Super League axing the Perth Reds on 1 October 1997. =Hiatus (1998‚Äì2005)= Rugby league has continued to be played in Western Australia since the Reds left the top-flight competition with the Swan Brewery Cup continuing and NRL matches being staged at various times since 1998. On 8 May 1999, Melbourne Storm played Western Suburbs Magpies at Lathlain Park in Perth, with Melbourne running out winners 62‚Äì6. In 2005, Cronulla Sharks took their home game against the New Zealand Warriors to Perth Oval, and played in front of around 13,000 spectators. =WA Reds (2006‚Äì2011)= 100px The WARL resurrected the Reds in 2006 with the intent of joining the National Rugby League in the future. In 2008 the Reds joined the Jim Beam Cup and played out of Perth Oval. In the 2009 Bundaberg Red Cup the Reds were winless until the back-end of the season when they won 3 of their 4 last games, giving them something to build on for the next season. Darwin Rugby League product Aaron Barnes was named the Reds' player of the year. Unfortunately for financial reasons the Reds snr team was withdrawn from the Bundy Cup for 2010. In 2010 the WA Reds entered an Under 18's team in the S. G. Ball Cup competition. The first trial game on 30 January 2010 was against the runners-up of the Western Australia Rugby League competition the Central Bulldogs ‚Äì they won 38‚Äì20. The WARL have set up two junior academies to help develop players for a return to the NRL with the SG Ball side providing a staging ground for player development. The WA Reds juniors won their first SG Ball game beating the Balmain Tigers at ME Stadium 28‚Äì8. Whilst the team found it tough going against often bigger and more experienced sides they did claim a couple of scalps and at the end of the season Curtis Rona was signed by the Sydney Roosters, earning a call up to the under 20s side during 2010. A new bid logo was launched in 2010 and membership for fans was made available. NRL CEO David Gallop recognised the WA Reds 2013 bid on a number of occasions, speaking positively about the potential for a Perth team in the NRL. =West Coast Pirates (2012-)= In 2012 the WARL launched the West Coast Pirates as the Perth bid team for an NRL licence. As of 2012 West Coast competes in the SG Ball Cup instead of the WA Reds.

The aircraft served on battleships and cruisers in a seaplane configuration, being launched by catapult and recovered from a sea landing. The wings folded back against the fuselage for storage aboard ship. When based ashore or on carriers the single float was replaced by fixed wheeled landing gear. Curtiss delivered 258 SOC aircraft, in versions SOC-1 through SOC-4, beginning in 1935. The SOC-3 design was the basis of the Naval Aircraft Factory SON-1 variant, of which the NAF delivered 64 aircraft from 1940. Design and development The SOC was ordered for production by the United States Navy in 1933 and first entered service in 1935. The first order was for 135 SOC-1 models, which was followed by 40 SOC-2 models for landing operations and 83 SOC-3s. A variant of the SOC-3 was built by the Naval Aircraft Factory and was known as the SON-1.US Navy History website Operational history The first ship the SOC was assigned to was the light cruiser in November 1935; by the end of the decade, the SOC had replaced its predecessor throughout the fleet. Production came to an end in 1938. By 1941, most battleships had transitioned to the Vought OS2U Kingfisher and cruisers were expected to replace their aging SOCs with the third generation SO3C Seamew. The SO3C, however, suffered from a weak engine and plans to adopt it as a replacement were scrapped. The SOC, despite belonging to an earlier generation, went on to execute its missions of gunfire observation and limited range scouting missions. Through the first six months of naval service, the SOC was known as the XO3C-1,Bowers 1979, pp. 339-340. The designation was changed to SOC when it was decided to merge its scouting and observation roles. The SOC was not called the Seagull until 1941, when the U.S. Navy began the wholesale adoption of popular names for aircraft in addition to their alpha-numeric designations. The name 'Seagull' had earlier been given to two civil Curtiss aircraft, a Curtiss Model 18 and a Model 25, both converted Curtiss MF flying boats.Bowers 1979, pp. 178, 183, 627. When operating as a seaplane, returning SOCs would land on the relatively smooth ocean surface created on the sheltered side of the vessel as it made a wide turn, after which the aircraft would be winched back onto the deck.World War II Database/SOC Seagull When the SOC was replaced by the OS2U Kingfisher, most remaining airframes were converted into trainers; they remained in use until 1945.Munson 1985, p. 79. With the failure of the Curtiss SO3C Seamew, many SOCs in second line service were returned to frontline units starting in late 1943. They saw service aboard warships in the combat zone for the rest of World War II. This is one of the few instances in aviation history in which an older aircraft type, that was retired or sent to second line service, replaced the new aircraft type that was intended to replace it.Donald 1997, p. ?.

Born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1950, Nash holds a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and is the author of several acclaimed books. A feature writer for The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Weekend, she was named the Society of Professional Journalists' National Member of the Year in 1994. In 1977, Nash's job afforded her the opportunity to become one of the journalists to view the remains of Elvis Presley. In her dust jacket biography for her book Baby, Let's Play House, she was described as \\"the first journalist to see Elvis Presley in his casket\\". Dolly Parton Nash's much- reprinted 1978 biography of Dolly Parton included material gathered from a long interview with its subject, that took place over the course of several days. The biography, Dolly, was published just as Parton reached mainstream appeal outside of the country music world, via her now-famous pop-music crossover. Nash has closely followed Parton's career since, having also written numerous magazine articles about her and reviewing a number of Parton's albums. Other projects In 1988 Nash received acclaim for her book on Jessica Savitch, Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch, which was the basis for the 1996 motion picture Up Close & Personal, as well as a made-for- television movie named Almost Golden. In the 1990s Nash began researching the life of Elvis Presley in order to write a book. Although there were already several hundred Presley books on the market, her 1995 book, Elvis Aaron Presley: Revelations from the Memphis Mafia, provided what Entertainment Weekly called \\"stunning allegations.\\" As a result of Nash being able to get the collaboration of employees Marty Lacker, Lamar Fike, and Presley's first cousin, Billy Smith who lived and worked with Presley throughout his life, she provided a look at Presley not previously published. Colonel Tom Parker Her research into Presley led to a second book on Colonel Tom Parker. While covering Presley's death, Alanna Nash had seen what most of the throng of reporters there at the time considered as somewhat bizarre decorum by Parker when he came to the funeral dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap. For her 1995 book, Nash had interviewed Colonel Parker but her examination into his life kept unfolding with so many twists and turns that it led to six years of exhaustive research including travel to his birthplace Breda in the Netherlands for documents and interviews. Her book, The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley, was published on July 15, 2003 to acclaim. Billboard called it a \\"classic of music industry reporting\\". Other positive reviews came from The Washington Post, The New York Review of Books, Variety, and Publishers Weekly, among others. In the UK, Mojo music magazine said her book was \\"the most incisive and comprehensive look at the life of the elusive Colonel available\\" and the reviewer for The Observer lauded the book as \\"perhaps the most thoroughly researched music book ever written\\" -- before adding that \\"sadly most of the story has been told before. Nash simply adds layer after layer of padding.\\" For her reporting on Colonel Parker, Nash was voted one of the \\"Heavy 100 of Country Music\\" by Esquire magazine and earned the 2004 CMA Media Achievement Award and the 2004 Belmont Book Award. She has reviewed for Stereo Review magazine, Reader's Digest, and Amazon.com as well as others.

The RJE workstation is called a remote because it usually is located some distance from the host computer. The workstation connects to the host through a modem, digital link, packet-switching network or local area network (LAN). RJE is similar to uux and SSH, except that the workstation sends a complete job stream rather than a single command and that the user does not receive any output until the completion of the job.. The terms Remote Batch, Remote Job System and Remote Job Processing are also used for RJE facilities.  Examples  Remote Job Entry (RJE) is also the name of an OS/360 component that provided RJE services. An RJE workstation operator may have complete console control of the job flow between the workstation and mainframe, depending on local configuration and policy. Houston Automatic Spooling Priority (HASP) initially supported job entry from terminals using Synchronous transmit-receive (STR); eventually HASP II supported only Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), and added the Multi-leaving protocol for BSC programmable work stations; this protocol was incompatible with that used by OS/360 RJE and is the basis for protocols used for job submission from programmable work stations for, e.g., JES2, JES3, OS/VS1 RES, VM RSCS, as well as the later protocols for Network Job Entry (NJE) in, e.g., JES2, JES3, VM RSCS. Conversational Remote Job Entry (CRJE) is a component of OS/360 and OS/VS1 that provides job submission, job retrieval and editing for a user at an interactive terminal. Remote Entry Services (RES) is a component of OS/VS1 that provided RJE services. An RJE workstation operator may have complete console control of the job flow between the workstation and mainframe, depending on local configuration and policy. Remote Spooling Communications Subsystem (RSCS) is, depending on the release, a component of or extra cost product in VM (operating system) that provides RJE services. The RSCS in the free VM/370 only supported BSC; IBM added support for Systems Network Architecture (SNA), NJE and TCP/IP over several chargeable versions. Network Job Entry (NJE) is Store and forward networking for transmitting, e.g., card files, jobs, printed output, among peers. The initial versions of NJE for JES2, JES3 and VM RSCS used BSC multileaving, but IBM quickly added support for Channel-to-channel adapters. IBM later added support for SNA and, ultimately, TCP/IP. NETRJS is the protocol developed by the Campus Computing Network at UCLA to deliver batch jobs to the Remote Job Service (RJS) on their IBM 360 Model 91. This protocol was originally assigned to ARPANET Initial Connection Protocol sockets 71, 73, and 75, and later reassigned to Internet ports 71‚Äì74. RJS is a subsystem of OS/360 MVS written by UCLA to support remote batch from card-reader/printer terminals. 200 USER Terminal was a remote batch terminal and protocolhttp://bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/terminal/82128000_200_User_Terminal_Hardware_Reference_Jul68.pdf developed by the Control Data Corporation for their CDC 6000 series and CDC 3000 series mainframe computers in the 1960s. A 200 USER Terminal consisted of a low speed punched card reader, a line printer, and a CRT operators console. It typically communicated with a remote mainframe via synchronous modem. The software subsystem on the mainframe side was called Export-Import 200, and later, the Remote Batch Facility (RBF). Other remote batch terminals using the UT200 protocol included the CDC 731, 732, and 734.http://bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/terminal/82163400B-1_731_Remote_Batch_Terminals_Operating_and_Programming_Guide_Nov72.pdf Software emulators for the UT200 protocol were also written for a number of minicomputer systems.

Early life Nicieza was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Omar and Irma Riguetti Nicieza.Dedication, Adventures of Captain America No. 1 (Sept. 1991) He was four years old when his family moved to the United States. Growing up in New Jersey, Nicieza learned to read and write from comic books. He lived first in Sayreville, New Jersey and moved to Old Bridge Township, where he attended Madison Central High School, from which he graduated in 1979.O'Donnell, Chris. \\"Creator of weekend box office champion 'Deadpool' from NJ\\", Courier News, January 14, 2016.

He set his sights on being a comic book writer after the family moved to Old Bridge and he graduated from now defunct Madison Central High School in 1979.\\" He studied at Rutgers University, interning at the ABC television network before graduating in 1983 with a degree in advertising and public relations. His brother is Mariano Nicieza, also a comic book writer and editor. Career Until 1985, Nicieza worked for the Berkley Publishing Group, starting in the production department and becoming a managing editor. =Marvel Comics= In 1985, Nicieza joined the staff at Marvel Comics, initially as a manufacturing assistant, later moving to the promotions department as an advertising manager. During this period he began to take his first freelance work for Marvel, writing short articles for Marvel‚Äôs promotional magazine Marvel Age. Nicieza's first published comics story came with Psi-Force No. 9 (July 1987), a title in Marvel's short-lived New Universe imprint. This led to his becoming that title's regular writer from #16 (Feb. 1988) until #32 (June 1989), the final issue. This led to fill-in work on titles such as Classic X-Men, for which he provided backup stories, and in the Marvel Annuals' 1989 summer crossover \\"Atlantis Attacks\\". After Tom DeFalco, then Marvel's editor-in- chief, created the superhero team the New Warriors, using existing characters, in Thor No. 412 (Dec. 1989), he selected Nicieza to write the spin-off series. Nicieza recalled \\"I took the assignment for two reasons. First, I saw a lot of potential in these characters that had already been deemed useless. And secondly, I really wanted to write a monthly book.\\" Collaborating with pencilers Mark Bagley and later Darick Robertson, primarily, Nicieza went on to write the title for most of its first 53 issues (July 1990 ‚Äì November 1994). Years later, Nicieza said that he considers the first 25 issues of New Warriors to be the best work of his career. Also in 1990 Nicieza began short runs on comics such as Alpha Flight (#87‚Äì101), Avengers (#317‚Äì325) and Avengers Spotlight, as well as the miniseries Nomad, which in turn led him to write the ongoing series Nomad vol. 2 in 1992. That year, Nicieza became editor of Marvel's children's imprint, Star Comics. Shortly afterward, he left the Marvel staff and began freelance writing for the company. Nicieza's projects in this period included the first four issues of National Football League-approved superhero NFL SuperPro (Oct. 1991 ‚Äì Feb. 1992), and, with penciler Kevin Maguire, the four-issue miniseries Adventures of Captain America (also known by its cover-logo treatment, The Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty) (Sept. 1991 ‚Äì Jan. 1992), an origin-story retelling set in the 1940s. =The X-Men= In 1991, Nicieza joined with artist Rob Liefeld in co-plotting and writing the final three issues of the New Mutants. In those issues Liefeld and Nicieza created the characters Deadpool and Shatterstar as well as the super team, X-Force. Liefeld and Nicieza then produced an ongoing X-Force title. Nicieza initially worked on the title as scripter; after the departure of Liefeld in No. 12 he became its full writer, which he remained until 1995. By the end of 1992, Nicieza became regular scripter for X-Men vol. 2, beginning with No. 12 (Sept. 1992), working primarily with penciler Andy Kubert throughout his run. For the next three years, Nicieza was among the writers and editors of one of Marvel's most popular superhero franchises during a time of such popular, multi-series crossover story arcs as \\"X-Cutioner's Song\\", \\"Phalanx Covenant\\" and \\"Age of Apocalypse\\". During this period Nicieza wrote the first Cable miniseries as well as the first few issues of the character's subsequent ongoing series. He also wrote the first solo Deadpool series, Deadpool: the Circle Chase in 1993. These series expanded the characters' personalities and established key background information for both characters, all things which were later used by other writers on those characters‚Äô subsequent ongoing books. However in 1995, in a dispute with then editor-in-chief Bob Harras over the future direction of his plotlines on X-Force, Nicieza was fired from the X-titles, leaving X-Force with No. 43 and X-Men with No. 45\\\\. He later remarked, \\"I never wanted to leave [X-Force], and never felt my firing was justified. ... I don't recall being given a reason [for being fired], and I also don't recall asking for one. ... Considering it was a Top 10 selling title at the time, I felt it was a wholly unjustified decision.\\" =Acclaim Comics= After 1995, Nicieza wrote short runs of Captain Marvel (vol. 2, 1995), Spider-Man: The Final Adventure (1995) and stories for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers before leaving the company in 1996. That year Nicieza did his first work for rival publisher DC Comics, co-writing Justice League: Midsummer Nightmare with Mark Waid which relaunched the Justice League as the JLA. He also worked for Twist and Shout Comics writing and pencilling back-up stories in X-Flies Special #1 and Dirtbag #7. Later in 1996 Nicieza joined Acclaim Comics as senior vice- president and editor-in-chief. He was charged with revamping the companies intellectual properties which had previously formed Valiant Comics' Valiant Universe. Nicieza as editor oversaw the new version, dubbed \\"VH2\\", which re- imagined characters such as Solar, X-O Manowar, and Ninjak. Nicieza himself wrote the Turok title as well as a new series, Troublemakers. Turok met with success as a video game adaptation, and Nicieza was promoted to president and publisher of Acclaim Comics in 1997. He also wrote a Turok novella during this period. However, after staff cuts and most of the lines' cancellation, Nicieza left Acclaim in 1999. =Freelance work= Returning to freelance work, Marvel and the X-Men, Nicieza co-wrote the Magneto Wars crossover through Uncanny X-Men #366‚Äì367 and X-Men vol. 2, #86‚Äì87, with artist Alan Davis in 1999. This led to the successive Magneto limited series Magneto Rex (1999) and Magneto: Dark Seduction (2000), as well as an ongoing Gambit (1999) series which he wrote for the first 24 issues of its 25-issue run. Also in 1999, Nicieza began writing Thunderbolts with #34. He continued to write the book (initially with old partner Mark Bagley on art, later with Patrick Zircher and Chris Batista) up until No. 75 when the title was revamped. The revamp was unsuccessful, and in 2004 the original version of the team was resurrected, initially in an Avengers/Thunderbolts miniseries, then later in the New Thunderbolts series with Nicieza again as writer. Nicieza also worked on several limited series at Marvel and DC around the turn of the century. At Marvel he wrote Citizen V (2001), Citizen V and the V Battalion: Everlasting (2002), X-Men Forever (2001), and X-Force vol. 2, as well as the short-lived ongoing series Hawkeye (2003); while at DC, he wrote the six-issue miniseries Supermen of America (1999) and the Elseworlds project JLA: Created Equal (2000), as well as some issues of the children's comic Justice League Adventures. In 2003 Nicieza co- created, with artist Stefano Raffaele, the horror miniseries The Blackburne Covenant, published by Dark Horse Comics. That same year he returned to two of his old characters with the Marvel series Cable and Deadpool, of which he wrote all 50 issues. In 2006, Nicieza returned to DC with a three-issue arc in Action Comics #841‚Äì843 (July‚ÄìSept. 2006), co-written with Kurt Busiek. Nicieza also wrote JSA Classified #28.

Early life Ailsa was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on June 28, 1901. She was the daughter of the banker and diplomat Andrew W. Mellon and Nora Mary (n√©e McMullen) Mellon (1879‚Äì1937). Her parents divorced in 1912 and from 1921 to 1932, Ailsa served as her father's official hostess during his tenure as United States Secretary of the Treasury, and again when he was U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1932‚Äì1933. Her only sibling was brother Paul Mellon (1907‚Äì1999), who was also a philanthropist and was known as a prominent owner/breeder of thoroughbred racehorses. Ailsa attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut and spent her summers as a teenager in Europe. Philanthropy and legacy Bruce established the Avalon Foundation in 1940, which made grants to colleges and universities, medical schools and hospitals, youth programs and community services, churches, environmental projects, and an array of cultural and arts organizations. In 1947, the Avalon Foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the Hampton National Historic Site in Maryland. In 1957, when Fortune prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Ailsa Mellon Bruce, her brother, Paul, and her cousins, Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each. In 1968, Ailsa and Paul donated $20 million to build an annex to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. At her death in 1969, Ailsa Bruce bequeathed 153 paintings, primarily by 19th-century French artists, to the National Gallery of Art, as well as establishing a fund for future acquisitions. Among the many works acquired by the Gallery through the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund was the portrait of Ginevra de' Benci, the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the United States. In 1969, the assets of Paul Mellon‚Äôs Old Dominion Foundation were merged into his sister's Avalon Foundation, which was renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in honor of their father.

They were the founders of the Taconic Foundation, a charitable giving organization, which was instrumental in the formation of the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership. She obtained a divorce from her husband in Palm Beach, Florida in April 1945 on the grounds of \\"desertion and mental cruelty\\", receiving sole custody of their 11 year old daughter. Following their divorce, her ex-husband would later become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1961 to 1969, the same position her father held. After her divorce, Mrs. Bruce was in a long rumored relationship with G. Lauder Greenway of the Lauder Greenway Family.

The show has aired on NBC since 1975. 2005‚Äì2006 season Saturday Night Live promised changes for the 2005‚Äì06 season, one of which was broadcasting in high-definition. Lorne Michaels added four new featured players: Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig (partway through the season), and Jason Sudeikis, who was added for the last three episodes of the previous season. Hader quickly became popular for his impersonations, such as Vincent Price, Lindsey Buckingham, Al Pacino, Alan Alda, James Carville, John Boehner, Julian Assange, and many others. Hader also created multiple signature characters. These characters included New York City correspondent Stefon, Italian talk show host Vinny Vedecci, and Hollywood gossip reporter Brady Trunk as well as many others. Hired along with Samberg were his longtime friends and The Lonely Island collaborators Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer, who joined the writing staff. The three would create a new SNL mainstay feature in the SNL Digital Shorts, the most popular being \\"Lazy Sunday\\". Wiig, who first appeared when Jason Lee hosted, gained popularity with impersonations of Drew Barrymore, Felicity Huffman and Megan Mullally, also creating memorable characters such as the Two A-Holes (with Sudeikis) and Target Lady. Lorne Michaels extended her contract until the 2009‚Äì10 season (though she wouldn't officially leave the show until the 2011‚Äì12 season). Leaving after this season were Rachel Dratch and Tina Fey, who had committed to working on Fey's new sitcom 30 Rock, as well as Horatio Sanz, Finesse Mitchell, and Chris Parnell, who were let go due to budget cuts. Fey had missed several episodes early in the season while on maternity leave, as had Maya Rudolph. Horatio Sanz took Fey's place on Weekend Update while she was away. This season featured the first former female cast member as a host. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, a cast member from 1982 to 1985, hosted in May 2006. =Opening montage= The opening montage for the 2005 season was identical to that of the 2004 season, except for several minor variations. The names were displayed in a different font. The montage was also produced in widescreen and high definition. =Cast= * Fred Armisen * Rachel Dratch * Tina Fey * Will Forte * Darrell Hammond * Seth Meyers * Finesse Mitchell * Chris Parnell * Amy Poehler * Maya Rudolph * Horatio Sanz * Kenan Thompson Featuring * Bill Hader * Andy Samberg * Jason Sudeikis * Kristen Wiig (first episode: November 12, 2005) bold denotes Weekend Update anchor 2006‚Äì2007 seasonOpening montage= The opening montage introduced on the 32nd-season premiere involved the cast on a roof-top party in New York City. It was a completely new production from the previous montage, featuring a completely new logo and VTR. The font was in a plain greyish colour with bold lettering, where each word is progressively larger than the last in both the title and cast credits, with footage of New York City in the background. The musical guest and host's pictures are simply seen over top of the background footage instead of inserted onto a billboard like the previous season. With the Jaime Pressly episode airing on October 7, 2006, the montage was changed slightly to include an SNL logo changed to a design and typeface identical to the 1981‚Äì1985 SNL logo. The pictures of the host and musical guest were placed over the entire screen, instead of over the New York City footage. This new montage was also used for the rerun for the Dane Cook/The Killers episode, replacing the originally-aired one. Also changing for the October 14, 2006 repeat was the logo. The logo kept the same look, but condensed to look thinner, and to fit wide screen. =Bumper format= The commercial bumpers featured the host and musical guest in a solid color background, that featured many colors. The logo usually featured the current logo of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", or bold lettering of \\"SNL\\". The font is Gotham Ultra Bold. =Cast changes= SNL had a smaller cast in the 2006‚Äì2007 season due to ‚Äúmassive budget cuts‚Äù at NBC. Lorne Michaels said that cutting staff was chosen over reducing from 20 the number of original episodes produced. A separate announcement confirmed the departure of Tina Fey, who left to focus on her new show 30 Rock. Rachel Dratch, one of the stars in the 30 Rock pilot (though subsequently replaced by Jane Krakowski), also did not return. In September 2006, it was announced that Seth Meyers would replace Tina Fey as co-anchor on Weekend Update. Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, and Jason Sudeikis were all promoted to repertory players at the beginning of their second season (the third for Sudeikis including his role as a featured player). The final cast list included just 11 members, the lowest number since the 1997‚Äì1998 season, and the first time since the 1997‚Äì98 season that no featured players were hired. =Cast= * Fred Armisen * Will Forte * Bill Hader * Darrell Hammond * Seth Meyers * Amy Poehler * Maya Rudolph * Andy Samberg * Jason Sudeikis * Kenan Thompson * Kristen Wiig =Notes= * Seth Meyers shares head writer status with Paula Pell and Andrew Steele (writer). Due to this position, like Fey before him, he appears rarely on the show outside of Weekend Update, but is credited as a repertory player. Pell returned to the show after her sitcom, Thick and Thin, wasn't picked up. * With the departures of Rachel Dratch, Chris Parnell, and Horatio Sanz, Darrell Hammond became the only cast member who was hired in the 1990s to still be on the show, also Maya Rudolph became the longest-tenured current female cast member (she joined SNL in 2000). 2007‚Äì2008 season The 2007‚Äì2008 season of Saturday Night Live began on September 29, 2007 with LeBron James hosting the episode and musical guest Kanye West. Production was suspended due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, after which only four episodes were produced. The show's first episode after the writers' strike was aired on February 23, 2008, with former head writer and cast member Tina Fey as host. =Opening montage= The opening montage for the 2007‚Äì2008 season was identical to that of the previous season, though the artwork for the host and musical guest is now a black and white portrait. =Bumper format= Instead of featuring a solid color background, the background colors for the bumpers were usually white. There were rare occasions of the background being black, or gray. The logo was the same as last season, either featuring the full current logo, \\"Saturday Night Live\\", or featuring a bold lettering of \\"SNL\\". The logos featured different colors. =Cast= * Fred Armisen * Will Forte * Bill Hader * Darrell Hammond * Seth Meyers * Amy Poehler * Maya Rudolph (final episode: November 3, 2007) * Andy Samberg * Jason Sudeikis * Kenan Thompson * Kristen Wiig Featuring * Casey Wilson (first episode: February 23, 2008) =Notes= * The first four episodes feature the same cast as Season 32. By the time the show returned in February 2008 after the writer's strike, Maya Rudolph had left the show, she would also become SNL's new longest serving female cast member. She tied Molly Shannon (who stayed for 7 seasons: 1995-2001), as Rudolph also stayed for 7 Seasons, but Rudolph joined the show in early 2000 before leaving the show in late 2007 which makes her to remain for a little over 7 1/2 years, she stayed on 146 episodes as a credited cast member, however, Vanessa Bayer surpassed her record as she stayed on for 149 episodes over the span of 7 seasons. ** Casey Wilson was hired as a featured player to take her place. * Casey Wilson is the first new cast member to join the show in over two years. Wilson is also SNL's first cast member born in the 1980s. * Amy Poehler was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on the show. ** Also, as of Maya Rudolph's departure, Poehler became the longest-tenured current female cast member, as she joined SNL in 2001. * Due to the writer's strike, this was SNL's shortest season (beating out seasons six and thirteen, which were also cut short due to writers' strikes involving the Writers' Guild of America, but managed to have 13 episodes each before the show went on hiatus due to the strikes), containing only 12 episodes, and the only strike-shortened season to continue after the strike ended. The first four episodes of season 33 aired in the fall of 2007 (hosted by basketball player LeBron James, comic actor Seth Rogen, Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi, and news anchor Brian Williams) before the show went on hiatus until February 2008, when it resumed production until May of that year. ** Brian Williams becomes the first network news anchor to host Saturday Night Live. * During the summer reruns, the scheduled rerun of the episode hosted by Ellen Page was replaced with a rebroadcast of SNL's very first episode hosted by George Carlin, as Carlin died of heart failure in June 2008. 2008‚Äì2009 season The 2008‚Äì2009 season of Saturday Night Live began September 13, 2008 with host Michael Phelps and musical guest Lil' Wayne. =Opening montage= The opening montage remains the same as the last two seasons, but this time, the majority of the opening is in black and white, while the cast credits remain in color. The \\"SNL\\" logo and the cast credits appear smaller to fit into the 4:3 \\"safe area\\". In the second episode of the season, the video for Casey Wilson's credit was changed. In the fourth episode, the show went back to being shown in letterbox in some markets. =Bumper format= The bumpers now have variously colored backdrops instead of the plain white from last season. The season's first three episodes had the \\"SNL\\" logo within the 4:3 \\"title-safe area.\\" From episode 4 and on, however, the logo has been in the 16:9 title- safe area. =Cast= * Fred Armisen * Will Forte * Bill Hader * Darrell Hammond * Seth Meyers * Amy Poehler (final episode December 13, 2008) * Andy Samberg * Jason Sudeikis * Kenan Thompson * Kristen Wiig Featuring * Abby Elliott (first episode: November 15, 2008) * Bobby Moynihan * Michaela Watkins (first episode: November 15, 2008) * Casey Wilson =Notes= * At its annual fall schedule presentation on April 2, 2008, NBC revealed it would air three half-hour episodes of \\"SNL Thursday Night Live\\", a presidential election- themed Weekend Update special, on Thursdays starting October 16, 2008. * Amy Poehler left the show in mid-December to work on her new show, Parks and Recreation. As of 2018, Poehler became the longest serving female cast member with eight seasons, surpassing Molly Shannon, Maya Rudolph, and Rachel Dratch's record. Because of this, Kristen Wiig became the longest-tenured current female cast member (she joined SNL in the 2005‚Äì2006 season). * Bobby Moynihan, Abby Elliott and Michaela Watkins join the cast this season as featured players, the latter two coming in during Poehler's maternity leave. * This season had 22 episodes instead of the usual 20 to make up for the episodes left unproduced during the 2007-2008 Writers' Guild strike. From this season to season 37, all of SNL's seasons have 22 episodes. As of the 38th season, SNL now has 21 episodes a season (though season 45 had 18 seasons due to Studio 8H being shut down over public health concerns over the coronavirus: 15 done in studio and three done as a webseries called, SNL Stays at Home). * Amy Poehler, Kristen Wiig, Tina Fey and Justin Timberlake would receive Emmy nominations for the work on the show, Poehler and Wiig for their work as cast members, Fey as a guest actress, and Timberlake as a guest actor. * With this season, Abby Elliott is the first child of a former SNL cast member to be a cast member. She is the daughter of season 20 (1994‚Äì1995 season) cast member Chris Elliott. Elliott is also the third member of the Elliott family to appear on Saturday Night Live in some capacity: her grandfather, Bob Elliott, cameoed on an episode during the 1978-1979 season (season 4) and, as mentioned before, her father, Chris, was a season 20 cast member. * Darrell Hammond leaves after this season. At 14 years (1995‚Äì2009), Hammond is now the longest- running white male repertory cast member in SNL history (though he would return during the 40th season to be the show's announcer following the death of long-time announcer, Don Pardo). * Featured players Casey Wilson and Michaela Watkins were let go after this season. With this season, Casey Wilson is now the first former cast member born after SNL's premiere (Wilson was born in 1980).  2009‚Äì2010 season  The 2009‚Äì2010 season of Saturday Night Live began September 26, 2009 with host Megan Fox and musical guest U2. =Opening montage= The opening montage introduced on the 35th-season premiere featured the cast in random places in New York City. The montage features the same logo as the previous seasons but instead of the greyish color it's now a light greenish color with bold lettering. The host and musical guest are pictures cover the entire screen when introduced. In the second episode the host and musical guest have a small picture that is circled with bright colors, the background features it going down a city street. =Bumper format= The commercial bumpers featured the host and musical guest in a light color background. The logo usually featured the current logo of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", or bold lettering of \\"SNL\\" (often with the number \\"35\\" attached to commemorate SNL's 35 years on the air). =Cast= * Fred Armisen * Will Forte * Bill Hader * Seth Meyers * Andy Samberg * Jason Sudeikis * Kenan Thompson * Kristen Wiig Featuring * Abby Elliott * Bobby Moynihan * Nasim Pedrad * Jenny Slate =Notes= * Departed featured players Casey Wilson and Michaela Watkins are replaced by newcomers Nasim Pedrad and Jenny Slate. ** Nasim Pedrad is the first Middle Eastern SNL cast member and the fifth cast member to be born outside of North America (after the Italian-born Tony Rosato, the New Zealand-born Pamela Stephenson, the England-born Morwenna Banks, and the Chilean-born Horatio Sanz). * This season is the first without Darrell Hammond, the last cast member from the 1990s. Hammond left the show after a record setting 14 season run. ** With Hammond gone, Seth Meyers is now currently the longest-running cast member, having been on the show since 2001, Fred Armisen is now the oldest cast member and the only cast member who was born before 1970 (Armisen was born in 1966), and the entire cast consists of people who were hired in 2001 or later. * The Gerard Butler/Shakira episode is the first time that a sole advertiser (Anheiser-Busch's Bud Light Golden Wheat) bought all national ad time. In exchange, SNL aired outtakes (some of which are from sketches that never aired due to actors flubbing lines or cracking up too much to stay in character) from various sketches from the 1990s and the 2000s. * In early 2010, an online campaign was created on Facebook to get actress Betty White to host an episode of SNL. In March 2010, White confirmed that she would be hosting the May 8 episode. White's episode garnered around 12 million viewers, the highest since the 2008 election. * This season featured many milestones set by the hosts and musical guests: ** Sigourney Weaver now has the longest between appearances at 24 years (her first hosting appearance was the season 12 premiere episode in 1986), beating out Madeline Kahn, who had an 18-year gap between her second appearance in 1977 and her third and final appearance in 1995. Weaver's record was broken again in the 2010‚Äì2011 season, by Jeff Bridges, who has a 27-year gap between appearances (Jeff Bridges first hosted SNL with his brother, Beau, in 1983). ** Jennifer Lopez is now the first Hispanic celebrity to be a simultaneous host and musical guest for more than one episode (Lopez first hosted and was musical guest in a season 26 episode in 2001). ** Tina Fey is now the first Lorne Michaels-era former female cast member to host more than one episode and the second former female cast member overall to host more than one episode, following Julia Louis-Dreyfus. ** Taylor Lautner is now the first seventeen- year-old male celebrity to host SNL (the other three 17-year-olds who have hosted‚ÄîThe Olsen twins and Lindsay Lohan‚Äîwere female). ** Betty White is now the oldest celebrity to ever host SNL at age 88¬Ω, beating out the 80-year-old Miskel Spillman (the winner of SNL's \\"Anyone Can Host\\" contest back in 1977), the second cast member from The Golden Girls to host SNL (after Bea Arthur, who hosted prior to starring in The Golden Girls in a season five episode in 1979), and is the first celebrity to be chosen to host SNL based on an online petition. ** Alec Baldwin now ties with Steve Martin for most frequent male SNL host (both Baldwin and Martin have hosted 15 times). Baldwin's episode is also the first time he ever hosted a season finale. Two seasons later, Baldwin would break Steve Martin's record of most episodes hosted. ** Drew Barrymore is now the most frequent female SNL host. Barrymore has hosted six times, breaking the tie she once held with Candice Bergen. ** Justin Bieber, at age 16, is now the youngest male solo musical guest to appear on SNL. * This is the last season featuring Will Forte, who was on the show since 2002. Jenny Slate's contract was not renewed for another season.

Originally due to appear just once, the character was so popular with audiences that the show's writers made her a semi-regular character. Fictional character historyEarly life= A native of El Salvador, Rosario was a school teacher, who received a bachelor's degree in clinical psychology from the University of Texas and who almost got a master's degree (three credits short); she also attended business school. At some point, she moved to The Bronx, presumably while studying business. However, Karen states that she bought Rosario from Rosario's parents, and another comment made by Jack states that Karen smuggles staff in from Latin America, namely Mexico, and probably El Salvador as well. While there, she also performed with a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez, including a production of \\"Tea for Two\\" at the Shalom Retirement Center. At some point, she was also paid to tape pornographic videos for Tommy Lee. One of Rosario's brothers is a political prisoner, and remarks made by Karen suggests she has children, possibly still in El Salvador. =Series overview= Although she had been mentioned by Karen since the pilot episode, Rosario's first appearance was in the season-one finale, \\"Object of My Rejection.\\" Due to Karen's patronizing tone, we're made to think she doesn't speak English well. Rosario actually speaks English fluently albeit with a thick accent, but is an illegal alien. To keep her in the country, Karen has her marry Jack McFarland, her gay friend, to get her green card. The marriage was later terminated at the end of season two, when Rosario asked for a divorce to pursue other romantic interests. However, she maintained a close relationship with Jack after (often echoing hers with Karen) and claimed to still think of him as family. Rosario was one of few people with whom Stan remained in contact after he faked his death (at the end of season five). When Karen learned that Rosario had kept this news from her (in season eight), she fired her. Rosario worked as a bar attendant until Karen took her back. During a live episode, it is revealed by Karen that Rosario earns $350,000 per year. In the show's series finale, Rosario was shown to have lived with Karen and Jack in the years after the show ended, growing older with them and possibly still working for them despite being in a wheelchair (though she states that she is only in the wheelchair due to a sprained ankle). Rosario is usually seen wearing a Members Only jacket over her maid's uniform. She has a particular fondness for Subway sandwiches. Morrison was a guest star in the first two seasons, but from season three until the eighth season, she was credited as a main cast member in the episodes she appeared. =Series revival= In the series revival in 2017, Rosario is an unseen character, referred to but never appearing. Morrison had declined to reprise her role, having retired from acting. The character was written out of the show in the episode \\"Rosario's Quincea√±era\\", in which Rosario dies of a heart attack off screen. =Relationship with Karen Walker= In 1985, Rosario met Karen Walker at a club, while working as a cigarette lady, and went to work for her as a maid, which was where she was working when the series began in 1998. Rosario and Karen are very close, but their relationship is love-hate. They are notorious for swapping insults back and forth. Rosario is just as feisty as Karen, and is one of the few people that can go toe-to-toe with her. In earlier episodes, they often yell and argue with each other at the same time. However, many of those fights end with an emotional embrace or light-hearted exchange between the two, which makes it clear that they really do care about each other. Examples of this include the season 3 episode \\"My Uncle, The Car,\\" where Karen becomes sad at almost losing Rosario in a bet to her rival Beverley Leslie, and the season 7 episode \\"Partners,\\" where Karen ignores the plight of a very sick Rosario because she is afraid of losing her. Rosario also mentions in season 4's \\"The Third Wheel Gets The Grace\\" that, for their 15-year anniversary, all she wanted to do was spend time with Karen. When Rosario dies in the series revival, Karen arranges the funeral, giving Rosario the quincea√±era she never had. She bolts out of the funeral before it starts, however, drowning her sorrows at a bar, unable to handle the loss of her friend. She later comes back to the church to sit next to the casket and say goodbye, admitting with rare emotion that Rosario was her best friend, her \\"sparring partner\\", and her \\"everything\\".

Retrieved on 2015-10-18.America's happiest cities: No. 2, Manchester, N.H. - Nov. 28, 2011 Overall, New Hampshire ranks ninth in the U.S. in high-tech employment concentration, with most of these jobs located in Manchester and its immediate environs. In recent years the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential historic district have experienced continual redevelopment. Many properties originally built in the nineteenth century as tenement housing for mill workers have been retro-fitted to create stylish and eclectic residential condominiums, retail stores, and restaurants. The Pandora Mill is one such converted mill building, situated between the Merrimack and a large cluster of new developments. Elm Street, a block to the east, is the commercial center of the city and northern New England. Academics The University of New Hampshire's urban campus provides associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees, with a special emphasis on programs that address urban issues and integrate undergraduate and graduate study with Manchester's thriving professional and business communities.Academics Pre-Professional Programs In addition to its wide range of academic and non-academic community outreach programs, the campus has a collaborative agreement with the neighboring New Hampshire Institute of Art that allows students interested in the fine arts to enroll in the Institute's Bachelor of Fine Arts program. The campus also has an articulation agreement with the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences that allows students to dual enroll in the pre-pharmacy or physician assistant programs offered at the latter's Manchester location. UNHM has also established a partnership with the Institute at Palazzo Rucellai in Florence, Italy, which allows students in the former's Politics and Society program to study abroad. UNHM also provides valuable student resources, such as workshops and tutoring, through its Center for Academic Enrichment. The student-faculty ratio at the university's urban campus is 13:1, and 97% of classes have fewer than 30 students. While the College has always attracted a significant cohort of non-traditional students, in recent years the demographics of the student body in Manchester have shifted considerably. In 2006, 59% of students were between the ages of 17 and 23, with 41% 24 or older; by 2013, only 34% of students were 24 or older, with 66% of the student body between the ages of 17 and 23. =STEM emphasis= Critical to the academic mission of the University of New Hampshire's campus in Manchester is emphasizing student learning in and out of the classroom, particularly in the STEM fields. A significant percentage of the 1,000 students studying at the urban campus secure for- credit internships in the Manchester business community, often in STEM- oriented companies, and the college in turn offers use of the UNH STEM Discovery Lab to members of the local community, particularly K-12 students and their teachers. UNHM Community Outreach Scholarship further serves the Manchester community by maintaining a massive data archive relating to the City of Manchester and its public policy initiatives. This archive is an official part of the UNH Dimond Library Digital Collections Initiative. =Study abroad programs= Students can take advantage of opportunities to study outside of the United States through UNH-managed programs such as the Florence Summer Program, UNH exchange programs, or UNH-approved programs. The National Student Exchange also allows a student to take a semester at a public college or university anywhere in the United States or its territories. =Rankings= Ordinarily, as a college of the University of New Hampshire, UNHM is not ranked by media outlets as a discrete institution. However, in 2013 Washington Monthly ranked UNH's urban college #14 in the United States in an assessment of best-value liberal arts colleges. In 2014, Money, a publication of Time Magazine, ranked UNH Manchester #231 out of all colleges and universities in the United States in an assessment of educational quality, affordability, and career outcomes. The undergraduate colleges of UNH located in Durham ranked #261 in the Money assessment. In 2012, UNH Dining, which services the UNH colleges in both Manchester and Durham, was ranked in the top 50 nationally by The Daily Meal, whose \\"Best Colleges for Food in America\\" listing rates universities' dining options on accessibility, service, healthiness, sustainability, and use of local products. Student lifeHousing= While many UNHM students commute to campus from towns in the greater Manchester area, UNH Manchester announced the opening of a new UNH residence hall in fall 2018. Located at 1000 Elm Street, UNH Downtown Commons offers double and triple rooms, on-site dining, laundry facilities, and other amenities. The residence hall is a 14-minute walk to campus, and steps from downtown Manchester‚Äôs restaurants, shops and nightlife. UNH Manchester also partners with the New Hampshire Institute of Art to offer meals in the NHIA dining hall, located on Spring Street.University of New Hampshire at Manchester, \\"Downtown College Living with NHIA\\" (October 16, 2015) =Activities= Students at UNHM participate in many student-led academic, recreational, and special-interest clubs. =Athletics= The University of New Hampshire's athletic program consists of 18 NCAA programs, all of which play at the Durham campus of the university. However, Manchester does on occasion host home games of the UNH men's ice hockey team. Games are held at SNHU Arena, a few blocks from the UNH Manchester campus, with a seating capacity of 11,770 (9,852 for ice hockey). SNHU Arena has also hosted other college and professional teams, such as the NCAA Frozen Four Tournament and the Manchester Monarchs hockey teams. =Publications= Millworks and Campus Connections tell the UNH Manchester story and connect students and other members of the UNHM community to the campus.MillWorks Campus Connections Both publications are coordinated by the UNHM Marketing and Community Relations Office, and feature articles on student achievements, faculty research, and community partnerships. =Off-campus events= Manchester is home to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, the Double-A affiliate of Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays. The Fisher Cats play home games at Northeast Delta Dental Stadium, a 7,722-seat venue approximately a half-mile from UNH Manchester. Other local attractions include the historic Palace Theater, the Currier Museum of Art, the New Hampshire Institute of Art, and the SEE Science Center, an interactive learning facility adjacent to the UNH Manchester campus. =Public programs= The University of New Hampshire's Manchester campus connects the research and knowledge of students, faculty, and staff with the local community through public programs and events. The UNHM Speaker's Bureau runs a lecture series that pairs researchers at UNHM with academic partners like middle schools, high schools, and community colleges. Through the Bureau, campus faculty and students share, free of charge, their disciplinary expertise and research experience in the STEM fields, the social sciences, and the humanities. In addition, the campus sponsors films, book clubs, brown-bag luncheon lectures, the Sidore lecture series, and Music in the Mills (an initiative supported by the Frederick Smyth Foundation) to provide those living in and around Manchester with an opportunity to learn and discover.

First described in 1820, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and caused by mutations in the CDKN2A gene. In addition to melanoma, individuals with the condition are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. The diagnosis of dysplastic nevus syndrome is based on clinical presentation and family history. Treatment consists of resection of malignant skin lesions (melanoma). Screening for pancreatic cancer may be considered, particularly if there is a family history. Signs and symptoms Dysplastic nevus syndrome is characterized by unusual nevi and multiple inherited melanomas.Czajkowski, R., FAMMM Syndrome: Pathogenesis and Management, Dermatologic Surgery, Vol. 30 Issue 2 p2, p291-296, 2004. Genetics The CDKN2A gene is located on chromosome 9p21.3. Two main transcripts, isoforms '1' and '4', each contain three exons and span 7288 and 26740 bp, respectively. They encode proteins of 156 and 173 amino acids; isoform '1' encodes p16(INK4a), while isoform '4' encodes p14(ARF), a protein that is structurally unrelated to p16(INK4) but acts in cell cycle G1 control by stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53. Dysplastic nevus syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The penetrance for melanoma in kindreds with CDKN2A mutations is estimated at 58% to 92% by 80 years of age and varies with geography. The penetrance in CDKN2A mutation carriers for pancreatic cancer has been estimated to be 17% by 75 years of age. As noted above, there is wide variation in published estimates of the penetrance of CDKN2A mutations. Pathology The histopathologic characteristics of melanoma in FAMMM kindreds are not different from those seen in sporadic cases of melanoma and, thus, are not useful in diagnosing the syndrome. Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) and nodular melanoma are the most frequently encountered histological melanoma subtypes in patients with CDKN2A mutations, which is consistent with the relative early age of onset. DiagnosisDefinition= FAMMM has been described by multiple authors and institutions, and various definitions have been adopted. According to Newton et al., a scoring system allotting one point per feature establishes FAMMM with scores greater than or equal to 3. The features include: 1) two or more clinically atypical nevi, 2) more than 100 nevi in patients between 20 and 50 years of age, 3) more than 50 nevi in patients under 20 years of age or more than 50 years of age, 4) more than one nevus in buttocks or instep, 5) nevi on the anterior scalp, 6) one or more pigmented lesions in the iris. The Classical (1990) definition uses the following criteria: 1) 100 or more melanocytic nevi, 2) one or more melanocytic nevi greater than or equal to 8mm in its largest diameter, and 3) one or more clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus 1992 definition, which is still controversial, requires a family history of melanoma, in addition to a large number of melanocytic nevi (often greater than 50) and melanocytic nevi that present certain histological features. Management Screening for melanoma in FAMMM kindreds should begin at age 10 with a baseline total body skin examination including scalp, eyes, oral mucosa, genital area, and nail, as family members may develop melanoma in their early teens. Monthly self- performed skin examinations and early referral to a dermatologist for monitoring are recommended interventions. Treatment approaches such as removal of the largest dysplastic nevus or all of the dysplastic nevi have not been shown to appreciably reduce the risk of developing melanoma and are not cost- effective; therefore, these approaches are not recommended. Similarly, biopsy of multiple pigmented dysplastic nevi is not recommended and biopsy should be limited to specific nevi with appearance concerning for melanoma. At Mayo Clinic, FAMMM patients with a confirmed mutation and family history of pancreatic cancer are offered screening with either high-resolution pancreatic protocol CT, MRI, or endoscopic ultrasound starting at age 50 or 10 years younger than the earliest family member with pancreas cancer. They are counseled on the lack of evidence-based data to support screening, and on the limitations of our current technology to detect a lesion at a stage amenable to therapy. History  In 1820 Norris reported for the first time a case of what is now recognized as FAMMM (12). He described a 59-year-old man with melanoma, a high total body mole count, and family history of the same.

The stadium has a roof over the field and the stands, like other indoor ballparks. However, it lacks a wall behind the stands so that natural air comes into the field. This makes it possible for home runs to leave the stadium, something not possible in typical domed stadiums. The stadium was built in 1979 without the roof and named as the new home field of the Lions that moved from Fukuoka to Tokorozawa that year. The installation of the roof took place in two phases: the first phase after the 1997 season, and the second phase after the 1998 seasons. At the beginning of the 1998 season, the stadium was renamed Seibu Dome although the domed roof had not completed yet.

It is located just west of Colorado Springs on U.S. Highway 24, near the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. Tours of the complex of caves are given daily. Cave features A tour guide leads a party of visitors through Cave of the Winds (May 1972). By far the most famous section of the Cave of the Winds is the Silent Splendor room. Discovered in 1984,History of Cave - from the official website the room contains numerous rare crystalline speleothems including helectites which appear to defy the laws of gravity by growing in strange directions and not being forced down by gravity like many cave formations. . Unfortunately, the room must be sealed off from the general public in order to maintain its delicate environment. Silent Splendor is sealed from public view by an \\"environmental gate\\" with a large tube that seals in moisture to maintain the atmosphere necessary for the delicate formations to continue to grow. In the late 1980s a few new passages were opened inside the cavern. On May 8, 1988, Mother's Day,Proclamation 5801 -- Mother's Day, 1988 a chamber called the \\"Adventure Room\\" was opened. Left in a more natural state than most of the cave, the Adventure Room has dirt floors, lower numbers of lights (compared to other chambers inside the cave) and gives entry to the Manitou Grand Caverns where Lantern Tours are given. In 1989, a new passage named \\"Old Curiosity Shop\\" was opened, billed as the most narrow passage in the Cave of the Winds. Traversing it gains a look at the \\"Colorado Rose\\", a beaded helectite, and \\"Spider Web Valley\\", a collection of delicate helectites. This passage was opened to make tour groups moving through \\"Tall Man's Headache, Fat Man's Misery\\" a little easier. Other lesser known attractions include a \\"bottomless pit,\\" often the scene of practical jokes by the guides. The site also features a free-fall amusement ride called the Terror-Dactyl. History \\"Entrance to Williams Canyon\\" Postcard -- 1908-1909 It is believed that both Apache and Ute Native Americans knew about the cave. The name, Cave of the Winds, relates to a legend involving the Apache, who were said to believe the cave was the home of a Great Spirit of the Wind. The first documented mention of the cave came in 1880 when two brothers, John and George Pickett, discovered the cave during a hike in Williams Canyon led by the Rev. Roselle T. Cross, pastor of the Congregational Church in Colorado Springs. The boys noticed that their candles flickered in a small shelter cave they had found and wind was seen to be blowing from a nearby crevice. Crawling through the opening they emerged into a large chamber. Within a few days Cross wrote about the discovery of the cave in his church newsletter and his story was immediately reprinted in the Colorado Springs Gazette of July 2, 1880. The Colorado Encyclopedia relates: \\"Although Cross exaggerated the heights and depths of vertical elements, as do most inexperienced cavers, his account is remarkably free of the florid Victorian hyperbole typical of most cave descriptions of that time. Cross and his Boys‚Äô Exploring Association explored most of the horizontal passages accessible from the original entrance, a distance of about 200 feet‚Äîa respectable distance for schoolboys using candles.\\" Tourist attraction Entrance to Cave of the Winds by W. H. Jackson ~ circa 1883-1890 In 1880, the same year that the cave was discovered, George Washington Snider, a stonecutter from Ohio who had traveled to Colorado seeking his fortune visited the cave. Snider excavated passages from the Williams Canyon caves, as they were then called, and discovered \\"Canopy Hall\\" -- a large room nearly 200 feet long containing thousands of stalactites and stalagmites.. Snider wrote, ‚ÄúIt was as though Aladdin with his wonderful lamp had effected the magic result.\\" Unfortunately Snider spoke of his discovery in town and the next day the cave was mobbed by townspeople who stripped the cavern of many of the stalactites. Snider continued to excavate and began preparations for guided tours. The Cave of the Winds quickly became one of the established attractions of the young Manitou resort area. Cave of the Winds has been in continuous operation since 1881 ‚Äì making it one of Colorado‚Äôs oldest visitor attractions. Electrical lights were added in 1907, and visitors began traveling to the cave in even greater numbers ‚Äì first by carriage and railroad, and later by car. Geology Manitou Limestone.-Williams Canyon Formation-Leadville Limestone Stalactites & draperies About 500 million years ago during the Ordovician period warm shallow seas covered the Pikes Peak region of Colorado. The seas were home to abundant shell creatures that accumulated on the sea floor when they died. The layers built up for millions of years and were eventually compacted and hardened into the rock known as limestone. The geological name for the limestone layer found in the cave is Manitou Limestone. About 70 million years ago the shallow seas receded and the area was lifted forming the Rocky Mountain region. About 4 to 7 million years ago the limestone fell below the water table Rainwater mixed with carbon dioxide, forming a weak carbonic acid that slowly ate away at the limestone, forming pockets. The pockets slowly enlarged forming passageways and caverns. In the short steep drive up Williams Canyon to the cave entrance one can view several different depositions of limestone. During the Devonian period the Williams Canyon Limestone was laid down and during the Mississippian period the Leadville Limestone layer was deposited. =Cave formations= Flowstone & draperies Helictites (Cave of the Winds, Manitou Springs, Colorado, USA) As the water table dropped within the cave system air began to fill the passageways and caverns. Stalactites formed on the cave's ceilings as calcium carbonate-rich water dripped leaving thin calcite rings that grew into icicle- like shapes over thousands of years. Through the same process stalagmites grew from the cave floors. A third type of structure is called flowstone. Flowstone formations are curtain-like formations that flow along the sides of caverns or passages. They are the most common formation found in \\"solution caves\\" in limestone, such as Cave of the Winds. Sometimes called draperies or curtains, they are formed over thousands of years as the mineral-rich water flows over surfaces leaving calcite behind. The rarest and most delicate formations are called helictites. Helictite forms have been described in several shapes: \\"hands\\", ribbon helictites, saws, rods, butterflies, curly-fries, and \\"clumps of worms\\". They can be easily broken by the slightest touch and consequently are set away from tour groups. As helictites grow, they change their axis from the vertical at one or more stages of growth, hence the \\"clumps of worms\\" description for one type. Several theories as to how and why they defy gravity have been suggested but no theory has yet been proven to be correct.

He was introduced in Tekken 5 as the main antagonist and unplayable final boss. While he is first made playable in the PlayStation 3 version of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection (albeit as a bonus character), his full playable appearance is in Tekken Tag Tournament 2. A legendary martial artist, once known as \\"the strongest fist\\" Jinpachi founded the mega corporation Mishima Zaibatsu decades before the start of the series. He lost control over his company to his son, Heihachi, approximately 50 years before the series started and 10 years later was imprisoned under the Mishima family temple, Hon-maru, where he died of starvation several years later. He was resurrected and possessed by a demon, and retook the Mishima Zaibatsu during Heihachi's absence in Tekken 5. AppearancesIn video games= Jinpachi Mishima was the original founder of the Mishima Zaibatsu and the father of Heihachi, father-in-law of Kazumi, paternal grandfather of Kazuya and Lars Alexandersson, adoptive paternal grandfather of Lee Chaolan and paternal great-grandfather of Jin Kazama. Unlike most Mishima (who were ruthless and power hungry), Jinpachi was a man of honor and wisdom as he showed compassion to his grandson Kazuya when the latter was a child (this is possibly another reason Heihachi resented Jinpachi so much) and was friends with Wang Jinrei. However, Jinpachi's life took a turn for the worse when the greedy Heihachi staged a coup d'√©tat and stole the company from him. Jinpachi attempted to retake the company when Heihachi entered the military industry, but failed and was imprisoned underneath a Mishima compound, Hon-Maru. He died due to starvation after some years. Before his debut, Jinpachi never makes an appearance, although his existence is hinted multiple times, as his friend, Wang's participation in the second tournament is motivated by Jinpachi's wish, and his gravestone is also shown in Wang's ending in Tekken 2. In Tekken 5, having been resurrected and taken over by a demon as well as granted incredible supernatural powers, Jinpachi breaks out of Honmaru when the temple is destroyed during a battle between Heihachi, Kazuya and an army of Jack-4s sent to kill Heihachi in which the Jacks explode, pulverizing the Hon-maru and freeing Jinpachi from his underground prison. With the news of Heihachi's apparent demise, Jinpachi takes over the company from behind the scenes and organizes the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament under the orders of the demon, that told him to destroy the world and seek out the souls of the strong, even though he wanted to refuse this command, he obeyed due of lack of energy. In the tournament finals, Jinpachi is confronted by his great-grandson, Jin Kazama, who defeats him and puts him to rest at last. Though not playable, Jinpachi briefly appears in the Scenario Campaign prologue of Tekken 6, which retells the events from previous games in a comic book-style format, and he is also mentioned in the prologues and epilogues of several characters, such as Jin and Wang. He returns in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 as a playable character and as one of the Stage 7 sub-bosses, alongside Heihachi. He reprises his role as one of the unplayable Stage 7 sub-bosses in Tekken Revolution. In Street Fighter X Tekken, Dhalsim's Swap Costume is based on Jinpachi's appearance. Character design Jinpachi is as a tall, muscular old man with a long beard and hair similar to his son, Heihachi, albeit much longer. He is one of the oldest human characters in the Tekken series, being around the same age as his friend, Wang Jinrei, who is about 102 years old in Tekken 5, the game Jinpachi debuted in. He wears a large golden necklace, a pair of golden bracelets on his arms and legs and a cloak pants. In his devil form in Tekken 5, Jinpachi has a purple aura around him, his height slightly increases, his skin becomes dark purple, his eyes glow yellow, and his necklace and bracelets disappear. He also gains spikes on his elbows, two spiked humps on his back and a large mouth on his stomach, from which he shoot fireballs. In his alternate devil form in Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection, instead of purple aura and skin, Jinpachi has a flaming aura, his skin is dark brown and yellow, and lava-like substance sprouts from all over his body. Although he still has the spikes and mouth from his original devil form, his face is now almost unrecognizable, he loses his beard and hair in exchange for a flaming spike, and his eyes are fiery white with no pupils instead of merely glowing yellow. Originally Jinpachi was supposed to be the origin of the Mishima curse, the Devil gene, proven by his in-game appearance with Devil traits, his ending text in which it says \\"Jinpachi's mind is consumed by the Devil\\" and Devil Jin's interlude with Jinpachi has them talk about Devil, as well Devil Jin's ending sharing elements from Kazuya's ending from Tekken 4, in which Devil Jin turns in Devil after absorbing Jinpachi's demon similarly to Kazuya turning into Devil after absorbing Jin's Devil. Gameplay Jinpachi's gameplay is similar to the other Mishima characters, which involves many fast attacks and juggles. He shares many moves with Heihachi and Kazuya, including the iconic Electric Wind God Fist move; however, his executions of several moves range from having little to vast differences than both of them. In his unplayable Tekken 5 appearance, Jinpachi has an array of unblockable moves, one of which is a fireball attack that Jinpachi fires from the mouth of his abdomen. The fireball has a very long range and can deplete more than half of the player's health; the best way to avoid the fireballs is through sidestepping, although it can be avoided by other means depending on the character, such as by using Xiaoyu's somersault move or Steve's dodges and sways. Another of his unblockable move is an ability to disrupt an opponent by stunning their motion, which hits the opponent at every range regardless of them being on the ground or airborne. This move leaves the opponent open to any attack Jinpachi decides to throw at them. Jinpachi also has a move in which he absorbs a small part of his opponent's health, as well as a teleporting move that temporarily makes him unable to be hit while doing so. While his boss appearance in Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection is mostly the same as Tekken 5, his playable appearance in the PS3 version tones him down considerably as he is slower, weaker, and has a minuscule movelist compared to other characters. In Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Jinpachi's moveset is drastically altered to balance him as a playable character. He loses many of his unblockable moves like the stun attack and health absorption, and his fireballs do a lot less damage than it did before; in return, he gains a variety of new moves, including properly using his teleportation move as a stance than can be chained to other attacks. He also has new stances, such as the ability to fly. =In other media= Though Jinpachi does not appear in the 2010 film, he is mentioned (though not by name) as having been imprisoned and murdered by Heihachi (who had a similar personality in this film) many years prior to the film's events.

The cave was some high, wide and in depth. It was discovered in 1834, and originally dubbed Aeolus's Cave, after the Greek god of winds. Guided tours began officially in 1841, through Goat Island and descending down a staircase closer to the falls, into the cave. A rock fall closed the tour in 1920. It officially reopened in 1924, bringing visitors to the front of the Bridal Veil instead of behind it, on a series of decks and walkways. Tropical storm-like conditions can be experienced, as winds can reach up to 68 mph underneath the falls. The cave was obliterated in a massive 1954 rockfall and subsequent dynamiting of a dangerous overhang. Modern attraction Today, the \\"Cave of the Winds\\" is the name of a tourist attraction near the same site. An elevator takes people from the area between the American and Canadian Falls down to the level of the Niagara River at the base of the American Falls. A series of redwood decks and platforms allow sightseers to walk right up to the base of the Bridal Veil Falls with water crashing down right on them and flowing beneath the decking. The decking is removed each fall due to the potential damage caused by ice buildup at the falls and re-installed each spring by park officials for sightseers to enjoy the experience. The decking is not secured to the rocks below by bolts or other construction materials; the wood beam supports are simply wedged into the rock crevices.

He is best known for establishing Dublin's Municipal Gallery of Modern Art (the first known public gallery of modern art in the world) and for his contribution to the visual arts in Ireland, including the Lane Bequest. Hugh Lane died on board the RMS Lusitania. Family Hugh Percy Lane was born in County Cork, Ireland, on 9 November 1875. He was the son of a rector father, and his mother Adelaide was a daughter of Dudley Persse, of Roxburgh, Co Galway and her sister was the dramatist Augusta, Lady Gregory of Coole, Co Galway. He was brought up in Cornwall, England, and began his career as an apprentice painting restorer with Martin Henry Colnaghi in London, then worked as an art dealer at the Colnaghi's Marlborough Gallery for some years, before becoming a dealer in his own right and opening a gallery in Dublin in 1908. Through regular visits to Coole (near Gort), County Galway, the home of his aunt, Lady Gregory, Lane remained in contact with Ireland. He soon counted among his family, friends and social circle those who collectively formed the core of the Irish cultural renaissance in the early decades of the 20th century that was a part of the Celtic Revival. Art collector Sir Hugh Lane by John Singer Sargent, 1906 Extolling the cause of Irish art abroad, Lane also became one of the foremost collectors and dealers of French Impressionist paintings in Europe, and amongst those works purchased by him for the new gallery were La Musique aux Tuileries by Manet, Sur la Plage by Degas, Les Parapluies by Renoir and La Chemin√©e by Vuillard. For his \\"services to art\\" in Ireland, Lane was knighted in June 1909 at the comparatively young age of 33. The Municipal Gallery of Modern Art opened in January 1908 in temporary premises at 17 Harcourt Street, Dublin, with no entrance charge. Lane hoped that Dublin Corporation would run it, but the corporation was unsure if it would be financially viable. Lane met the running costs, while seeking a more permanent home. A new gallery was proposed in St Stephens Green, and then a dramatic bridge-gallery over the River Liffey, both designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Both were turned down, the latter by a close vote of the Corporation, which would have to meet the long- term running costs. Despairing of Irish support, after all he had done, Sir Hugh then bequeathed his pictures to the National Gallery in London. Shortly before his death Lane reversed this in a codicil to his will, that was however, unwitnessed. Lane did not live to see his gallery permanently located as he died in 1915 during the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, off the west coast of Cork, the county of his birth. Just fourteen months before his death, in March, 1914, Lane had been appointed Director of the National Gallery of Ireland. The Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, extended in 2005, is now in Parnell Square in central Dublin. A drama-documentary on him, Citizen Lane, directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, was produced in 2018. Controversy over the Lane Bequest Following his death, Lane's will bequeathed his collection to London, but an unwitnessed later codicil bequeathed it to Dublin. Having possession, London's National Gallery did not recognise the codicil. Altering this legal reality became the life's work of Professor Thomas Bodkin. At the request of Lane's aunt, Lady Gregory, WT Cosgrave, leader of the Irish Government unsuccessfully approached Ramsay MacDonald on the matter in 1929. Then, in 1938, the present-day solution came from the British side, during the House of Lords debates on the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938. Lord Strabolgi put forward a suggestion from Sir Robert Witt: \\"..that these pictures should alternate between London and Dublin. We have had them in London for a considerable number of years, and it might now be the turn of the Dublin Galleries to have them for a number of years... Legally, the holders have a very strong case, but we are so wealthy in our treasures, while Ireland is so comparatively poor...\\" Lord Marley added: \\"My Lords, perhaps I might say one word in support of what my noble friend Lord Strabolgi has said because Sir Hugh Lane was a cousin of mine, and I do know he was very anxious, even before this codicil was made, that the pictures should go to Dublin. I hope that something will be done in support of what my noble friend has said.\\" When John A. Costello became Taoiseach in 1948, he initiated further negotiations with the UK government. Support in London was maintained in 1953 by Lord Moyne, who said in Parliament: \\".. I would urge on Her Majesty's Government to include in it a provision for the return of the thirty-six, or so, pictures which were collected by the late Sir Hugh Lane as a basis for a modern collection for Ireland ....\\" These interventions eventually led on to a compromise agreement in 1959, announced by Taoiseach Sean Lemass, whereby half of the Lane Bequest would be lent and shown in Dublin every five years. In his announcement of the agreement, Lemass thanked the then-retired Thomas Bodkin for his persistence, helped by Lord Moyne and Lord Pakenham. In 1993, the agreement was changed so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland. The remaining 8 were divided into 2 groups, so that 4 would be lent for 6 years at a time to Dublin. These 8 include works by Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Morisot, Vuillard and Degas. In 2008, The National Gallery in London arranged for the entire collection to be on display in Dublin together for the first time. There was a switch in May 2013 for a six-year period.

General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 315, a) A tabernacle is a fixed, locked box in which, in some Christian churches, the Eucharist is \\"reserved\\" (stored). A less obvious container for the same purpose, set into a wall, is called an aumbry. Within Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and in some congregations of Anglicanism and Lutheranism, a tabernacle is a box-like vessel for the exclusive reservation of the consecrated Eucharist. It is normally made of metal, stone or wood, is lockable and secured to its altar or adjacent wall to prevent the consecrated elements within from being removed without authorization. The \\"reserved Eucharist\\" is secured there for distribution at services, for availability to bring Holy Communion to the sick, and, especially in the Western Church, as the centre of attention for meditation and prayer. The term \\"tabernacle\\" arose for this item as a reference to the Old Testament tabernacle which was the locus of God's presence among the Jewish people - hence, it was formerly required (and is still generally customary) that the tabernacle be covered with a tent-like veil (conopaeum) or curtains across its door when the Eucharist is present within. By way of metaphor, Catholics and Orthodox alike also refer to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Tabernacle in their devotions (such as the Akathist Hymn or Catholic Litanies to Mary), as she carried within her the body of Christ in her role as Theotokos. History In early Christianity, priests and or lay people commissioned by them took bread consecrated at their Eucharist to their homes, in order to give it to the sick and others unable to attend the celebration. But when the Edict of Milan ended persecution, and the early Church was allowed to practice its religion publicly, the Eucharist was no longer kept safeguarded in private Christian homes, but was reserved near the altars of churches The preferred containers, the original \\"tabernacles\\", then had the form of a (usually gold) dove within a (usually silver) tower. There is mention of a gift of these two vessels, both of gold and adorned with 250 white pearls, that the Emperor Constantine gave to Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica in Rome, and of silver towers and golden doves given to particular churches by Pope Innocent I and Pope Hilarius. The vessels were kept in a place called the \\"sacrarium\\" or \\"pastophorium\\" away from the central body of the church or were suspended by fine chains from the middle of the canopy (hence called a \\"ciborium\\" or bread store) above the altar of the church. Gian Lorenzo Bernini‚Äôs 29-metre-high Baroque baldacchino over the main altar in today‚Äôs Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica is at present the best-known such structure. Later, simpler vessels replaced to some extent the dove and the tower. By the thirteenth century, the Eucharist was most often kept in a highly embellished cabinet inserted into the wall to the right or left of the altar. The Altar lamp indicated the Presence of Christ. This was a means of following the decree of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council requiring that the reserved sacrament be kept in a locked receptacle. The ornate tabernacle in St Martin's church, Kortrijk, Belgium In the late fourteenth century, special stone constructions for the Eucharistic bread began to be built, especially in northern Europe. In German and Netherlandish churches of the period, such structures can still be seen: tall towers, known in German as Sakramentsh√§user, in Dutch as sacramentstorens, usually placed to the north of the altar and often reaching almost to the ceiling. They were in use until the mid-nineteenth century. As the presence of the sanctuary lamp in the adjacent picture shows, some have been returned to their traditional use. German examples are found in the church of St Lawrence in Nuremberg (18.70 metres), the minster of Salem (16 metres), Saints Peter and Paul city church in Weil der Stadt (over 11 metres), the church of Our Lady in L√ºbeck (9.5 metres), and St Mary's Cathedral in F√ºrstenwalde upon Spree. Belgian churches with such sacrament towers include St Catherine's in Zuurbemde, St Martin's in Kortrijk, St Peter's and St James's in Leuven, St James's in Bruges and St Leonard's in Zoutleeuw. In the early sixteenth century, Bishop Matteo Giberti ordered that, in his diocese of Verona, in Italy, the container case for the consecrated bread should be placed on an altar. The custom spread through northern Italy. Saint Charles Borromeo, who became Archbishop of Milan, Italy in 1560, had the Sacrament moved from the sacristy to an altar (not the main altar) of his cathedral. The edition of the Roman Missal revised and promulgated by Pope Pius V in 1570 (see Tridentine Mass) still did not envisage placing the tabernacle on an altar: it laid down instead that the altar card containing some of the principal prayers of the Mass should rest against a cross placed midway on the altar (Rubricae generales Missalis, XX - De Praeparatione Altaris, et Ornamentorum eius). However, in 1614 Pope Paul V imposed on the churches of his diocese of Rome the rule of putting the tabernacle on some altar. Reaction to Protestantism's denial of the reality and permanence of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist then led to the spread of the placing of the tabernacle even on the high altar, so as to make it more evidently visible. Whether on the main altar of the church or in a special chapel, the tabernacle became more and more large and ornate, to the extent of dominating the altar. Present normsCatholic Church= Tabernacle at Cath√©drale Saint Louis de Versailles The Catholic Church holds the doctrine of transubstantiation, i.e. that Christ is \\"truly present, Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity,\\" though under the appearance of bread or wine. This presence perdures after the consecration, so that even after Mass is concluded, the Eucharistic elements are still Christ's Body and Blood. A tabernacle serves as a secure place in which to store the Blessed Sacrament for carrying to the sick who cannot participate in Mass, or as a focus for the prayers of those who visit the church. The renewal of the Roman-rite liturgy following the Second Vatican Council (see Mass of Paul VI) was to highlight the primacy of the Eucharistic celebration itself, more than just a means for providing the permanent Eucharistic presence. The altar, it was decided, should be \\"truly the centre to which the attention of the whole congregation of the faithful naturally turns\\".General Instruction of the Roman Missal, ¬ß299 Before Vatican II, Mass was often celebrated directly in front of the tabernacle. Today, most often, the altar for the celebration of Mass stands on its own, and the tabernacle is given its own, usually smaller, altar or it stands nearby on a pedestal or in its own separate chapel. This allows the faithful to focus on the celebration of the Eucharistic action during Mass, but preserves a dignity of place and fosters prayer and meditation outside of Mass by giving the tabernacle its own space. Before the 1960s, some bye-altars in Catholic churches also housed a tabernacle, in addition to that of the high altar. The same Instruction lays down that: :314. In accordance with the structure of each church and legitimate local customs, the Most Blessed Sacrament should be reserved in a tabernacle in a part of the church that is truly noble, prominent, readily visible, beautifully decorated, and suitable for prayer. :The one tabernacle should be immovable, be made of solid and inviolable material that is not transparent, and be locked in such a way that the danger of profanation is prevented to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, it is appropriate that, before it is put into liturgical use, it be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual. :315. It is more in keeping with the meaning of the sign that the tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist is reserved not be on an altar on which Mass is celebrated. Consequently, it is preferable that the tabernacle be located, according to the judgment of the Diocesan Bishop, ::a. either in the sanctuary, apart from the altar of celebration, in a form and place more appropriate, not excluding on an old altar no longer used for celebration; ::b. or even in some chapel suitable for the faithful‚Äôs private adoration and prayer and which is organically connected to the church and readily visible to the Christian faithful. :316. In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a special lamp, fuelled by oil or wax, should be kept alight to indicate and honor the presence of Christ. Tabernacles have generally been made of metal (such as bronze or brass), or sometimes of heavy wood. They are traditionally lined in white cloth (often silk), and are always securely lockable and generally permanently affixed or bolted to their support. Some Tabernacles are veiled when the Eucharist is present in them. These veils are often of cloth and design similar to the priest's vestments (that is, to create a harmony of design), and are either white (the color of the Eucharist), gold (which may be substituted for white), or of violet, green or red depending on the liturgical color of the day or season. =Eastern Catholic and Orthodox ChurchesReserved sacrament The altar at Golgotha in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem. In the centre is an Orthodox tabernacle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Holy Mysteries (reserved sacrament) are kept in a tabernacle (Greek: Œ±œÅœÑŒøœÜŒøœÅŒπŒøŒΩ artophorion) or ark (Slavonic: –∫–æ–≤—á–µ–≥ kovch√©g) on the altar at all times. The tabernacle is normally wrought of gold, silver, or wood and elaborately decorated. It is often shaped like a miniature church building, and usually has a cross on the top of it. It may be opened using small doors, or a drawer that pulls out. Some churches keep the tabernacle under a glass dome to protect it (and the Holy Mysteries) from dust and changes in humidity. Dormition Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin) The Orthodox do not have a concept of Eucharistic adoration as a devotion separated from the reception of Holy Communion. But the Holy Mysteries are treated with utmost respect, as they believe in the Real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ. The clergy must be vested whenever they handle the Holy Mysteries. During the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts (wherein Communion is received from the reserved Sacrament), when the consecrated Holy Mysteries are brought out during the Great Entrance, everyone makes a full prostration--even the chanters stop singing and prostrate themselves while the entrance is made in silence. When Orthodox Christians receive Holy Communion, they always receive in both species: the Body and the Blood of Christ. This includes Communion taken to the sick. Therefore, both are reserved in the tabernacle. Every year on Holy Thursday, the reserved Mysteries are renewed. The priest will cut an extra Lamb (host) for that liturgy and after the consecration, just before the clergy receive communion, the priest will take the extra Lamb and carefully pour a little of the Blood of Christ over it. This Lamb will then be cut into very small portions, allowed to dry thoroughly, and be placed in the tabernacle. The deacon (or priest, if there is no deacon) will consume whatever remains of the previous year's reserved sacrament when he performs the ablutions. Typically, a sanctuary lamp is kept burning in the Holy Place (sanctuary) when the Mysteries are reserved. This may be a separate lamp hanging from the ceiling, or it may be the top lamp of the seven-branch candlestick which sits either on top of the Holy Table or behind it. Communion for the sick chalice, in the back is a tiny communion spoon with a cross on the handle (Kiev-Pecherski Lavra) A small receptacle called a pyx is used for taking communion to the sick. While designs may differ, this often consists of a metal case with a chain attached so it can be hung around the neck. Inside the case are several compartments. One compartment contains a small box with a tightly-fitting lid into which some of the reserved Holy Mysteries will be placed. There is also a place for a very small chalice, just enough to hold a small amount of wine and a particle of the reserved Mysteries. There will be a small bottle to hold ordinary wine (not consecrated) which is used to soften the particle before it is consumed, a small pair of tweezers with which the priest removes a particle of the Mysteries from the box to place it in the chalice without touching it, and finally a small communion spoon with which to administer Holy Communion. This sick call kit is normally kept on the Holy Table, or sometimes on the Table of Oblation. Rather than using a kit like the one described above, a priest may use a small chalice with a tight-fitting lid. He pours a little wine into the chalice, places a particle of the reserved Mysteries in the wine, and attaches the lid. He will take the chalice and a communion spoon to administer Holy Communion to the sick. Presanctified gifts A smaller tabernacle, sometimes referred to as a pyx, is used during Great Lent. This tends to be a rectangular, gold-plated box, often with a cross on top, with a hinged lid. On Sundays during Great Lent, the priest will consecrate extra Lambs (in the same manner as on Holy Thursday), for use during the Presanctified Liturgy. These Lambs will be kept in the pyx on the Holy Table, or sometimes on the Prothesis (Table of Oblation). =Lutheran Churches= Mikael Agricola Lutheran Church in Helsinki, juxtaposed with a chancel lamp and note about the real presence. Reservation of the blessed sacrament is permitted in the Lutheran Churches, although not for the purposes of Eucharistic adoration. In Lutheran parishes that practice sacramental reservation, a chancel lamp is kept near the tabernacle or aumbry. The Evangelical Catholic Church, a Lutheran denomination of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship based in North America, taught: =Anglican and Episcopal Churches= Only some Anglican parishes of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship use tabernacles, either fixed on the altar, placed behind or above it, or off to one side. As in Catholic churches, the presence of the reserved sacrament is indicated by a \\"presence lamp\\" ‚Äì an oil or wax-based flame in a clear glass vessel placed close to the tabernacle. Normally, only ciboria and Blessed Sacrament are placed in the tabernacle, although it is not uncommon for the wine or consecrated oils to be placed there as well. When the tabernacle is vacant, it is common practice to leave it open so that the faithful will not inadvertently perform an act of devotion (such as bowing or genuflecting). Tabernacles are customarily lined with, if not constructed from, cedar wood, whose aromatic qualities discourage insect life. E. J. Bicknell in A Theological Introduction to the Thirty-Nine Articles writes that \\"According to the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI the sick might be communicated with the reserved sacrament on the same day as a celebration in church.\\" Article XXVIII ‚Äî Of the Lord's Supper in Anglicanism's 39 Articles and Article XVIII ‚Äî Of the Lord's Supper in Methodism's Articles of Religion state that \\"The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped.\\" The Rev. Jonathan A. Mitchican, founder of The Conciliar Anglican writes that this Article \\"does not explicitly ban these practices but does add a note of caution about them by pointing to the fact that none of them are biblical.\\" As such, the reserved sacrament was used by Anglican priests who held these views to administer communion to persons unable to attend church through illness. However, in 1885 the upper house of Convocation ruled against this practice, declaring \\"the practice of reservation is contrary to the wise and carefully revised Order of the Church of England\\".Cutts, E. L. (1895) A Dictionary of the Church of England; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; p. 511 Among those Anglicans who identify as \\"Anglo-Catholics,\\" the Protestant Reformation is often considered one episode in church history which no longer defines their faith as Anglicans. After the Oxford Movement, reservation became commonplace in large parts of the Anglican Communion, and some parishes also perform services of solemn benediction and/or other forms of Eucharistic adoration. The Anglo- Catholic manual of rites and ceremonies Ritual Notes described tabernacles as generally made of wood (they could however be of gold, silver or even iron; if of iron this should be enclosed in gilt-wood, wrought metal or carved stone). If the material be metal there should be an inner lining of poplar or cedar wood and in any case a lining also of white silk or cloth of gold or silver. The tabernacle should be securely fixed to the altar or (shelf), but away from the wall so that the conopaeum (a veil used to cover it when it contains the blessed sacrament) can completely surround it. The veil may be white or varying in liturgical colour. There may be a second tabernacle but not more in the same church but if so only one should be used at any time. A lamp should remain lit nearby when the tabernacle is in use.Cairncross, Henry, et al., comps. (1935) Ritual Notes; 8th ed. London: W.

Comparison of stadium seating (left) to standard seating. The rearmost viewer can see a lower subject with stadium seating. Stadium seating or theater seating is a characteristic seating arrangement that is most commonly associated with performing-arts venues, and derives its name from stadiums, which typically use this arrangement. Description In stadium seating, most or all seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them so that the occupants of further-back seats have less of their views blocked by those further forward. This is especially necessary in stadiums where the subject matter is typically best observed from above, rather than in-line or from below. In addition to sports venues and performing arts venues, many other venues that require clear audience views of a single area use stadium seating, including religious institutions, lecture halls, and movie theaters. Alternatives An alternative to stadium seating is to place the focal area at a higher level than the audience, so that the audience may look above those people in front of them to see, (like the green circle in the illustration, right), avoiding blocked sight-lines . One example of this is floor seating of a music venue which has a raised stage; seats are commonly all at an equal height on the actual floor of a venue, such as the floor seats at a concert held in a sports arena. Because the increased angle of stadium seating, seats are typically (but not universally) installed on a stepped floor surface which also functions as a staircase in the aisles. This is as opposed to the common usage of a flat, often slightly sloped, floor used in many standard seating venues (such as many stage theaters). There has been some criticism of stadium seating because, due to the stepped layout, it is usually not possible for disabled people in wheelchairs to move about. Venues with stadium seating generally place handicapped seating among the row which is at the level of the concourse which feeds the seating area, leaving more space than rows above or below it, and leaving chair-less space(s) for wheelchairs. Trains The trains on some roller coasters are also configured in tiers; this seating configuration is also sometimes called stadium seating. Three prominent examples of roller coasters whose trains use this type of seating are Millennium Force at Cedar Point, which opened in 2000, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, which opened in 2005, and Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, which opened in 2007. Theaters Converting sloped-floor theaters to stadium seating often requires raising the ceiling and adding risers, so owners of movie theaters often judge conversion as not cost- effective.

He, Orville and Cuddles became popular performers on primetime television until the show was cancelled in 1990, as audiences and television producers began to move away from variety performances. After a low period and two failed business ventures in the early 1990s, he embarked on a busy stage career (mostly in pantomime) and found new appreciation in the 2000s, appearing as a guest in several television programmes. His output declined after a 2013 cancer diagnosis and he died two years later. Early life Born in Lyndhurst, Hampshire on 21 September 1947, Harris grew up in North Baddesley in Hampshire\\"Tributes paid to Orville ventriloquist Keith Harris as he dies aged 67\\", Southern Daily Echo, 28 April 2015. Retrieved 14 November 2019. and near Chester (where he attended a secondary modern school). His parents were variety performers; his mother Lilian \\"Lila\\", n√©e Simmons (born 1917), was a dancer; his father, Norman Harris (1912‚Äì2005), was a singer, comedian and ventriloquist. From age nine Harris appeared on his father Norman's knee as a \\"dummy\\" in his ventriloquist act. Harris was severely dyslexic at school and in 2014, he claimed that his dyslexia had cost him millions of pounds because of his inability to read contracts accurately.  Career  Early television appearances = Harris began creating ventriloquism characters as a teenager. After appearing in summer seasons at holiday resorts, he had spots on the television series Let's Laugh (1965).Anthony Hayward, \\"Keith Harris obituary\\", The Guardian, 28 April 2015. Retrieved 14 November 2019. Harris became a popular act on television variety shows, and following a spell as the host of The Black and White Minstrel Show, was given his own show called Cuddles and Company. He appeared several times on BBC TV's long-running show The Good Old Days. = Height of fame = Harris' best known creation, Orville the duck, came about after he saw some green fur lying around backstage at a performance of The Black and White Minstrel Show in Bristol. Orville, recalled Simon Farquhar in his Independent obituary of Harris, was \\"a huge, gormless, falsetto-voiced green duckling sporting a nappy fastened by a giant safety pin\\".Simon Farquhar, \\"Keith Harris: Children's entertainer whose act with his dummies Orville and Cuddles was one of the last triumphs of the variety age\\", The Independent, 28 April 2015. Harris recorded \\"Orville's song\\", written by Bobby Crush. It made the Top Ten in the UK singles chart in 1982 and sold 400,000 copies. It was later voted the worst song ever recorded. The Keith Harris Show ran on Saturday evenings on BBC1 from 1982 to 1990 and a series for children The Quack Chat Show (1989‚Äì90) also on BBC1. Harris appeared in several Royal Variety Performances and also performed privately for the Royal Family. At the request of Diana, Princess of Wales he was booked as an act for the birthdays of Princes William and Harry at each of their respective third birthdays at Highgrove and Kensington Palace. =Depression, recovery and pantomime= The end of Harris's television show coincided with a period when television was \\"turning away from variety acts\\". He entered a period of depression, drank heavily and was arrested for drunk driving; his third marriage collapsed during this period. He also opened clubs in Blackpool and Portugal which failed, leading him to declare bankruptcy twice. However, he recovered and began performing in clubs, in pantomimes and at holiday camps, touring the United Kingdom; he wrote 17 of his own pantomimes and had his own pantomime company, Keith Harris Productions, which he sold in 2009 to Richard Jordan.Michael Quinn, \\"Obituary: Keith Harris\\", The Stage, 29 April 2015.

Together, the saccharine-sweet avian [Orville], acerbic simian [Cuddles] and Harris as straight man and stooge were one of the most high-profile acts of the 1980s\\". Quinn also pointed out that this popularity faded after that decade, but that Harris nevertheless remained appreciated by audiences until his retirement. The Telegraph, however, remarked that the 2002 Louis Theroux documentary exposed a \\"darker side\\" of Harris, \\"a nervous, edgy man who kept telling rotten jokes\\" and who struggled to forgive past slights against him. In the same documentary Harris said of Orville that he had \\"created a monster ... Everybody knows Orville, not everybody knows Keith Harris\\", but also recognised that the bird had not \\"burdened\\" him and had contributed towards his success. Personal life Harris lived with his fourth wife (married in 1999), Sarah Metcalf (b. March 1966), and his two youngest children, Shenton (born in 2001) and Kitty (now a singer, born in 2000), in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool, where he converted the local cinema and bingo hall into a jazz nightclub called \\"Club L‚ÄôOrange\\". He had his first daughter, Skye, in 1986with his second wife of nine years, singer Jacqui Scott, a winner of a BBC talent show in 1979 who entered the 1980 A Song For Europe contest with her own composition.

It is an administrative center of Razgrad Province. Etymology The ruins of Abrittus The suffix \\"grad\\" means city in Bulgarian, while the origin and the meaning of the first part \\"raz\\" is obscure. During the Second Bulgarian Empire, around the present city there was a settlement, mentioned by the names of Hrasgrad, Hrazgrad and Hrizgrad'. These names come from the name of the Proto-Bulgarian and Slavic god Hors. History Razgrad clock tower, the symbol of the city, built in 1864 Razgrad was built upon the ruins of the Ancient Roman town of Abritus on the banks of the Beli Lom river. Abritus was built on a Thracian settlement of the 4th-5th century BC with unknown name. Several bronze coins of the Thracian king Seuthes III (330-300 BC) and pottery were found, as well as artifacts from other rulers and a sacrificial altar of Hercules. Ahmet Bey mosque in Razgrad Some of Razgrad's landmarks include the Varosha architectural complex from the 19th century, the ethnographic museum and several other museums, the characteristic clock tower in the centre built in 1864, the St Nicholas the Miracle Worker Church from 1860, the Momina cheshma sculpture, the Mausoleum Ossuary of the Liberators (1879‚Äì1880) and the Ibrahim Pasha Mosque from 1530. The mosque is said to be one of the largest in the Balkans. In 251, the town was the site of the Battle of Abrittus, during which the Goths defeated a Roman army under the emperors Trajan Decius and Herennius Etruscus. The battle is notable for being the first occasion of a Roman emperor being killed in a battle with barbarians. Razgrad Peak on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Razgrad.  Population  In January 2012, Razgrad was inhabited by 33,416 people within the city limits, while the Razgrad Municipality with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 50,457 inhabitants.National Statistical Institute - 2012 The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1988-1991 when exceeded 55,000. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887. =Ethnic composition= According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical InstitutePopulation by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute * Bulgarians: 24,701 (79.1%) * Turks: 5,902 (18.9%) * Roma: 288 (0.9%) * Others: 140 (0.4%) * Indefinable: 195 (0.6%) ** Undeclared: 2,654 (7.8%) Total: 33,880 The Razgrad Province has the second largest Turkish population in Bulgaria behind the Kardzhali Province, though the municipality and the city of Razgrad have a lower proportion of Turks than the rest of the province. Sport Razgrad is widely recognizable for being home to the association football club Ludogorets Razgrad, who in recent years have become the dominant force in Bulgarian football after winning eight consecutive Bulgarian First League titles between 2012 and 2019. After reaching the UEFA Europa League round of 16 during the 2013‚Äì14 season, the club also made their UEFA Champions League debut appearance a season later.

Character overview  Jack is Will Truman's (Eric McCormack) best friend. A \\"camp\\" gay man. Very mercurial, he changes careers rapidly from cater waiter, Banana Republic and Barneys New York sales clerk, to acting teacher, to student nurse, to surfer, to back-up dancer for Jennifer Lopez and Janet Jackson. Although he considers all his relationships serious, only one lasted longer than a few weeks (with Stuart, a client of Will's played by Dave Foley), and even that one ended with Jack's cheating. Jack is unashamedly vain and self-absorbed, and adores all gay icons, particularly Cher, of whom he has a rare doll. (He met her once, although he mistook her for a drag queen. He would also meet Cher in a dream where she appeared as God, complete with an entourage of \\"dancing fairies\\"). According to Will, he has the best gaydar in the tristate area. He is a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, particularly lesbian character Willow Rosenberg. He also collects clippings of celebrities' hair, including a complete collection from the four main actresses on The Golden Girls, as well as Broadway icons Bernadette Peters, Betty Buckley, Idina Menzel, and ‚Äì as of season seven ‚Äî Patti LuPone. Jack also stalks actor Kevin Bacon, briefly becoming the actor's assistant. He believes in gay rights, but tends to lend his support to shallow causes, such as protesting NBC censoring a gay kiss on a television show (\\"What about our Constitutional right to see two hotties get it on?\\"). Nevertheless, his intentions are essentially good: For example, in one episode he uses all his nest-egg money to save a pair of gay penguins at the zoo in order to make Will happy. Character history Jack was born February 16, 1969, and was raised by his mother Judith (Veronica Cartwright) and stepfather Daniel (Beau Bridges). He also had a babysitter named Sissy (played in one episode by Demi Moore). His mother did not know he was gay, and his stepfather was not close to him. He claims to have come out as early as preschool. While he was in high school, Jack befriended Will and helped him come to terms with his sexuality. They have been best friends ever since. Since the first season, Jack has established a close bond with alcoholic socialite Karen Walker (Megan Mullally), who works as Grace's secretary. Karen is his closest female friend, and they bond due to their shared narcissism and materialism. Jack also strikes up a friendship with Will's other best friend Grace Adler (Debra Messing), through association with Will and Karen. In the pilot episode, Jack is living with Will while his floors are re-done, but has to find elsewhere to live when Grace moves in. At the end of season one, Jack agrees to marry Karen's maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) to secure her green card. Jack lives with Karen for the entirety of season two, but after a year together, the marriage is annulled when Rosario wants to marry Karen's gardener. Therefore, at the end of season two, Jack moves in with Will, but when Will takes Grace in after an attempted burglary at her apartment, Jack agrees to sublet Grace's apartment ‚Äî although Will, Karen, and his mother pay the rent. (In \\"Moveable Feast Part 1,\\" it emerged that each of the three pays one half of the cost, meaning that Jack is actually collecting one and a half times the actual amount of his rent.) In season three, Jack undertakes a search for his biological father, which ends when he discovers that his father died several years back. Jack does, however, meet Elliot (Michael Angarano), his own biological son, whom he fathered by depositing at a sperm bank as a teenager so that he could buy a leather jacket. He later discovers that the boy's mother Bonnie (Rosie O'Donnell) is a lesbian; she was a nurse at the sperm bank who stole Jack's deposit and was inseminated with it. Jack's most consistent vocation results from his taking over the class of his acting teacher Zandra (Eileen Brennan) after she is fed up with his lack of talent. After taking everyone's money and leaving, another student (Stacy Keach) takes over the class and begins teaching the \\"McFarland method\\" (\\"acting is attracting\\") without Jack's knowledge. He also trains to be a student nurse, but ultimately gives it up when, during Karen's fourth wedding, he meets Jennifer Lopez and becomes her back-up dancer (and, for a short time, Janet Jackson's back-up dancer), a career that fizzles as well. In the seventh season, Jack embarks on a proper career as a producer for OutTV, a new gay television network. By season's end, his profile rises to the point that he is given a talk show of his own to host. In season eight, however, Jack loses his job at the network after he speaks out against the new right-wing ownership of the show, which has given him a conservative co-host named Amber Louise (Britney Spears). He has a hard time finding work, and out of desperation auditions for a minor role on a television show. Feeling depressed and rejected at the time, he displays real emotion instead of his usual over- dramatic acting style, and ends up getting the lead role of Chuck Rafferty, a straight, alcoholic, womanizing cop. In the series finale, Jack is forced into a relationship with Karen's nemesis Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan); Karen, who has recently lost all of her money, demands that he take up with the obnoxious millionaire so he can inherit Leslie's fortune and keep her in the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Eventually Karen realizes that she is doing to Jack what her mother did to her, and tells him that she cares more about his happiness than the money. When Beverley dies after being swept off his balcony by a gust of wind, Jack is left with his money, which he shares with Karen. A flash forward reveals that, 16 years later, Jack and Karen are still living together. When the series was revived in 2017, however, the events of the finale were retconned. In the new continuity, Jack was never engaged to Beverly Leslie, is not rich, is still living across the hall from Will and Grace, and is still pursuing an acting career while throwing himself at every available man in sight. During the ninth season, he takes up a part- time job as rehearsal pianist and acting teacher at the Bronx Boys and Girls Club. In the 11th season, he takes over as owner and manager of Cleo's, a legendary New York gay bar. In the series finale, Jack is cast in a Broadway show as a \\"fifth understudy\\", and finally achieves his dream of appearing on the Great White Way when the original actor and all four other understudies call in sick. In the final scene, he goes with Will, Grace, and Karen to the hospital when Grace goes into labor. RelationshipsRomantic relationships= Jack is known for his several various flings throughout the show. Most of them are mentioned but not shown, and Jack never seems to take any of them seriously or settle down with anyone for very long. Jack's longest relationship is with Stuart Lamarack (Dave Foley), which lasts several months during the sixth season, until Jack cheats on him. During the ninth season, Jack enters into a relationship with Drew (Ryan Pinkston) after realising he fears growing old and lonely. Drew later abruptly breaks up with Jack after two months, claiming he is not ready for a committed relationship and wants to see other people, which devastates Jack as he realises he is now ready to settle down with someone. In the ninth season finale, he instantly goes on a rebound fling and quickly gets engaged to Estefan (Brian Jordan Alvarez), a man he met on said rebound vacation. While Jack at first struggles with the idea of a lifelong commitment, he finally realizes that he loves Estefan, and marries him in the 10th season finale. =Will= The episode \\"Lows in the Mid-Eighties\\" reveals that Jack met Will at a party in 1985 and realized immediately that he was gay. After Will comes out of the closet, he and Jack become best friends, with Jack helping Will navigate life as an openly gay man. While they care deeply for each other, however, Jack and Will fight and make fun of each other constantly. Jack often calls Will \\"bald and fat\\" (which he clearly isn't), while Will makes fun of Jack's promiscuity, shallowness, and perpetual unemployment. Nevertheless, Will pays virtually all of Jack's bills, including half his rent (with Karen and Jack's mother also paying half each). Several episodes suggest that Jack has feelings for Will. In \\"Lows in the Mid-Eighties,\\" he confesses his love to Will, but tries to pass it off as a 'test of friendship' when Will doesn't feel the same. He has a similar reaction in an eighth-season episode when Will's boyfriend James (Taye Diggs) accuses him of being jealous of their relationship. =Karen= Jack and Karen meet in the second episode of the first season, and become instant best friends. Karen calls Jack \\"poodle\\" and lavishes him with gifts and attention, while also paying half his rent. They also provide each other with emotional support (in their own self-absorbed fashion), with Karen defending him from people who treat him unkindly and Jack giving her a shoulder to cry on when her marriage falls apart. In the series finale, Jack reluctantly moves in Karen's nemesis Beverley Leslie to provide for a newly bankrupt Karen. However, Karen realizes that she doesn't want him to make a mistake and stops him from marrying Beverley. After Beverley dies, Jack inherits his money, and he and Karen live together in luxury for the rest of their lives. The 2017 revival retcons these events as one of Karen's drug-induced hallucinations, though Karen does not tell Jack about what happened to him in this dream. =Grace= Jack and Grace initially dislike each other, seeing each other as competition for Will's attention. Eventually, they bond over their shared love of ice skating. For the remainder of the series, they are good friends, although they make fun of each other constantly. =Elliot= In the third season, Jack finds out that he has a son, Elliot (Michael Angarano), conceived through in vitro fertilization using sperm that Jack donated to a sperm bank years before. Jack initially has trouble adjusting to fatherhood, especially since Elliot's mother Bonnie (Rosie O'Donnell) dislikes him. Eventually, however, Jack realizes that he loves Elliot and commits (in his own way) to being a good father. In the revived series, Jack and Elliot have been estranged for several years. Jack learns that Elliot has a son, Skip, who is presumed to be gay. He is horrified to learn that Elliot and his wife are sending Skip to \\"hetero camp\\", and follows the boy there to tell him that there is nothing wrong with him. Elliot realizes the error of his ways and invites Jack into his family. Reception The character has gained a mixed reception from critics for perpetuating gay stereotypes. Nevertheless, Hayes won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2000 for his performance.

He is one of only five people ever designated an \\"Exemplar of Racing\\" by the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He was co-heir to one of America's greatest business fortunes, derived from the Mellon Bank created by his grandfather Thomas Mellon, his father Andrew W. Mellon, and his father's brother Richard B. Mellon. In 1957, when Fortune prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister Ailsa Mellon-Bruce, and his cousins Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each (around $ and $ in today's dollars). Mellon's autobiography, Reflections in a Silver Spoon, was published in 1992. He died at his home, Oak Spring, in Upperville, Virginia, on February 1, 1999. He was survived by his wife, Rachel (a.k.a. Bunny), his children, Catherine Conover (first wife of John Warner) and Timothy Mellon, and two stepchildren, Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza, Viscountess Moore. Biography Paul Mellon was the son of Andrew W. Mellon, US Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932, and Nora McMullen of Hertfordshire and brother of Ailsa Mellon-Bruce. He graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, in 1925, where he wrote for the literary magazine. He then went on to graduate from Yale College and the University of Cambridge. At Yale, he was a member of Chi Psi fraternity, Scroll and Key and served as vice-chairman of the Yale Daily News. He was a great benefactor of his alma maters, donating to the Forbes-Mellon Library at the University of Cambridge, the Mellon Arts Center and the Mellon (now Icahn) Science Center to Choate, two residential colleges, and the Yale Center for British Art. After graduating from Yale, he went to England to study at the University of Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1931, while his father served as the US Ambassador to the Court of St. James's from 1932 to 1933. In 1930, he was a founding member, alongside Sir Timothy William Gowers, of the CRABS, the Clare Rugby And Boating Society (the oldest of the collegiate Gentlemen's societies still active). In 1938, he received an Oxbridge MA from Clare College, Cambridge. He was a major benefactor to Clare College's Forbes-Mellon Library, opened in 1986. =Marriage and military service= Paul Mellon (William Orpen, 1924) Mellon returned to Pittsburgh, to work for Mellon Bank and other businesses for six months. In 1935, he married Mary Conover Brown and the couple, who had two children, Catherine and Timothy, moved to Virginia. He enrolled at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1940 but six months later joined the United States Army, asking to join the cavalry. Mellon served with the Morale Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services in Europe. He rose to the rank of major and was the recipient of four battle stars in the European Theatre of Operations. After his wife Mary's death in 1946 from an asthma attack, he married Rachel Lambert Lloyd, known as \\"Bunny\\", the former wife of Stacy Barcroft Lloyd Jr. She was a descendant of the Lambert family who formulated and marketed Listerine and an heiress to the Warner-Lambert corporate fortune (Warner-Lambert is now part of Pfizer, following a 2000 merger). Bunny Mellon was an avid horticulturist and gardener, whose fondness for French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting, as well as American art, Mellon came to share. By this marriage, he had two stepchildren: Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza Lambert Lloyd (d. 2008; who married and divorced Viscount Moore). =Art collection= While Mellon did not share his father's interest in business, the two found common ground in their love of art and philanthropy. Shortly before Andrew Mellon's death in 1937, construction began on the West Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., for which Andrew Mellon had provided funds. Four years later Paul Mellon presented both the building by John Russell Pope and his father's collection of 115 paintings to the nation. He served on the museum's board for more than four decades: as trustee, as president (twice), as board chair, and as honorary trustee. Mellon commissioned I. M. Pei to build the East Building and, with his sister Ailsa, provided funds for its construction in the late 1970s. Over the years he and his wife Bunny donated more than 1,000 works to the National Gallery of Art, among them many French and American masterworks. In 1936, Mellon purchased his first British painting, Pumpkin with a Stable-lad by George Stubbs, who became a lifetime favorite of Mellon's. Beginning in the late 1950s, with the help of English art historian Basil Taylor, Mellon amassed a major collection by the mid-1960s. London art dealer Geoffrey Agnew once said of his acquisitions: \\"It took an American collector to make the English look again at their own paintings.\\" Mellon's collection was catalogued by Dudley Snelgrove and Judy Egerton. Mellon granted his extensive collection of British art, rare books, and related materials to Yale University in the 1960s, along with the funding to create an appropriate museum to house it (designed by Louis Kahn). He characteristically insisted that it not be named in honor of him, but rather would be called the Yale Center for British Art, to encourage others to support it as well. Mellon also provided extensive endowment support to fund not only operations but also an ongoing program of acquisitions, and he made a generous bequest to the Center at the time of his death. The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art was founded in 1970 through a generous grant to Yale University, as a London- based affiliate of the New Haven center, to encourage study of British art and culture both at the undergraduate and the research scholar levels. Mellon also provided important leadership gifts to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, as well as Choate Rosemary Hall. =Rokeby Stables= Mellon owned many thoroughbred horses under his Rokeby Stables, including Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero. Two of his horses, Arts and Letters and Fort Marcy, were named American Horse of the Year in 1969 and 1970 respectively. Both are inductees in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He also owned three European champions, Mill Reef { Forrest Flower } and Gold and Ivory. Mill Reef was the #8 rated horse in the world for the 20th Century in A Century of Champions, by John Randall and Tony Morris. Mellon won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1971 and again in 1986. =Establishment of philanthropic foundations= Mellon established the Old Dominion Foundation in 1941 and the Bollingen Foundation in 1945, both to support advancement and learning of the humanities and liberal education. The Bollingen Foundation published over 100 books before closing in 1969, the same year the assets of the Old Dominion Foundation were merged into those of his sister Ailsa's Avalon Foundation. The combined organization was renamed The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in honor of their father. Yale University Paul Mellon's foremost philanthropic interest was his alma mater, Yale University. His most generous and well-known gifts established the Yale Center for British Art, but his legacy makes itself felt across the campus. Mellon's other major gift was to provide extensive funding to support the creation of two new undergraduate residential colleges at Yale, Ezra Stiles College and Morse College. Designed by Eero Saarinen, these colleges along with the Kahn-designed British Art Center demonstrated Mellon's commitment to bringing modern architecture to Yale. Perhaps most importantly, the additional undergraduate capacity that these colleges provided were a critical prerequisite to the ability of the university to transition to co-education. Beyond these capital gifts, Mellon endowed the deanships of each of Yale's 12 residential colleges. He created the Mellon Senior Forum program, which provides a weekly meal for seniors in each of the residential colleges where they can share progress on their senior essays and projects with one another. Mellon was active in the humanities at Yale. He provided the funding necessary to create the Directed Studies program of intense freshman-year focus on the humanities. He supported significantly the undergraduate theater studies program, and endowed named professorships in schools throughout the University, particularly in the humanities. Other philanthropy Mellon was highly supportive of causes that advanced the preservation of horses, including the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. That organization allocates grants towards specific research projects for the safety, welfare, longevity and improvement of life for racehorses. He donated the $1 million bonus that Sea Hero won in the Chrysler Triple Crown Challenge to the United States Jockey Club's Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. Furthermore, he requested that double that amount be raised in response to his donation. That goal was met during the 1995‚Äì1996 fiscal year. Upon his death, he left yet another $2.5 million to the Foundation's endowment. In 1999, Paul Mellon bequeathed $8 million to the University of Cambridge in England for the Fitzwilliam Museum. During his lifetime he agreed that ¬£1 million of that sum could be allocated to the Museum's Courtyard Development and, under the terms of his Will, following his death in 1999, his Executors subsequently allocated a further $12.5 million to complete the renovations associated with the Courtyard, including the re-lighting of all of the Museum's galleries. The remaining balance was added to the Paul Mellon Fund which was established as a trust fund for the Museum at the time of the bequest, the income from which is being used to support education, exhibitions and publications. He also helped to buy the 28,625-acre Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the 1,500-acre Sky Meadows State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where he used to go to look at the stars.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/03/19/AR2007031901844.html He was also a major benefactor of Clare College and Clare Hall, both in Cambridge, England. Indeed, Clare Hall, founded 1966, gains much from his benefaction; his generous bequest serves the intellectual needs of the graduate college members. The Mellon Fellowship is another example of his generosity, permitting the reciprocal exchange of two students from Yale and two from Clare College for graduate study in each other's institutions. He developed his great love of England and English culture while studying at Clare College from 1929-1931. \\"It was while I was at Cambridge that I embarked on the dangerous seas of collecting\\", Paul Mellon once said‚Äîa statement by the man who described himself as \\"the incurable collector\\" that has had profound implications for his major beneficiaries, both in the US and the UK. Mellon helped to arrange the merger of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, founded by his father Andrew W. Mellon and uncle Richard B. Mellon with Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1967 to create Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.http://www.cmu.edu/presidential- search/images/13-038_Presidential_Search_81712.pdfhttp://www.cmu.edu/presidential- search/index.html Additionally, he donated substantial funds to Carnegie Mellon. Honors and awards American philanthropist and galloping anglophile within St George's, Bloomsbury Paul Mellon was a trustee of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and one of the only five people ever designated an \\"Exemplar of Racing\\" by the Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the English Jockey Club Hall of Fame. Among honors, he was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1974, awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1985, and awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities in 1997. In 1978, Mellon received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

She plays in both the Irish Traditional and Baroque styles.  Biography  Mary Bergin was born in Shankill, County Dublin, Ireland. Her parents Joe and M√°ire were melodeon and fiddle players, respectively. Mary started learning to play the tin whistle at the age of nine. Bergin won the All Ireland tin whistle championship in 1970. Her two virtuosic recordings of the solo tin whistle, Fead√≥ga St√°in (1979) and Fead√≥ga St√°in 2 (1993), have been critically cited as \\"outstanding and unequalled\\". Bergin moved to An Spid√©al, County Galway, in the early 1970s and played with many of the up-and-coming stars of the Irish music scene, notably De Danann and Ceolt√≥ri Laighin. She is currently a member of the group Dord√°n, who perform Irish traditional music and Baroque music with pieces by George Frideric Handel, Henry Purcell and a tune from Johann Sebastian Bach's Little Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. In addition to releasing two solo albums, which aided the popularisation of modern traditional Irish tin whistle playing, and three albums with Dord√°n, Bergin has taught hundreds of students, in Ireland, across Europe, and in the United States, to play the whistle. Playing style Bergin was exposed to the music of many renowned musicians from an early age, but her style is particularly influenced by flute player Packie Duignan and the whistle playing of Willie Clancy. She plays the whistle \\"left-handed\\", with the right hand covering the upper tone holes, unlike most whistle players who play with the left hand on top. Bergin's playing is characterized by great feeling, technical virtuosity, and a respect for the music. Music scholar Fintan Vallely has described her playing as \\"brightly ornamented but uncluttered\\", with \\"crisp articulation\\". Writer and flute player Grey Larsen uses similar terms, describing her playing as \\"precise\\", \\"elegant\\", and \\"streamlined\\".

It is primarily used for football and serves as the home field for the Missouri Tigers football program. It is the third-largest sports facility by seating capacity in the state of Missouri, behind The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis and Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. In 1972, Memorial Stadium's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot. During the offseason, soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches. Until 2012 it was the site of the annual \\"Providence Bowl\\" game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools, so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia, and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two. This tradition stopped when Missouri joined the Southeastern Conference and conference scheduling made hosting the game more difficult. Faurot Field has also served as the host of Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) football championships. The stadium is an early 20th century horseshoe-shaped stadium, with seating added on in the \\"open\\" (south) end zone. The original horseshoe is completed by a grass berm in the curved end, which is used for general admission on game days. The berm is famous for the giant block \\"M\\" made of painted white stones located behind the end zone. A paved path encircled the west, north and east sides of the field taking the place of the track, but was removed in 1994. Early history Fundraising began in 1921 for a \\"Memorial Union\\" and a \\"Memorial Stadium\\" to be constructed at the University. The names of the two projects were a tribute to Mizzou alumni who lost their lives during World War I. Ground was broken on the site of the future stadium in December 1925. The site was a sizeable natural valley that lay between twin bluffs south of the campus. Original plans called for the stadium to seat 25,000, with proposed stages of expansion in capacity to 35,000, 55,000, 75,000 and 95,000. According to legend, a rock crusher and truck were buried during initial blasting, which still remain buried under the field. Memorial Stadium was dedicated on October 2, 1926, to the memory of 112 alumni and students who lost their lives in World War I. The 25,000-seat stadium‚Äîthe lower half of the current facility‚Äîwas built with a track that circled the playing field. That first October game against Tulane was marred by rainstorms that washed out a bridge into Columbia coming from the western side of Missouri. While the game sold out, the field could not be sodded due to the wet conditions. Therefore, a surface of sawdust and tree bark was used, and \\"the Tigers and Green Wave played to a scoreless, mudpie tie\\", in the words of sportswriter Bob Broeg. Grass would be installed thenafter until the 1980s. The highly recognizable rock 'M' of the northern end zone debuted on October 1, 1927, to a 13-6 victory over Kansas State. The monument was built by members of the freshman class using leftover rocks from the original stadium construction. The wide by high 'M' has continued to watch over the field and provide seating for fans since that day. TraditionsRock M= The stadium's most historic and identifiable landmark is the rock \\"M\\" above the stadium's north end zone. The \\"M\\" is formed by whitewashed rocks and measures 90 feet wide by 95 feet high. The landmark was built in 1927 by a group of freshman students, using leftover rocks from the original construction of Memorial Stadium. This distinctive feature has not been immune to pranks, such as enterprising Nebraska or Kansas fans attempting to change the \\"M\\" to an \\"N\\" or a \\"K\\", but groundskeepers and students have in the past protected the landmark. One of the traditions of the football team is that seniors, after playing their final home game, take a rock from the \\"M\\" as a souvenir. The rock \\"M\\" is also whitewashed every year by incoming freshmen during welcoming activities prior to the first home game.2005 Mizzou Football Media Guide. p21. =MIZ-ZOU Chant= The \\"M-I-Z,\\" \\"Z-O-U,\\" chant came about in 1976 after a game in Columbus, Ohio against Ohio State, famous for its seismic \\"OH/IO\\" chant. After an unexpectedly stunning 22‚Äì21 defeat of the Buckeyes and during the long bus-ride home, Missouri's cheerleaders were determined to come up with a signature chant equally awe- inspiring for home. The nickname, \\"Mizzou,\\" while quite old and well-known, was not often used to describe the University of Missouri by the late 1970s. Nonetheless Mini-Mizzou member Cedric Lemmie suggested MIZ-ZOU as something that might work and the cheerleaders agreed to devise a plan to get it started. According to Jess Bushyhead, cheerleading varsity co-captain (1976‚Äì1978) the plan was implemented during the next home game against the North Carolina Tar Heels on October 2, 1976. During the first half Marching Mizzou split in two and occupied the lower student section and the lower Alumni section. Unfortunately, the attempts were too scrambled and mostly failed to take off. So during halftime, Bushyhead deployed the cheerleaders, megaphones and PA bullhorns in hand, to get up into the stands to instruct alumni, \\"When you hear 'MIZ! from the students across the field, answer 'ZOU!\\" Students were to listen for that \\"ZOU\\" from the alumni, then return that with an even louder \\"MIZ!\\" This tepid start caught fire and by the end of 1976/77 football and basketball seasons, \\"MIZ-ZOU\\" had entered Missouri legend as the primal scream of Mizzou Pride. Nearly half a century later you can travel almost anywhere in Missouri and yell, \\"MIZ!\\" and any number of perfect strangers will return \\"ZOU!\\" thumb Today the chant is often started by the \\"Big MO\\" drum (the world's largest marching bass drum). The student section yells out \\"M-I-Z\\" and the alumni section responds \\"Z-O-U\\". This tradition has expanded to Tiger first downs; the PA announcer says, \\"First down, M-I-Z...\\" and the crowd finishes with \\"Z-O-U!\\" Expansion and Renovation1949‚Äì1978 Seating Expansions= Throughout its history, numerous expansion and renovation projects have taken place at Faurot Field. Beginning in 1949, MU expanded Memorial Stadium by constructing a second tier of seating above the original 1926 construction. The 1949 construction included seats between the 30 yard lines on the west side and between the south 30 and north 40 yard lines and a new press box on the west side of the stadium. A second project in 1961 filled in the northeast and northwest sections of the second tier and two final projects in 1963 and 1965 completed the second tier construction with new southwest and southeast stands. In 1967 the MU Board of Curators awarded contracts totaling $460,000 for construction of a new three story press box. The new press box was completed for the start of the 1969 season. In 1974, Athletic Director Mel Sheehan studied the possibility of lowering the field to add additional seats on each side closer to the sidelines, but the plan did not move forward due to a prevalence of bedrock just below the playing surface. During the summer of 1978, the south end zone (open end of the original horseshoe) was enclosed with 10,800 permanent seats, which brought total permanent seating capacity to 62,023 and overall seating capacity to around 75,000. =1985 Omniturf= On May 18, 1985, Mizzou replaced the natural grass surface with a new artificial surface called Omniturf, which was also installed at Autzen Stadium (Oregon) and Martin Stadium (Washington State). The conversion was completed on August 30. Mizzou was the last school in the Big Eight Conference to switch from grass to artificial turf. Six of the other seven conference schools switched to artificial turf in the early 1970s, and Iowa State followed suit in 1975 when the Cyclones' new Jack Trice Stadium opened. The first game on the new artificial turf was a 27‚Äì23 loss to Northwestern University played on September 14, 1985. The Tigers went on to finish 0‚Äì7 at home during the 1985 season. The OmniTurf surface became infamous to Tiger fans as the \\"lousy field\\" on which The Fifth Down Game was played on October 6, 1990. The surface was also panned by opponents as well. In 1992, Big Eight Conference coaches issued a statement that read, in part: \\"Big Eight Conference football coaches wanted to report that the football field at the University of Missouri is a detriment to the home and visiting teams and takes away from the integrity of the game played on such a field.\\" =1990s= On September 18, 1994, The Rolling Stones performed, during their Voodoo Lounge Tour, before 45,000 fans at Memorial Stadium in a concert that raised almost $100,000 for the conversion of the Omniturf surface back to natural grass. The final game on the infamous Omniturf surface was played on November 19 of that same year against the University of Kansas, a 31‚Äì14 Kansas victory. Mizzou's all-time record on the Omiturf was a disappointing 20‚Äì38‚Äì3. The new 15-story state-of-the-art facility containing press boxes, suites, and a restaurant was constructed in 2000. The new Daktronics video board installed before the start of the 2009-2010 football season. The artificial Omniturf playing surface was removed and replaced with natural grass over the summer of 1995. Legendary Coach Don Faurot put down the last piece of sod as a symbolic gesture. Faurot had helped to lay the sod of the original playing surface in 1926. He died later that year in October, during Homecoming week. As part of the installation of the new playing surface, grass-covered terraces were extended up from the field to the seating area, where they met a new low brick wall that was designed to give Memorial Stadium a traditional college ambiance. The brick wall also honors the greatest figures in Tiger football (including Faurot, Kellen Winslow and Dan Devine) by listing the team's honored numbers on each panel. The first game on the new natural grass resulted in a 28‚Äì7 victory for Mizzou over North Texas. The game was also historic as the first game played under permanent lights‚Äîpreviously, night games only were played under temporary lights paid for by television broadcasters, and as part of the renovations four large light stanchions were erected outside each corner of the stadium. In 1996, four permanent light towers were installed, allowing Missouri to begin playing night games on a regular basis. The first game under these new lights was on September 14, 1996, when the Memphis Tigers defeated Missouri 19‚Äì16. 1997 brought a major renovation that included the installation of the Diamond Vision video board above the Rock \\"M\\" at the north end zone. The video board measured 21 feet high by 27 feet wide, and the screen utilized Clearvision Signal Processing. The concourses were also refurbished, with new signage and expanded concessions. New ticket booths were constructed, and the north entrance was reconfigured with more brick work to accent the new brick wall installed at field level in 1995. =2000‚Äì2012 Pre SEC Entry= Prior to the start of the 1999 football season, construction of a new press box and luxury suites began. The $13.1 million 15-story tower was completed in August 2000, and it contained state-of-the-art facilities for the coaches and media, as well as several executive suites, hundreds of premium club seats and a restaurant.\\"Rivals Battle for Press Box Supremacy. Lawrence Journal-World. September 15, 1999. 3C2005 Mizzou Football Media Guide. p 23 FieldTurf replaced the natural grass in 2003. With installation of the new FieldTurf, the traditional \\"M\\" was removed from the 50 yard line of the field, and it was replaced by the oval \\"Power Tiger\\" logo at the center of the field. In 2005, the south end's antiquated auxiliary scoreboards were replaced with new ones, as well as a second high-definition video monitor. In 2009, the university installed a new $5 million 30x80 foot north end zone scoreboard with updated video capabilities and new sound system. The new north end zone video board and audio upgrades replaced the 10-year-old DiamondVision equipment.\\"2008 Progress Continues at the Sports Park at MU\\". Tiger Row. Summer 2008. p19.

When the Tigers entered Southeastern Conference play, the Faurot Field video scoreboard was the ninth largest in the SEC. Press box view of the redesigned FieldTurf surface for the 2012 season. End zone view of the redesigned FieldTurf surface for the 2012 season. In 2012, Athletic Director Mike Alden announced a $1.5 million modification plan for Faurot Field in anticipation of increased game attendance in the SEC. Changes to the stadium included a redesigned FieldTurf surface featuring a larger \\"Power Tiger\\" logo at midfield, SEC conference logos, black and gold \\"M-I-Z-Z-O-U\\" end zone diamonds to replace the previous white \\"M-I-S-S-O-U-R-I\\" diamonds, and gold trim surrounding the field. Additionally, Marching Mizzou was moved from the south end zone to the southeast corner of the seating bowl, and a \\"Touchdown Terrace\\" premium seating section was added to the south end zone. =2012‚ÄìPresent SEC Entry= As part of the entry into the SEC, renovation plans were expanded to increase the current capacity by approximately 6,000 seats at a planned cost of $72 million: In 2013, the west side press box complex was renovated, moving all press facilities to the sixth floor and converting the existing space to new premium suites. In addition, the \\"Rock M\\" and grass berm were moved closer to the north end zone and the northern concourse was expanded. For the 2014 season, an upper bowl was completed on the east side of the stadium, providing 5,200 general admission seats and 800 club seats as well as adding two elevators, new stairs and a new entryway for the student section. Mizzou approved a renovation of the south end zone, including a new locker room, coaches offices and additional club and general seating at the end of the 2017 season. When finished the overall capacity of the stadium will decrease to roughly 65,000, and will complete before the 2019 season. Record crowds A view of the west stand, known to fans as the \\"Alumni Stand\\" The stadium's current capacity is 60,168, though in the past the stadium has been able to hold more fans. The record attendance for Faurot Field is 75,298 when Missouri hosted Penn State on October 4, 1980.

The stadium serves as a home to the Nigerian national football team, as well as a center for various social, cultural, and religious events. The Federal Government of Nigeria approved the contract for the construction of the National Stadium complex and Games Village on 18 July 2000. The stadium was constructed to host the 8th All Africa Games which took place in October 2003. On 12 June 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari announced the change of the name of the National Stadium, Abuja to Moshood Abiola National Stadium. President Buhari made this pronouncement during his speech at the Democracy Day celebration on Wednesday at the Eagle Square, Abuja. Construction and Architecture Seats view of the stadium Moshood Abiola National Stadium is one of the 50 most expensive stadiums ever built in the world. Structure Moshood Abiola National Stadium main bowl is designed to accommodate 60,491 spectator seats covered by a lightweight roof construction. The main characteristics are the two overlapping spectator tiers; the lower tier accommodating 32,000 seats and the upper tier 28,000 seats. The lower tier also incorporates 56 corporate suites with viewing terraces and one presidential lounge for 50 guests. All functional and secondary areas are accommodated in the entrance building which provides a gross floor area of approximately 25,000 m¬≤. This building is arranged below the concourse level which serves as the spectators‚Äò distribution level and therefore provides several kiosks, banks, first aid stations and toilet buildings. The structure of the stadium is a combination of insitu and precast concrete elements. There are 36 towers supporting the upper tier and the roof structure. These towers are founded on 140 bored piles with diameters of 1.30 m and 1.50 m in a depth of 8.00 m to 30.00 m. Precast concrete elements varying between 13 and 15 meters in length are placed between the towers, forming the spectator stands. A total of 6,300 precast elements were produced in the company‚Äôs production yard 15 kilometers away. The towers are connected on the top by a 2.50 m high and 2.00 m wide hollow concrete ring beam with a wall thickness of 0.35 m. The roof structure is fixed on 36 massive concrete points to the ring-beam. For the first time in the world, the ringbeam for this kind of roof structure was made of concrete. The roof structure itself is a cable construction with a weight of 800 tons carrying a 28.000 m¬≤ membrane. Facilities External view The Abuja Velodrome All facilities within the stadium are designed and engineered in compliance with the requirements of international sport associations, particularly the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The complex includes: *60,491 capacity covered main bowl *A Velodrome *Presidential suite and viewing area *56 corporate suites *Post offices *Banks *Media facilities *Two scoreboards and floodlights *Shops and kiosks for snacks *Helipad *3000 capacity indoor sports hall *2000 capacity gymnasi* 2000 capacity swimming pool *Tennis Courts *3000 capacity hockey stadium *Baseball and softball complex Moshood Abiola National Stadium meets the requirements of the International safety standards; it is equipped with emergency service units, closed circuit security cameras as well as crowd control steel fencing. There are also stand-by fire fighting equipment and metal detectors which have been put in place to avoid any misfortunes. History of the Stadium Although Nigeria had several stadiums scattered throughout the country, there was a lack of stadiums that met international standards. The capital city of Nigeria, Abuja, was selected to host the 8th All Africa Games in 2000 (a regional multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa) despite having no facilities for such a major sporting event. The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multimillion-dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on 18 July 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated. Citizens and athletes had doubts as to whether the completion of the stadium was feasible before the games. However, construction went very smoothly and ended up being ahead of schedule. As a matter of fact, the stadium was scheduled to be the host center for the Miss World Beauty Pageant that took place later in 2002. Unfortunately, the stadium not being fully completed by then as well as an uprising amongst citizens especially in the northern city of Kaduna which resulted in loss of lives forced the pageant to relocate to London, England. The construction of the main bowl went on from its inception in September 2000 to its completion in April 2003, well in time for the games. The Games Village construction went on from September 2000 to August 2003. The official commissioning of the complex was on 8 April 2003. Following its commissioning was the final leg of preparations for the games. The games that year were the largest in All Africa Games history;\\"8th All Africa Games.\\" 2K+ International Sports Media. Retrieved 30 October 2006 6,000 athletes from 53 countries competed in 22 sports, watched over by 1,200 officials. Over 1,500 journalists reported for the world's media. The games took place from the 4th to 18 October 2003 and was deemed successful by many. The host country, Nigeria, accumulated a total of 226 medals, emerging as leader of the games that year. Apart from the All African Games, the stadium has hosted important football matches, such as World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and other countries. The first game played at the stadium was a football (soccer) match between two local rival teams; the Shooting Stars of Ibadan and Sunshine Stars of Akure on 8 April 2003\\"Nigeria; Who Will Score First International Goal at Abuja Stadium?.\\" VANGUARD Newspapers 19 April 2003. Retrieved 30 October 2006 The first goal scored in the complex was from Shooting Stars' striker Shakiru Lawal who scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes. The complex has given the country confidence to bid for various up-coming international events. The Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) has given the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) the provisional hosting rights of the 2007 World Youth Championship because of the facilities the stadium has. The stadium during a match Other uses Apart from its function as a sports center, Moshood Abiola National Stadium serves as a home to cultural and religious events. Its capacity attracts various events such as concerts, and religious conferences, events which sometimes have preference over sports. Nigeria is a highly religious country with a population split almost equally between Christianity and Islam. Due to this fact, several religious events occur each year that attract a lot of citizens and require a large capacity arena. For example, in September 2006, the Nigeria Football Association was rendered helpless over the Presidency's preference of a religious event in the main bowl of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to an international football match against Rwanda. Some citizens are however concerned about the use of the stadium for such large events. Similar events held at the Stadium in Lagos resulted in its demise. The management of the stadium, however, intends to keep these events coming. Cost of maintenance is an issue and renting out the facility for various events is a strategy that has been employed to cover these costs. There were no plans whatsoever by the former military ruler late general Sani Abacha to build a national stadium in Abuja as some people might think. The pool at the Stadium's sport complex Maintenance Several issues have risen concerning the maintenance of the sports complex. The National Stadium in Lagos, the most populous and industrialized city in the country, was built for the 1973 All-Africa Games. Though it initially was considered state-of-the-art, it today is considered below any standard facility-wise and environmental-wise. The Nigerian sports boss Amos Adamu advised the government to privatize the Abuja stadium immediately after the 2003 All-Africa Games in order to forestall the vandalisation typical of publicly owned buildings. The federal government of Nigeria, who owns 100% equity on the property at the moment, has faced a lot of antagonism both locally and internationally. The average estimate for annual maintenance since its inauguration has been about $7 million, a number considered high by many standards. Due to the high cost of maintenance, the federal government has been seeking options for privatization of the facility. Through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Government of Nigeria intends to grant a concession to a sole Concessionaire who will enter into an investment commitment, and essentially operate the stadium with a primary goal of generating revenue from the proceeds of sporting events, concerts, religious activities, corporate sponsorship, corporate advertising and other promotional activities. The Concessionaire has the choice of assuming the role of Facility Manager for the property encompassed in the National Stadium and the Indoor Sports Complex, or employ a firm to perform the task. The BPE will act as the monitor in the arrangement, and the Concessionaire will report to the federal government through the BPE. A minimum tenure of 20 years was recommended, subject to review every five years. Maintenance of the Stadium and its external areas will be the responsibility of the Concessionaire. Change of Name On June 12 2019 President Muhammadu Buhari renamed the national stadium in Abuja after the winner of the 1993 presidential election, Moshood Abiola. It is widely believed that Mr Abiola won the June 1993 presidential election based on available results, but the election was cancelled by the military government of Ibrahim Babangida. President Buhari in 2018 recognised Mr Abiola‚Äôs mandate by conferring on him the country‚Äôs highest national honour of the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic, reserved only for presidents. While President Muhammadu Buhari was delivering his speech at the change of name event, which also marked Nigeria‚Äôs 20th year of uninterrupted democracy, President Buhari said ‚ÄúHenceforth it will be called the Moshood Abiola National Stadium\\". The event at the Eagles Square was attended by other foreign leaders, including the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame.

The lake was originally built as the main water source for the Rochdale Canal, but developed as a tourist resort from the 1860s, and became known as the Weighver's Seaport. Hotels were built around it, at least two of which had outdoor dancing stages with gas lighting. Tourism was helped by the arrival of the railway in 1839, which brought day-trippers and weekend visitors from Manchester, Bradford and Leeds. The popularity of the lake as a resort declined in the early twentieth century, and the area was used as an army camp during the First World War. The canal company sold the reservoir, with seven others, to the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations for water supply in 1923, by which time the canal was in terminal decline. After the Second World War, boating rights were bought by Rochdale Council, who developed the area into the Hollingworth Lake Country Park in 1974. There has been a steady increase in facilities since, and it is now a thriving centre for water sports and other activities. The lake was used for training by Captain Matthew Webb, before he became the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, and was used for the \\"World Professional Mile Championship\\", a long-distance swimming event, in the 1880s. It is home to the Hollingworth Lake Rowing Club, which has been in continuous existence since 1872. History In 1794, an Act of Parliament sanctioned the construction of the Rochdale Canal. Hollingworth Lake with its three earth dams was a main feeder source completed in 1800, four years before the canal. The lake covers an area of and the path around it originally measured . In places the lake was deep, with the average depth being about . When first constructed, it was capable of holding 400 million gallons (1,800 Ml) of water. The site was not a natural choice for a reservoir, as there was no natural hollow and plans exist which indicate the reservoir could have been built in the Ealees Valley which did. Consequently, three large earth embankments were built to enclose the reservoir. The main embankment, Hollingworth Bank, is approximately high and about in length. Fens Bank is high and long while Shaw Moss Bank is high and long. The lake surface is about above sea level,Google earth. A steam engine was installed to lift water into a channel which fed it into the summit pound at Chelburn. The pumping engine was demolished around 1910. Local mill owners feared the canal would take water from the rivers and streams that powered their mills, and succeeded in defeating the first two attempts to obtain an act to authorise building the canal. The third attempt succeeded, largely because the canal company alleviated the millowners' concerns, and the Act contained conditions on the siting of reservoirs, so they would not interfere with water supplies to the River Roch, River Irk or River Medlock. The lake, or \\"The Lodge\\" when first built, benefitted some millowners by supplying water to mills close to the canal and on the new low-level road from Todmorden to Littleborough. Houses were built for railway workers, reservoir workers, and workers in the new factories and cotton mills. The Lodge became known as The Lake, and became a popular place to walk. By the 1920s, the Rochdale Canal was in serious decline, and in 1923 the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations Water Act authorised the sale of Hollingworth Lake and seven other reservoirs in the vicinity to the local authorities for use as a public water supply. The company received ¬£396,667, from which it paid ¬£98,334 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company in compensation for the loss of the water supplied by the Rochdale company, who retained the water rights to certain local streams, and could draw on the reservoirs under certain exceptional circumstances. A major programme of civil engineering work to strengthen and reshape the earth dams was carried out in 1985. The outlet from the reservoir was rebuilt, and the level of the overflow was reduced. The work cost ¬£2.5 million, and resulted in the lake being closed for leisure activities for almost a year. A ten-year statutory inspection of the reservoir in 2011 identified the need to improve the outflow arrangement so that water levels could be lowered more quickly in an emergency or after heavy rainfall. The ¬£1.25 million project included a concrete tower, with equipment on top raising its height by but concerns expressed by the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and local councillors resulted in a tower half the height of the original design and clad in stone to fit in with the surroundings. The four-month project began in autumn 2011 and the water level was reduced by while the work was in progress, but the lake remained open for watersports. United Utilities is responsible for the maintenance of the reservoir whose main function is to supply water to the Rochdale Canal and has never been used to provide drinking water for the public supply network. Tourist resort The Promenade at Hollingworth Lake The area developed rapidly after the arrival of the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1839, and the construction of Summit Tunnel in 1841, the longest railway tunnel in Europe at that time. In the 1850s, Henry Newall of Harehill, owner of Harehill Woollen Mill and a recently built gasworks, and his engineer, Mr. Sladen, later the landlord of the Mermaid Inn, saw the potential of the lake as a tourist attraction. They leased the lake from the canal company and created novelty amusements and facilities for boating. Despite very cold water and strong undercurrents caused by water entering and leaving the lake, small rowing boats became popular, and two paddle steamers were operated from 1856. By 1860, there was a rowing club, and a regatta was held in 1862. Two hotels, the Beach Hotel and the Lake Hotel and Gardens, catered for day trippers and weekend visitors. The facilities were advertised by the railway companies, who transported visitors to Smithybridge and Littleborough stations, for the short walk to the lake and its facilities. The resort became known as the Weighver's Seaport, and Davenport's \\"Guide to Hollingworth Lake\\", published from 1860 onwards, extolled its virtues in typical Victorian fashion. .. As you step on the embankment, which is considerable and scarcely looks artificial, the broad expanse of water at once presents itself to your vision. Your first feeling on beholding it is that of astonishment that so vast a basin, lying in that cup of hills, should not have become known to you before. ... You will see Blackstone Edge to the east, towering above its fellows, and preaching from its rocky pulpit sermons to the solitude around.Davenport's Guide, quoted in There were two hotels in the area before the reservoir was built, the Fisherman's Inn, developed from farm buildings at Littleborough, and the Blue Ball at Smithy Bridge, which was demolished and rebuilt in the 1970s. The Beach Hotel built at the start of development had accommodation and refreshment rooms, as well as outdoor platforms illuminated by gaslight which were used for picnic parties and dancing. The Lake Hotel and Pleasure Grounds, to which visitors could walk, travel by carriage around the eastern shore, or cross the lake by steamer, was built in the Swiss style on the opposite side of the lake. The company maintained a booking office at the ferry terminal which was connected to the hotel by a \\"Subaqueous Telegraph cable\\", laid on the lake bed. Its grounds were designed by Mr Henderson of Birkenhead, and had a bowling green, a croquet lawn, shrubberies and rustic arbours. Refreshments were served in a small building by the water's edge built for the boat club in 1860. Only the foundations of the hotel remain. The Mermaid Inn had a 1777 date stone but this was not thought to be original. It closed in 1911. The Lodge Inn at Rakewood provided accommodation and food, and stabling for horses, as did the other hotels. It opened in 1826 and closed in 1917, and became two houses. Peanock Farm, on the south side of the lake, was rebuilt as the Queens Hotel in 1857, and had \\"a spacious pavilion and dancing stage in the grounds.\\" It has reverted to being a farm. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Hotel, built in 1876, had an outdoor dancing platform covering . When it was demolished, the stone was reused to construct several houses. Now a private house, the Star Inn was in Littleborough near the Fishermans Inn and close to both stations were hotels called the Railway. Smithy Bridge had a beer house called the Royal Oak, and there were unlicensed refreshment rooms around the lake. Many private houses supplied \\"tea in jugs and sandwiches\\". The resort catered for 6,000 miners, who arrived at the lake on 13 August 1866 for a conference. In November 1865, Mr Newhall was notified of \\"the immoralities which it is stated take place in connection with the dancing stages at Hollingworth.\\" Two months later he replied that if such immoralities were taking place, they were certainly not doing so on any part of the reservoir or land which he was leasing from the canal company. At the height of its popularity in the late 19th century, there were three lake steamers, and visitors arrived by trains from Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The rowing club folded after a few years, and the clubhouse was used by the Lake Hotel for refreshments but the club reformed in 1872 and is still active. Fishing developed after 30,000 fish, mostly bream, dace and perch were introduced in 1863. A variety of stalls and lock-up shops, many close to the landing stage for the ferry, were soon trading in sweets, snacks and souvenirs, and on special holidays, there were fortune tellers, conjurers and tricksters. Although photography was in its infancy there were six businesses listed in Davenport's Guide as taking photographic portraits of visitors. Other attractions included a camera obscura, a stereoscopic exhibition, and a gymnasium, which was attached to the Beach Hotel. A roundabout with galloping horses, powered successively by a hand winch, a steam engine, a gas engine and finally electricity, remained at the lake until after the Second World War. The lake's surface froze to a sufficient thickness to allow activities on the ice in 1860 and 1864, when over 2,000 people were recorded as skating. Teams from Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester used the lake for curling matches, and local teams even played cricket. Cricket was played in 1871, and in the 20th century the lake froze in 1902, 1907, 1924, 1929, 1941 and 1947. The lake almost dried up in 1934, when the water level dropped so low that stone farm buildings which had not been seen since 1800 became visible. The fortunes of the resort improved in 1883, after a law was passed allowing boats to operate on Sundays. Huge crowds flocked to the lake, although a claim of 40,000 visitors on one occasion may be an exaggeration. Swimming became popular, despite the cold water, perhaps inspired by Captain Matthew Webb, who used the lake for training before becoming the first man to swim the English Channel from Dover to Calais in 1875. He competed against G A Jennings of Tunbridge Wells in a 5-hour endurance swim in 1881. Regular swimming competitions were held from 1882, including the mile championship. The distance was covered in 26 minutes 8 seconds by a local man named Joseph Nuttall when he swam against McCusker from the United States, in the \\"World Professional Mile Championship\\", allegedly watched by a crowd of 20,000. =Decline= By the beginning of the 20th century, travel was easier, people took longer holidays, and the lake's attraction started to diminish. Some hotels closed and the Beach Hotel burned down in 1901 although it was rebuilt. The stunts and shows stopped and by the start of the First World War the lake was in decline. There was an upsurge in activity when a training camp for the Manchester Regiment was set up in the Ealees Valley and the hotels and local houses accommodated wives and visitors. Most soldiers from the camp were sent to the Dardanelles, but few returned as many were killed on the beaches when they tried to land. After that war, the rowing club developed and the lake was used for sailing. Day visitors could hire rowing or motor boats, but only the Fisherman's Inn and the Beach Hotel remained open. =Revival= In 1950, the boating rights which had been held by the Water Board since 1923 were taken over by Rochdale Council, who also planned to turn the area into a country park in 1974. Ten years later, it was in a list of the top ten country parks in England. It is now used for recreation and includes a wildlife sanctuary. Currently there are two public houses by the lake, the Beach Hotel and the Wine Press, which was formerly the Fisherman's Inn. Activities Hollingworth Lake boatyard The lake supports watersports like sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, swimming, rafting, rowing and fishing. Since 1989, Hollingworth Lake Water Activity Centre has offered tuition in outdoor activities, including kayaking, canoeing, power boating and sailing. In summer, visitors can hire rowing boats. The centre used to operate a launch The Lady Alice at weekends during the summer months to provide trips around the lake, but the boat has been out of service since 2009 as it required a major refit. A new pleasure boat, The Lady Katherine was launched in May 2019. The scenic walk, around the lake, passes a nature reserve with a bird hide in the south-western corner of the lake, in an area from which boats and watersports are excluded. The lake provides habitat for a variety of wildlife and is used for fishing. The variety of fish has been expanded by stocking the lake with carp, tench and roach, in addition to those introduced in 1863. The country park is used for activities for children, who catch various types of pond life. The path around the lake is a gravel track from the Beach Hotel to the far side of the Lake, and then follows Rakewood Road and Hollingworth Road. A children's playground and trim trail for adults known as the Woodland Enviro Gym situated where the path joins Rakewood Road, was opened on 7 August 2010. The facility was funded by the Big Lottery Community Spaces fund, and was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake, a group working to improve the facilities, which was set up as an informal society in November 2007, but was registered as a private company limited by guarantee in May 2010 to enable it to handle grant applications. Lake users have included: * Hollingworth Lake Rowing Club, whose yearly regatta has attracted many other clubs since it was first held in 1964. The club was re-formed in 1872 after its initial demise. * Hollingworth Lake Sailing Club, which was founded in 1946, offers open handicap racing and social sailing in a variety of different class of dinghy sailing. * The Sea Cadets training centre \\"T.S. Palatine\\", located on the south side of the lake, was opened on 16 May 1960 by Lord Derby, and offered training in rowing, sculling and seamanship. Despite providing training for around 1,500 young people each year, the Sea Cadets took the decision to close the centre from 30 April 2011, as the organisation would be better served in the north west of England by the new Crosby Lakeside Adventure Centre. To the east, a visitor centre shows children's artwork and objects found in the lake. The annual Easter fun fair runs from the Thursday before Easter until the following Sunday, on a car park by the lake. Transport The lake and its surroundings are served by the Smithy Bridge and Littleborough railway stations,Ordnance Survey, 1:50,000 map which link west to Rochdale, Oldham and Manchester, and east to West Yorkshire. Smithy Bridge station stands beside a barrier-operated level crossing. Hollingworth Lake is served by buses from Rochdale including the 455 (Rochdale, Smallbridge, Hollingworth Lake and Littleborough), and the 456 (Rochdale, Wardle and Hollingworth Lake). It is easily accessible by road from junction 21 of the M62 motorway (via the A640 and B6225 roads) and has three pay and display car parks.

Methods Endovenous laser treatment treats varicose veins using an optical fiber that is inserted into the vein to be treated, and laser light, normally in the infrared portion of the spectrum, shines into the interior of the vein. This causes the vein to contract, and the optical fiber is slowly withdrawn. Some minor complications can occur, including thrombophlebitis, pain, hematoma, edema and infection, which can lead to cellulitis. EVLT has the same meaning as ELT, but it is a trademark name owned by Diomed and used as the name for their 910 nm laser treatment unit for ELT. The 810 nm laser is the original laser fiber wavelength as pioneered by Dr. Robert Min of New York, USA. Subsequently, various other fibers with different wavelengths have become available. The varying wavelength each aim to maximize local damage to a component of the varicose vein or the blood contained in it while minimizing damage to adjacent tissues. During the procedure, a catheter bearing a laser fiber is inserted under ultrasound guidance into the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) through a small puncture. The catheter is then advanced, also under ultrasound guidance, to the level of the groin or knee crease. Dilute local anesthesia is injected around and along the vein (perivascular infiltration) using ultrasound imaging to place the local anesthetic solution around the vein, mostly in a sub-facial location. This technique derives from the tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) method long used and proven safe and effective for some methods of liposuction. The laser is activated whilst the catheter or laser fiber is slowly withdrawn, resulting in obliteration of the saphenous vein along its entire length. The treatment, which is performed without sedation, usually takes between 1 and two hours, and the patient walks out under his or her own power. The leg is bandaged and/or placed in a stocking that the patient wears for up to three weeks afterwards. Foam sclerotherapy or ambulatory phlebectomy is often performed at the time of the procedure or within the first 1‚Äì2 weeks to treat branch varicose veins. However, some physicians do not perform these procedures at the time of the ELT because the varicose veins can improve on their own as a result of reduced reflux from the great saphenous vein. Complications Complications of endovenous laser treatment can be categorized as minor, or serious. Minor complications include bruising (51%), hematoma (2.3%), temporary numbness (3.8%), phlebitis (7.4%), induration (46.7%), and a sensation of tightness (24.8%). More serious complications include skin burns (0.5%), deep venous thrombosis (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.1%), and nerve injury (0.8%). These rates of complications are derived from the Australian MSAC review of all available literature on the procedure. Retinal damage is a serious but very rare complication (<1%) that can occur during the use of lasers. If the fiber breaks or if the laser is activated when the laser is outside of the body, reflected laser light may cause a focal permanent retinal deficit or \\"blind spot\\" or scotoma. The nominal hazard zone (NHZ) or space within which the level of direct, scattered, or reflected laser radiation exceeds the maximum permissible exposure (MPE), varies by the wavelength of the laser and is shorter (17 inches) with the newer 1470 nm laser. Use of appropriate protective eyeware specific to the wavelength laser being used prevents accidental injury. Clinical evaluations A 2005 report from one practice, summarising results of 1,000 limbs treated over a 5-year period with EVLT showed that 98% of the treated vessels at up to 60 months follow-up remained closed, with complications and side effects such as temporary parasthesia and DVTs below 0.5%. The Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in 2008 has determined that endovenous laser treatment for varicose veins \\"appears to be more effective in the short term, and at least as effective overall, as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins.\\" It also found in its assessment of available literature, that \\"occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT, nerve injury and paresthesia, post-operative infections and hematomas, appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT\\". A study of 516 treated veins over 69 months by Elmore and Lackey reported a success rate of 98.1%. Endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) by radiofrequency or laser is a safe and effective treatment of refluxing great saphenous veins (GSVs) and has replaced traditional high ligation and stripping in official recommendations of various leading Vascular Societies in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Postoperative instructions  Patients are usually fitted with Class 2 graduated compression stockings and/or bandages for up to 3 weeks. Duplex ultrasound is used during follow-up to assess the success of treatment and if there is a need for additional sclerotherapy or phlebectomy of branch veins.

This serial introduced Kamelion, voiced by Gerald Flood, as a companion. The serial is set in an English castle in 1215. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Master (Anthony Ainley) uses the robot Kamelion to imitate King John of England as part of the Master's plot to have the real King John overthrown and thus preventing the signing of Magna Carta. Plot In 1215, the Court of King John of England is at the castle of Sir Ranulf Fitzwilliam to extort more taxes, and when the lord refuses to pay the King insults him. To defend his honour his son Hugh takes on the King‚Äôs champion, Sir Gilles Estram, in a joust. The latter wins easily, though the joust is disturbed by the arrival of the TARDIS. The Fifth Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough are greeted as demons and welcomed by the King. Having established the date, the Doctor concludes the King is not himself ‚Äì in fact, he is not the King at all, as he is actually in London taking the Crusader‚Äôs Oath. Sir Geoffrey de Lacy, the cousin of Sir Ranulf, arrives at the castle and confirms he knows the King is in London. Sir Gilles is about to torture him as a liar during a royal banquet when the Doctor intervenes. It seems the King's champion is not who he claims to be, either: Sir Gilles sheds his disguise and reveals himself to be the Doctor‚Äôs nemesis, the Master. He flees in his own TARDIS, which had been disguised as an iron maiden. The King knights the Doctor as his new champion, and he is given run of the castle. After a series of mishaps, including the death of Sir Geoffrey at the Master‚Äôs hands, the Doctor confronts the King and the Master and discovers the truth. The monarch is really Kamelion, a war weapon found by the Master on Xeriphas, which can be mentally controlled and used to adopt disguises and personas. Disguised as King John, the Master intends that Kamelion will behave so appallingly so as to provoke a rebellion and topple the real King from his throne, thus robbing the world of Magna Carta, the foundation of parliamentary democracy. It is a small plan on the Master‚Äôs usual scale, but nevertheless particularly poisonous to the normal progress of Earth society. The Doctor resolves the situation by testing the Master in a battle of wills for control over Kamelion. He takes control of the robot and steals it away in the TARDIS, thus foiling the Master‚Äôs scheme. Kamelion reverts to its robot form and thanks the Doctor for his assistance and rescue. Production The story was repeated on BBC1 on consecutive Fridays 6‚Äì13 July 1984, achieving viewing figures of 3.3 and 5.0 million respectively. The working titles for this story were The Android, The Demons, A Knight's Tale and Demons Keeper. Part One of this story was billed by the BBC as the six hundredth episode of Doctor Who. This story marked the first appearance of Kamelion as voiced by Gerald Flood. Freelance effects designer Richard Gregory and software designer Mike Power gave a demonstration of the robot prototype for Nathan-Turner and Saward. Nathan-Turner was so impressed he commissioned scriptwriter Terence Dudley to develop a storyline to introduce Kamelion into the series. Shortly after filming, however, Power died in a boating accident and no one was able to continue his work. Subsequently, Kamelion made only two appearances before being written out of the series. In the story, the Master disguises himself as Sir Gilles Estram, Estram being an anagram of \\"Master\\". To hide Ainley's return, Sir Gilles was credited in the Radio Times as having been played by \\"James Stoker\\", an anagram of \\"Master's Joke\\". This story marks the last appearance of the TARDIS console room set, which had been in use since The Invisible Enemy. A new console room would debut in the next story, The Five Doctors, although the console itself would be reused as the Second Doctor's console in The Two Doctors. Commercial releasesIn print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terence Dudley, was published by Target Books in February 1986. =Home media= The King's Demons was released on VHS in November 1995 in a box set along with a special edition of the subsequent serial The Five Doctors and a postcard book.

It is one of the compounds that may be responsible for proposed biological and pharmacological effects of coffee.

Cafestol is present in highest quantity in unfiltered coffee drinks such as French press coffee or Turkish coffee/Greek coffee. In filtered coffee drinks such as drip brewed coffee, it is present in only negligible amounts, as the paper filter in drip filtered coffee retains the diterpenes.  Research into biological activity  Coffee consumption has been associated with a number of effects on health and cafestol has been proposed to produce these through a number of biological actions. Studies have shown that regular consumption of boiled coffee increases serum cholesterol whereas filtered coffee does not. Cafestol may act as an agonist ligand for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor, blocking cholesterol homeostasis. Thus cafestol can increase cholesterol synthesis.

It does not provide any benefit beyond that of sugar pills. It is a popular preparation, particularly in France and Russia. Oscillococcinum is promoted according to the disproven homeopathic principle that \\"like cures like\\" and that a disease can be cured by small amounts of the substance that cause similar symptoms. Boiron is its sole manufacturer. Oscillococcinum is used in more than 50 countries and has been in production for over 65 years. Oscillococcinum was originally proposed by the French physician Joseph Roy, based on his misidentification of a supposed oscillating bacterium he named oscillococcus in victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917‚Äì1918. Roy said he had seen the same bacterium in cancer sufferers, and proposed a homeopathic preparation (which he claimed to have isolated in a duck) as a remedy for the Spanish flu. The microbes Roy said he saw have never been independently observed by any other researcher. In addition, it is now known that influenza is caused by a virus and not a bacterium. The preparation is derived from duck liver and heart, diluted to 200C‚Äîa ratio of one part duck offal to 10400 parts water. Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an \\"imprint\\" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo. NCCAM Publication No. D183  Origin and history  The word \\"Oscillococcinum\\" was coined by the French physician Joseph Roy (1891‚Äì1978) in his 1925 book Towards Knowledge and the Cure of Cancer. Roy wrote that while on military duty during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917 he had observed an oscillating bacterium in the blood of flu victims, which he named Oscillococcus. Roy subsequently claimed to have observed the microbe in the blood of patients that had viral diseases like herpes, chicken pox, and shingles. He thought it to be the causative agent of diseases as varied as eczema, rheumatism, tuberculosis, measles, and cancer. Roy searched for the \\"bacterium\\" in several animals until he felt that he had found it on the liver of a Long Island duckling. Believing he had also detected it in the blood of cancer patients, he tried a vaccine-like therapy on them, which was unsuccessful. The microbe has never been independently observed by another researcher, and it remains unclear what, if anything, Roy actually saw. Moreover, medical science has since disproved Roy's \\"universal germ\\" theory: rheumatism, for example, is not caused by bacteria, and measles is caused by a virus far too small for Roy to have observed in his optical microscope. The modern preparation is created from the heart and liver of Muscovy duck (see the preparation section for the details). In France, the selling of all products manufactured according to the Korsakovian principle of dilution was forbidden until 1992, with the exception of Oscillo, thanks to a special measure made for it. , Oscillococcinum was one of the top ten selling drugs in France, was publicised widely in the media, and was being prescribed for both flu and the common cold. As of 2008 it sells US$15 million per year in the U.S., and it also sells widely in Europe.  Preparation  The ingredients of a one-gram tube of Oscillococcinum are listed as follows: * Active ingredient: Anas Barbariae Hepatis et Cordis Extractum (extract of Muscovy duck liver and heart) 200CK HPUS which is much less than the mass of a proton (). * Inactive ingredient: sucrose, lactose (100% sugar.) The 200CK indicates that the preparation entails a series of 200 dilutions of the starting ingredient, an extract from the heart and liver of a Muscovy duck. Each step entails a 1:100 dilution, where the first mixture contains 1% of the extract, the second contains 1% of the first mixture, etc. The K indicates that it is prepared by the Korsakovian method, in which rather than 1% of the preparation being measured out at each stage and then diluted, a single vessel is repeatedly emptied, refilled, and vigorously shaken (in homeopathic terminology \\"succussed\\"), and it is assumed that 1% remains in the vessel each time. The 200C dilution is so extreme that the final pill contains none of the original material. Oscillococcinum is generally considered harmless. When Boiron (the company that makes oscillococcinum) spokeswoman Gina Casey was asked if a product made from the heart and liver of a duck was safe, she replied: \\"Of course it is safe. There's nothing in it.\\"Dan McGraw. Flu Symptoms? Try Duck. U.S. News & World Report 2/9/97 page 2  Efficacy  There is no compelling scientific evidence that Oscillococcinum has any effect beyond placebo. None of its active ingredient is present in a dose of the final product, nor is there any credible evidence that duck liver is effective in relieving (or causing) flu symptoms in the first place. Homeopaths claim the diluted molecules leave an \\"imprint\\" in the remedy, but there is no known mechanism for how this could occur.(page numbering given from online version) Homeopathy as a whole is widely considered to be pseudoscience. As Robert L. Park, a critic of alternative medicine, explains, some of the characteristics of flu may suggest that Oscillococcinum works. Since the flu normally goes away on its own in a variable number of days, the natural course of the disease is a potential source of error in assessing the efficacy of any intervention: if one takes any medication, and then one's flu goes away, there is a tendency to attribute this to the medication even though the infection would have resolved anyway, which is an example of the informal fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc. Someone who gets over a mild strain of flu may attribute the mildness to the efficacy of the homeopathic preparation and not to the fact that it was a mild strain, and might recommend it to other people, spreading its popularity. Also, the most likely explanation for its effectiveness with flu symptoms is that patients are misdiagnosing the symptoms of several rhinovirus diseases or of allergies to several hundred substances, and attributing them to a flu infection that they do not have. A 2005 review of flu treatments (vaccine, medicine, homeopathy) has concluded that the popularity of Oscillococcinum in France was unsupported by any evidence of efficacy. In a 2007 review, the effectiveness of non-mainstream remedies against seasonal flu could not be established beyond reasonable doubt, and the evidence is found to be sparse and limited by \\"small sample sizes, low methodological quality, or clinically irrelevant effect sizes\\", and that the results strengthen using conventional approaches for flu. A Cochrane review published in December 2015 found that there was insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about whether Oscillococcinum is useful for influenza.  Lawsuits and criticisms  The non-profit educational organizations Center for Inquiry (CFI) and the associated Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) have petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), criticizing Boiron for misleading labeling and advertising of Oscillococcinum. \\"One petition complains that Boiron‚Äôs packaging for Oscillococcinum lists the alleged active ingredient ‚Äì duck liver and heart ‚Äì in Latin only. Another petition complains that Boiron‚Äôs web ad for this product implies that it has received FDA approval.\\" Ronald Lindsay, CFI and CSI president and chief executive officer, contends, \\"If Boiron is going to sell snake oil, the least they can do is use English on their labels.‚Äù A class action lawsuit was filed against Boiron on behalf of \\"all California residents who purchased Oscillo at any time within the past four years.\\" The lawsuit charges that Boiron \\"falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu because it contains an active ingredient it claims is proven to get rid of flu symptoms in 48 hours.\\" The lawsuit also states that the listed active ingredient in Oscillococcinum (Oscillo) \\"is actually Muscovy Duck Liver and Heart ... and has no known medicinal quality.\\" A settlement was reached, with Boiron denying any wrongdoing and agreeing to make several changes to its marketing of the product. These changes include adding to their packaging notices like \\"These ‚ÄòUses‚Äô have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration\\" and \\"C, K, CK, and X are homeopathic dilutions.\\" Since 2011, at least two class action lawsuits on behalf of customers who purchased Oscillococcinum have been filed against Boiron in the United States, alleging that Boiron falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu. A proposed settlement was reached in August 2012. While the settlement was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by one class member who opposed the settlement, on February 24, 2015 the Ninth Circuit issued a decision upholding approval of the class action settlement. Boiron's legal threats against Samuele Riva for writing criticisms on his website were rebuffed by his web hosting company, and the debacle was described as producing a Streisand effect against Boiron.The Web‚Äôs Backstroke. \\"In a classic case of \\"harm set, harm get\\", a French homeopathy giant earns public condemnation after threatening a private critic with legal action.\\" Lab Times, May 2011  References  External links  * The True Story of Oscillococcinum, homeowatch.org * Flu Symptoms?

With the molecular formula Au2Cl6, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl3. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl4, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as \\"gold chloride\\" or \\"acid gold trichloride\\". Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 ¬∞C or in light. Structure AuCl3 exists as a chloride-bridged dimer both as a solid and as a vapour, at least at low temperatures. Gold(III) bromide behaves analogously. The structure is similar to that of iodine(III) chloride. In gold(III) chloride, each gold center is square planar, which is typical of a metal complex with a d8 electron count. The bonding in AuCl3 is considered somewhat covalent. Preparation Gold(III) chloride is most often prepared by passing chlorine gas over gold powder at 180 ¬∞C: :2 Au + 3 Cl2 ‚Üí Au2Cl6 Another method of preparation is by reacting Au3+ species with chloride to produce tetrachloroaurate. Its acid, chloroauric acid, is then heated to eliminate hydrogen chloride gas.

It may be reduced by causing elemental gold to be precipitated from solution. Anhydrous AuCl3 begins to decompose to AuCl at around 160 ¬∞C; however, this in turn undergoes disproportionation at higher temperatures to give gold metal and AuCl3. :AuCl3 ‚Üí AuCl + Cl2 (>160 ¬∞C) :3 AuCl ‚Üí AuCl3 \\\\+ 2 Au (>420 ¬∞C) AuCl3 is Lewis acidic and readily forms complexes. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form chloroauric acid (): :HCl + (aq) ‚Üí + Other chloride sources, such as KCl, also convert AuCl3 into . Aqueous solutions of AuCl3 react with aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide to form a precipitate of Au(OH)3, which will dissolve in excess NaOH to form sodium aurate (NaAuO2). If gently heated, Au(OH)3 decomposes to gold(III) oxide, Au2O3, and then to gold metal.N. N. Greenwood, A.

For example, reaction with potassium cyanide produces the water-soluble complex, K[Au(CN)4]: : + 4 KCN ‚Üí + 3 KCl Applications in organic synthesis AuCl3 has attracted the interest of organic chemists as a mild acid catalyst for a variety of reactions,G. Dyker, An Eldorado for Homogeneous Catalysis?, in Organic Synthesis Highlights V, H.-G. Schmaltz, T.

Gold(III) salts, especially Na[AuCl4] (prepared from AuCl3 \\\\+ NaCl), provide an alternative to mercury(II) salts as catalysts for reactions involving alkynes. An illustrative reaction is the hydration of terminal alkynes to produce acetyl compounds. :300px Some alkynes undergo amination in the presence of gold(III) catalysts. Gold catalyses the alkylation of certain aromatic rings and a conversion of furans to phenols. For example, a mixture of acetonitrile and gold(III) chloride catalyses the alkylation of 2-methylfuran by methyl vinyl ketone at the 5-position: :450px The efficiency of this organogold reaction is noteworthy because both the furan and the ketone are sensitive to side-reactions such as polymerisation under acidic conditions. In some cases where alkynes are present, phenols sometimes form (Ts=tosyl): :400px This reaction involves a rearrangement that gives a new aromatic ring.

Metadata describes all classes and class members that are defined in the assembly, and the classes and class members that the current assembly will call from another assembly. The metadata for a method contains the complete description of the method, including the class (and the assembly that contains the class), the return type and all of the method parameters. A CLI language compiler will generate the metadata and store this in the assembly containing the CIL. When the run- time executes CIL it will check to make sure that the metadata of the called method is the same as the metadata that is stored in the calling method. This ensures that a method can only be called with exactly the right number of parameters and exactly the right parameter types. The Windows Runtime application platform, present in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, makes use of the CLI metadata format to describe component interfaces for code written in any of the supported programming languages. A difference in use within the Common Language Runtime is that an assembly typically does not contain any CIL instructions. Attributes Developers can add metadata to their code through attributes. There are two types of attributes, custom and pseudo custom attributes, and to the developer these have the same syntax. Attributes in code are messages to the compiler to generate metadata. In CIL, metadata such as inheritance modifiers, scope modifiers, and almost anything that isn't either opcodes or streams, are also referred to as attributes. A custom attribute is a regular class that inherits from the \`Attribute\` class. A custom attribute can be used on any method, property, class or entire assembly with the syntax: \`[AttributeName(optional parameter, optional name=value pairs)]\` as in: [Custom] [Custom(1)] [Custom(1, Comment=\\"yes\\")] Custom attributes are used by CLI extensively. Windows Communication Framework uses attributes to define service contracts, ASP.NET uses these to expose methods as web services, LINQ to SQL uses them to define the mapping of classes to the underlying relational schema, Visual Studio uses them to group together properties of an object, the class developer indicates the category for the object's class by applying the \`[Category]\` custom attribute. Custom attributes are interpreted by application code and not the CLR. When the compiler sees a custom attribute it will generate custom metadata that is not recognised by the CLR. The developer has to provide code to read the metadata and act on it. As an example, the attribute shown in the example can be handled by the code: class CustomAttribute : Attribute { private int paramNumber = 0; private string comment = \\"\\"; public CustomAttribute() public CustomAttribute(int num) { paramNumber = num; } public String Comment { set { comment = value; } } } The name of the class is mapped to the attribute name. The Visual C# compiler automatically adds the string \\"\`Attribute\`\\" at the end of any attribute name. Consequently, every attribute class name should end with this string, but it is legal to define an attribute without the \`Attribute\`-suffix. When affixing an attribute to an item, the compiler will look for both the literal name and the name with \`Attribute\` added to the end, i. e. if you were to write \`[Custom]\` the compiler would look for both \`Custom\` and \`CustomAttribute\`. If both exist, the compiler fails. The attribute can be prefixed with \\"\`@\`\\" if you don't want to risk ambiguity, so writing \`[@Custom]\` will not match \`CustomAttribute\`. Using the attribute invokes the constructor of the class. Overloaded constructors are supported. Name-Value pairs are mapped to properties, the name denotes the name of the property and the value supplied is set by the property. Sometimes there is ambiguity concerning to what you are affixing the attribute. Consider the following code: [Orange] public int ExampleMethod(string input) { //method body goes here } What has been marked as orange? Is it the \`ExampleMethod\`, its return value, or perhaps the entire assembly? In this case, the compiler will default, and treat the attribute as being affixed to the method. If this is not what was intended, or if the author wishes to clarify their code, an attribute target may be specified. Writing \`[return: Orange]\` will mark the return value as orange, \`[assembly: Orange]\` will mark the entire assembly. The valid targets are \`assembly\`, \`field\`, \`event\`, \`method\`, \`module\`, \`param\`, \`property\`, \`return\` and \`type\`. A pseudo-custom attribute is used just like regular custom attributes but they do not have a custom handler; rather the compiler has intrinsic awareness of the attributes and handles the code marked with such attributes differently. Attributes such as \`Serializable\` and \`Obsolete\` are implemented as pseudo-custom attributes. Pseudo-custom attributes should never be used by ILAsm, as it has adequate syntax to describe the metadata. Metadata storage Assemblies contain tables of metadata. These tables are described by the CIL specification. The metadata tables will have zero or more entries and the position of an entry determines its index. When CIL code uses metadata it does so through a metadata token. This is a 32-bit value where the top 8 bits identify the appropriate metadata table, and the remaining 24 bits give the index of the metadata in the table. The Framework SDK contains a sample called that will list the metadata tables in an assembly, however, this information is rarely of use to a developer. Metadata in an assembly may be viewed using the ILDASM tool provided by the .NET Framework SDK. In the CIL standard, metadata is defined in ILAsm (assembly language) form, an on-disk representation form for storage, and a form that is embedded into assemblies of the Portable Executable (PE, .exe or .dll) format. The PE form is based on the on-disk form.  Reflection  Reflection is the API used to read CLI metadata. The reflection API provides a logical view of metadata rather than the literal view provided by tools like metainfo. Reflection in version 1.1 of the .NET framework can be used to inspect the descriptions of classes and their members, and invoke methods. However, it does not allow runtime access to the CIL for a method. Version 2.0 of the framework allows the CIL for a method to be obtained.  Other metadata tools  Besides the namespace, other tools are also available that can be used to handle metadata.

(2003). The World of Juba II and Kleopatra Selene: Royal Scholarship on Rome's African Frontier. New York: Routledge. , p. 256 the numeration is modern) was a Ptolemaic princess and Queen of Mauretania. She was the most important royal woman in the early Augustan age. Cleopatra Selene was the only daughter of Greek Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. In the Donations of Antioch and of Alexandria, she was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya.Roller, pp. 76‚Äì81 After Antony and Cleopatra's defeat at Actium and their suicides in Egypt in 30 BC, Selene and her brothers were brought to Rome and placed in the household of Octavian's sister, Octavia the Younger, a former wife of her father. Selene eventually married Juba II of Numidia and Mauretania. She had great influence in Mauretania's government decisions, especially regarding trade and construction projects. During their reign, the country became extremely wealthy. The couple had a son and successor, Ptolemy of Mauretania. Through their granddaughter Drusilla, the Ptolemaic line intermarried into Roman nobility for many generations. Early lifeChildhood= Cleopatra Selene was born in approximately 40 BC in Egypt, as Pharaoh Cleopatra VII's only daughter. Her second name (\\"moon\\" in ancient Greek) opposes the second name of her twin brother, Alexander Helios (\\"sun\\" in Ancient Greek). She was raised and highly educated in Alexandria in a manner appropriate for a princess. The twins were formally acknowledged by their father, Triumvir Mark Antony, during a political meeting with their mother in 37 BC. Their younger brother, Ptolemy Philadelphos, was born a year later. Their mother most likely planned for Selene to marry her older half- brother Caesarion, possibly the only biological son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Over the next two years, Antony bestowed a great deal of land on Cleopatra and their children under his triumviral authority. In 34 BC, during the Donations of Alexandria, huge crowds assembled to witness the couple sit on golden thrones on a silver platform with Caesarion, Cleopatra Selene, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus sitting on smaller ones below them. Antony declared Cleopatra to be Queen of Kings, Caesarion to be the true son of Julius Caesar and King of Egypt, and proceeded to bestow kingdoms of their own upon Selene and her brothers. She was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya. Neither of the children were old enough to assume control of their lands, but it was clear that their parents intended they should do so in the future. This event, along with Antony's marriage to Cleopatra and divorce of Octavia Minor, older sister of Octavian (future Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus), marked a turning point that led to the Final War of the Roman Republic. In 31 BC. during a naval battle at Actium, Antony and Cleopatra were defeated by Octavian. By the time Octavian arrived in Egypt in the summer of 30 BC, the couple had sent the children away. Caesarion went to India, but en route he was betrayed by his tutor, intercepted by Roman forces and executed. Selene, Alexander, and Ptolemy Philadelphos went south to Thebes. Meanwhile, their parents committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. The deaths of their mother and Caesarion left Selene and Alexander nominally in charge of Egypt until the kingdom was officially annexed by the Roman Empire two weeks later. =Life at Rome= Octavian captured Selene and her brothers, and took them to Rome. During his triumph, he paraded the twins dressed as the moon and the sun in heavy golden chains, behind an effigy of their mother clutching an asp to her arm. The chains were so heavy that the children were unable to walk in them, eliciting unexpected sympathy from many of the Roman onlookers.Roller, pp. 82‚Äì85 Once Egypt had ceased to exist as an independent kingdom, there remained the question of what to do with Selene and her brothers. In the absence of any surviving relative, responsibility for the children passed to Augustus, who in turn gave the siblings to Octavia to be raised in her household on the Palatine Hill.Roller, pp. 82‚Äì85 They were members of an extended family that included their half- brother Iullus Antonius (their father's son with his late wife Fulvia), their half-sisters, both called Antonia (daughters of their father with Octavia), and Octavia's older children from a previous marriage, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and his two sisters called Marcella. Between 26 and 20 BC, Cleopatra Selene is the only known surviving member of the Ptolemaic dynasty.Roller, pp. 84‚Äì89 Her brothers are not recorded in any known historical account and are presumed to have died, possibly from either illness or assassination. Marriage and issue Octavia arranged for Cleopatra Selene to marry the intellectual King Juba II of Numidia, whose father had committed suicide in 46 BC. He was sent to be raised in Caesar's household; on Caesar's death in 44 BC custody passed to Octavian, the future Augustus. The marriage likely took place in 25 BCRoller, p. 4 and was commemorated in an epigram that survives in its entirety: The couple had two children: * Ptolemy of Mauretania born in 10 BC Cleopatra Selene by Chris Bennett He was named after his mother's dynasty and her younger brother. In naming her son, Cleopatra created a distinct Greek-Egyptian tone and emphasized her role as heiress of the Ptolemies in exile. * A daughter, whose name has not survived, is mentioned in an inscription. It has been suggested that this was Drusilla of Mauretania, but she may have been a granddaughter through Ptolemy instead. A hoard of Selene's coins has been dated at 17 AD. It is traditionally believed that she was alive to mint them, but this would mean that her husband married Princess Glaphyra of Cappadocia during Selene's lifetime. Historians generally assume that Juba wouldn't have taken a second wife as a thoroughly Romanized king, arguing that if he married Glaphyra before 4 AD, then his first wife must have already been dead.Roller, pp. 249‚Äì251 However, even contemporary client kings with Roman citizenship took multiple wives. It is possible that Selene and Juba separated for a time, but that their rift was mended after Juba's divorce from Glaphyra. Queen of Mauretania A likely depiction of Cleopatra Selene II wearing an elephant scalp, raised relief image on a gilded silver dish, from the Boscoreale Treasure, 1st century BC In 25 BC, Augustus decided to confer on Juba and Selene the newly created client kingdom of Mauretania as Numidia had been turned into the Roman province of Africa Nova in 46 BC. The young rulers renamed their new capital Caesarea (modern Cherchell, Algeria), in honor of the Emperor.Roller, pp. 98‚Äì100 Mauretania was a vast territory, but lacked organization. Cleopatra Selene is said to have exercised great influence on the policies which Juba promoted. She imported many important advisers, scholars, and artists from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve in Caesarea. Through the couple's influence, the Mauretanian kingdom flourished. =Economy= Coin of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania. Juba II of Numidia on the obverse, Cleopatra Selene II on the reverse. Cleopatra supported Mauretanian trade. The kingdom developed a significant export throughout the Mediterranean region,Roller, pp. 91‚Äì162 particularly with Spain and Italy. Their products included fish, grapes, pearls, figs, grain, wooden furniture and purple dye harvested from shellfish. Tingis (modern Tangier), a town at the Pillars of Hercules (modern Strait of Gibraltar), became a major trade centre. The value and quality of Mauretanian coins became recognised throughout the Roman Empire. =Building projects= Cleopatra's promotion of architecture marks a transition between the Hellenistic style and Roman. The construction and sculptural projects at Caesarea and Volubilis display a mixture of Ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles.Roller, pp. 91‚Äì162 These buildings included a lighthouse in the style of Pharos of Alexandria in the harbour, a royal palace situated in the seafront, and numerous temples dedicated to Roman and Egyptian deities. Her vigorous promotion of her mother's legacy stood in sharp contrast to the negative image being disseminated in contemporary Augustan poetry. Death The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, a tomb of Cleopatra Selene II and Juba II in Tipaza, Algeria. The couple ruled Mauretania for almost two decades until Cleopatra's death at the age of 35. Controversy surrounds her exact date of death. The following epigram by Greek epigrammatist Crinagoras of Mytilene is considered to be her eulogy:Roller, pp. 249‚Äì251 If this poem isn't simply literary license, Selene's death seems to have ironically coincided with a lunar eclipse. If so, astronomical correlation then can be used to help pinpoint the date of her death: Lunar eclipses occurred in 9, 8, 5 and 1 BC and in AD 3, 7, 10, 11 and 14. The event in 5 BC most closely resembles the description given in the eulogy.Ancey, pp. 139‚Äì141 However, the date of her death is not ascertainable with any certainty. Zahi Hawass, former Director of Egyptian Antiquities, believes Cleopatra died in 8 AD.Roller, p. 250 Selene was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania in modern Algeria, built by her and Juba east of Caesarea and still visible. Juba died in 23 AD and was buried in the same tomb. There is a fragmentary inscription dedicated to the couple as the \\"King and Queen of Mauretania\\". Their remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raids, possibly shortly after the mausoleum's construction; or because the structure was meant to serve as a memorial and not as a place of burial.Davies, Ethel (2009). North Africa: the Roman Coast. Chalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire: Bradt Travel Guides. , p. 11. Legacy An ancient Roman bust of Cleopatra Selene's only son, Ptolemy of Mauretania, in the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell, Algeria. Cleopatra was survived by her husband and their son Ptolemy, who ruled Mauretania together until Juba's death in AD 23. Ptolemy then reigned until 40, when he was executed by Emperor Caligula, his mother's great nephew, who was probably jealous of Mauretania's wealth. Caligula's successor, Emperor Claudius, took advantage of Ptolemy's lack of heirs and assumed control of Mauretania, turning it into the Roman provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana. Thereafter, Cleopatra, Juba and Ptolemy were mostly forgotten. One of the two satellites of the asteroid (216) Kleopatra was named Cleoselene in her honor.

Redesmere Lake  Redesmere Redesmere, created as a feeder reservoir for the ornamental lakes of Capesthorne Hall in the late 18th century, once had an island. According to popular belief the island floated, and it is marked as such on the 1842 One Inch Ordnance Survey map, though the 1964 1:2500 Ordnance Survey map shows that it had become joined with the bank by then.

Soon after he fell ill, but she remained loyal to him and nursed him back to health. There then followed a storm which tore the island from the bottom of the lake, and it floated ever since, clearing the lady's name.

Summary While the New Republic struggles to decide what to do with the deadly Sun Crusher‚Äîa new doomsday weapon stolen from the Empire by Han Solo‚Äîthe renegade Imperial Admiral Daala uses her fleet of Star Destroyers to conduct guerrilla warfare on peaceful planets. And now she threatens Mon Calamari, the watery homeworld of Admiral Ackbar and important shipyard for the New Republic. But as the battle for a planet rages, an even greater danger emerges at Luke Skywalker's Jedi academy on Yavin 4. A strong but untrained student named Gantoris delves dangerously into the dark side of the Force and unleashes the spirit of the ancient dark side master Exar Kun, who instructs him in the creation of a unique, three crystal lightsaber that can be focused to extend beyond the normal length to that of a spear. The spirit of Exar Kun also tries, with disastrous consequences, to entice him toward the dark side. Although unsuccessful, this sets the stage for another of Luke's students, Kyp Durron, to face the same choice as Gantoris. When he does get to the Jedi Praxeum, he starts learning the ways of the light side of the Force, astonishing all the other students with his extraordinary talent and his aptitude for Force-training; unfortunately, he also starts learning of the dark side of the Force after Gantoris' death (Gantoris had been corrupted by the spirit of Exar Kun, but turned against him; in revenge, Exar Kun burned Gantoris alive). Exar Kun's spirit began tempting Kyp. Kyp's power increases considerably, and he is tainted by the dark side and the lies Kun told him of the history of the Jedi Order. After a violent disagreement with Tionne over ancient history (involving the fall of Exar Kun), Kyp assaulted Skywalker; with the dark aid of Kun, Kyp ripped Luke's soul from his body, placing him into a coma. With his strength in the Force, Kyp reached out and guided the Sun Crusher from the heart of the gas giant, Yavin, and set out on a mission of vengeance against Admiral Daala and the Imperial Remnant. He knows that his brother, Zeth Durron, is still part of the Empire and he sets course for Carida, intending to rescue him by force if need be.

He was regarded as the premier choreographer of Hollywood sword-fighting, and during his career he coached many actors in swordsmanship, including Errol Flynn, Sean Connery, Antonio Banderas, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Paul, and Johnny Depp. He also appeared as a stunt double for Darth Vader's lightsaber battles in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Biography Anderson was educated at The Royal Hospital School, in Raleigh House. It was here that he began to fence. Anderson joined the Royal Marines and won several combined services titles in the sport of fencing. He served in the Mediterranean during the Second World War.Darth Vader stand-in Bob Anderson dies espn.com, 2 January 2012 As a competitive fencer, he represented Great Britain at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympic Games, and the World Championships in 1950 and 1953 in the sabre event. He finished tied for fifth in the team sabre event at Helsinki in 1952. After his retirement from fencing competition, he studied under Prof. Roger Crosnier and was appointed the first official British National Coach, in charge of the National Training System, the day he was awarded his full Professorship. He succeeded Prof. Crosnier as President of the British Academy of Fencing. During the late 1950s to the 1970s he travelled around Britain, and between fencing courses he combined his official duties with television and film work. Eventually emigrating to Canada, he went on to become technical director of the Canadian Fencing Association in Ottawa. During the 1960s and 1970s he was also the president of the British Academy of Fencing. Anderson's cinema career began in 1953 when he choreographed fights for and coached Errol Flynn in The Master of Ballantrae. During rehearsal for a scene he accidentally slashed Flynn on his thigh, leading to notoriety in Hollywood as \\"the man who stabbed Errol Flynn\\". He went on to work as a stunt performer and/or fight choreographer in films such as The Guns of Navarone and the Bond films From Russia With Love and Casino Royale. His stature in Hollywood was cemented when he was selected by Stanley Kubrick in 1974 to act as the sword master for Barry Lyndon. Anderson subsequently went on to be involved in all three of the original Star Wars films. Anderson did not receive much recognition for his work for years after their initial release. Mark Hamill in 1983 revealed, \\"Bob Anderson was the man who actually did Vader's fighting. It was always supposed to be a secret, but I finally told George I didn't think it was fair any more. Bob worked so bloody hard that he deserves some recognition. It's ridiculous to preserve the myth that it's all done by one man.\\" Anderson in 1994 specified that for The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi he staged the lightsaber duels and also wore the Vader costume in fight scenes. Published under title \\"Giving Some Pointers\\". David Prowse, who played Vader, said he did his own swordplay in the first Star Wars film but afterward, \\"having one of the principals do his own stunts made [the filmmakers] very weird from an insurance point of view.\\" Anderson continued to work in cinema for the next 30 years, and was responsible for the swordsmanship in many films, including Highlander, The Princess Bride, The Three Musketeers, The Mask of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Shortly before his death he was working on The Hobbit. He had a reputation for being a perfectionist, with director Martin Campbell giving him the nickname \\"Grumpy Bob\\".

The Japanese DVD was released by video game publisher Atlus on March 25, 2005. It is based on a far futuristic planet where four mercenaries band together to try and unlock the power of the ultimate weapon which can either save humanity or destroy it. Against mechas and strange races, they sweep the vast planet to reach their goal. Summary Aqualoid was a prosperous planet, but an attack from a mysterious life force, the Inorganics, transforms it into a post-apocalyptic shell of its former self. When Nam finds a mysterious sword, he is suddenly the object of a planet-wide chase. With the Inorganics closing in, will Nam and his friends discover the secret of the sword and save their world? Or will they destroy Aqualoid in favor of a new Birth? Production Yoshinori Kanada acted as one of the OVA's key animators. Another noteworthy animator on Birth was a young Hideaki Anno, who would go on to direct Neon Genesis Evangelion. English dubs Two English dubs of Birth exist. The first was licensed in 1987 by Harmony Gold and released by Streamline Pictures in North America and the United Kingdom under the title The World of the Talisman. According to New Straits Times, it briefly aired in Malaysia in late 1987. The OVA was later retitled yet again to Planet Busters. Harmony Gold's version changes some of the character names, tones down some of the more surreal Japanese humour to appeal to a younger audience, and contains more American-style dialogue, alternate music composed by Randy Miller and additional voice-overs. The second dub by ADV Films, released on DVD on July 13, 2004, is much more faithful to the original Japanese version.

The show was created for the cable channel Bip and debuted in March 2004, becoming the first prime time animated series in Israeli television, and was later rebroadcast partly censored on Channel 2. The show won the Israeli Television Academy Award for Best Comedy Series and is considered by many a milestone in the history of Israeli animation. Despite gaining popularity and critical acclaim, the negotiations for a second season seem to have failed, making the first 10-episode season the only one thus far. Main cast and characters * Danny Steg as Corporal Shlomi Hanukkah: A narrow-minded soldier and a Mizrahi \\"ars\\". * Haim Yafim Barbalat as Corporal Itai Shulman: Hanukkah's friend, an Ashkenazi nerd. * Albert Iluz as Camp Commander Warrant Officer Gabriel Shukrun: A stupid, stubborn and manipulative NCO. * Inbal Luri as Michal Levinstein: A handicapped volunteer, generally hated by all other involuntary soldiers for her self-righteousness. * Adib Jahschan as Abed Abu Jamal: An Israeli Arab living near the base. He appears to be Shukrun's humble friend, while secretly being a terrorist training bionic shahid sheep. In the show he represents the \\"fifth column Israeli Arabs\\" stereotype. Premise and production M.K. 22 satirically deals with Israel Defense Forces manners and culture, and with general issues of Israeli society and current events in Israel. It is situated in the fictional top-secret logistics military base M.K. 22, in the south of Israel, storing the country's so-called nuclear missiles. Two of the show's creators, Yaron Niski and Doron Tzur, actually served together as logistics soldiers in an Israeli military base and the show is influenced by their experiences there. The show's initial goal was \\"to combine the style of South Park with local cult such as Giv'at Halfon\\". Director Assaf Harel claimed that the fact that the show was created for a cable network made it possible to use a blacker and more extreme type of humor, which he compared to that of South Park. In general, South Park is widely considered the show's biggest influence by Israeli critics and fans. Obvious similarities to South Park include the crude style of animation, the use of live-action (the episode \\"One of Us\\" showed parts of the 1989 Israeli film of the same name, which the episode parodied), and a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer similar to that of South Park. =Name= M.K. stands for \\"machane keva\\", Hebrew for \\"permanent [military] camp\\", while the words \\"Mem Qoph 22\\" might sound like \\"milkud 22\\", the Hebrew translation for the idiom catch-22. =Themes= The show's themes included, among others, the tensions between Haredi Jews and homosexuals, the media attention given to Ilan Ramon (prior to his death), the aliyah from Ethiopia, the West Bank barrier and the Split broadcast incident. The show also parodied several films, TV shows, politicians and celebrities. =Animation= According to Harel, the show's style of animation was influenced by South Park, although M.K. 22 uses more 3D computer graphics and more complicated backgrounds. The show's characters and backgrounds are made to appear deliberately crude, though not as if they're made of cut-out pieces of paper. There is only one round shape in the entire series, one of the soldiers' helmet, whereas other naturally round shapes look quadrilateral or polygonal. The Sun for instance, is a plain yellow square in the sky. Controversy In 2005, when it was decided to broadcast the show on Channel 2, the show's straightforward treatment of delicate Israeli issues caused Keshet to censor parts of it. One of the episodes, \\"Robo Rabbi\\", was completely censored. It has been suggested that the background for the episode's censorship was the upcoming expiration of the Channel 2 tender. The episode parodied the threats of violence of Haredi Jews towards the pride parade, and spoofed the film Yossi & Jagger.

The daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III of Egypt, Cleopatra Selene was favoured by her mother and became a pawn in Cleopatra III's political manoeuvres. In 115 BC, Cleopatra III forced her son Ptolemy IX to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV, and chose Cleopatra Selene as the new queen consort of Egypt. Tension between the king and his mother grew and ended with his expulsion from Egypt, leaving Cleopatra Selene behind; she probably then married the new king, her other brother Ptolemy X. Following the marriage of the Syrian Seleucid princess Cleopatra I to Ptolemy V of Egypt, dynastic marriages between the two kingdoms became common. In 102 BC, Cleopatra III decided to establish an alliance with her nephew Antiochus VIII of Syria; Cleopatra Selene was sent as his bride. After his assassination in 96 BC, she married his brother and rival Antiochus IX. Cleopatra Selene lost her new husband in 95 BC and married a final time to Antiochus IX's son Antiochus X, who disappeared from the records and is presumed to have died in 92 BC, but may have remained in power until 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). Cleopatra Selene then hid somewhere in the kingdom with her children. Eventually, Syria split between the sons of Antiochus VIII with Philip I ruling in the Syrian capital Antioch and Antiochus XII in the southern city Damascus. Cleopatra Selene had many children by several husbands. Probably following the death of Antiochus XII in 230 SE (83/82 BC), she declared Antiochus XIII, her son by Antiochus X, king, and seems to have declared herself co-ruler; they claimed Antioch following Philip I's death. But the people of Antioch and the governor of Damascus, exhausted by the Seleucids' civil wars, invited foreign monarchs to rule them: Tigranes II of Armenia took Antioch, while Aretas III of Nabataea took Damascus. Cleopatra Selene controlled several coastal towns until Tigranes II besieged her in 69 BC in Ptolemais; the Armenian king captured the queen and later executed her. Historical background, family and name By the second century BC, the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom were weakened by dynastic feuds, constant wars against each other (known as the Syrian Wars), and Roman interference. To ease the tension, the two dynasties intermarried. Cleopatra I of Syria married Ptolemy V of Egypt in 193 BC, and her granddaughter Cleopatra Thea married three Syrian kings in succession starting in 150 BC. Those intermarriages helped Egypt destabilize Syria which was especially fragmented between different claimants to the throne; brothers fought between themselves and Egypt interfered by supporting one claimant against the other. Cleopatra Selene was born between 135 and 130 BC to Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. Cleopatra Selene had many siblings, including Ptolemy IX, Ptolemy X, and Cleopatra IV. Ancient writers, such as Cicero and Appian, mention that the queen's name is Selene, and Strabo clarified that she was surnamed \\"Cleopatra\\". On the other hand, modern scholars, such as Arthur Houghton and Catharine Lorber, believed that Selene was actually an epithet. The archaeologist Nicholas L. Wright suggested that she assumed the epithet \\"Selene\\" when she became queen of Egypt and that it is a divinising epithet, indicating that Cleopatra Selene presented herself as the manifestation of the moon goddess on earth. Coins struck in her name record her as Cleopatra Selene. Selene was the name of the Greek moon goddess and it is connected to the word selas (œÉŒ≠ŒªŒ±œÇ), meaning \\"light\\". \\"Cleopatra\\" was a Ptolemaic dynastic name; it means \\"famous in her father\\" or \\"renowned in her ancestry\\". As a queen of Syria, she was the second to rule with the name 'Cleopatra'. Hence, she is termed \\"Cleopatra II Selene\\" to differentiate her from her predecessor and aunt Cleopatra I Thea, who was the mother of Cleopatra Selene's husbands Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX. Classicist Grace Macurdy numbered Cleopatra Selene as \\"Cleopatra V\\" within the Ptolemaic dynasty and many historians have used this convention. Queen of Egypt Ptolemy VIII Sibling marriage was known in ancient Egypt and, although it was not a general practice, it was acceptable for the Egyptians; the Ptolemies practised it, perhaps to consolidate the dynasty. In 116 BC, Ptolemy VIII died and his will left Cleopatra III to rule alongside a co-ruler of her choice from between her two sons; she wanted to choose Ptolemy X but the people of Alexandria (the capital of Egypt) opposed this, forcing her to accept Ptolemy IX's ascension to the throne. Shortly after his elevation, Cleopatra III forced Ptolemy IX to divorce Cleopatra IV, his sister whom he had married before their father's death; the 2nd-century historian Justin implied that Cleopatra III made this a condition of accepting him as co-ruler. Cleopatra Selene, favoured by her mother Cleopatra III, was chosen as the new queen consort in 115 BC. In 107 BC, the relationship between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated; Cleopatra III forced him out of Egypt, and he left his wife and children behind. The same year, 107 BC, Cleopatra Selene was probably married off to the new king, her younger brother, Ptolemy X. In 103 BC, Ptolemy IX was fighting in Judea. The queen mother feared an alliance against her between Ptolemy IX and his friend Antiochus IX of Syria, who was fighting a civil war with his brother Antiochus VIII; this led her to send troops to Syria. Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X conquered Ptolemais, and according to Justin, the king, shocked by his mother's cruelty, abandoned her and ran away; Cleopatra III then decided to marry Cleopatra Selene to Antiochus VIII, as a step to bring Antiochus VIII to her side in order to counter an alliance between Ptolemy IX and Antiochus IX. If it is accepted that Cleopatra Selene married Ptolemy X, then Cleopatra III divorced her from him after he deserted. Queen of SyriaQueen consort= Antiochus VIII The marriage of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus VIII took place c. 102 BC; historian Leo Kadman suggested that Cleopatra III gave her daughter to the Syrian king in Ptolemais before she retreated to Egypt, and that Cleopatra Selene kept that city as her main base until the end of her life. Details of Cleopatra Selene's life with Antiochus VIII are not clear; no known offspring resulted from the marriage, though six of Antiochus VIII's children from his previous marriage are known. In 96 BC, Herakleon of Beroia, a general of Antiochus VIII, assassinated his monarch and tried to usurp the throne, but failed and retreated to his home- town Beroia. The capital of Syria, Antioch, was part of Antiochus VIII's realm at the time of his assassination; Cleopatra Selene probably resided there. Antiochus IX The queen held out in the capital for a while before marrying Antiochus IX. The manner in which Antiochus IX took control of Antioch and his new wife in 95 BC is not clear; he could have taken the city by force or it could be that Cleopatra Selene herself opened the gates for him. In the view of historian Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Cleopatra Selene had little reason to trust the five sons of her previous husband; the queen needed an ally who would help her control the capital while Antiochus IX needed a wife and Cleopatra Selene's influence over the city's garrison and her late husband's officials. It is unlikely that this marriage was received well by Antiochus VIII's sons. The first of them to act was Seleucus VI who was established in Cilicia. Within a year of his marriage to Cleopatra Selene, Antiochus IX marched against his nephew but was defeated and killed. Soon afterwards, Seleucus entered the capital. Cleopatra Selene probably fled before the new king's arrival. Alternatively, she might have been sent to Arados by Antiochus IX for protection before he marched against Seleucus. Antiochus X In 218 SE (95/94 BC), Antiochus X, the son of Antiochus IX, proclaimed himself king in Arados, and married Cleopatra Selene. The Seleucid dynasty had a precedent of a son marrying his stepmother: Antiochus I had married his stepmother Stratonice, and this might have made it easier for Cleopatra Selene. Yet, the marriage was scandalous. Appian wrote an anecdote concerning the epithet of Antiochus X, \\"Eusebes\\" (\\"the pious\\"): the Syrians gave it to him to mock his show of loyalty to his father by bedding his widow. The rationale for the marriage might have been pragmatic: Antiochus X sought to be king, but had little resources and needed a queen. Cleopatra Selene was in her forties and could not simply marry a foreign king. Antiochus X pushed Seleucus VI out of Antioch in 94 BC and ruled northern Syria and Cilicia, while Seleucus VI's brothers Philip I and Demetrius III ruled Beroea and Damascus respectively. The last evidence for the reign of Antiochus X is dated to 92 BC; he is generally assumed to have died at around this date. Ancient sources contain contradictory accounts and dates, and the numismatist Oliver D. Hoover suggested the date of 224 SE (89/88 BC) for Antiochus X's demise. Antioch was taken by Demetrius III then Philip I. =Queen regnant and regent= Syria in Cleopatra Selene's location during the reign of Antiochus X's successors in Antioch is unknown. She evidently took shelter with her children somewhere in the kingdom, and possibly fled to Cilicia or Coele-Syria, probably the city of Ptolemais, which she held until her death. Antiochus XII, another son of Antiochus VIII who was ruling in Damascus, died in 230 SE (83/82 BC). With the throne of Antiochus XII vacant, Cleopatra Selene declared her son Antiochus XIII king. Based on the evidence of the coins depicting her alongside her ruling son, it appears that Cleopatra Selene acted as the regent. Many of those coins have been found, and they depict Antiochus XIII in the background and herself in the foreground, in the style of a queen regnant, where Cleopatra Selene's name is written before that of the king's. When she declared her son king, Cleopatra Selene controlled lands in Cilicia or Phoenicia or both. The archaeologist Alfred Bellinger suggested that she was in control of several coastal Syrian cities from a base in Cilicia; she certainly controlled Ptolemais and probably Seleucia Pieria. The 1st-century historian Josephus wrote of \\"Selene ... who ruled in Syria\\", indicating her continued influence despite her never controlling the capital Antioch. Her children probably remained in Cilicia or somewhere else in Asia Minor for protection, which would explain Antiochus XIII's nickname, \\"Asiaticus\\". Reign in Damascus Bronze coin of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII. The reverse indicates that it was minted in Damascus According to Josephus, \\"those that held Damascus\\" invited Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans, to rule them because they feared Ptolemy (son of Mennaeus), king of the Iturea. Damascus' history between the death of Antiochus XII and 241 SE (72/71 BC), when the Armenian king Tigranes II took the city, is obscure. Based on her jugate coins which depict her alongside Antiochus XIII, Hoover suggested that Selene operated from Damascus; those coins used a broken-bar Alpha, cursive Epsilon and squared Sigma. This typography appeared in the Damascene coins of Demetrius III and Antiochus XII and is otherwise rare in the Hellenistic world. If her currency was minted in Damascus, then it dates to the period between the death of Antiochus XII and Tigranes II's occupation of the city. Two scenarios are possible: *Cleopatra Selene took Damascus after Antiochus XII's death and was replaced by Aretas III before 73 BC: Josephus does not name the people of Damascus as the party who invited Aretas III, rather, his words indicate that a garrison or a governor conducted the act. All known coins of Cleopatra Selene are made of bronze, and the absence of silver coinage indicates that the queen lacked the necessary resources to defend Damascus, which would explain the invitation of Aretas III. It is also possible that Cleopatra Selene moved her capital to Ptolemais, causing her troops in Damascus to lose faith in her rule, leading them to invite the Nabataean king. *Aretas III's rule in Damascus did not last long before Cleopatra Selene took control: Wright suggested that Cleopatra Selene's takeover of Damascus took place after 80 BC. Several factors might have compelled the Nabataeans to withdraw, such as the Ituraean threats or the attacks of the Hasmonean Judaean king Alexander Jannaeus, whose incursions into Nabataean lands must have made their position in Damascus difficult. Claiming the north In the north, Philip I ruled until his death, after which Cleopatra Selene claimed the rights of her children with Antiochus X to the vacant throne. The queen's claims of authority were not generally accepted by the Syrians, and the people of Antioch invited Tigranes II to rule Syria, being frustrated by the Seleucids' constant civil wars. The year in which this event took place is debated; 83 BC is, without any proof, commonly accepted as Philip I's year of death by the majority of scholars who count on the account of Appian, who assigned a reign of fourteen years for Tigranes II, which ended in 69 BC. Oliver D. Hoover suggested that Tigranes II invaded Syria only in 74 BC, with Philip I ruling until 75 BC in Northern Syria, allowing Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII to claim the country unopposed for a while. An argument in favour of Cleopatra Selene and her son being the sole claimants of Syria in 75 BC is a statement by Cicero: the Roman statesman wrote that Antiochus XIII and his brother were sent to Rome by their mother in 75 BC. They returned to Syria in 240 SE (73/72 BC); the brothers claimed the throne of Egypt based on their mother's birthright. To impress the Roman Senate, the queen endowed her children with sufficient assets, which included a jewelled candelabrum that was dedicated to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The Senate refused to hear their petition for the Egyptian throne, but, according to Cicero, their de jure right to the Syrian throne which they had inherited from their ancestors was already acknowledged. The statement of Cicero indicates that in 75 BC, Tigranes II was still not in control of Syria, for if he were, Antiochus XIII would have asked the Roman Senate for support to regain Syria, since Tigranes II was the son-in-law of Rome's enemy, Mithridates VI of Pontus. Likewise, Philip I could not have been alive since Antiochus XIII went to Rome without having to assert his right to Syria. In a paper presented at the 131st annual meeting of the American Historical Association, Nikolaus Overtoom, based on Hoover's chronology, suggested that Cleopatra Selene was in control of the south while Philip I ruled the north until 75 BC; his death meant that Cleopatra Selene's son was the strongest candidate to the throne, but Philip I's faction, being opposed to Cleopatra Selene, offered the crown to Tigranes II who invaded and conquered the country in 74 BC. =Downfall, assessment and legacy= The regency of Cleopatra Selene probably ended in 75 BC as the journey of Antiochus XIII to Rome indicates that he had already reached his majority or was close to it. Tigranes II, whose invasion probably took place during Antiochus XIII's absence, never controlled the entire country and took Damascus only in 72 BC. Cleopatra Selene resisted the Armenians in Ptolemais while Antiochus XIII probably took shelter in Cilicia. In 69 BC, Tigranes II besieged Ptolemais; the city fell according to Josephus, but Tigranes II had to move north fast as the Romans started attacking Armenia. According to Strabo, Tigranes II imprisoned the queen in Seleucia and later had her killed. Those accounts seem to contradict each other, but in the view of the seventeenth century historian William Whiston, they do not, since Josephus does not mention that Tigranes II captured the queen in Ptolemais. Historian John D. Grainger explained Tigranes II's action as a consequence of Cleopatra Selene's political importance; she was a winning card in the hands of her husbands, and Tigranes II sought to deny other ambitious men from acquiring influence through her. Others see Cleopatra Selene as a pawn in political schemes who later evolved into a schemer in her own right, one who decided her actions effectively based on her own benefit. Cleopatra Selene's long career, as the wife of three successive Syrian monarchs, and the mother of one and a ruler in her own right, in addition to her divine status, turned her into a symbol of Seleucid continuity. The ancient Near East was ruled by successive dynasties whose monarchs claimed the title of Great King, i.e. imperial overlord. When the Romans ended the Seleucid dynasty in 64 BC, they attempted to simply replace the Syrian monarchs as an imperial authority, but the political reality of Rome as a republic meant that its legitimacy in the East was questioned. The Seleucid diadem was considered a symbol of legitimacy even after the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, and many eastern kings, such as the Parthian monarch Mithridates II, used Seleucid royal iconography to gain the local nobility's support in their domains. The Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt were the closest relatives of the Seleucids and their legitimate successors; Cleopatra VII of Egypt used the name of Cleopatra Selene for her daughter Cleopatra Selene of Mauretania, born 40 BC; this can be viewed in the context of Cleopatra VII's attempts to claim the Seleucid succession rights in the East. IssueBy Ptolemy IX= *According to Justin, Cleopatra Selene and Ptolemy IX had two children; the historian John Whitehorne noted that the existence of those two children is doubted and they might have died at a young age. In 103 BC, Cleopatra III sent all her grandsons and treasures to the island of Kos for protection in preparation for her war with Ptolemy IX. In 88 BC, Mithridates VI captured all the Egyptian royals in Kos; the two children of Cleopatra Selene mentioned by Justin, if they actually existed and were sent to Kos by Cleopatra III, would have been among the captured. *Ptolemy XII, the father of Cleopatra VII, and his brother Ptolemy of Cyprus. Ptolemy XII's legitimacy was historically questioned; his father was certainly Ptolemy IX but his mother's identity is vague. Cicero wrote that Ptolemy XII was royal \\"neither in birth nor in spirit\\", but the classicist John Pentland Mahaffy noted that Cicero's words indicate that Ptolemy XII's mother was not a reigning queen at his birth, and so could be Cleopatra IV, whose marriage to Ptolemy IX can be considered morganatic (a marriage between people of unequal social rank), since it was not acceptable that a Ptolemaic prince marry his sister prior to his ascension to the throne. The historian Christopher J. Bennett considered Ptolemy XII and his brother identical with the two children mentioned by Justin, but proposed that they were the children of Cleopatra IV, considered illegitimate because of their parents' \\"morganatic\\" marriage. Hence, Cleopatra Selene was not the biological mother, rather, she was the official mother, thus explaining her attempt to raise one of her sons by Antiochus X to the throne of Egypt in 75 BC by repudiating Ptolemy XII's legitimacy. Whitehorne, citing Cleopatra Selene's denial of Ptolemy XII's illegitimacy, refused to identify Ptolemy XII and his brother as the two children mentioned in Justin's work. *Cleopatra Berenice (Berenice III), whose mother's identity is not certain, might have been a daughter of Cleopatra Selene, but Cleopatra IV is also a candidate and is favoured by modern scholarship. Bennett noted that Berenice III's legitimacy was never questioned by ancient historians, and the illegitimacy of Ptolemy IX and Cleopatra IV's marriage makes it more probable that Berenice III was the result of a legitimate marriage, that is between her father and Cleopatra Selene. =By Ptolemy X= Ptolemy X's son, Ptolemy XI, might have been the child of Cleopatra IV. Following Cleopatra IV's expulsion from Egypt in 115 BC, she went to Cyprus where Ptolemy X resided, but she departed quickly to Syria and married Antiochus IX; if Ptolemy XI was her son, then her abandonment of Cyprus is hard to explain, and her son would not have been considered legitimate, while the legitimacy of Ptolemy XI was unquestioned. Berenice III was mentioned as a mother of Ptolemy XI in a Demotic text, but the Egyptian word used to denote a \\"son\\" can also mean a step son, which is the meaning preferred by most scholars for the word in the text mentioning Berenice III as a mother of Ptolemy XI. Cleopatra Selene is the most suitable candidate; among several arguments in favor of Cleopatra Selene, Bennett noted that Berenice III was called by Cicero a sister of Ptolemy XI. If Ptolemy XI and Berenice III were both children of Cleopatra Selene, then the statement of Cicero can be taken literally. Cleopatra Selene's maternity of Ptolemy XI can not be confirmed, and which of Ptolemy X's wives bore Ptolemy XI remains unknown. =By Antiochus X= Identifying Antiochus X and Cleopatra Selene's children is problematic; Cicero wrote that the queen had two sons, one of them named Antiochus. More children, perhaps a daughter, might have resulted from the marriage, but it can not be confirmed; according to Plutarch, Tigranes II \\"put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity\\". Thus, it is possible that Cleopatra Selene had a daughter captured by Tigranes II. Antiochus XIII, coin bearing the epithet Philadelphos *Antiochus XIII: this son is the Antiochus of Cicero, who, as a sole monarch following his mother's death, appears on his coins as Antiochus Philadelphos (\\"brother-loving\\"), but on coins where Cleopatra Selene is depicted along with her ruling son, the king is named Antiochus Philometor (\\"mother-loving\\"). This has led scholars to propose various theories: Kay Ehling, reasserting the view of Bouch√©-Leclercq, suggested that Cleopatra Selene had two sons, both named Antiochus. But Cicero, who left one of the brothers unnamed, is clear that only one of them was named Antiochus; for Ehling's proposal to be valid, Antiochus Philometor should be the Antiochus mentioned by Cicero, then he died and his brother, who had a different name, assumed the dynastic name Antiochus with the epithet Philadelphos, but this scenario is complicated and remains a mere hypothesis. Thus, Antiochus XIII bore two epithets: Philadelphos and Philometor. *Seleucus Kybiosaktes: the second son of Cleopatra Selene, who was unnamed by Cicero and does not appear in other ancient sources, is generally identified by modern scholarship with a character named Seleucus Kybiosaktes, who appeared in Egypt as a husband of Berenice IV of Egypt. Kybiosaktes was never associated with Cleopatra Selene in the ancient sources; solid evidence is lacking and the identification remains a theory. *Seleucus VII: in 2002, the numismatist Brian Kritt announced the discovery and decipherment of a coin bearing the portrait of Cleopatra Selene and a co-ruler; Kritt read the name of the ruler as Seleucus Philometor and, based on the epithet, identified him with Cleopatra Selene's son, unnamed by Cicero. Kritt gave the newly discovered ruler the regnal name Seleucus VII, and considered it very likely that he is identical with Kybiosaktes. The reading of \\"Seleucus VII\\" was accepted by some scholars such as Lloyd Llewellyn Jones and Michael Roy Burgess, but Hoover rejected Kritt's reading, noting that the coin was badly damaged and some letters were unreadable; Hoover read the king's name as Antiochus and identified him with Antiochus XIII. According to Wright, if the reading of Kritt is accepted, then it is possible that Cleopatra Selene became estranged from Antiochus XIII at some point before 75 BC and declared Seleucus VII as her co-ruler.

Career \\"Big Dan\\" started broadcasting at WHCH Hofstra College, Hempstead; WNRC, New Rochelle; and WALK-FM, Patchogue, all in New York State. Ingram was one of the most highly regarded DJs from his era. He was noted for his quick wit and ability to convey a humorous or satiric idea with fast pacing and an economy of words, a skill that rendered him uniquely suited to, and successful within, modern personality-driven music radio. He was among the most frequently emulated radio personalities, cited as an influence or inspiration by numerous current broadcasters. One of Ingram's unique skills was his ability to \\"talk up\\" to the lyrics of a record, meaning speaking over the musical introduction and finishing exactly at the point when the lyrics started. Ingram was well known for playing doctored versions of popular songs. The Paul McCartney & Wings song My Love Does it Good became My Glove Does it Good. The stuttering title refrain of Bennie and the Jets went from three or four repetitions to countless. In the same vein, the distinctive refrain added to Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Swede, Ooga-chucka-ooga-ooga would start repeating and listeners would never know when it would end. Paul Simon's 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover became \\"50 Ways to Love Your Leaver\\" and \\"49 Ways to Relieve Your Liver\\", and Ingram \\"rearranged\\" the spelling of \\"S-A- T-U-R-D-A-Y\\" on the Bay City Rollers' Saturday Night. His longtime closing theme song was \\"Tri-Fi Drums\\" by Billy May. An edited version of the song was used for broadcast. TV commercials Ingram narrated include a 1970 promo for free cut-out records of Archies songs on the backs of Post Honeycomb and Alpha-Bits cereals. Ingram also worked for cable channel HBO in the mid-1980s, mostly as the off-camera host of HBO Coming Attractions (a monthly show featuring previews of HBO's upcoming programming; occasionally he would co- host with another HBO voice, Joyce Gordon) and various voiceover roles, though he did occasionally appear on camera in early 1986 as part of the HBO Weekend interstitials of the time. Ingram was also featured prominently in his son Chris's book, Hey Kemosabe! The Days (and Nights) of a Radio Idyll, a fictionalized account of the Musicradio WABC era.

She is currently a professor at the School of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London. She is well known for her opposition to orthodoxy in current analytic philosophy of mind, and for her use of J. L. Austin's Speech Act Theory to look at the effects of pornography. Education and career Hornsby earned her PhD from the University of Cambridge under the direction of Bernard Williams. She also earned a BA and MPhil from Oxford and London, respectively. She taught at the University of Oxford for 17 years before moving to Birkbeck College, London. She was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1996 to 1997.Hornsby's Profile at Birkbeck College, London. Philosophical work Hornsby's work focuses primarily on the philosophies of mind, action, language, and feminist philosophy. =Actions= Hornsby's action theory is significantly influenced by the philosophy of Donald Davidson. In her book Actions (1980), she argues that actions are events occurring beneath the surface of the skin. The argument for this turns on an ambiguity in the slogan \\"all actions are bodily movements\\". The ambiguity stems from the fact that 'move' is one of a class of verbs that can occur either transitively or intransitively. Nominal expressions containing such verbs are therefore ambiguous: for example, 'the movement of the flag' can refer either to the action of someone's moving the flag or to the resultant movement of the flag. As we only ever answer a question about what someone did by using transitive verbs --- e.g. 'Jack moved his arm', not 'Jack's arm moved' (unless the latter is taken to imply that the former is true) --- the slogan \\"all actions are bodily movements\\" is only true if 'movement' is read transitively. This ambiguity noted, Hornsby then points out that if A VT-s B, then A caused B to VI ('T' and 'I' serving to distinguish between transitive and intransitive uses of the relevant verbs). If Jack raisedT the flag, Jack caused the flag to riseI. As causes and effects must be distinct, we must therefore also distinguish between Jack's raisingT his arm from Jack's arm's risingI, the former causing the latter. So actions are bodily movementsT, which cause bodily movementsI. The final move is to claim that we know from physiology that the causes of bodily movementsI are events that occur beneath the surface of the skin. Therefore, actions occur beneath the surface of the skin. This claim is combined with another: that the most basic description, in the causal sense of 'basic', of an action is as a trying. This arises from accepting a coarse-grained account of the individuation of events, according to which events are particulars that can be described in many different ways. The descriptions are distinguished by the effects of the described event in terms of which they are picked out. For example, the event of my slamming the door may be identical to the event of my waking the cat. The first description picks out the event by reference to the event of the door's being slammed. The second description picks out the event by reference to the event of the cat's waking. The question then is, Is there a description of the events which are actions that picks them out without reference to any effects? Hornsby's answer is that we can describe actions as tryings. I can try to raise my arm and, if successful, my arm will rise. (Note, though, that not all tryings are actions, only the successful ones.) Honours Hornsby is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In July 2017, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. She was elected international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in April 2018.

In the United Kingdom, a common equivalent term for a walker is Zimmer frame, a genericised trademark from Zimmer Holdings, a major manufacturer of such devices and joint replacement parts. Walkers started appearing in the early 1950s. The first US patent was awarded in 1953 to William Cribbes Robb, of Stretford, UK, for a device called \\"walking aid\\", which had been filed with the British patent office in August 1949.Walking Aid ‚Äì US Patent 2656874 Retrieved 2012-03-03 Two variants with wheels were both awarded US patents in May 1957,Invalid Walker ‚Äì US Patent 2792052 Retrieved 2012-03-03Orthopedic Walker ‚Äì US Patent 2792874 Retrieved 2012-03-03 and the first non-wheeled design that was called a \\"walker\\" was patented in 1965 by Elmer F.

Smith of Van Nuys, California.Smith Invalid Walker ‚Äì US Patent 3517677 Retrieved 2012-03-03 Design The basic design consists of a lightweight frame that is about waist high, approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes such as pediatric (for children) or bariatric (for obese persons). Modern walkers are height adjustable and should be set at a height that is comfortable for the user, but will allow the user to maintain a slight bend in their arms. This bend is needed to allow for proper blood circulation through the arms as the walker is used. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached, depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front; additionally felt products adapted to glide with the legs such as adhesive feet, along with tennis balls with holes cut into them to place them onto the legs are also utilized on surfaces such as hardwood, epoxy and linoleum flooring common to institutions.  Use  A woman supporting her weight using a walking frame without wheels The person walks with the frame surrounding their front and sides and their hands provide additional support by holding on to the top of the sides of the frame. Traditionally, a walker is picked up and placed a short distance ahead of the user. The user then walks to it and repeats the process. With the use of wheels and glides, the user may push the walker ahead as opposed to picking it up. This makes for easier use of the walker, as it does not require the user to use their arms to lift the walker. This is beneficial for those with little arm strength. A walker is often used by those who are recuperating from leg or back injuries. It is also commonly used by persons having problems with walking or with mild balance problems. Also related is a hemi-walker, a walker about half the size of a traditional walker which is intended for use by persons whose dexterity is limited or non-existent in one hand or arm. These walkers are more stable than a quad cane (a cane with four points that touch the ground, as opposed to one), but are not recommended as highly as a traditional walker for those who can use it. Walker cane hybrid A walker cane hybrid adjusted to four configurations A walker cane hybridMulti-configuration Walking Apparatus ‚Äì US Patent 8291924 Retrieved 2012-11-09. was introduced in 2012 designed to bridge the gap between an assistive cane and a walker. The hybrid has two legs which provide lateral (side-to-side) support which a cane does not. It can be used with two hands in front of the user, similar to a walker, and provides an increased level of support compared with a cane. It can be adjusted for use with either one or two hands, at the front and at the side, as well as a stair climbing assistant. The hybrid is not designed to replace a walker which normally has four legs and provides four-way support using both hands.  Rollators  A different approach to the walker is the rollator, also called wheeled walker, invented by the Swede Aina Wifalk in 1978, herself a polio sufferer.Innovationsinspiraton: Aina Wifalk ‚Äì Rollatorn (in Swedish) Linked 2012-03-03Rollator awarded reddot design award 2011 Linked 2012-03-03 Although originally a brand name, \\"rollator\\" has become a genericized trademark for wheeled walkers in many countries, and is also the most common type of walker in several European countries. The rollator consists of a frame with three or four large wheels, handlebars and a built-in seat, which allows the user to stop and rest when needed. Rollators are also often equipped with a shopping basket. Rollators are typically more sophisticated than conventional walkers with wheels. They are adjustable in height and are light-weight, yet sturdier than conventional walkers. The handlebars are equipped with hand brakes that can be lifted or pushed downward to instantly stop the rollator. The brakes can also be used in maneuvering the rollator; by braking one side while turning the rollator towards that side a much tighter turning radius can be achieved. A study in the 2000s found an increase in the use of rollators by young people \\"usually in their thirties who are setting a new standard for walking among young people\\". The researchers conclude that this might be helpful in alleviating the stigma that using a rollator currently carries. A Norwegian-made version of Wifalk's rollator won the 2011 Red Dot Design Award in the \\"Life science and medicine\\" class. The European norm for walking aids EN ISO 11199-2:2005 applies to rollators and walking frames.

It is suitable for dogs with mobility problems with hind legs (or unstable). It also helps them to exercise their back legs and can help maintaining any partial mobility they may have left or, in some cases, help to improve it. Zimmer frame The Zimmer frame was invented by Norman Metcalfe. It was aimed to help the disabled walk more easily. It is an improvement of the classic walking aids. Zimmer frames have two wheels in the front.

The territory corresponds with the southeastern part of the present-day states of Lower Saxony, western Saxony-Anhalt and northern Thuringia. Together with Westphalia, central Angria and Nordalbingia it was one of the four main Saxon administrative regions. It should not be confused with East Westphalia (Ostwestfalen).

The bishoprics of Halberstadt and Hildesheim were established in eastern Saxony, bounded by the Oker river, in 804 and 815 respectively. The medieval Duchy of Saxony was divided between the districts of Eastphalia (Ostfalahi), Westphalia and Engern. The Eastphalian territory at the Harz mountain range was the hereditary lands of Henry the Fowler, the first Saxon duke to become King of the Romans in 919, and his descendants of the Ottonian dynasty. They left several Romanesque abbeys and castles, a cultural landscape that today encompasses three World Heritage Sites with the medieval town of Goslar and Quedlinburg, as well as St. Mary's Cathedral and St. Michael's Church at Hildesheim. As the Eastphalian territory bordered on the lands of the Polabian Slavs beyond the Elbe and Saale rivers, it became the starting point of the German Ostsiedlung, started by the invasions of King Henry and continued by the Saxon margraves. After the Welf duke Henry the Lion was placed under Imperial ban in 1180, Eastphalia was increasingly subdivided into smaller states, foremost the Welf Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and the counties of Anhalt, Wernigerode and Blankenburg as well as the Imperial city of Goslar, but also the ecclesiastical territories of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, the prince-bishoprics of Hildesheim and Halberstadt and Quedlinburg Abbey. The Saxon tradition was perpetuated by the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg, who secured for themselves the electoral dignity and later established the Electorate of Saxony on the upper Elbe. Subdivisions Eastphalia consisted of several Gaue. The exact list is not known for sure and differs among authorities. From North to South, the Gaue were (where available, modernized names are used): * Bardengau around L√ºneburg (sometimes considered part of Engern, not Eastphalia) * Drevani (a Slavic tribe) * Chojna (sometimes considered part of Drevani) * Osterwalde (Salzwedel) * Gretinge (Hohne) * Mulbeze * Balsamgau (Stendal) * Flutwidde * Astfala (Hildesheim) * Derlingau (Evessen) * Nordth√ºringgau * Gudingau (Elze) * Valothungo (sometimes considered part of Gudingau) * Scotelingo (sometimes considered part of Gudingau) * Aringo (sometimes considered part of Gudingau) * Flenithi (sometimes considered part of Gudingau) * Suilbergau * Ambergau (sometimes considered part of Salzgau) * Salzgau (Salzgitter) * Densigau (sometimes considered part of Salzgau) * Harzgau (Halberstadt) * Schwabengau * Hassegau (Mansfeld) * Friesenfeld (sometimes considered part of Hassegau)  References  Category:Regions of Lower Saxony Category:Regions of Saxony-Anhalt Category:History of Brunswick Category:Geography of Braunschweig Category:Old Saxony Category:Historical regions ","title":"Eastphalia"},{"id":"2015673","text":"The Swedish Market Court () is a Swedish government agency that answers to the Ministry of Integration and Gender Equality.

His father was a Captain in the border patrol of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Brief biography @ Essekeri. The Mourning of Christ Due to his father's reassignments, the family moved frequently and his education was sporadic until he entered the Cadet School at Karlovac in 1874. After graduation, in 1882, he was assigned to the 78th Osijek infantry regiment under Baron Josip ≈†okƒçeviƒá. He moved up in the ranks quickly, becoming a full Lieutenant in 1886, but resigned the following year because he refused to help support K√°roly Khuen-H√©derv√°ry's policy of Magyarization.\\"Retrospektiva Bele ƒåiko≈°a Sesije: Soldat i symbolist\\" by Igor Bre≈°an @ Slobodna Dalmacija Despite having shown no particular aptitude for art, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied with Julius Victor Berger. While there he received two gold medals, in 1889 and 1891, for scenes depicting ancient history. In 1891, he also enrolled in a special course in Orientalist painting taught by Leopold M√ºller. Salome After M√ºller's death in 1892, he returned to Zagreb and participated in decorating the \\"Pompeian Room\\" at the local offices of the \\"Department of Education and Religious Affairs\\" (now occupied by the \\"\\"). His work there was supervised by the head of the department, Izidor Kr≈°njavi, who would become his patron and mentor. The first thing Kr≈°njavi did was send him on a study trip to Venice with Robert Frange≈°-Mihanoviƒá and Ferdo Kovaƒçeviƒá. This was followed by studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Wilhelm Lindenschmit. He got married there, to his cousin Justine, then embarked on another study trip to Italy. This was followed by more studies in Munich, with Carl von Marr, after which he settled in Zagreb, joining the circle of painters who gathered around Vlaho Bukovac. His mentor, Kr≈°njavi, was not happy about that, believing that Bukovac was a bad influence. This led to a conflict that caused him to leave Zagreb, in 1895, taking a job as a drawing teacher in Ogulin. A year later, he was back in Zagreb, with his own studio and reconciled with Kr≈°njavi. In 1902, he left Zagreb again; this time largely for economic reasons, and travelled to America with fellow painter Robert Auer. After a mostly unsuccessful year, he came back and opened a private art school, together with Menci Klement Crnƒçiƒá. Four years later he, Crnƒçiƒá, Auer, Frange≈°-Mihanoviƒá, , Oton Ivekoviƒá and Branko ≈†enoa would join together to help create the \\"Royal College for Arts and Crafts\\" (now the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Zagreb).

He bridged the gap in Russian opera composition between Mikhail Glinka and the later generation of The Five and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  Biography  Dargomyzhsky was born in Troitsko village, Belyovsky District, Tula Governorate, and educated in Saint Petersburg. He was already known as a talented musical amateur when in 1833 he met Mikhail Glinka and was encouraged to devote himself to composition. His opera Esmeralda (libretto by composer, based on Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame) was composed in 1839 (performed 1847), and his Rusalka was performed in 1856; but he had little success or recognition either at home or abroad, except in Belgium, until the 1860s, when he became the elder statesman, but not a member, of The Five. His last opera, The Stone Guest, is his most famous work, known as a pioneering effort in melodic recitative. With the orchestration and the end of the first scene left incomplete at his death, it was finished by C√©sar Cui and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and was much prized by The Five for what was perceived as its progressive approach to operatic expression. It was premiered in 1872, but never became a lasting standard operatic repertoire item. Dargomyzhsky also left some unfinished opera projects, among them an attempted setting of Pushkin's Poltava, from which a duet survives. Besides operas, his other compositions include numerous songs, piano pieces, and some orchestral works. He died in Saint Petersburg in 1869, aged 55.

Ramayana reached Laos much later than Cambodia and Thailand (Siam) which caused the loss of its original Hindu influence and affected local adaptation. Similar to some Malay versions of the Hikayat Seri Rama, the epic has lost the association with Hinduism and is instead considered a Jataka Story, a previous lifetime of the Buddha. It is also very popular in some parts of Northeastern Thailand, or Isan, a region of Thailand populated by many Lao-speaking people and formerly part of Lanxang. Names Phra Lak Phra Ram is named after two principal characters, the brothers Phra Lak, or Lakshaman, and Phra Ram, or Rama. Since Phra Ram is considered the hero, it is believed the altered name was chosen for euphony. Veteran dance performers of Luang Prabang, however, say that Phra Lak comes first in deference to his voluntary assistance of Phra Ram, whose actions were obligatory to his kingship.J√§hnichen, G. (2009). Re- designing the role of phalak and pharam in modern Lao Ramayana. Wacana Seni Journal of Art Discourse, 8, p 3-4. Since it also considered a Jataka tale, it is referred to as Phra Ram Xad√¥k (‡∫û‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫£‡∫≤‡∫°‡∫ä‡∫≤‡∫î‡∫ª‡∫Å, p ∞rƒÅ î r√°Àêm s√°Àê d√≥k). It was also called Rammakien (‡∫£‡∫≤‡∫°‡∫°‡∫∞‡∫Å‡∫Ω‡∫ô, R√°Àêm mƒÅ î kian), but this the name for this other regional varieties in the Ramayana in general. Introduction to Laos Lao legends attribute to the introduction of the Phra Ram Xad√¥k via the first king of Lane Xang, Chao Fa Ngoum, who arrived with his soldiers, artists, dancers, concubines, poets from musicians from Angkor who would have been familiar with the Reamker. Yet Indic civilizations knew of what is now Yunnan in China, as \\"Gandhara\\" no later than the second century B.C.Iyengar, K. R. S. (2006). Asian variations in ramayana. New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi. p. 247. Hindu culture, language and religion spread into that part of the world incident to the cultural achievements of the Sahavahanas (230 BC‚ÄìAD 220.) Though definitive dates cannot be established for the gradual Tai inland migration from China, transmission of the epic likely occurred much sooner than the traditional date. Tai tribes definitely settled on the fringes of highly Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer culture, adopting much of Indic learning and knowledge. As those kingdoms receded, the Lao came to venerate the earlier Hindu temples, often decorated in Ramayana and the Mahabharata motifs, such as at Vat Phou in Champassak. Earlier versions remained somewhat similar to other versions, but by the 18th century, the versions are completely localised. Although Theravada Buddhism was known to the Mekong River Tai tribes as early as the 7th or 8th century B.C., it wasn't until the 14th or 15th centuries that a re-invigorated Theravada Buddhism supplanted earlier animist, Hindu, or Mahayana Buddhist loyalties.Saveda, A. (1994). Laos: a country study. [Replaces 1971 version.]. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved from http://countrystudies.us/laos/Charles, I. (2007). Buddhism, power and political order. New York: Routledge. This would have also seen introduction of the Dasaratha Jataka, an ancient Buddhist crystallisation of the story.Richman, P. (1991). p. 54. By the 18th century, the manuscripts are completely adapted to Lao culture and Theravada Buddhist religion.p. 18. Religious significance Although the Hindu nature of the Ramayana epic was lost in Laos, it was not completely erased. Indra, Shiva, and Brahma are present in the Phra Ram Xad√¥k. Lao culture has always been oral and visual, and oral tales were often codified into elaborate dance-dramas by the royal courts. Great influence in dance came from Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese culture, with a slight native flair. In kh√¥ne and lakhone dance-dramas, the symbolism, costumes, and story are also more attuned to and influenced by Hindu Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese traditions. Some versions explicitly announce that it is a Jataka tale, while others are generally assumed to be so. Phra Lak and Phra Ram are the epitome of moral leadership, ethics, selflessness, and living true to dharma. Pha Ram is associated with a previous life of Siddartha Gautama, while his cousin Hapmanasouane (Ravanna) is often compared to Buddha's cousin Phra Thevathat or Buddha's final impasse to enlightenment, Phra Man. The parallels include their religious knowledge and generally moral superiority but also their ruin by greed and desire.Richman, P. (1991). Many rƒÅmƒÅya·πáas: the diversity of a narrative tradition in south asia. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. Hampanasouane as Mara, the personification of worldly desires who tried to tempt the Buddha during meditation, can be seen in both their searches for lust, power, and material gain. The cosmology and some elements are taken from the Tripitaka, such as the greater role of Indra vis-√†-vis Shiva, and Indra asking riddles of religion and Buddhist thought to a young Hapmanasouane.Richman, P. (1991). pp. 62-73 Although important, religiously, it is subordinate to the greater and more chronologically recent Jataka tales of Phra Vet and the annals of the lifetime of Siddhartha Gautama.Holt, J. (2009). Spirits of the place: Buddhism and Lao religious culture. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. p. 267. Animistic elements are not as apparent in the Phra Lak Phra Ram, but it is noteworthy to point out that the scenery takes place along the Mekong River. She is a great goddess and ancestral spirit that is as sacred and quintessentially 'theirs' as the Ganges is to India and a personification of water, bounty, and life. It was also the King of the Nagas that suggested Phra Ram's father move the capital from Maha Thani Si Pan Phao (modern-day Nong Khai, Thailand) across the bank to Chantaboury Sri Sattanak (modern-day Vientiane).Tinh, V. T. (1971). Phra lak phra Ram: a previous life of the buddha [Published on-line 2003.]. (Adapted from text of Vat Kang Tha.), Retrieved from http://www.seasite.niu.edu/lao/otherTopics/PhralakPhralam/index.htm Like most animistic elements, the NƒÅga is seen in both Buddhist and Hindu-influenced contexts, but worship of nagas predates Indian influence in the region, and are common in folktales of Laos and Isan. A unique version of the Phra Lak Phra Ram, the Khwai Thoraphi focuses very much on Sankhip and Palichane's fight with the water buffalo. It was often read at temple, probably in Buddhism's attempt to replace Lao spirit propitiation ceremonies that involved water buffalo sacrifice.Iyengar, K. R. S. (2006) pp. 237-8. Influence on culture and art The importance of Phra Lak Phra Ram to Lao culture can be seen in how ubiquitous it is. It is a mainstay of dance and drama, song, painting, sculpture, religious texts, and manuscripts. It is also seen in the more common arts, such as classical morlam, folklore, and village dances.p. 231. Scenes from court dancers were performed on Lao New Year celebrations, and other Buddhist holidays. The texts are commonly read during sermons. And the tales themselves have been deeply interwoven into local folklore, myth, and legend. Sculpture, lacquerware, carvings, and paintings adorn temples and palaces. The chapters have been intricately crafted into song and dance and accompanying music. Through the Buddhist elements, Lao beliefs of morality and karma are re-affirmed. The first half of Lao versions also establish the mythology for the creation of the Lao polities, land features, and waterways, and it serves as a transmission of culture. * Royal theatre of Luang Prabang CharactersMain characters= Phra Ram (‡∫û‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫£‡∫≤‡∫°, p ∞rƒÅ î r√°Àêm) * Son of Thattaratha, brother of Phra Lak, husband of Nang Sida.

Norfolk Collegiate is accredited by the Virginia Association of Independent Schools (VAIS) and by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It's also a member of the Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools, which includes 10 private schools from the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, as well as a member of the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association.  History  Norfolk Collegiate was founded in 1948 as a Carolton Oaks School in Wards Corner section of Norfolk, Virginia. It began as a kindergarten and preschool in a cottage home in Norfolk. By 1963, the school had graduated its first class of seniors, and 10 years later it changed its name to Norfolk Collegiate School to more accurately reflect its college-preparatory mission. Today, the school is home to 600 students and more than 120 faculty and staff on two campuses, the middle and upper school (Grades 6-12) at 7336 Granby Street, Norfolk, and the lower school (Pre-K3-Grade 5) at 5429 Tidewater Drive, Norfolk. The school boasts several signature programs and learning spaces, such as the lower school's innovative farm-to-table Outdoor Learning Lab and MakerLab 1. The middle and upper school is home to the Meredith Center for the Arts, which showcases the school's arts and technology programs and serves as a venue for the Hampton Roads community. It houses a 425-seat theater, communication arts suite, digital arts classrooms, chorus rooms, MakerLab and more. The latest addition to the school came in September of 2015 with the opening of its $2.6 million athletic complex which features two 70x110 yard, competition-sized, pre-lined artificial, lighted turf fields.  Athletics  Norfolk Collegiate's athletic program offers daily physical education for students in kindergarten through grade 12 and focuses on fitness and nutrition. For student-athletes, an additional focus is placed on healthy competition, teamwork, accountability, goal setting and effective communication in team and individual sports. The athletic program offers more than 50 teams in nearly 20 sports for students in grades 6-12. Students in kindergarten through grade 5 are offered enrichment sports, such as karate, dance, soccer, as well as sport clinics throughout the year. Student-athletes compete in the fall, winter and spring seasons at the middle school, junior varsity and varsity levels.

Its name comes from the facility having two race tracks: a oval and a road course. It was built in 1997 by Honda, as part of the company's effort to bring the IndyCar Series to Japan, helping to increase their knowledge of American open- wheel racing.  Super speedway  left The oval course is the only one of its kind in Japan used for competitive racing. It is a low-banked, 1.549-mile-long (2.493 km) egg-shaped course, with turns three and four being much tighter than turns one and two. On March 28, 1998, CART held the inaugural Indy Japan 300 at Twin Ring Motegi Speedway. The race was won by Mexican driver Adri√°n Fern√°ndez. CART continued racing at Twin Ring Motegi Speedway from 1998‚Äì2002. In 2003, Honda entered the Indy Racing League and the race became a part of the IRL schedule. In addition to Indy car racing, the track has also hosted a single NASCAR exhibition race in 1998. Honda, which had built the oval for the express purpose of developing its oval-racing program for Indy car racing, did not win a race at the track for its first six years of operation. In 2004, Dan Wheldon took the first win for Honda on the oval. In 2008, the Motegi oval gained additional publicity when Danica Patrick became the first woman to win an Indycar race, beating H√©lio Castroneves for her first and only Indycar victory. The 2011 season was the last season of Indycar in Motegi. It had been dropped from the calendar as organizers looked to maximize viewing audiences. The road course, rather than the super speedway, was used for the 2011 race due to damage to the oval track resulting from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. The oval is not presently used for racing and even has been used as additional parking space during MotoGP events, but is still used for Honda's annual Thanks Day event showcasing various Honda road and racing vehicles, mainly from the nearby Honda Collection Hall, with Takuma Sato running a lap of the course in his 2017 Indianapolis 500 winning car seven years since the last IndyCar race in the oval. = Track length of paved oval = The track length is disputed by series that run at Twin Ring Motegi. The NASCAR timing and scoring use a length of .1998 NASCAR Thunder Special Motegi at racing- reference.info This length was used by CART in their races between 1998 and 2002, too.1998 race result on champcarstats.com The IRL measured in 2003 a length of .2003 race result on champcarstats.com This length was also used in the following races till 2010.2010 race result on champcarstats.com =NASCAR history= Mike Skinner won the only NASCAR Cup Series exhibition race held at the track in 1998, the Coca-Cola 500. Skinner won driving the No.31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing. The race was most noted for being the first oval track NASCAR race in Japan as well as being the first in which Dale Earnhardt and his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., competed with one another, driving No.3 and No.1 Coca-Cola Chevrolets, respectively. The track also held the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West in 1999 with Kevin Richards getting the win.  Road course  The road course is 4.8 kilometers long and is unique in sharing garage and grandstand facilities with the oval course, but being entirely separate otherwise. Although they are separate tracks, it is impossible for races to occur simultaneously on the two courses; to access the oval track, teams must cross the road course pit and front straight. The road course also runs in the opposite direction from the oval; clockwise, rather than counter-clockwise. The course itself is built in a stop-start straight-hairpin style, which flows differently than many similarly-sized tracks. By Japanese standards the circuit is exceptionally flat, with only a slight elevation rise towards the hairpin turn. The road course is much busier than the oval track, with Formula Nippon visiting twice, Super GT and Super Taikyu cars once each, and local events almost every weekend. The road course can be used in three ways: the full course, or two \\"short courses\\" can be made, using connecting roadways. These short courses are usually used for junior formula events, such as Formula 4 and FJ1600. The road course is also a popular motorcycle racing track, with the MotoGP usually visiting once a year, as well as several Japanese national bike racing series. It has hosted the Pacific motorcycle Grand Prix from 2000 to 2003 and the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix since 2004. Other facilities In addition to the main racing complex, Twin Ring Motegi features a second road course (called the \\"North Short Course\\") for karting and Formula 4 events, as well as a 1/4 mile dirt track for modified and sprint car racing. In addition, the FIM Trials series visits the track every year for the world trials championship. Therefore, an outdoor trials course exists on the facility. Outside of racing, Twin Ring has the Honda Collection Hall, which features historic Honda racing and production cars and motorcycles, and Honda Fan Fun Lab, which features Honda's next generation technologies such as robotics, fuel-cell vehicles and aviation. Honda also operates a technology demonstration center on the site, as well as educational centers. In 2009, a cafe opened which was named after the Gran Turismo video games.http://www.vg247.com/2009/04/03/gran-turismo-cafe-opens-in-japan/  Track difficulties  Twin Ring is a separate-but-combined road-and-oval track (as opposed to the \\"roval\\" tracks common in the United States), and the decision to include a full road course contained largely within the oval necessitated design compromises. For spectators, sightlines can be extremely poor for road course races, as the grandstands are much further back than usual. The oval course blocks the view of much of the road course, including the best passing point on the track , and several large-screen televisions are needed. Seating outside the grandstand is limited to areas of the infield and along the 750-metre backstraight of the road course. Track access is a major concern, with only two entry and exit points by a two-lane public road. Motegi is not a particularly large town, and accommodation is virtually non-existent close to the track, except for the on-site hotel. Train links to the area are extremely limited (the major regional lines, JR East and Tobu Railway do not service the area), nor has a planned superhighway been completed. Thus the stated track capacity (about 65,000) is dictated largely by traffic flow, not by actual seating capacity (estimated to be nearly 100,000 for road-course events, 80,000 for the oval). In 2011 Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo proposed to boycott the MotoGP race out of fears for their health from radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant even though all the independent scientific experts including the World Health Organization and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency had stated that it is safe to live permanently 80 km or more from the plant. Motegi is more than 120 km from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In the end, all the teams showed up for the race. In popular media As a large recently constructed Japanese circuit, Twin Ring Motegi has and continues to be utilised virtually in a large number of electronic video games, both in arcade machines and in PC and console games for home use. * In Honda's 2005 Clio Awards winning commercial \\"Impossible Dream\\", the sequence in which the BAR Formula One car is driven into the bridge was filmed at the circuit. *During the opening sequence of Kamen Rider Agito, the three main Kamen Riders are shown riding around the circuit, as Honda is the series sponsor. *During the ending sequence of Engine Sentai Go-onger, the series' characters are shown dancing on the main straight of the road course.

Alexander (born April 13, 1958) is a Roman Catholic priest of the diocese of Honolulu. Prior to February 1, 2006, he served the diocese as diocesan theologian and pastor of a clustered parish known as the Manoa- Punahou Catholic Community. He was born in Sagami, Japan. He was educated in Hawai‚Äòi at Saint Anthony of Padua Elementary School in Kailua, and Damien Memorial High School in Honolulu. He completed his secondary education in 1976 at Mount Vernon High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He studied at Saint Meinrad College Seminary in southern Indiana, as well as the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. He also studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a doctorate in sacred theology in 1993. Priestly ministry After completing his seminary studies in the American College of Louvain (Leuven), he was ordained to the presbyterate for the diocese of Honolulu at Saint John Vianney Church in Kailua on October 18, 1985 where he served as a parochial vicar. From 1987 until 1990 he served as an associate director for adult religious education/catechesis for the Diocese of Honolulu, with an office at Saint Stephen Diocesan Center. In 1989, he was appointed interim pastor for the topside parishes on the island of Molokai. He created one of the first clustered parishes by combining these communities into the Molokai Catholic Community, where he served until 1990. After his doctoral studies in Rome, he returned to Hawaii in 1993 to be appointed diocesan theologian and director of the diocesan lay ministry training program called Servant Leadership. He became founding executive director of the Hawaii Catholic Conference, the public policy arm of the Roman Catholic Church in the State of Hawaii, from 1994 until 1999. In 1998, Bishop Francis DiLorenzo appointed him as pastor of Sacred Heart Church and Maryknoll School in Punahou. This also included the Korean Catholic Community. In 1999 he was subsequently also appointed as pastor of Saint Pius X Church in Manoa. The two parishes were clustered and have since been called the Manoa-Punahou Catholic Community. Since his public policy days, Alexander has testified on legislation addressing homelessness, housing (including the rental housing trust fund), same-sex marriage, euthanasia/assisted suicide and domestic violence. As vicar general he led major initiatives in strategic planning (the first ever plan for the diocese won the 2008 American Planning Association Hawaii Chapter's Donald Wolbrink Chapter Achievement award), the diocesan capital campaign (which raised gifts and pledges over $57 million on a $30 million goal), and restructuring the central administration of the diocese. Bishop Clarence Silva appointed Father Alexander to the office of vicar general for the Diocese of Honolulu effective February 1, 2006. Bishop Silva appointed Father Alexander as his moderator of the curia, on May 5, 2006. Alexander has also served as vice-president and chief executive officer of The Augustine Educational Foundation. Alexander resigned as the Homeless Coordinator for the Hawaii Governor's Office in January 2012 due to an affair with a woman while he was an ordained Catholic Priest.

The Belger Arts Center is also located in the district. First Fridays Art galleries generally open new shows on the first Friday of each month from 6 to 9 pm. This has become one of the region's most popular regular events as thousands of people flock to the Crossroads for gallery \\"open houses\\" amidst the Crossroads's unique atmosphere. There are more than 60 galleries in the Crossroads district, making it one of the five largest arts districts in the US. Crossroads Music Festival First held in late August 2005, the Crossroads Music Festival is an annual event organized by Spice of Life Productions, which features local music artists. The 2005 event was held at Grinder's Sculpture Park (CrossroadsKC) at 18th Street and Locust Street. In addition to concert performances, offerings include short films by local independent filmmakers and booths offering apparel by local designers, local independent print media, and carnival games. Tax abatements In 2007, one of Kansas City's development agencies began a program to allow property tax abatements for art-related business who would otherwise be priced out of the neighborhood by fast-rising property values. Neighborhood leaders lobbied for the program to prevent the \\"Soho Effect\\" of gentrification. Tax abatements had been granted to developers to attract new residents to the neighborhood with high-end condominiums and lofts next to the galleries.

Although he wrote a range of works, he had his greatest success as a historical novelist, particularly with Eclipse of the Crescent Moon and Slave of the Huns. Life G√°rdonyi was born in Ag√°rdpuszta, Kingdom of Hungary, the son of a machinist on the estate of an aristocrat in Western Hungary. He graduated at a college for teachers and worked for some years as a teacher and Catholic cantor. He married M√°ria Moln√°r in 1885, but their marriage was unhappy and they separated in 1892. G√°rdonyi's career as a writer started off when he began writing for magazines and newspapers in the mid-1880s. His first successes were the satirical \\"G√∂re G√°bor\\" letters on rural life, works which he later repudiated. Around the turn of the century, he started to tackle historical themes in writing, which resulted in a series of fine novels. He moved to Eger (today's northern Hungary) in 1897 with his mother and lived there until his death. He is also buried there, with his tomb bearing the inscription Csak a teste (\\"Only his body\\"). The house where he lived and did most of his writing is now preserved as a museum. Best known workEclipse of the Crescent Moon= G√°rdonyi's most famous novel Egri csillagok was published in 1899. The title translates literally as Stars of Eger, but it was published in English as Eclipse of the Crescent Moon. It is set around a famous siege of the town of Eger in Hungary by the Ottomans in the year 1552. In 2005 this book was voted \\"the most popular novel of Hungary\\" by viewers of the television programme Big Read (A Nagy K√∂nyv). =Slave of the Huns= In the opinion of some people his best work was A l√°thatatlan ember, published in 1901. The title translates literally as The Invisible Man, but it was published in English as Slave of the Huns. It is set around the time of Attila the Hun. Although these two novels are very well known in Hungary, translations into English and other European languages only became widely published in the late 20th century.

He was also the leader of All Ethiopian Unity Party from 1996 to 2013. He died at age of 80 on October 6, 2016, while receiving treatment at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Early life Hailu was born in Northern Shewa, Ethiopia. He attended elementary and high school in Addis Ababa at Dagmawi Minilik School. At the age of 18 he moved to the United States to pursue higher education and enrolled at Wayne State University. He did both his bachelor's and master's degree in Civil Engineering and returned to Ethiopia in 1960 soon after his graduation. He was married to Almaz Zewde whom he met at his friend's wedding. They had six children together.https://www.diretube.com/the-biography-of-eng- hailu-shawl_a4b9dd017.html Professional career After returning to Ethiopia, Hailu started his career as a research engineer at Abay Gorge by working with the team who has been studying about the gorge in a project funded by the US government. Following that he worked for 13 years in the different managerial positions at Shell international. In 1973‚Äì1974 at the height of the Ethiopian student movement, Hailu was appointed as head of Ethiopian Transportation Authority and served for three years. Following the Somalia invasion on Ethiopia in 1977 he was called for national service and participated in designing an aircraft for the Ethiopian air force. After the Somali war was ended by Ethiopian victory, Hailu was appointed general manager of Ethiopian Sugar Corporation and managing director of Wonji Sugar Company and Metehara Sugar Company and then Minister for State Farms Development of Ethiopia. At the height of Qey Shibir or Red Terror Hailu spent his time squabbling and fighting with Derge officials in objection to their political and development policies. In mid-1978, 24 hours away from being killed for helping an EPRP operative escape, Hailu left the country in exile to the United States. In 1983 Hailu formed a successful company, Shawel Consultancy inc, which is now run by his economist son Dr. Shawel Hailu. Until his return to Ethiopia to join politics He was general manager of Shawl Consultancy which conducted construction work in cooperation with international institutions such as UN, and African Development Bank. Political career Hailu Shawul joined politics by succeeding Professor Asrat Woldeyes as the head of the All- Amhara People's Organization (AAPO). However, some sources dispute his presidency and show that the AAPO's split into two factions - the All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) and the United Ethiopian Democratic Party-Medhin - was due to Hailu Shawel not gaining the presidency and thus creating his own party. Many believe that the division was tactically mediated by the EPRDF government interference.Antony Shaw, \\"Some thoughts on the CUD and other opposition parties\\" , Sidama Concern, published 1 December 2005 (accessed 26 October 2009) Late in 2004, a year before 2005 general election, a series of negotiations started among Hailu shawel, Lidetu Ayalew, leader of Ethiopian Democratic Party, Berhanu Nega, the then leader of Rainbow Ethiopia: Movement for Democracy and Social Justice, and Chekol Getahun, the leader of Ethiopian Democratic League, which led to the formation of Coalition for Unity and Democracy. Hailu was elected leader of the CUD to challenge the ruling EPRDF party on 2005 general election. During 2005 Ethiopian general election, the CUD under Hailu's leadership was able to win 137 out of 138 seats of the Addis Ababa city council and 109 seats in the federal parliament. The result was disputed both by the ruling EPRDF and CUD. Following the dispute and alleged voting irregularities Observers from the European Union assessed that closing and counting processes negatively in almost half of urban polling stations, counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, and there was a lack of transparency in the results.EU-EOM, \\"Final Report\\", p. 2 The situation deteriorated further as the negotiation between EPRDF and CUD fall apart and finally on late October 2005, protest erupted across the country against the ruling party. As a result of the protests, the government placed Hailu Shawul and other high-ranking leaders under house arrest for weeks. When the CUD held an initially peaceful protest the highly armed government security forces augmented the situation by using excessive force which turned it violent, leading to the deaths of more than 200 peaceful demonstrators in the capital alone and an unknown number in the countryside in October 2005. The government claimed the death of four police officers. Hailu Shawel and 23 other CUD leaders were arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason and genocide[Wenedesen S].\\"Jailed Ethiopia opposition head risks blindness\\" (Sudan Tribune) While in imprisoned, on December 2005, Hailu Shawul with other CUD prisoners went on a hunger strike, which has aggravated his diabetes and threatens his vision. As a result of the hunger strike, Hailu Shawul has lost much of his sight,Jailed opposition leader losing sight, failing health (Ethiomedia) and gained access to medical care only after being visited by foreign diplomats.\\"Hailu Shawel admitted to hospital\\" (Ethiomedia) On December 2007 the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia pardoned all twenty- four of the CUD members after they pleaded guilty and made public apologies; his fellow CUD member, Birtukan Mideksa, who was imprisoned and pardoned with him, claims that their pleas and apologies were coerced. Illness and death After being freed from prison, Hailu Shawul traveled to America in January 2008 to get medical care for his diabetes. In mid-2013 he resigned from his tenure as leader of All Ethiopian Unity Party due to his deteriorating health condition. From 2014 to 2016 he spent his time abroad receiving medical treatment.

In 1976, in response to the Israeli government's announcement of a plan to expropriate thousands of dunams of land for state purposes, a general strike and marches were organized in Arab towns from the Galilee to the Negev.Levy and Weiss, 2002, p. 200. In the ensuing confrontations with the Israeli army and police, six unarmed Arab citizens were killed, about one hundred were wounded, and hundreds of others arrested.Israeli Arab leader on Land Day: We'll fight Israel's 'rising fascism' by Yoav Stern and Jack Khouri, Haaretz, June 15, 2008Byman, 2002, p. 132.Thousands of Arabs mark Land Day by Yaakov Lappin, Jerusalem Post, March 30, 2008 Scholarship on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict recognizes Land Day as a pivotal event in the struggle over land and in the relationship of Arab citizens to the Israeli state and body politic. It is significant in that it was the first time since 1948 that Arabs in Israel organized a response to Israeli policies as a Palestinian national collective. An important annual day of commemoration in the Palestinian national political calendar ever since, it is marked not only by Arab citizens of Israel, but also by Palestinians all over the world.Schulz and Hammer, 2003, p. 77. Background fellahat) from Battir, a village between Jerusalem and Bethlehem taking produce to market (1910) The Arabs of Mandatory Palestine were a largely agrarian people, 75% of whom made their living off the land before the establishment of the Israeli state.Herb and Kaplan, 1999, p. 260. \\"[...] the geographical scale of the Arab identity in Israel has changed dramatically a few times during the twentieth century. Prior to the disastrous 1948 defeat, they were an integral part of the agrarian Palestinian society that was gradually building its national consciousness.\\" After the Palestinian exodus and the effects of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, land continued to play an important role in the lives of the 156,000 Palestinian Arabs who remained inside what became the state of Israel, serving as the source of communal identity, honor, and purpose.Nassar and Heacock, 1990, p. 29. A popular slogan that emerged among Palestinians after 1967 war was al-Ard qabl al'Ard (\\"land before honor\\"). The Israeli government adopted in 1950 the Law of Return to facilitate Jewish immigration to Israel and the absorption of Jewish refugees. Israel's Absentees' Property Law of March 1950 transferred the property rights of absentee owners to a government- appointed Custodian of Absentee Property. It was also used to confiscate the lands of Arab citizens of Israel who \\"are present inside the state, yet classified in law as 'absent'.\\" The number of \\"present-absentees\\" or internally displaced Palestinians from among the 1.2 million Arab citizens of Israel is estimated (in 2001) to be 200,000, or some 20% of the total Palestinian Arab population in Israel. Salman Abu-Sitta estimates that between 1948 and 2003 more than of land was expropriated from Arab citizens of Israel (present-absentees and otherwise).Salman Abu Sitta in Masalha and Said, 2005, p. 287, footnote 33. Sitta also gives an estimate for the total land area owned by Arab citizens prior to the expropriations: . Half of this total, some , had been expropriated by the early 1960s. According to Oren Yiftachel, public protest against state policies and practices from among the Arabs in Israel was rare prior to the mid-1970s, owing to a combination of factors including military rule over their localities, poverty, isolation, fragmentation, and their peripheral position in the new Israeli state.Yiftachel, 2006, p. 170. Those protests that did take place against land expropriations and the restrictions Arab citizens were subject to under military rule (1948‚Äì1966) are described by Shany Payes as \\"sporadic\\" and \\"limited\\", due to restrictions on rights to freedom of movement, expression and assembly characteristic of that period.Payes, 2005, p. 7. While the political movement Al-Ard (\\"The Land\\") was active for about a decade, it was declared illegal in 1964, and the most notable antigovernment occasions otherwise were the May Day protests staged annually by the Communist party. =Catalyzing events= Arraba from the road leading to its northern limit The government of Israel declared its intention to expropriate lands in the Galilee for official use, affecting some 20,000 dunams of land between the Arab villages of Sakhnin and Arraba, of which 6,300 dunams was Arab- owned.Endelman, 1997, p. 292. On March 11, 1976, the government published the expropriation plan.Demythologizing Land Day by Jerusalem Post Yiftachel writes that the land confiscations and expansion of Jewish settlements in the northern Galilee formed part of the government's continuing strategy aimed at the Judaization of the Galilee which itself constituted both a response to and catalyst for \\"Palestinian resistance\\", culminating in the events of Land Day.Yiftachel, 2006, p. 69. According to Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the land was to be used to construct \\"[...] eight Jewish industrial villages, in implementation of the so-called Galilee Development Plan of 1975. In hailing this plan, the Ministry of Agriculture openly declared that its primary purpose was to alter the demographic nature of Galilee in order to create a Jewish majority in the area.\\" Orly Helpern of The Jerusalem Post writes that the lands were confiscated by the government for security purposes, and that they were subsequently used to build a military training camp, as well as new Jewish settlements. Yifat Holzman-Gazit places the 1976 announcement within the framework of a larger plan devised in 1975. Some 1900 dunams of privately owned Arab land were to be expropriated to expand the Jewish town of Carmiel. Additionally, the plan envisaged the establishment between 1977 and 1981 of 50 new Jewish settlements known as mitzpim (singular: mitzpe) which would consist of fewer than 20 families each. The plan called for these to be located between clusters of Arab villages in the central Galilee affecting some 20,000 dunams (30% of which were to be expropriated from Arabs, 15% from Jews, with the remainder constituting state-owned land).Holzman-Gazit, 2007, p. 140. David McDowall identifies the resumption of land seizures in the Galilee and the acceleration of land expropriations in the West Bank in the mid-1970s as the immediate catalyst for both the Land Day demonstration and similar demonstrations that were taking place contemporaneously in the West Bank. He writes: \\"Nothing served to bring the two Palestinian communities together politically more than the question of land.\\"McDowall, 1990, p. 157-158. =Protest of 1976= Tawfiq Ziad addressing a crowd. Location and date unknown. The government decision to confiscate the land was accompanied by the declaration of a curfew to be imposed on the villages of Sakhnin, Arraba, Deir Hanna, Tur'an, Tamra, and Kabul, effective from 5 p.m. on March 29, 1976. Local Arab leaders from the Rakah party, such as Tawfiq Ziad, who also served as the mayor of Nazareth, responded by calling for a day of general strikes and protests against the confiscation of lands to be held on March 30.Kimmerling and Migdal, 1993, p. 178. On March 18 the heads of the local Arab councils, members of the Labour Party, met in Shefa-'Amr and voted against supporting the day of action. When news of the decision became public a demonstration developed outside the municipal buildings and was dispersed with tear gas.Pappe, Ilan (2011) The Forgotten Palestinians: A History of the Palestinians in Israel. Yale. . pp.130,131 The government declared all demonstrations illegal and threatened to fire 'agitators', such as schoolteachers who encouraged their students to participate, from their jobs.Abdo and Lentin, 2002, p. 139. The threats were not effective, however, and many teachers led their students out of the classrooms to join the general strike and marches that took place throughout the Arab towns in Israel, from the Galilee in the north to the Negev in south. Solidarity strikes were also held almost simultaneously in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and in most of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.Frankel, 1988, p. 40. The events of the day were unprecedented. According to the International Jewish Peace Union, \\"To preempt incidents inside Israel on Land Day, about 4,000 policemen, including a helicopter-borne tactical unit and army units, were deployed in the Galilee [...]\\"International Jewish Peace Union (IJPU), 1987, p. 26. During the protests, four unarmed demonstrators were shot dead by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and two more by police. Nahla Abdo and Ronit Lentin write that three of the dead were women, and that, \\"the army was allowed to drive armoured vehicles and tanks along the unpaved roads of various villages of the Galilee.\\" About 100 Arabs were wounded and hundreds of others were arrested. The New York Times reports that the killings were carried out by police during \\"riots in the Galilee region to protest over Israeli expropriation of Arab land.\\" In Arutz Sheva, Ezra HaLevi writes that the riots started the night before, \\"with Israeli-Arabs throwing rocks and firebombs at police and soldiers. The riots continued the next day and intensified, resulting in many wounded members of Israeli security forces and the death of the six Arab rioters.\\" Yosef Goell, writing in The Jerusalem Post, says that, \\"What actually set off the rioting that led to the deaths was a wild attack by hundreds of inflamed young Arabs on an unsuspecting IDF convoy driving on the road by the villages of Sakhnin, Arrabe and Deir Hanna. There was no prior provocation on the part of that IDF convoy, unless one insists on seeing a provocation in the very presence of an Israeli army unit in the heart of Israeli Galilee.\\" A 2003 Israeli government document notes that, \\"Arab public figures tried to limit the protests, but lost control over the events. The protestors burnt tires, blocked roads, and threw rocks and molotov cocktails.\\" Placing the six fatalities within the context of \\"severe clashes\\" between protestors and security forces, it is also noted that there were many injuries on both sides. Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal write that Land Day differed from the Kafr Qasim massacre in that the Palestinians in Israel exhibited a \\"[...] daring confidence and political awareness totally lacking in 1956; this time Arab citizens were not passive and submissive. Instead they initiated and coordinated political activity at the national level, responding to police brutality with their own violence.\\"Kimmerling and Migdal, 2006, p. 196. Impact During the Land Day events, a new sense of national pride, together with anger toward the state and police and sorrow over the dead protesters, developed among the Arab community in Israel. A split erupted between the Arab political parties of Rakah and Abnaa al-Balad. Committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, Rakah held major reservations about the involvement of Palestinians from the West Bank. Conversely, Abnaa al-Balad's commitment to the establishment a single democratic Palestine saw the issues of land, equality, the refugees and the occupation as \\"a comprehensive, integral and indivisible whole.\\" While Rakah remained committed to a two-state solution, it charted a delicate balance, expressing a Palestinian identity more clearly so as to be more in tune with community sentiment. For example, shortly after Land Day, Tawfiq Ziad declared that, \\"From now on there will be no communities and religious groups but only a single Arab minority, part of the Palestinian nation.\\" Government compound named after Yitzhak Rabin in Upper Nazareth Land Day also resulted in the Arabs gaining a presence in Israeli politics in that they could no longer be ignored. Arab civil society in Israel began coordinating with one another more and protests against government policies became more frequent with a focus on three major issues: land and planning policies, socioeconomic conditions, and Palestinian national rights. The protest did little to stop the 1975 land expropriation plan. The number of mitzpim established reached 26 in 1981 and 52 in 1988. These mitzpim and the \\"development towns\\" of Upper Nazareth, Ma'alot, Migdal Ha'emeq and Carmiel significantly altered the demographic composition of the Galilee. While Arabs had comprised 92% of the population of the Galilee in the years following Israel's establishment, by 1994, that number was reduced to 72% out of a regional population of 680,000, with Jews making up the remaining 28%. Large-scale expropriations of land in the Galilee have generally been avoided by Israeli governments since the 1980s. Studies of Israeli media coverage Israeli media coverage of Land Day has been analyzed and critiqued by Israeli academics. Alina Koren's 1994 study of seven major Israeli newspapers found that coverage of the preparations and outcome of the day was extensive in March‚ÄìApril 1976, with reports relying almost entirely on statements from official Israeli information sources such as ministers, advisers or \\"experts on Arabs.\\" Hardly any space was devoted to the voices of Arab organizers and participants. All of the newspapers examined, whatever their ideological differences, minimized the causes, emphasizing instead two main themes: portraying the demonstrations as the work of a marginal and unrepresentative minority and describing them as a potential threat to state security and law and order. Daniel Bar-Tal and Yona Teichman write: \\"Of special importance is the finding that all the newspapers delegitimized the participants, as communists, nationalists, extremists, agitators, inciters, enemies or violent people.\\"Bar-Tal and Teichman, 2005, pp. 153‚Äì154. Bar-Tal and Teichman also cite a 2000 study by professors Gadi Wolfsfeld, Eli Avraham and Issam Aburaiya that analyzed coverage by Haaretz and Yediot Aharonot of the annual commemorations between 1977 and 1997 and found that reports prior to the event each year also relied heavily on news items from the police and military sources. The focus was on security preparations, with reports on Arabs limited to the agitation and incitement put forward by their leadership. Information on the reasons for the protest was provided in between 6% to 7% of the stories published. Almost all of the reporters were Jewish, and only Haaretz had a reporter specially assigned to cover the Arab population. The event was framed within the context of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict with Arab demonstrators defined as enemies, rather than citizens making demands of their government. A March 22, 1997 editorial in Yediot Ahronoth for example read: \\"The right to protest does not include the right to run riot, to close roads, to throw stones at passing vehicles. ... Again, it has to be made clear to Israeli Arabs that most of their Israeliness is based on their loyalty that they owe to their country and its laws. If they don't want these laws no one is preventing them from leaving.\\" Legacy Land Day poster (1984) by Abdel Rahman Al Muzain For Palestinians, Land Day has since become a day of commemoration and tribute to those who have fallen in the struggle to hold onto their land and identity. Often serving as a day for the expression of political discontent for Arab citizens of Israel, particularly surrounding issues of equal land and citizenship rights, in 1988, they declared that Land Day should serve as \\"a Palestinian-Israeli civil national day of commemoration and a day of identification with Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, to be marked by yearly demonstrations and general strikes.\\" Not only did Land Day work to forge political solidarity among Arab citizens of Israel, but it also worked \\"[...] in cementing the acceptance of the \\"1948 Arabs\\" back into the larger Palestinian world and into the heart of mainstream Palestinian nationalism.\\" The day is commemorated annually by Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and further afield in refugee camps and among the Palestinian diaspora worldwide. In 2007, the Press Center of the Palestinian National Authority described it \\"...as a remarkable day in the history of the Palestinian people's struggle, as the Palestinians in such a particular day embrace the land of their ancestors, their identity and their existence.\\" However, in recent years, many observers have noted that the Arab population inside Israel seems less enthusiastic about the protests, despite the organizers' efforts to promote hype. Many see this as a sign of growing reconciliation on the grass-roots level. =Annual commemoration and protests= A Palestinian woman and child at a Land Day rally in Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip An Israeli judiciary study reports that the general strike and marches carried out in Israel during the annual commemoration of 2000 generally proceeded peacefully, with the exception of the protest in Sakhnin. There, hundreds of youth gathered and moved towards the Israeli military base adjacent to the village to the west. Uprooting the fences, they penetrated the base, and waved the Palestinian flag inside. Arab public figures who were there to make speeches attempted to subdue them, but were met with hostility and even beatings. Border police forces who arrived to reinforce the base were stoned by the protestors, some of whom were wearing masks and set fires in the woods. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to push the protestors back towards the main road where clashes continued. Muhammad Zidan, Head of the Arab Higher Followup Committee, was among those wounded in the clashes, and a 72-year-old woman from Sakhnin was reported to have died in the hospital after injuries sustained from tear gas inhalation. A 2006 report in The Jerusalem Post states that in annual commemorations of the day by Arab citizens today, Israeli security forces are on alert but do not interfere in the protests. During the Second Intifada in 2001, on the 25th anniversary of Land Day, which fell on a Friday, the weekly \\"Day of Rage\\", Palestinians were called upon to demonstrate. Tens of thousands of Arab citizens, joined by some Jews, demonstrated in peaceful marches inside Israel, carrying Palestinian flags. During demonstrations in the West Bank, four Palestinians were killed and 36 wounded in Nablus when Israeli forces used live ammunition against protesters throwing stones and molotov cocktails. In Ramallah, one Palestinian was shot dead and 11 others injured when soldiers clashed with 2,000 demonstrators who burned pictures of Ariel Sharon and waved Iraqi and Palestinian flags; Palestinian gunmen also joined the clashes after an hour, drawing heavy Israeli fire from tank-mounted machine guns. There were also demonstrations in the Gaza Strip and in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh in Lebanon. In the Land Day demonstrations of 2002, Arab citizens of Israel expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, speaking out against the \\"Israeli siege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters.\\" The 2005 Land Day commemorations were dedicated to the plight of the unrecognized villages in the Negev, where organizers said 80,000 Arab citizens live without access to basic amenities and 30,000 homes have received demolition orders. Marches in 2008 included one organized in Jaffa where 1,000 Arab citizens used the Land Day commemorations to bring attention to what they described as an acceleration in land confiscations in the city, with many complaining that they were facing evictions and demolition orders designed to force them out of their homes in order to settle Jews from abroad in their place. The Palestinian filmmaker and artist Hisham Zreiq honors the Archbishop of Sebastia Theodosios (Atallah Hanna) and the Palestinian singer Manal Mousa by giving each of them one of his artworks in The Palestinian Land Day celebration in Dortmund Germany Calls to launch non- violent resistance actions to protest against ongoing land confiscations regularly occur on Land Day. For example, the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights issued a press release for Land Day 2006, calling for \\"boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel\\" and an end to \\"racial discrimination, occupation, and colonization.\\" During the commemorations for Land Day in 2009, a group of 50 Palestinian women singing Palestinian nationalist songs by Marcel Khleifi and some internationals gathered at the Damascus Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem, to hand out posters and T-shirts calling for a boycott of Israeli products. Also in 2009, thousands of Arab citizens, some carrying Palestinian flags, marched through the towns of Arrabe and Sakhnin, under the banner, \\"We are all united under Israeli fascism and racism.\\" Arab Knesset member Talab el-Sana called upon the government, \\"to put a stop to the racist plans of Judaizing the Galilee and Negev and adopt development policies for all the Galilee and Negev's residents\\". Ynet reported that protests by Palestinians were planned in locations worldwide, including the US, Canada, Germany, Finland, France and Belgium, and that the World Social Forum (WSF) announced the launching of a campaign calling on all of its affiliates to excommunicate Israel. Land Day was also commemorated in Sabra and the Shatila refugee camp via an art exhibition and musical event, and in the Palestinian territories, where Palestinians demonstrated and threw stones near the Israeli West Bank barrier in Naalin and Jayyous. In anticipation of Land Day protests of 2012, Israel sealed off the West Bank (but the restrictions did not apply to Israeli settlers). The protests were held in Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces fired at protestors who tried to cross the security fence, resulting in one man killed and 37 injured. At the Qalandia checkpoint, rock-throwing Palestinian youths clashed with Israeli soldiers firing rubber bullets and stun grenades, resulting in 39 Palestinians being injured. In Jordan, 15,000 people, including Palestinians joined in a peaceful sit-in. Palestinian refugees also held demonstrations near Beaufort Castle, Lebanon. During the 2018 Land Day protests, 17 Palestinians were killed, including five Hamas members, and more than 1,400 were injured in shootings by the Israeli army during a march calling for the Palestinian right of return at the borders with Gaza.

She specialized in the philosophy of religion, philosophical theology, and medieval philosophy. She was Horace Tracy Pitkin Professor of Historical Theology at Yale Divinity School from 1998 to 2003 and Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford from 2004 to 2009.  Early life and education  Adams was born on October 12, 1943, in Oak Park, Illinois, United States. She was the daughter of William Clark McCord and Wilmah Brown McCord. In 1966, she married the philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams. Adams was educated at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree. She continued her studies at Cornell University, completing her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1967. She undertook studies and training for ordained ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary, graduating with a Master of Theology degree in 1984. She was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (DD) by the University of Oxford in 2008, thereby becoming the first woman to become an Oxford DD.  Career  Academic career = Adams spent the majority of her academic career at the University of California, Los Angeles: she was an associate professor (1972‚Äì1978) and then professor of philosophy from 1978 to 1993, and chair of the Department of Philosophy between 1985 and 1987. She was President of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy from 1980 to 1982. Having moved to Yale University, she was professor of historical theology from 1993 to 2003 and the Horace Tracy Pitkin Professor of Historical Theology at Yale Divinity School from 1998 to 2003. In 2004, Adams moved to England where she had been appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford. The chair is linked to a canonry at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and so she also became a residentiary canon. She was the first woman and the first American to be appointed to Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. In 2009, after five years abroad, she returned to the United States to join the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a distinguished research professor of philosophy. She moved to Rutgers University, where she was a visiting/distinguished research professor from 2013 to 2015. Adams was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015.

Work and writing  Adams speaking in 2007 Adams' work in philosophy focused on the philosophy of religion, especially the problem of evil, philosophical theology, metaphysics, and medieval philosophy. Her work on the problem of evil largely focused on what she calls \\"horrendous evils\\".

Life Gies (also known as Henk van Santen in The Diary of Anne Frank) was born and raised in Amsterdam's south side. He met his future wife, Miep Gies, in 1933 when he was a bookkeeper and she an office worker at a local textile company. It was not until after they'd gone their separate ways - Jan into the Dutch Social Services and Miep to Otto Frank's company, Opekta - that they met each other again socially in 1936. They married in Amsterdam on 16 July 1941, when Miep was threatened with deportation back to Vienna after she refused to join a Nazi women's group. Their wedding was attended by Otto and Anne Frank, Hermann van Pels and his wife Auguste van Pels, and Miep's colleagues Victor Kugler, Bep Voskuijl, and Johannes Kleiman. Later that year, Gies was appointed the nominal director of Otto Frank's company after Frank was forced to resign from the board under the newly introduced Nazi laws which forbade Jews to hold directorships, and from then on, the company traded under the name Gies & Co. As the persecution of Amsterdam's Jewish population intensified, he dedicated himself to assisting Jews and others escape by obtaining illegal ration cards for food, finding them hiding places, and securing British newspapers free from Nazi propaganda. Gies aided the Frank family's escape to their hiding place at the Gies & Co premises at 263 Prinsengracht. He visited frequently during their two-year confinement and with his wife, spent a night in the secret annex to experience the terror there for themselves. In addition to their concealment of the Frank and van Pels families and of Fritz Pfeffer at the Prinsengracht, Miep and Jan also took in a student, who had refused to sign a Nazi oath. Following the arrest and deportation of the hidden families in August 1944, Miep rescued the diaries and other manuscripts of Anne Frank from the hiding place before it was ransacked by the Dutch secret police. Of the eight people she and Jan had assisted to hide, Otto Frank was the sole survivor. Upon Frank's return to Amsterdam in June 1945, he moved in with them and stayed with them for seven years before he emigrated to Switzerland to be close to his mother. Jan Gies (middle), Miep Gies, 1989 After the publication of Anne Frank's diary, under the title Het Achterhuis (The Backhouse; often translated as The Secret Annex) in 1947, Jan and Miep found themselves the subjects of media attention, particularly after the diary was translated into English as The Diary of a Young Girl and adapted for the stage and screen. They attended memorial ceremonies and gave lectures about Anne Frank and the importance of resisting fascism. Death In 1993, Jan Gies died peacefully at home from diabetes, aged 87. He was survived by his wife, Hermine \\"Miep\\" Gies, who died at the age of 100 in 2010 and his son, Paul Gies, who was born in 1950, daughter-in-law Lucie, and three grandchildren, Erwin, Jeanine, and David.

A Samba school parades in the Sambadrome in the 2014 Carnival. A samba school () is a dancing, marching, and drumming (Samba Enredo) club. They practice and often perform in a huge square-compounds (\\"quadras de samba\\") and are devoted to practicing and exhibiting samba, an African-Brazilian dance and drumming style. Although the word \\"school\\" is in the name, samba schools do not offer instruction.Renata de S√° Gon√ßalves, \\"The traditional samba school dance as a performative experience\\", accessed 12 Mar 2014 Samba schools have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro- Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system,Dils A., Albright A., (eds.) \\"Moving History / Dancing Cultures - A Dance History Reader\\", Wesleyan University Press 2001:169. and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development.Guillermoprieto, A., \\"Samba\\", Jonathan Cape 1990:23-25. The phrase \\"escola de samba\\" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals. In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with poor neighborhoods (\\"favelas\\"). Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers.Samba, a documentary directed by Ella Jessouroun, 2001. Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly carnival parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a carnavalesco or carnival director. From 2005, some fourteen of the top samba schools in Rio have used a specially designed warehouse complex, the size of ten football pitches, called Samba City (Cidade do Samba) to build and house the elaborate floats. Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the poorest in Brazilian society.\\"Imperatriz do Carnival\\" a documentary directed by Fernando Schultz, 2004. The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America. Carnival parade Samba dance at Rio Carnival The formal parades (\\"desfiles\\") during carnival, are a showcase of each main \\"escola\\" enhanced by the participation of celebrities, fans and guests who often pay large sums of money for their elaborate costumes. In Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo and Porto Alegre, the formal parades are held in specially constructed arenas called Sambadromes (Sambadrome Marqu√™s de Sapuca√≠ in Rio, the Anhembi Sambadrome in S√£o Paulo) designed by influential architect, Oscar Niemeyer, the Sambadromo Complexo Cultural Porto Seco in Porto Alegre and the Sambadromo de Uruguaiana in Uruguaiana where \\"escolar de samba\\" from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina participate. Sambadromes are designed to accommodate all social classes, with VIP lounges, tourist sections, and various types of seating right down to cheapest seats for poorest sections of the community. Those who choose to only watch the parade may also be charged for the best seats. Each school displays glamour in colorful costumes and floats with special effects and is organized into different segments or \\"alas\\" (\\"wings\\"). The \\"alas\\" represent different components of the school's theme, or \\"enredo\\", as they act out a homage to a myth, historic event or figure, or express their view on a social, environmental, or international issue. The \\"alas\\" display distinct costumes or \\"fantasias\\" and also reflect traditional samba school roles developed years ago. Thus, each samba school parade has the \\"comiss√£o de frente\\"; individuals who open the parade by walking in social attires, saluting the crowds; the \\"ala das Baianas\\", or the traditional segment of Bahian African-Brazilian ladies with impressive round dresses spinning through the avenue; the \\"puxadores\\" (lead singers) singing the \\"samba-enredo\\" or theme-song while they play the \\"cavaquinho\\" or other string instruments; the \\"velha guarda\\", or veterans who made history in the school; the \\"bateria\\", or samba band with drums, \\"cuicas\\" and other instruments, preceded by the \\"madrinha da bateria\\", or band godmother who is often a sexy female celebrity. The \\"porta-bandeira\\", or the female flag holder, and the \\"mestre-sala\\", or male cortsy, display and honor the school's flag, as they dance and strive to show harmony and samba expertise, while their performance is carefully observed and scored by the judges. Guy Veloso Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo \\"Cariocas\\", the Rio natives, and \\"Paulistanos\\", S√£o Paulo natives, are overtaken with emotion while performing or watching their favorite school, much more so in Rio, where a carnival samba school culture has been developed since the 1930s and samba rehearsals, costume making, and planning is a year-round event. It is often said that a samba school slum dweller may not have a job or food on the table the whole year, but they will make sure they have the money for their costume to show their \\"samba no pe'\\" or dancing skills expertise. Front commission dressed as codfish in the parade of Imperatriz Leopoldinense (2007) As samba schools originated in Rio de Janeiro, they are today the most famous ones and, arguably, produce the most spectacular parades or (as it is often said) the \\"greatest show on Earth\\". The city of S√£o Paulo also has a number of samba schools with some tradition that is linked to an interesting mixture of African-Brazilian display of pride, immigrant or working class activism, and soccer team fondness, as schools such as \\"Gavi√µes da Fiel\\", \\"Mancha Verde\\" began as a singing/dancing group that cheered and rooted during matches in S√£o Paulo stadiums. Nearly all Brazilian states have samba schools, but states such as Bahia and Pernambuco tend to have floats that lead a crowd composed of general people, without the need for membership, rehearsals, or even a special attire. Some groups do charge a certain amount of money for the \\"abad√°s\\", or colorful T-shirts that display affiliation to a specific group, or \\"bloco\\". Organization of samba schools A significant majority of the samba schools, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, have in their name the words Gr√™mio Recreativo Escola de Samba (Recreative Guild Samba School), represented by the acronym GRES, before the name itself. In S√£o Paulo there is a common variation Gr√™mio Recreativo Cultural e Escola de Samba (Recreative Cultural Guild and Samba School). There are exceptions, such as the Sociedade Rosas de Ouro (Golden Rose Society) and the traditional Agremia√ß√£o Recreativa Cultural e Escola de Samba Vizinha Faladeira (gr√™mio and agremia√ß√£o in Portuguese are synonyms). The standardization of the classifications of entities emerged in 1935 when the Rio carnival associations were required to take a charter to the Delegacia de Costumes e Divers√µes (Delegation of Customs and Entertainment) to be able to parade. In an effort to show a modicum of decency and organization, the delegate owner, Dulc√≠dio Gon√ßalves, refused to grant the permit to associations with \\"inappropriate\\" names, which is why the GRES Portela had to change to the current name, instead of the previous Vai Como Pode (Come as You Will).Nelson p.94 (p.112 of e-book) The samba school system seems to be unique to Brazil.Carnaval da Diamond Unlike parades such as the Rose Parade in California, for instance, the samba schools' organizations consist almost entirely of community volunteer work. More than just musical groups, the schools are the neighborhood associations that cover a variety of community needs, such as educational resources and medical care. There are often political and commercial interests involved as well, even from abroad, especially when the samba school honors the literature, music and dance, or a myth, historic figure or event from another country. Drug lords who control trafficking in the Rio favelas as well as illicit gambling (Jogo do Bicho) are also said to contribute financially to schools, as many of them are guardians and controllers of shanty town life.  History  The origins of samba schools are linked to the history of carnival in Rio itself, as well as the creation of the modern samba. The first parades, or \\"cortumes\\", as Luso- Brazilians called them, were more exclusive events and used to have white revelers, rather than mostly African-Brazilians like nowadays. The rhythms were often the \\"marchinhas\\", with a more Portuguese or European flair. Samba players from a group called Est√°cio were the pioneers of present-day samba schools, with the founding of \\"Deixa Falar\\", or Let Me Speak in 1928. Ismael Silva seems to have been the first to have come up with idea of creating \\"blocos de Carnaval\\" in which groups could dance and move to the samba rhythms and sounds.Nelson p.47 The first samba school contests began in 1928 and were held at the home of Z√© Espinguela, where his Conjunto Oswaldo Cruz won and Mangueira and Deixa Falar also competed for the title. Some consider this as the starting point leading to the development of present-day samba schools.Academia do Samba - Cap√≠tulo 1 However, between 1930 and 1932, these were only considered a variation of the blocos, local street parade celebration, and in 1932 the owner of Mundo Sportivo, M√°rio Filho, decided to sponsor the first Parade of Samba Schools in Pra√ßa Onze. Composers such as Ant√¥nio Nassar, Armando Reis and Orestes Barbosa) had the idea of organizing a Carnival parade which was supported by local newspapers. Newspaper owners and journalists such as M√°rio Filho and his brother N√©lson Rodrigues, who did not have much to write about after the end of the soccer season, joined journalist Carlos Pimentel, who was connected to samba personalities in holding a parade at Praca XI square.Nelson p.77 At the invitation of \\"Sports World\\", 19 schools attended. The newspaper established the criteria for judging the participating schools and nowadays news networks still have some say on the parades as they strive for fairness and high quality, especially because so much money is invested on TV networks that have broadcasting rights for the parades. Newspapers and magazines also make huge profitsl.Composer Orestes Barbosa, actors Eug√™nia Brand√£o and √Ålvaro Moreyra and rep√≥rter Fernando Costa were jury members in 1932. The traditional \\"ala das Baianas\\" was a prerequisite to compete, and the schools, all with more than one hundred members, should present sambas unpublished and not use pipe instruments, among other requirements.Nelson p.79 The winning school was Mangueira, while the second group had the Conjunto Osvaldo Cruz, or Portela. The officials assured the success of the contest remained up in Praca XI Square in 1941.\\"Nosso Tempo\\", Turner Publishing, Inc. e Century Books, Inc. Nosso Tempo, Volume I; pg. 239. Editora Klick. 1995 Over time, the samba schools took many elements brought by ranches, such as the plot, the pair of mestre-sala cortsy and flag holder and the opening committee, elements with which Ismael Silva disagreed. Samba school Imp√©rio do Papagaio, from Helsinki, Finland, during the 2004 Carnival With the rise of populist dictator Get√∫lio Vargas and the foundation of the General Union of Samba Schools in 1934, the marginalization of samba persisted for some time. Then, it regained power and began to expand and gain importance in the Rio carnival, supplanting the ranches carnival. It did not take long for the samba schools to expand to other states, with the foundation in 1935 of the \\"Primeira S√£o Paulo\\" (First of S√£o Paulo),Prefeitura de Ribeir√£o Preto - Carnaval 2008, homenagem da Os Bambas √† Primeira de S√£o Paulo the first school of samba de S√£o Paulo. The official competitions of the samba schools in S√£o Paulo only started in 1950 with the victory of Lavap√©s, but before that there were other minor tournaments at the municipal and state levels.Revista Quatro Rodas, ano VII, n¬∫91, fevereiro de 1968, p√°gina 61 - many informations in article Santos carnival In the early 1960s some organized soccer support fan groups, like the Vai-Vai (Go-Go) and the Camisa Verde e Branco (Green and White Jersey) became samba schools. Due to the large number of schools, in 1952, the access league \\"Grupo de Acesso\\" was created in order to allow news schools in and promote them to the \\"premier league\\" only if they aboded by certain rules of excellence. That year, the parade of the access league (Group 2, current Group RJ-1) went seamlessly, but the parade of the main group (Group 1, currently the Special Group) was carried out under heavy rain. The judging results were canceled and all schools belonging to the access league were promoted to the \\"premier league\\".Academia do Samba - 1952 In 1953 UGESB and FBES in AESCRJ,Academia do Samba - 1953 merged as LIESA, an association of samba schools from the premier league which became known in Portuguese as Grupo Especial. In 2008, LESGA was created, representing schools from the access league. LIESA inspired the creation of similar bodies in other cities, such as LIGA-SP. In 1984, Rio de Janeiro governor Leonel Brizola dedicated the Sambadrome, a special space for the parading of samba schools. Years later, in S√£o Paulo, Mayor Luiza Erundina did the same, creating the Anhembi Sambadrome. Today, many other cities throughout the country also have their Sambadromes, including Manaus and in 1993 its parade was broadcast for the first time.'FortuneCity  Characterization  Natural associations are almost always local, largely from poor communities or the suburbs, forming samba schools that usually represent in a district, sub-district or set of districts. A parade which usually has local character, whereas the main schools of the city gather to compete among themselves for the best of the year. In this show, conducted over two nights, they are evaluated by a committee of judges chosen in advance by their leaders or by the representative.O Dia - LIESA inicia curso de jurados nesta segunda-feira G1 - Carnaval 2008 - RJ: anunciados os 40 julgadores dos desfiles do Grupo Especial Regulamento do Carnaval de Uruguaiana 2009 The judges consider each of the judging categories, giving points to each. On the day that the results are announced, the final assessment of the panel can be affected by certain penalties for breaking certain rules, such as the requirement to parade within specific time limits, parading with the minimum components, and avoiding total nudity.  Parade  In major cities, the parade of each samba school currently takes about an hour, with some variations according to the rules imposed by the organization of the carnival in the city. For each of the Special Group in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the parade has a maximum time of one hour and twenty minutes, while in S√£o Paulo is the maximum of 1 hour and five minutes. Along the parade ground, stop watches mark the period of time.Introduced 1986. = Concentration area = This is the time and place occupied by the schools while waiting their turn to enter the parade in the Sambadrome. After the end of a parade, the narrator announces the school next to perform, and the sounds from the microphone, restricted to only a part of sambadrome, are released so that people can hear in the bleachers. Then the opening cries are heard, after which the parade itself begins, and the timer starts to run. = Requisites = Several elements are part of the characterization of a parade of the samba school, and some areas to which the jury should assign notes.Prefeitura Municipal de Florian√≥polis - Regras do desfile carnavalesco de 2002 Others, like the wing of Bahia, however, are not considered as items, but can cause loss of points for the body anyway, if not shown.  Front Commission  This is the first group of parade participants to perform, and consists of about ten to fifteen people who execute a choreography to introduce the theme. Apart from the Front Commission, there is no other rule regarding the order of the elements during the parade of samba schools. Functioning as a sort of master of ceremonies of the show by welcoming the public and presenting the school, the front commission of the samba schools has undergone many changes over time. In its early years, it was formed by a group of men, the general directors of the college, who came in front of the school wearing their best clothes and welcomed the public. Sometimes they carried sticks in their hands, whose prime objective was \\"to defend the group against rivals\\". The Portela samba school developed a more refined front commission, where its performers paraded with elegant clothes, even occasionally with tails and top hat, a model which soon came to be copied by other schools. That was the policy of its most illustrious member, Paulo da Portela, which meant that Sambistas should always go well dressed, in order to dispel the negative image of them held by the upper class. In the less formal blocos, predecessors of the schools, they had a reputation of being supporters of street fights and street riot.Samba-choro Coloninha.org  Allegorical floats and props  Allegorical floats of the Esta√ß√£o Primeira de Mangueira school during the carnival parade of 2013. One of the judging categories is the allegorical floats, filled with sculptures of wood, plastic, Styrofoam and other materials, decorated to represent the elements of the plot.

The first float of the parade often includes a stylised depiction of the school. Some schools, such as Portela for example, always bring their winged eagle symbol, regardless of plot. The greatest floats can reach up to 13 meters high and 60 meters in length, which sometimes affects their entry into the parade ground. These floats are propelled by hand with people who are below or behind the float. No float can be moved by an engine (during the 1990s, it was to prevent the risk of fire.Grupo Pac√≠fica - como funciona o Carnaval  Progression and harmony The progression or evolution of the school's parade as it develops its story is of great importance to the judges. Anyone watching should have the impression that the school is a single body, a continuous row. There is no requirement that the components perform samba, but they must move with a degree of unison and good timing. Schools that suffer dramatic changes in its parade speed, parading sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly, are usually penalized. Schools where the participants do not sing the samba, or sing badly, may receiving lower points. Plot-theme (\\"enredo\\") As a feature of the parades, the plot, usually chosen some time after the previous carnival, will occupy the school for the following year. Meanwhile, from the main theme, a synopsis is drawn, which will guide the design and manufacture of costumes, floats and samba-song. Judges will decide whether the school explained the theme during the parade,.  Samba-song  Judges assess whether the samba has a good melody and lyrics with interesting features, musically rich, reflecting the theme, and without bias or errors of language. The samba of each school is chosen after an internal competition at the school, where Sambistas or groups create their sambas, based on the previously agreed theme. The competition takes place over several weekends, some entries are eliminated, until only there is a winning song which the school then adopts. In Rio de Janeiro, the competition usually takes place in August. In October, a CD of the Special Group is recorded with chosen sambas from each school Until 2007, the Special Group schools of S√£o Paulo, the samba song would be considered twice, once for lyrics and once for melody of music, with equal points for each.  Mestre-sala and Porta-Bandeira  Mestre-sala and porta-bandeira from Unidos de Vila Isabel at the 2006 Carnival. The mestre-sala (literally, \\"The Master of the Room\\") and porta-bandeira (\\"she who carries the flag\\") display the flag of the school to the audience. The porta- bandeira carries the flag, and the mestre-sala pays tribute and draws attention to both the flag and the porta-bandeira. Her dance is not a samba, but she spins and swirls her way ahead. The mestre-sala dances around her. All their moves are regulated in a set of rules, and at one point during the parade they are evaluated by the judges. The slightest mistake may result in their scores being lowered. For example: it is forbidden that the two turn their backs to each other at the same time, and errors such as the drop of a hat or other slips will result in lower scores. Their costumes are similar to the gala costumes typical of the eighteenth century, but \\"carnavalized\\", i.e. with an exaggerated amount of colors and decorations. Currently, at least since the 1990s, the schools of the Special Group of Rio and S√£o Paulo parade usually with three or four pairs of mestre-salas and porta-bandeira, but only the first is evaluated, the other being merely decorative, and optional. Normally, they are there to represent the school in some events when the main couple is unable to.SRZD - Ensaios: O que devem e n√£o podem fazer o mestre- sala e porta-bandeira The mestre-sala seems to reflect the carnival dances of the nineteenth century, in which there was a professional organization responsible for the hall that was called \\"master of room\\" or \\"master-room.\\" With respect to the porta-bandeira, the name was a natural adaptation of the old flag-bearer character, usually male, who carried the heavy banners of Brazilian carnival groups The visual aspect of the mestre-sala has also been compared to the Z√© Pilintra of ethnic Afro-Brazilian traditions.Louren√ßo R, \\"Bandeira, Porta Bandeira e Mestre-Sala Elementos De Diversas Culturas Numa Tr√≠ade Soberana Nas Escolas De Samba Cariocas\\", Textos escolhidos de cultura e arte populares, Rio de Janeiro, v.6, n.1, p. 7-18, 2009,  Drumming Section  One of many instruments in a samba school bateria: the repique. The drumming wing, or \\"bateria\\", is a kind of orchestra of percussion instruments. They accompany the singer and lead the pace of the parade. The faster and stronger the pace of the bateria, the faster members usually parade. Each school has, currently, an average 250 to 300 musicians.GRES Consulado Every bateria is evaluated on \\"the regular maintenance and support of the cadence ... in accordance with the Samba Theme: the perfect combination of sounds emitted by various tools, and the creativity and versatility of the bateria.\\" The following instruments usually form part of a bateria of the samba school: Surdo de primera, surdo de segunda, surdo de terceira, caixa de guerra, repinique, chocalho, tambourim, cu√≠ca, agog√¥, reco-reco, and frigedeira.Artes.com - bateria There are variations in composition, for example, the samba-school Mangueira, does not use the surdo de segunda, only surdo de primeira and another drum known as a surdo mor, while the samba- school Empire Serrano emphasizes the agog√¥.Samba-choro - tribuna In the 1960s came the \\"Paradinha\\" (\\"little stop\\") of Mestre Andr√©, a famous director of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel. Andr√© was the creator of the musical effect in which the bateria suddenly stop playing during a parade, leaving only the cavaquinho (a small string instrument) and voice components for a moment. When the music returns, the effect is of surprise and excitement. The expected effect, considered beautiful by the critics, is also risky because it increases the chances that the samba song can mistakenly be taken up again at the wrong moment.Terra - Carnaval 2006 - 12 de janeiro de 2006, 07h36 \\"Sem paradinha, eu fico em casa\\", diz Mestre Ci√ßa = Other elements  Director of the Drums Section  As a whole orchestra, the percussionists of the samba school also has a conductor, also called master of bateria.

The queen of the drums sectionConhe√ßa as rainhas de bateria do Carnaval 2009 and related roles: godmother, muse, and princess are positions of honor occupied by distinguished members of the community and sometimes by celebrities. The queen of the drums section dances ahead of the drummers group and sometimes interacts with them. The figure of the queen of the drums section appeared in the 1970s when the famous mulatto Adele Fatima led the Youth Independent Drums Section, an unprecedent fact, and gained popularity in the following decade. Today it is one of the most celebrated roles in samba schools. Monique Evans, in Mocidade, Luma de Oliveira, in Tradi√ß√£o and Soninha Capeta, in Beija-Flor, were some notable queens of drum sections. Some schools also introduced the figure of a King of the drums section.G1 - Rei de bateria enfrenta preconceito entre ritmistas The godmother of the drumming section is similar to the queen, and the two often get confused.Globo.com - carnaval 2008 - 12/12/2007 - Rainhas de bateria: abram alas para as vossas majestades Many schools use the two roles to pay tribute to more women. In the 1980s, many schools began to choose famous TV actresses instead of girls from the community, raising controversy in the media.Samba Rio Carnaval - Coluna da Denise - 27 de abril de 2008, n¬∫ 03, ano I In theory, the position of godmother should be offered to women of importance in the history of the school or in daily life, on a lifelong basis, which does not change every year, as the position of queen, but this is often not the caseJuliana Alves ser√° rainha de bateria da escola de samba P√©rola Negra Carnaval UOL - 24/01/2008 - 19h42 - \\"Todas as rainhas de bateria se odeiam\\", diz rainha da Acad√™micos da Rocinha and the godmother only a queen with another name.  Ala das Baianas  The \\"ala das baianas\\" is considered one of the most important wings of a samba school parade, and preferably composed of ladies dressed in clothes that refer to old aunts of the first groups of Bahia samba of the early twentieth century. It is mandatory for all competition parades of samba schools, although not official. In the years 1940 to 1950, it was common for men to parade dressed in this way.Terra - Carnaval 2006 - Baiana de \\"cueca\\" vai desfilar por escola do Rio The traditional clothing of Bahia consists of torso, coat, cloth and skirt round the coast. However, often we can see Bahia with the most unusual costumes, such as brides, statues of liberty, space beings, globe (pictured) or oil wells.  Old-guard  The old guard (in Portuguese \\"Velha Guarda\\") is a group of samba dancers older, often already quite old, often the founders of schools that no longer hold positions within the hierarchy of the party, but as a separate department, and occupy the Carnival parade in positions of honor, dressed in carnival costumes typical of samba, such zoot suitsNei Lopes.

Using a microphone, and usually more powerful than the supporting singers, his voice stands out over the other members of the school, taking the lead on how fast the song is sung by the school's parade. Jamel√£o (1913-2008), a Brazilian samba singer.Renato Roschel, \\"Jamel√£o\\" . Dispon√≠vel em Almanaque M√∫sica . Acesso: 20 de fevereiro, 2009 The samba during the parade should not be interpreted by one or just a few people, but sung by the entire school: the music should only be \\"pulled\\" (initiated) by the minority group. Moreover, many believe that the handle would be a special category of performer, able not only to interpret a samba, but also encourage and arouse the audience. From the 1990s, Jamel√£o, the long time singer from the Mangueira school, criticized the traditional term, seeking to replace it with a new terminology: Interpreter/Singer of the Samba-Enredo. In the words of Jamel√£o, one who would handle \\"smoke pull, pull cart, pull-bag\\" (in original \\"puxa fuma fumo, puxa carro, puxa saco\\"; in Rio de Janeiro's giria, \\"smoke marijuana, steals vehicle, yes-man\\") which in his opinion, a derogatory term. From this, many commentators and TV stations began to replace the first by the second term, which however, still remains. Another controversy that is still common for interpreters is the question whether or not it is unethical for the official interpreter at a school to participate in the internal dispute of their own college. Some schools prohibit this, but release their professionals to participate in tryouts for other schools.Sidney Rezende - √â correto o int√©rprete oficial n√£o participar do concurso de samba?  Carnavalesco  This is the professional responsible for design and development of the plot to be submitted by a school of samba as well as the design, development and construction of floats and costumes related to the proposed plot. In some cases, the carnavalesco develops the plot from a topic proposed by the direction of the samba school. In others, he suggests the theme of an idea from its original. The carnavalesco is usually a single person, but the Beija- Flor school of Rio de Janeiro now use a team of carnavalescos. The carnavalescos may or may not be university-trained for the profession, and may even have a team of researchers working with them to develop the school's theme. Many have a strong carnaval connection or background in the visual arts, performing arts, theater or dance.  Dirigents/Directorial staff  This is the name by which may be called the president, the president of honor and patron of the school. One can also use this to include carnival directors, producers and other crew members. A director of carnival is a director of the samba school that heads up the guidelines and philosophy of their carnival college, taking part in the selection of members of various sectors, even sometimes the plot, coordinating also the shed or warehouse where the floats are made, the purchase of equipment, payments and the development of the entire project of the school. It is not uncommon for directors of Carnival to be paid professionals. Many also include the executive directors of the samba school, such as La√≠la, of Beija-Flor.  Carnival parade results  The results of the carnival competition are announced on the afternoon of Ash Wednesday in Rio, and on the afternoon of Tuesday of carnival in S√£o Paulo. In both cities, there is a ceremony where long lines are set up in the Samb√≥dromo site. Tents are set up where the representatives of each samba school will annotate the scores as they are being disseminated, making the calculations. The chairman of the league makes the final considerations about the carnival that year, reads the possible loss of points given to each samba school, and then reads the scores. The bleachers are open to the public, and the charge for entry is typically one kilogram of non-perishable food. Both in Rio and in S√£o Paulo the event is transmitted live on television; television cameras in real time are used to broadcast the movement of blocks within the main school, the title favorite, where members and fans that Samb√≥dromo were not to gather to watch the event from there.SPTuris - Cinco toneladas de alimentos s√£o arrecadadas na apura√ß√£o Terra - Carnaval 2008 - Apura√ß√£o: ambulantes vendem sacos de a√ß√∫car como ingresso The scores typically range between 7 and 10 in Rio and S√£o Paulo, and the points are further subdivided into decimal fractions in Rio and 25 hundredths in S√£o Paulo.Central de not√≠cias - Vila Maria, Mocidade, Vai-Vai e Imp√©rio, favoritas em SP In Rio, all the marks given by all the jurors are valid, while in S√£o Paulo the lowest note of each item is eliminated .IG Carnaval 2008 - Crit√©rios de Julgamento The scoring system has changed several times in both cities. In Rio and S√£o Paulo, until the early 2000s, the division was more than half a point, and there have been years when there was also the elimination of major score given to each school, the very removal of the lower scores have also and has ceased to be part of the rule several times. In Rio de Janeiro, the lowest score in the same period was 5, and note the 0 (zero) allowed only in case of failure of the plot. Often the scores given by the jurors are questioned, both by fans, as by members of schools who are harmed, causing many complaints after the show.SRZD - Bruno Chateaubriand diz que n√£o julga mais desfile de escola de samba Some results have been controversial stop in court.

It takes place on the Saturday following Ash Wednesday. This parade has no competitive character; it is a celebratory festival to crown the year's best schools that gives the parade participants (AKA foli√µes) a chance to be more carefree and enjoy themselves. In S√£o Paulo, the parade of champions is the night between Friday night and after the carnival on Saturday. Already the parade in Rio is the night of Saturday to the early hours of Sunday.

History The Soviet Union employed an estimated 50,000-60,000 nuclear experts, 65,000 bioweapons experts, and 6,000 chemical weapons experts.Smithson Amy E. Toxic Archipelago: Preventing Proliferation from the former Soviet Chemical and Biological Weapons Complex. Washington, D.C.: The Henry L. Stimson Center, 1999. When the Soviet Union collapsed, many of these once-privileged scientists, engineers, and technicians became unemployed, underemployed, or unpaid. To prevent weapons experts from selling their knowledge to unfriendly states, the US government established or co- established several programs and organizations to provide scientists with civilian employment in their home countries. These \\"scientist redirection\\" and \\"scientist engagement\\" initiatives include the International Science and Technology Center, the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine, the State Department's Global Threat Reduction programs (formerly Nonproliferation of WMD Expertise), the Department of Energy's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and now-defunct Nuclear Cities Initiative, and CRDF.Woolf, Amy F.

He was best known as the creator and main writer of the children's BBC television series, Bodger & Badger, in which he acted as the likeable but accident-prone Simon Bodger and his pet, Badger.  Personal life  Cunningham studied at the University of Cambridge, where he read English. He dropped out of this course at the end of the second of its three years, citing academic pressures as the reason for doing so, but later completed his degree at the University of Reading. By the mid-1990s, he was in a long-term relationship with co-star Jane Bassett who played Mousey in Bodger & Badger. They later separated but remained good friends. He also had a daughter, Phoebe, from a previous relationship. Career Before entering the acting profession and entertainment industry, he was an English teacher, then a social worker. After a while Andy began to explore magic conventions and it was at one in Brighton where - after spending a considerable amount of time having trouble getting past the doorman - he ordered by mail order a puppet called \\"Benji the Adorable Puppy\\" (which he named \\"China\\" after the Cockney slang \\"china plate\\", meaning \\"mate\\" - later to be used as China the Dog in Bodger and Badger). When this puppet arrived, he found himself being able to operate the puppet dog naturally and was able to ad-lib routines and comments in a way that he wasn't comfortable with doing with the ventriloquist's doll (which he named Douglas). Soon after, he gave up his day job to turn this hobby into a full-time job, alongside his work with the Covent Garden Community Theatre (with whom he held various positions, including acting). It was while working as a director here that he gave comedian Julian Clary his first big break. Another act he developed was of a three-headed man named \\"Freeman, Hardy and Willis\\". By the early 1980s, Andy had a regular income to supplement his magician and Community Theatre Group work as a handyman at a West London school, a job to which he admitted himself that he was entirely unsuited. In 1986, Andy wrote a children's book featuring Mr Bodger and Magritte the rat entitled \\"Mr Bodger's Jumping Hat\\". Also during this time, Roland Rat became popular on TV-am's breakfast television ITV franchise and many people in London who knew Andy because of his work with Magritte either began thinking that Andy had stolen the idea of a badly-behaved talking rat puppet from Roland Rat or confused Magritte with Roland, thinking Andy was Roland's puppeteer. It was also during this period when Andy made his only (uncredited) big-screen film performances in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.

Millikan has spent most of her career at the University of Connecticut, where she is now Professor Emerita of Philosophy. Education and career Millikan earned her BA from Oberlin College in 1955. At Yale University she studied under Wilfrid Sellars. Although W. Sellars left for the University of Pittsburgh midway through Millikan's doctorate, she stayed at Yale and earned her PhD in 1969. She and Paul Churchland are often considered leading proponents of \\"right wing\\" (i.e., individualistic) Sellarsianism. Millikan taught half-time at Berea College from 1969-1972, Two-thirds time at The University of Western Michigan from 1972-1973, half-time at the University of Michigan from 1993-1996,http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp- content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Millikan-cv.pdf but otherwise spent her entire career at the University of Connecticut, where she is now professor emerita. She is married to American psychologist and cognitive scientist Donald Shankweiler.http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp- content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Millikan-cv.pdf She was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize and gave the Jean Nicod Lectures in Paris in 2002.http://www.institutnicod.org/seminaires-colloques/conferences-et-prix- jean-nicod/archives/?lang=fr She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014.American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2014 fellows In 2017, she received both the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy from the University of Pittsburghhttp://www.pitt.edu/~rescher/Rescher%20Prize.htm and the Rolf Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/en- GB/pristagare2017/logikochfilosofi.55.html Philosophical work Millikan is most famous for the view which, in her 1989 paper of the same name, she refers to as \\"biosemantics\\".http://philosophy.uconn.edu/wp- content/uploads/sites/365/2014/02/Biosemantics-Oxford-Handbook.pdf Biosemantics is a theory about something philosophers often refer to as \\"intentionality\\". Intentionality is the phenomenon of things being 'about' other things, paradigm cases being thoughts and sentences. A belief of mine that you will do my chores for me, for example, is about you and about my chores. The same is true of a corresponding desire, intention or spoken or written command. In general, the goal of a theory of intentionality is to explain the phenomenon ‚Äì things being 'about' other things ‚Äì in other, more informative, terms. Such a theory aims to give an account of what this 'aboutness' consists in. Just as chemistry offers the claim \\"Water is H2O\\" as a theory of what water consists in, so biosemantics aims for a constitutive account of intentionality. Such an account, Millikan stresses, must deal adequately with such hallmarks of mentality as error, confusion, and what looks like standing in a relation (the 'aboutness' relation) to something that doesn't exist. For example: one 'sees' the stick is bent, but realizes otherwise after pulling it from the water; the inexperienced prospector thinks he's struck it rich, but he's holding a lump of pyrite (\\"fool's gold\\"); the field marshal thinks about the next day's battle, the child wants to ride a unicorn, and the phrase \\"the greatest prime\\" is somehow 'about' a number that cannot possibly exist (there's a simple proof for this). As the name hints, Millikan's theory explains intentionality in terms that are broadly 'biological' or teleological. Specifically, she explains intentionality using the explanatory resources of natural selection: what thoughts and sentences and desires are 'about' is ultimately elucidated by reference to what has been selected and what it has been selected for (i.e., what advantage it conferred on ancestors who possessed it). Where this selection is non-intentional, then what it is for is its 'proper function'.Millikan, Ruth Garrett, Language: A Biological Model, Oxford, 2005, 228pp, $29.95 (pbk), . Equally important is what might be called the co-evolution of producer-mechanisms and consumer- mechanisms. Millikan refers to the intertwined selection histories of these mechanisms to explain the hallmarks of mentality and to offer a wide range of positions on various matters of dispute in the philosophy of mind and language. In her article \\"Naturalist Reflections on Knowledge\\", Millikan defends the position that the justification of true beliefs through an explanation in accordance with evolution constitutes knowledge.

The stadium is under the control of the Sports Department Uttar Pradesh. It is an international cricket stadium in Uttar Pradesh (another one in Lucknow) that has regularly hosted international cricket matches in both Test and One Day format. The stadium hosted the 500th test played by the Indian team. It also organized four Vivo IPL matches, on 19 and 21 May 2016 and 10 and 13 May 2017. As of 19 August 2017 it has hosted 22 Tests, 14 ODIs and 1 T20I. It is situated near the river Ganges. It was named after British lady Madam Green who used to come here for horse riding. The stadium is nicknamed as 'Billiards Table',http://m.jagran.com/local/uttar- pradesh_kanpur-city-news-hindi.html and is also nicknamed as 'Woolmer's turf' in the memory of late cricket coach and player Bob Woolmer who was born in McRobert Hospital opposite to the stadium. History The Green Park Stadium is named after Madam Green who used to practice horse riding here in the 1940s. It is located in the Civil Lines area in the north east part of Kanpur city near the banks of the river Ganges, which flows just behind the stadium. This is the only stadium in India where a students gallery is available. Green Park has the largest manually operated scoreboard in the world. It also has video screens which are used during international matches. India's first Test win over Australia in December 1959 was at the Green Park ground. This was also the first match to be played on a turf wicket here.http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2008/apr/10biks.htm Off-spinner Jasubhai Patel's 14 wickets were instrumental in ensuring India's win. In 1958/9 Subhash Gupte took nine West Indian wickets in an inning for 102 runs, and had Lance Gibbs ‚Äì the only batsman he missed ‚Äì dropped by wicket keeper Naren Tamhane. Since 1957 India has lost only twice at Kanpur, to the West Indies on both occasions, when Subhash Gupte's dream spell was overshadowed by Wes Hall's 10 wickets in 1958 and later when India's 1983 world cup euphoria was cut short by Malcolm Marshall's fearsome bowling. The most runs scored were by Gundappa Vishwanath (776), Sunil Gavaskar (629) and Mohammed Azharuddin (543). The most wickets taken were by Kapil Dev (25), Anil Kumble (21) and Harbhajan Singh (20). Infrastructure The pitch of Green Park Stadium The ends are known as the Mill Pavilion End and the Hostel End. These are named after the Elgin Mill and DAV College which are close to the stadium. The pitch at Green Park has traditionally assisted the spinners and there have been some great performances by the likes of Jasubhai Patel and Subhash Gupte.

Three kingdoms existed in medieval Nubia: Nobadia with the capital in Faras, Makuria with the capital in Dongola, and Alodia (Alwa) with the capital in Soba. The latter used to be the capital of the medieval Nubian kingdom of Alodia from the sixth century until around 1500. E. A. Wallis Budge identified it with a group of ruins on the Blue Nile from Khartoum, where there are remains of a Meroitic temple that had been converted into a Christian church. Ibn Selim el-Aswani described the city as large and wealthy, but he probably never visited it and modern archaeological investigations show it to have been a moderate centre. Built mainly of red brick, the abandoned city was plundered for building material when Khartoum was founded in 1821. Development from the growth of suburbs now threatens the ruins.  Recent archaeological research  In its heyday, the city covered approximately 275 hectares, but the excavations carried out prior to 2019 only encompassed about 1% of this area.. The research was conducted by, among others, expeditions from the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) and the British Institute in Eastern Africa, mostly as part of salvage excavations resulting from the construction of an asphalt road and the building activity along it. During the last 20‚Äì30 years, modern architecture has covered about half of the site. In 2019, the interdisciplinary project ‚ÄúSoba ‚Äì the heart of Alwa‚Äù was commenced. It is carried out by the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw and the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences and is directed by Mariusz Drzewiecki (PCMA UW). It aims to study the topography of Soba and determine the extent, spatial structure, and character of each city quarter. A magnetic geophysical prospection revealed unknown parts of medieval Soba. In one of the quarters, large architectural complexes stood at a distance from each other; in another, a clear street grid is visible. Test trenches are also being excavated in strategic spots in the city or in places where the results of the geophysical research are not unequivocal.Mariusz Drzewiecki, Robert Ryndziewicz, Tomasz Michalik, Joanna Ciesielska, Ewa Czy≈ºewska-Zalewska, Maciej Kurcz, Mokhtar Maali Alden Mokhtar Hassan, Soba Expedition.

It is between the Missouri River in the north, to 31st Street in the south; and from the Kansas‚ÄìMissouri state line east to Bruce R. Watkins Drive as defined by the Downtown Council of Kansas City; the 2010 Greater Downtown Area Plan formulated by the City of Kansas City defines the Greater Downtown Area to be the city limits of North Kansas City and Missouri to the north, the Kansas‚ÄìMissouri state line to the west, 31st Street to the south and Woodland Avenue to the east. However, the definition used by the Downtown Council is the most commonly accepted. In March 2012, Downtown Kansas City was selected as one of America's Best downtowns by Forbes magazine for its rich culture in arts, numerous fountains, upscale shopping, and various local cuisine ‚Äì most notably barbecue. Demographics According to the Downtown Council of Kansas City, as of 2013, the Downtown area has a population of 19,899 residents with 11,790 housing units and a median household income of $61,491. Also as of 2013, Downtown has 137 units under construction and 1,326 in the planning stages. The United States Census in 2010 suggests Downtown has a population of 22,576, though this may include land outside the district boundaries defined by the Downtown Council of Kansas City. In 2000, the population may have been as low as 10,000 people with 7,330 units. In 2005, Downtown Kansas City had a population density of approximately in its area. According to Local Market reports, Downtown houses approximately of office space. However, the vacancy of this space is at about 15%. There are also about of Class A&B; office space in Downtown, with a vacancy rate of 15.9%. There are over 100,000 employees working in the Downtown area. Downtown has a total of 5,606 hotel rooms, accounting for 22.5% of the total amount of hotel rooms in the metropolitan area. The average occupancy of these rooms is about 56.5%. As of 2007, about of office space are under construction in Downtown Kansas City. Current investments into downtown redevelopment have exceeded $6 billion.

Since 2000, the estimated cost of these projects has totaled over $5.5 billion. =Power & Light District= The Power & Light District, also known as the \\"Entertainment District\\", is a nine-block area to the immediate south of the Central Business District. Originally to be named \\"Kansas City Live\\", Cordish, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland ‚Äì which developed the area ‚Äì decided to name the district after the historic art deco Power & Light Building. The present headquarters of the Kansas City Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy, is also on the district's northern side. Instead, a one-block area near the new H&R; Block headquarters tower ‚Äì devoted to live music venues ‚Äì was named Kansas City Live!. Kansas City Power and Light District The H&R; Block building, which opened in the summer of 2006, has a prominent oval shape in its design, mixed with blue-green reflective glass, making for an architectural transition between the Central Business District's skyscrapers and the south loop's older buildings. This ties together a theme of new, glass-walled buildings in the area, also including the Sprint Center and the Kansas City Star printing press across I-670. The redeveloped Mainstreet Theater, which is the Alamo Drafthouse. Cordish also will build four residential towers as part of the project, which include a 25-floor residential tower (One Light), lying to the immediate north of the H&R; Block headquarters on a lot once occupied by the flagship store of the Jones Store Company. Groundbreaking on the complex began in March 2006. The Entertainment District practically shares a border with I-670. Enclosed between the residential towers and H&R; Block's new building will be many shops and restaurants new to the Kansas City area. The new district has become a major attraction for residents and visitors to the Kansas City area, and has had a civic impact on Downtown similar to that experienced by other municipalities, such as Baltimore and San Antonio. =Sprint Center= The Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena, is a project that was announced shortly after the Power & Light District. In 2004, a ballot initiative to fund the proposed arena through a tax on car rentals and hotels was effectively passed by area voters. The project raised some controversy as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, whose owner is known for supporting a possible NBA franchise in the company's headquarters of St. Louis, lobbied against the tax and tried to sway public opinion against the arena. Some city officials, as well as those who did not desire to pay the increased tax, also fought against the project. One of the most prominent of these individuals was Sandra McFadden-Weaver, a member of the City Council of Kansas City, Missouri. Despite the outcry from a few dissenters, the arena vote passed decidedly. The Sprint Center lies within the Power and Light District. Construction began on the Sprint Center in late 2004. Before this, however, and even before the vote, the city sent out requests to local and national architectural firms ‚Äì including HOK Sports, Ellerbe Beckett, 360 Architecture, Rafael Architects Inc. and the world- renowned Frank Gehry ‚Äì to bid on the project. The first four of the aforementioned firms, however, collaborated to form the \\"Downtown Arena Design Team,\\" and won the contract over Gehry's bid, with the city citing the companies had completed a variety of sports-related projects and were based locally as the reason for their selection. Since construction began, many local minority leaders have protested the construction company and contractors for not putting enough minorities in the construction and contracting teams. The contractors, however, assert they have complied with state and federal requirements and continue to meet the requests of local citizens. The Sprint Center opened in 2007; as of June 2011, the arena does not have an NBA or NHL tenant. However, the arena has served as the venue for events such as concerts and since March 2008, the Big 12 Basketball Tournament. =Kansas City Convention Center = thumb351x351px Kansas City Convention Center at dusk. The Kansas City Convention Center consists of several buildings, either connected to or adjacent to each other: Bartle Hall, the Grand Ballroom, the Conference Center, Meeting Rooms, and Barney Allis Plaza. The facilities put together encompass more than 800,000 square feet. Bartle Hall was opened in 1976, in time for the Republican National Convention. As time passed, the need for more room grew. In 1994, Kansas City-based HNTB and BNIM designed an expansion that spanned over I-670 through downtown. After the project's completion, 388,800 square feet were available for the exhibition hall. The expansion also included a grand ballroom, conference center, and meeting rooms. The facilities also include Municipal Auditorium, an Art Deco venue built in 1934. It features an arena that seats 10,700; a music hall that seats 2,400; and a little theater suited for more private events. The auditorium connects via parking garage and skywalk to the rest of the convention center. =Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts= A view of the Brandmeyer Great Hall at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts is on the northern edge of the Crossroads Arts District, just south of the Bartle Hall ballroom. Construction began on October 6, 2006, and the facility opened to the public in September 2011. It was designed by architect Moshe Safdie. The 316,000 square foot performing arts center consists of the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Theater, Helzberg Hall, and the Brandmeyer Great Hall. Three resident companies call the center home: the Kansas City Symphony, Kansas City Ballet and Kansas City Lyric Opera. By May 2015, more than 1.5 million people had experienced an event at the center. =Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City= The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is a 16-story office tower with a two-story operations center designed by Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. It is at Penn Valley Park on the southern edge of Downtown, to the immediate west of Crown Center on a site formerly occupied by Trinity Lutheran and St. Mary's Hospitals. The bank was based out of a 21-story tower in the Downtown Loop until the Penn Valley Park facility opened in 2008. =IRS Headquarters= Kansas City Federal Reserve building, along Main Street next to Liberty Memorial. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has its Kansas City offices just west of Crown Center, which houses up to 6,000 employees. Presumably because of the threat of terrorism, the IRS selected the site as it is in a low-lying area and the development has low-rise buildings. The plan called for a $200 million facility with 5,500 parking spaces in its accompanying garage, and over of office space. Construction began in 2004 and the building was completed in the summer of 2006. The IRS was also to occupy the nearby Kansas City Main Post Office building (the Post Office having moved across the street to a building next to Union Station). =Freight House= The historic Freight House building in the Crossroads Arts District was built in the 1880s; it was renovated in the late 1990s, and it is now home to Grunauer, Lidia's Kansas City, and Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue. The original plan for the redevelopment included a 21-story hotel and garage; however, the hotel portion of the plan did not materialize because of uncertainty about the future redevelopment of downtown. In August 2007, developer Dan Clothier announced he wanted to complete his original plan by adding an 18-story hotel tower atop a three-level garage. The $38 million project calls for the structure to house 200 hotel rooms or a combination of 160 rooms along with some residential units. =Barkley, Inc.= The left In November, 2006, Barkley Inc., an advertising and public relations firm formerly known as Barkley Evergreen & Partners, moved its 350+ employees to the former TWA world headquarters at the district's southern edge. The building had been empty for two decades and cost over $30 million to renovate. Barkley also reconstructed the famous Walt Disney-designed three- story rocket ship that stood atop the building during TWA's tenure. The Moonliner signified one-time TWA majority shareholder Howard Hughes' desire to guide the airline into space travel. Other renovations included a theater, grass-lined rooftop observation deck, open floor plan, and gallery space featuring art from local and national artists. Barkley adopted the rocket ship as its new logo shortly before moving into the renovated TWA space. BNIM Architects moved to the building's third floor in 2014. Economy Commerce Bank Tower The Commerce Bank Tower at 9th and Main Streets housed Kansas City's largest bank until it was recently renovated into a multi-use property of apartments, child care center, and Park University school. H&R; Block, Commerce Bancshares, UMB Bank, Kansas City Southern, BNIM, Great Plains Energy, Aquila, DST Systems, J.E. Dunn Construction Group and HNTB are also among the companies headquartered in Downtown Kansas City. Entertainment and sites * Sprint Center * The Midland Theatre * Power & Light District * Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts * The Crossroads Arts District * Folly Theater * The River Market * Municipal Auditorium * Crown Center * Union Station * Liberty Memorial Neighborhoods View of the downtown loop from the Liberty Memorial =The Loop= The Loop is the north central section of Downtown Kansas City; it is the most dense section of the city, and is surrounded on all four sides by the downtown freeway loop. Altogether, the Loop has an area of nearly one square mile. In 2006, the Downtown Loop had nearly 8,000 residents. The Downtown Loop encompasses Quality Hill, the Central Business District, the Entertainment District, and the Government District. Districts in The Loop are: * The Library District is an officially designated area roughly bounded by 9th and 11th Streets on the north and south, and Main Street and Broadway on the east and west in Downtown Kansas City. The Library District name was adopted in 2003 in connection with the move of the Kansas City Public Library's Central Branch to a building formerly the headquarters of the First National Bank of Kansas City. This area includes the Kansas City Club, the Community Bookshelf (which is the exterior of the library's parking garage), and the 10th and Main Transit Plaza, one of the regional bus terminals. This area was developed as a commercial and entertainment area in the 1880s, but it now has many loft buildings. Several surface parking lots that remain may be redeveloped into more intensive developments. * The Garment District is to the east of Quality Hill, across Broadway Boulevard. In the 1930s, several large clothing manufacturers clustered here, making Kansas City's garment district second only to New York City's in size. Today, this heritage is commemorated by an oversized needle and thread monument. Its old industrial buildings have been redeveloped into loft apartments, office space and restaurants. Henry Perry, father of Kansas City-style barbecue, got his start in 1908 from a stand in an alley in the neighborhood. * The Government District ‚Äì on the east side of the downtown loop ‚Äì consists of Kansas City's City Hall (the tallest city hall in the United States at 30 stories), the Jackson County Courthouse, Police Headquarters, the Bolling Federal Building, the Charles Evans Whittaker U.S. Courthouse, which serves as the seat of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The government buildings are in walking distance of each other and are centered around Ilus Davis Park. * The Financial District, includes Kansas City's main skyscrapers, such as One Kansas City Place (the tallest habitable structure in Missouri), the Town Pavilion, and City Center Square. The district also includes the headquarters of the Kansas City, Missouri School District and, until the spring of 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The financial buildings are in walking distance of each other. * The Power & Light District is a nine-block entertainment district developed by the Cordish Company of Baltimore, Maryland, which has been under construction since 2004 and is nearing completion. It is situated along the southern edge of the downtown loop, bordered by Truman Road and Interstate 670 to the south and Bartle Hall Convention Center to the west. It includes the Municipal Auditorium, H&R; Block's new corporate headquarters and the 18,000-seat Sprint Center, which opened on October 10, 2007. * The Convention District consists of Bartle Hall, Municipal Auditorium, Bartle Hall Convention Center, the Power & Light District, and the Sprint Center. The convention buildings are in walking distance of each other. = Crossroads Arts District = The Crossroads District, formerly a warehouse district from I-670 in the north up to Union Station in the south, is going through a period of revitalization, like much of the city. Buildings are being redeveloped for office and residential uses. Several restaurants and art galleries are now within the district, and the area has a monthly event known as First Fridays. They feature pop-up art galleries, food trucks, live music, and shopping deals. = Crown Center = Crown Center is a district developed by Hallmark. Within Crown Center, families can enjoy an aquarium, Legoland, and Kaleidoscope. There are several mid to upscale stores, and visitors can stay at the Sheraton Crown Center or the Westin Crown Center. The district is a short walk from Liberty Memorial (which features a world-class World War One museum). Visitors can connect to Union Station and the rest of Crown Center via a skywalk called the Link. = The River Market = The River Market is Kansas City's original neighborhood on the Missouri River. The district contains one of the country's largest and longest lasting public farmers' markets. There are several unique shops and restaurants in the area. Steamboat Arabia Museum is next to the City Market. Residents and visitors traveling by foot or bike can take the Town of Kansas Bridge connection to get to the Riverfront Heritage Trail which leads to Berkley Riverfront Park, which is operated by Port KC. TransportationKCATA- RideKC RideKC Bus & MAX  Newly branded RideKC MAX Launched by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) in July 2005, \\"MAX\\" (Metro Area Express) is a bus rapid transit line extending from downtown through the Country Club Plaza to Waldo. The MAX buses include GPS to transmit real-time data on the next pickup time to each station where the line stops; all buses have dedicated lanes during rush hour and stoplights can automatically change in their favor, if needed, if buses are behind schedule. A second MAX route opened on January 1, 2011 (Troost Avenue MAX, or \\"Green Line\\"), which shares some downtown stops with what is now called Main Street MAX (or \\"Orange Line\\"). Most other KCATA routes have stops throughout downtown, centered on the Transit Plaza at 10th & Main Streets and Grand Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets. RideKC Streetcar RideKC Streetcar departing Union Station, heading north. On December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, two-mile streetcar, which will stretch from River Market to Crown Center, was approved by local voters. Construction on the line began in 2013, and the line became operational in May 2016. A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees ‚Äì the Kansas City Streetcar Authority ‚Äì operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., there will be no fare charged. The city is planning to add multiple extensions to the starter line.  RideKC Bridj  In 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus (all separate metro services) began merging into one coordinated transit service for the Kansas City region, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019. =Regional= * Amtrak ** Union Station * Bus Lines ** Greyhound Lines ** Jefferson Lines ** El Conejo Education The central branch of the Kansas City Public Library. = Universities = * Park University (satellite location) * Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences = Libraries = * Kansas City Public Library's Central Branch ReferencesExternal links *Downtown Council *Downtown Neighorhood Association *Crossroads Community Association *River Market Business Association *Power & Light District *The New Kansas City: $7 Billion Renaissance Category:Neighborhoods in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Economy of Kansas City, Missouri Kansas City ","title":"Downtown Kansas City"},{"id":"2015866","text":"The Swedish National Plant Variety Board () was a Swedish government agency that answered to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Affairs.

A hypoallergenic dog breed is a dog breed (or crossbreed) that is purportedly more compatible with allergic people than are other breeds. However, prominent allergen researchers have claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain breeds are hypoallergenic and, while allergen levels vary among individual dogs, the breed is not a significant factor. Another hypoallergenic dog breed, the West Highland White Terrier.  The myth  Though some studies suggest the possible existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds, there is too much variability to conclude that such a breed exists. According to researchers, claims about the existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds may have been fueled by unsubstantiated articles on the internet. In an interview, Christine Cole Johnson, Senior Staff Scientist at the Henry Ford Hospital & Health System, referring to the findings of her article in the July 2011 issue of the American Journal of Rhinology and Allergy, explained that it was unclear where the name hypoallergenic dog breed came from, and asserted that the existence of such a breed was just a myth. The significant allergens are proteins found in the dog's saliva and dander. Some studies have suggested that the production of the allergen, and therefore human allergenic reaction, varies by breed, yet more recent scientific findings indicate that there are no significant differences between breeds in the generation of these allergens. One study found hypoallergenic breeds to have significantly more allergen in their coats than non-hypoallergenic breeds although there was no differences in the allergen levels in the air or on the floor.  Scientific findings  Breeds that shed less are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog's dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment. However, protein expression levels play a major role and amount of shedding alone does not determine degree of allergic reaction. \\"Even if you get a hairless dog, it's still going to produce the allergen,\\" states Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, chair of the Indoor Allergen Committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. If a person is allergic, they may be best able to tolerate a specific dog, possibly of one of the hypoallergenic breeds. Dr. Thomas A. Platts-Mills, head of the Asthma and Allergic Disease Center at the University of Virginia, explained that there are cases in which a specific dog (not breed) might be better tolerated by a specific person, for unknown reasons. \\"We think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another,\\" Dr. Platts-Mills said. All dogs shed, and all dogs produce dander and saliva in some degree. As noted above, the amount of the allergenic protein present on the dander and in saliva varies by breed. Also, the amount of the allergen can be reduced or eliminated in individual dogs by treatments such as bathing. But for most breeds, when not regularly bathed, even a dog who sheds very little or has little dander can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person.  Effect of size  Size may be a factor in determining hypoallergenicity. It is possible that the total body surface area of the dog is more indicative of reduced production of allergens than its breed. Smaller dogs will also leave fewer environmental pollutants containing dog dander and dog allergens (reduced fecal matter, urine and saliva). Dogs may leave behind urine, saliva and fecal matter as allergen sources. Dogs with access to the outdoors may introduce outdoor allergens such as mold and pollen with larger animals tracking in more of these allergens. It is well established that most individuals with dog allergy also suffer with additional environmental allergies. Individuals with dog allergy may also be at increased risk for human protein hypersensitivity with cross-reactivity of dog dander allergen and human seminal fluid.  Expert recommendations  Researchers have shown that frequently bathing dogs reduces the amount of allergen related protein on the fur or hair of the dog and the amount of airborne allergen. Bathing a dog at least twice a week will minimize or even eliminate the reaction of an allergic person to a dog. Frequent cleaning and vacuuming of the home, using air filters, restricting the dog to certain rooms, and adopting a small dog that can easily be given frequent baths are all recommended by the Humane Society of the United States to control allergens. Scientific research has repeatedly shown that good cleaning practices in the home remove allergens from the environment. Many allergists suggest that a dog not be introduced to the environment of a dog allergic individual. While \\"allergy shots\\" can reduce many individuals' dog- allergic reactions, the most common approach remains avoidance. There have been recent studies suggesting early introduction of pets to home may reduce the likelihood of developing sensitization. There are reports of individuals who will become less sensitive with continued exposure to a pet in the environment. But allergists warn that pet owners cannot rely on a breed being non-allergenic just because a particular allergic pet owner can tolerate a specific dog of that breed.

Originally translated by Oliver Latsch, Dragon Rider was published in 2004 by The Chicken House in the UK and Scholastic Inc. in the US, using a translation by Anthea Bell. Dragon Rider follows the exploits of a silver dragon named Firedrake, the Brownie Sorrel, and Ben, a human boy, in their search for the mythical part of the Himalayas mountain range called the Rim of Heaven to find a safe place for Firedrake's kin to live when the dragon finds out that humans intend to flood the valley where he and his fellow dragons live. This book has 523 pages and is well-suited to readers aged nine to thirteen. Plot Firedrake is a young dragon who lives in a hidden valley outside of London with other dragons. After realizing that humans intend to flood the valley and the dragons living there are no longer safe, Firedrake sets off with the guidance from the eldest member of his clan (Slatebeard) to avoid the \\"Golden One\\" and to find the Rim of Heaven, a legendary location that is a safe heaven for all dragons. Firedrake travels to Hamburg with his friend Sorrel, a forest brownie, to find Gilbert Graytail, a rat who specializes in making maps. Not long after landing at the docks of Hamburg, Firedrake saves an orphan human Ben from dockworkers. Ben, in repayment for this, then provides Sorrel with human clothes so she may go in disguise to find Gilbert while Firedrake stays hidden. After finding Gilbert and providing payment, Gilbert hands over a map leading to the Himalayas, marking dangerous areas along the way. Only able to fly at night, Firedrake wastes no time wanting to leave. He and Sorrel also decide to bring Ben along with them. After Ben and Sorrel argue about turning East too soon or not, the three end up in a mountain range full of dwarves. Firedrake sleeps while the sun is up and the dwarves wait for him to wake up. While he rests however, one of the dwarves, Gravelbeard, runs to the castle in that same mountain range, revealing Nettlebrand, the Golden One, a fearsome dragon-like monster whose only purpose in life is to hunt, kill and eat dragons and his servant, Twigleg the Homunculus. After hearing of the trio, Nettlebrand decides to follow them, hoping to hunt down and kill the last of the dragons where he failed decades before. Firedrake, Sorrel and Ben fly onward, but are soon swept off course by a storm, arriving on the shore of Egypt. Encountering a basilisk and a band of zealous archaeologists, the party eventually befriends a kindly scientist named Professor Greenbloom. Sorrel is initially suspicious but soon warms up to him. Professor Greenbloom gives Ben one of two freezing-cold metallic scales he has, which unknown to the humans, once belonged to Nettlebrand. Twigleg relays the news to Nettlebrand, who immediately makes his way to the dig site to find Professor Greenbloom and recover the scales. Meanwhile, the three searchers set out on the advice of the professor to seek the advice of a Djinn, whose thousand eyes can see everything. Ben succeeds in fulfilling the Djinn's arcane requirements with the question: \\"Where does the Rim of Heaven lie?\\" The answer to the question appears in two of the Djinn's thousand eyes; it is a path, marked by the Indus River, by a mountain range, and by a monastery. Beyond this monastery is the Rim of Heaven. In the monastery, Ben must break the moonlight on the stone dragon's head. The Djinn also gives them a prophecy: \\"When that day comes, twenty fingers will point the way to the Rim of Heaven, and silver will be worth more than gold.\\" Meanwhile, Nettlebrand tracks down Greenbloom, who managed to escape him. Twigleg is discovered but is allowed to stay due to his almost-perfect ability to understand and translate any language. He has grown to be very attached to Ben, and he begins relaying false information to his master, sending him into the middle of a desert where he got attacked by the sandmans, who the monster eventually escapes from. While flying over the ocean, a lunar eclipse occurs and Firedrake (who lives off of moonlight), cannot fly. He falls and lands on the back of an initially frightening but amiable sea serpent. She agrees to take the friends to Pakistan, where they will rendezvous with a Dracologist, Zubeida Ghalib. She alone knows a way to help Firedrake fly without moonlight. Along the way, the Serpent tells them (among other things) about Nettlebrand and his army of red-eyed Ravens. As the peaceful voyage atop Serpent-back continues, they are spotted by one of Nettlebrand's raven spies. Annoyed, Sorrel throws a stone which she has smeared her adhesive saliva. The stone sticks to the Raven's wing and sends him panicking to shore. In Pakistan, the friends enter a village where Zubeida the Dracologist is living and also find Professor Greenbloom. His wife and daughter, Guinevere, have joined him on account of the incident with Nettlebrand. Deeply worried, the two parties compare their findings, which all point to a single grim fact‚ÄîNettlebrand is hunting the Dragons who live in the Rim of Heaven, and expects Firedrake to find them for him. Dr. Ghalib reveals a legend of a Dragon Rider who once lived in the village. Ben is his reincarnation, and his destiny is to save the silver dragons from a terrible enemy. No sooner have they heard the legend than two more of Nettlebrand's ravens descend on them. Sorrel attempts the saliva trick again, with one variation: a few sparks of Dragon-fire are added to the mix. The stones do not adhere, but the Ravens are indeed changed before the eyes of all, into a few crabs. This new strangeness on the part of Nettlebrand disturbs the searchers, ultimately inducing Twigleg to reveal his original intentions as Nettlebrand's spy. He also reveals Nettlebrand's origin‚Äîan alchemist created Nettlebrand as a dragon killing machine to obtain the Dragons' horns which he used in his experiments to create gold. Twigleg, and his eleven other Homunculus brothers, were made as Nettlebrand's caretakers. When the Silver Dragons went into hiding, Nettlebrand killed the alchemist and eventually ate all of Twigleg's brothers, then went hunting on his own. Zubeida showed Firedrake not only the tomb of the original Dragon Rider, but also a specie of flower which collects moonlight in the form of dewdrops on its leaves. Having drunk this \\"moon-dew\\", Firedrake is able to fly even if there's no moon at all. The two parties split up to lose Nettlebrand's pursuit in the mountains. After a hazardous encounter with a Roc, they are forced off course and must take refuge in a valley. Nettlebrand continues tailing a boat wherein are Professor Greenbloom and his family, knowing they will lead him to Firedrake, but is seen by Guinevere. In the valley, help comes to Firedrake and company in the form of Lola Graytail, Gilbert's niece. Lola had been cartographing the country for her uncle and she guides them to the monastery. There, they are welcomed by the monks, who look on Firedrake as a bringer of good fortune. Also it is here that Ben \\"breaks the moonlight\\"--- actually a moonstone kept by the monks for this purpose. Ben shatters the moonstone and summons the aid of a four-armed brownie, named Burr-Burr-Chan. He agrees to guide Firedrake, Sorrel, Twigleg, and Ben to the Rim of Heaven. He warns, however, that Firedrake's kin have degenerated into earthbound cowards as a result of hiding from Nettlebrand. Whilst waiting for the moment of departure, the company discover Gravelbeard (who was threatened by Nettlebrand into becoming another spy) but fail to catch him. They fly on their way swiftly, with Nettlebrand in pursuit. To Twigleg's dismay, in the center of the Rim of Heaven is a great lake, a perfect gateway for Nettlebrand, who can travel instantaneously by water. To make sure that he is right, Lola takes Twigleg in her miniature airplane to investigate and distract Nettlebrand, while above the others seek the Dragons' cave. There, they meet with a she-Dragon, Maia. She is the only living dragon there, as the other twenty-two have since turned into stone through lack of moonlight. Outside, Lola and Twigleg found Gravelbeard. In the struggle that follows, the Dwarf's hat (which functions as an altitude compensator), is taken by Twigleg. Promptly Gravelbeard is struck with mountain sickness, allowing himself to be taken a prisoner. Nettlebrand, who now knows their location, is coming. No one knows how they could ever stop him since he is twenty times as strong as one dragon as well as immune to other dragons' firepower. In disgust, Sorrel spits on the golden scale which the Professor gave to Ben. Inspired by his success with the Ravens, Firedrake breathes fire on it and reduces it to gold paint. Twigleg comes up with a plan. He pretends to be still loyal to Nettelbrand and frees Gravelbeard then sent him back to Nettlebrand. The Golden One, elated by upcoming success, orders the Dwarf to polish his armor. Unfortunately for Nettlebrand, the armor polish has been replaced with Brownie spits. When Nettlebrand enters the cave, he was at once dive-bombed by Firedrake, Maia, and Lola in her plane. At last, the Dragons came together and set Nettlebrand afire. The Brownie spits reacted at once, dissolving Nettlebrand's armor and destroying him. Nettlebrand melts to reveal nothing but a toad underneath. As the company stare in wonder at this transformation, Gravelbeard enters. He has seen the marvelous gemstones and rock formations in the cave, and wishes to enhance them with his own skill, revealing that doing so will bring the petrified dragons back to life. Within a few days, all the silver dragons are awakened again. Firedrake and Maia went flying with Sorrel and Burr-Burr-Chan to bring the other members of their species back home. Ben and Twigleg went to live with Professor Greenbloom and his family. Two months later, news reached the humans that Firedrake has convinced the silver dragons to come with him to the Rim of Heaven. Eager to see their friends again, Ben and Guinevere occupy their time with other investigations of \\"imaginary\\" creatures until they can visit the silver dragons again. Reception Dragon Rider ranked #21 of the New York Times children's books bestseller list in September 2004. Sequels In late 2015, Cornelia Funke divulged details on a sequel to Dragon Rider, titled A Griffin's Feather. The sequel would be set two years following the first book, with Ben living with the Greenblooms at a creature refuge founded in Norway. The book was published in Germany under the title Drachenreiter: Die Feder eines Greifs on 23 September 2016, with the hopes of releasing it in English the following year in 2017. Dragon Rider: The Griffin's Feather was published on 5 July 2017. Funke also announced plans for a third book, tentatively titled The Volcano Adventure, which would be told like a graphic novel, along with mobile phone interaction. Film adaptation On 31 October 2016, Cornelia Funke posted on social medias that she was meeting with a director for an animated adaptation of Dragon Rider. Dragon Rider was produced by Constantin Film and Rise Pictures, and released in Germany on 6 August 2020.

His music career started in the early 1980s, as the frontman of the world music influenced rock band Haustor. He emigrated to France after the Balkan war started in 1991, and has recorded five albums with various musicians from different parts of the world: Apokalipso, U ≈°irokom svijetu, Ruke, MHM A-HA OH YEAH DA-DA and Plavi avion. Career In 1979, Srƒëan Sacher (bass) and Darko Rundek (guitar and vocals) formed Haustor with Zoran Peri≈°iƒá (drums) and Ozren ≈†tigliƒá (guitar). Damir Prica (saxophone), Nikola Santro (trombone), and Zoran Vuletiƒá (keyboards) completed the original Haustor line- up. They were open to reggae, Latin American music and African music influences and were one of the top bands of the rock scene in Yugoslavia, performing numerous concerts to thousands of spectators. The band released four studio-recorded albums during the 80's: Haustor in 1981, Treƒái Svijet (Third world) in 1984, Bolero in 1985 and Tajni Grad (Secret Town) in 1988; three singles: 'Moja prva ljubav' (My first love) in 1980, 'Zima' (Winter) in 1981 and 'Radio' in 1982. The live album Ulje je na vodi (Oil on the water) was recorded in 1982 and released in 1995, and 81‚Äì'88 (a 'Best of' compilation) was released in 1995. In 1982, Rundek obtained his diploma in theatre directing from the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb with his graduation performance of America Hurray! by J.C. Van Italie. He went on to direct a number of plays (They say the Owl Once Was the Baker's Daughter; Three Slaps, Satires from Hekuba, No, Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh...), and also appeared occasionally as an actor. Darko's principal role in the theatre remains that of composer, with more than 30 productions to his credit, ranging from intimate children's theatre to international touring performances. =Solo career= Since 1991, he has been living in France. In 1995, Rundek started his solo career at the Croatian music festival Fiju Briju in front of an audience of 10,000 people. He presented new musical material which was to be developed during the following series of concerts throughout Croatia. In 1997 the album Apokalipso (apocalypse+calypso) was recorded with a multitude of instruments and musicians and with strong support from the record company Jabukaton. The album was stylistically very diverse, viewing the post- communist era with irony and poetry. Apokalipso was the music event of 1997 in Croatia. It won 5 Porins (song of the year, hit of the year, best male singer, best video clip, best vocal collaboration), and 4 Black Cats (song of the year for Apokalipso, best rock singer, best rock collaboration, best video clip). The album U ≈°irokom svijetu turned more towards folkloric influences. Mandolin, bag pipes and tin whistle enhanced the eclectic style of the songs. The atmosphere became intimate and more introspective. The band became more stable and toured in Croatia and other ex-Yugoslavian countries. =Darko Rundek and Cargo Orkestar= The project initially stemmed from Darko Rundek's song. It grew out of the need to develop ideas in collaboration with other musicians through improvisation and exchange. Isabel, ƒêani Pervan, Du≈°an Vraniƒá and Vedran Peternel started working on Darko Rundek's new songs; Isabel's mill in Burgundy in France, with her collection of exotic instruments, provided the working environment. They also incorporate a musical tradition with a potential for accepting diverse influences, firstly Balkan music, Central European music and Mediterranean, then reggae, Latin American, eastern and African music. Isabel (Swiss violinist), ƒêani Pervan (percussionist), Du≈°an Vraniƒá (pianist), Vedran Peternel (sound-designer) and Darko, undertook a ten-day improvisation session in Isabel's converted watermill on the outskirts of a small Burgundian village. When they finally laid down their instruments, they had the basis of the album Ruke (documented by the camera of Biljana Tutorov, whose video projections have become a feature of Cargo Orkestar's concerts). Trumpetist Igor Pavlica (Darko's old collaborator from the Haustor and solo periods), Emmanuel Ferraz (trombone player), and the bass player Bruno Arnal, joined Cargo Orkestar for the promotional tour in 2002. In 2004 Ruke was published by Piranha Musik ‚Äì Berlin, and distributed in 25 countries. In 2004, the live album Zagrebaƒçka magla was released under the Menart-Zagreb label, and Mhm A-Ha Oh Yeah Da-Da was published in 2006 by German record label Piranha. For the concerts, Cargo mixes new and old from the rich repertoire of Rundek songs. The informal and open feel is as remarkable in small concert halls as it is in large stadiums. One year later, the album was recorded and simultaneously released by record labels Menart in Croatia and Metropolis in Serbia. Some songs are co-signed by different members of the group. On the promotion tour the band was completed with three more musicians and gradually developed into Darko Rundek & Cargo Orkestar. =Theatre, film and radio= Rundek has written and produced film music, and occasionally appeared as an actor (Doctor Kljaiƒá in A View from Eiffel Tower), by N. Vukƒçeviƒá; Karlo in 100 minuta Slave, by D. Mataniƒá; Youngster in The Eagle (Orao), by Z. Tadiƒá, Marjan film). He played Herman in J. Burgerfor's film Ruins (Ru≈°evine), for which he was awarded best male film actor in Slovenia. Between 1982 and 1991, Darko Rundek directed around 50 radio-plays and documentaries for the drama department of radio Zagreb, for which he also wrote the music. Some of these represented radio Zagreb at various international festivals: Prix Italia, Premios Ondas and Prix Futura.

Biography For most of her career she taught in the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh, having moved there from Carnegie Mellon University. She retired to her native Dunedin, New Zealand, where she graduated from the University of Otago.

Baier received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago in 1999. Her husband was the philosopher Kurt Baier. Ethics Baier's approach to ethics is that women and men make their decisions about right and wrong based on different value systems: men take their moral decisions according to an idea of justice, while women are motivated by a sense of trust or caring. The history of philosophy having been overwhelmingly compiled by men, she suggests, leads to a body of thought which apparently ignores the role of nurture and trust in human philosophy.Annette Baier (1929 -) from Open2.net Bibliography Books =  , including especially \\"What Do Women Want in an Ethical Theory?\\" and \\"The Need For More Than Justice\\".  * = Chapters in books = * * ReferencesExternal links *Trust 1991 Tanner Lecture by Annette Baier *Obituary: Annette C.

A page from Taylor's The Alphabet showing the development of different variants of Greek letters Life Though he wrote several inflammatory theological pamphlets, such as The Liturgy and the Dissenters (1860) and Leaves from an Egyptian Notebook (1888), he is chiefly remembered today for his archaeological and philological studies, which include Words and Places (1864), Etruscan Researches (1874), The Alphabet (1883), and Greeks and Goths (1879), in which he argued that the runes were derived from a variety of the Hellenic alphabet used in the Greek colonies on the Black Sea about the 6th century B.C. \\"It would seem that the Goths, who then occupied the region between the southern coast of the Baltic and the upper waters of the Dnieper,\\" Taylor argued in a subsequent paper, \\"must have obtained a knowledge of the art of writing from the merchants of Olbia and other Greek colonies on the Euxine, who, according to Herodotus, voyaged forty days' journey to the North by the great trade route of the Dnieper.\\" Taylor's ideas concerning religion raised many eyebrows amongst his contemporaries. In 1887, he argued that Islam had been more successful than Christianity in \\"civilizing\\" Africa and ridding the \\"Dark Continent\\" of cannibalism, devil worship, human sacrifice, witchcraft, infanticide, and bad hygiene. Cheers followed not Taylor's lecture‚Äîmade to a British audience primarily of Anglican missionary supporters‚Äîbut the remarks made by the speakers who followed him and denounced his theories. In the same address, delivered to the Wolverhampton Church Congress in 1887, Taylor argued that \\"Islam, above all, is the most powerful total abstinence society in the world; whereas the extension of European trade means the extension of drunkenness and vice, and the degradation of the people.\\" Ultimately, Taylor's comments were made based upon the racist assumptions of Islamicist controversialists, including the famous traveller and writer Richard Burton that the lower races were better adapted to respond to the message of Islam than that of Christianity. In 1890, Taylor published Origin of the Aryans, in which he proposed the \\"round-head theory,\\" in which he argued that European Russia was the homeland of all of the Indo-European peoples, in opposition to the assertion of Max M√ºller, who had argued for Central Asia. Taylor believed that the Celts (tall stature, round heads), a branch of the ancient Finns, were the only true Aryans who had \\"Aryanized\\" the Iberians (short stature, long heads), the Scandinavians (tall stature, long heads), and the Ligurians (short stature, round heads). In regards to the origin of the Basques, Taylor believed that they were direct descendants of the Etruscans. Taylor‚Äôs theories on the Etruscans, though now obsolete, caused great interest at the time that they were presented. He believed that the Etruscan language belonged to the Altaic language group, and that Etruscan mythology was fundamental to that presented in the Kalevala, the great Finnish epic. In his Names and Their Histories (1898), Taylor presented an impressive survey of local, foreign, and national names. Though many of his toponymic theories have been discounted, he laid the groundwork for future research in this then-new discipline.

Indian logic stands as one of the three original traditions of logic, alongside the Greek and the Chinese logic. The Indian tradition continued to develop through early to modern times, in the form of the Navya-NyƒÅya school of logic. Origins The Nasadiya Sukta of the Rigveda (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of catuskoti: \\"A\\", \\"not A\\", \\"A and 'not A'\\", and \\"not A and not not A\\".S. Kak (2004). The Architecture of Knowledge. CSC, Delhi. Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) founded the anviksiki school of logic.S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools. The Mahabharata (12.173.45), around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, refers to the anviksiki and tarka schools of logic. (c. 5th century BCE) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350-283 BCE) in his Arthashastra as an independent field of inquiry anviksiki.R. P. Kangle (1986). The Kautiliya Arthashastra (1.2.11). Motilal Banarsidass. The schoolsVaisheshika= Vaisheshika, also Vaisesika, (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡•à‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡§ø‡§ï) is one of the six Hindu schools of Indian philosophy. It came to be closely associated with the Hindu school of logic, Nyaya. Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism and postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms. Originally proposed by KanƒÅda (or Kana- bhuk, literally, atom-eater) from around the 2nd century BCE. =Catuskoti= In the 2nd century, the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna refined the Catuskoti form of logic. The Catuskoti is also often glossed Tetralemma (Greek) which is the name for a largely comparable, but not equatable, 'four corner argument' within the tradition of Classical logic. =Nyaya= NyƒÅya (ni-ƒÅy√°, literally \\"recursion\\", used in the sense of \\"syllogism, inference\\") is the name given to one of the six orthodox or astika schools of Hindu philosophy ‚Äî specifically the school of logic. The Nyaya school of philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the Nyaya Sutras, which were written by Gotama in around the 2nd century CE. The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to modern Hindu thought is its methodology. This methodology is based on a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by most of the other Indian schools (orthodox or not), much in the same way that Western philosophy can be said to be largely based on Aristotelian logic. Followers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to obtain release from suffering. They therefore took great pains to identify valid sources of knowledge and to distinguish these from mere false opinions. According to the Nyaya school, there are exactly four sources of knowledge (pramanas): perception, inference, comparison and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these can, of course, still be either valid or invalid. As a result, Nyaya scholars again went to great pains to identify, in each case, what it took to make knowledge valid, in the process creating a number of explanatory schemes. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest Indian equivalent to contemporary analytic philosophy. =Jain logic= Jainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of logic by also occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Jain logic developed and flourished from 6th century BCE to 17th century CE. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason. Thus one finds in the Jain texts, deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive. P. 590 The Jains have doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning: *AnekƒÅntavƒÅda ‚Äì the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness; *SyƒÅdvƒÅda ‚Äì the theory of conditioned predication and; *NayavƒÅda ‚Äì The theory of partial standpoints. These Jain philosophical concepts made most important contributions to the ancient Indian philosophy, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.* p335\\" Following is the list of Jain philosophers who contributed to Jain Logic: *Kundakunda (2nd century CE), exponent of Jain mysticism and Jain nayas dealing with the nature of the soul and its contamination by matter, author of Pa√±cƒÅstikƒÅyasƒÅra (Essence of the Five Existents), the PravachanasƒÅra (Essence of the Scripture) and the SamayasƒÅra (Essence of the Doctrine). *UmƒÅsvƒÅti or Umasvami (2nd century CE), author of first Jain work in Sanskrit, TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra, expounding the Jain philosophy in a most systematized form acceptable to all sects of Jainism. *Siddhasena DivƒÅkara (5th century CE), Jain logician and author of important works in Sanskrit and Prakrit, such as, NyƒÅyƒÅvatƒÅra (on Logic) and Sanmatis≈´tra (dealing with the seven Jaina standpoints, knowledge and the objects of knowledge) *Haribhadrasuri (8th century CE), a Jaina thinker, author and great proponent of anekƒÅntavƒÅda and classical yoga, as a soteriological system of meditation in Jaina context. His works include and Yogabindu. *Aacharya Hemacandra (1089‚Äì1172 CE) - a Jaina thinker, author, historian, grammarian and logician. His works include Yoga≈õƒÅstra and Trishashthi Shalaka Purusha charitra. *Mahopadhya Ya≈õovijayaji (1624‚Äì88 CE) ‚Äì Jain logician and considered as intellectual giant to contribute to Jaina philosophy. *Acharya Mahapragya (1920‚Äì2010 CE);‚Äì Jain logician and considered as intellectual giant and encyclopedia to contribute to Jaina philosophy. The Eminent Scholar of Philosophy, Dr. Daya Krishna has recognized Acharya Shri Mahapragya as the most knowledgeable person on the subject of Jain Logic. His Book \\"New Dimensions in Jaina Logic\\" is the one of the best work on the subject in modern era. Acharya Mahapragya is known for his enlightening discourses. In 1975, he was specially invited to deliver a series of nine lectures on Jain Logic at the University of Rajasthan at Jaipur. The University published these lectures in the form of a book entitled ‚ÄòJain Nyay Ka Vikas‚Äô. His books on the subjects mainly include ‚ÄòJain Darshan-Mannan aur Mimansa‚Äô, ‚ÄòJain Dharma Aur Sanskriti‚Äô, ‚ÄòJain Darshan and Anekantvad‚Äô, ‚ÄòJain Dharma aur Darshan‚Äô, and many more. =Buddhist logic= Indian Buddhist logic (called Pramana) flourished from about 500 CE up to 1300 CE. The three main authors of Buddhist logic are Vasubandhu (400‚Äì800 CE), DignƒÅga (480‚Äì540 CE), and Dharmakƒ´rti (600‚Äì660 CE). The most important theoretical achievements are the doctrine of Trair≈´pya (Skrt. ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•à‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø) and the highly formal scheme of the Hetucakra (Skrt. ‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞) (\\"Wheel of Reasons\\") given by DignƒÅga. There is a still living tradition of Buddhist logic in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, where logic is an important part of the education of monks. =Navya-Nyaya= The Navya-NyƒÅya or Neo-Logical dar≈õana (school) of Indian philosophy was founded in the 13th century CE by the philosopher Gangesha Upadhyaya of Mithila. It was a development of the classical NyƒÅya dar≈õana. Other influences on Navya-NyƒÅya were the work of earlier philosophers VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra (900‚Äì980 CE) and Udayana (late 10th century). Gange≈õa's book TattvacintƒÅma·πái (\\"Thought- Jewel of Reality\\") was written partly in response to ≈örƒ´har≈õa's KhandanakhandakhƒÅdya, a defence of Advaita VedƒÅnta, which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of NyƒÅya theories of thought and language. In his book, Gange≈õa both addressed some of those criticisms and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì critically examined the NyƒÅya dar≈õana himself. He held that, while ≈örƒ´har≈õa had failed successfully to challenge the NyƒÅya realist ontology, his and Gange≈õa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of NyƒÅya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise. TattvacintƒÅmani dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, logic, set theory, and especially epistemology, which Gange≈õa examined rigorously, developing and improving the NyƒÅya scheme, and offering examples. The results, especially his analysis of cognition, were taken up and used by other dar≈õanas. Navya-NyƒÅya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the NyƒÅya concepts into four main categories: sense or perception (pratyak≈üa), inference (anumƒÅna), comparison or similarity (upamƒÅna), and testimony (sound or word; ≈õabda). This later school began around eastern India and Bengal, and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlob Frege's \\"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\\" and his \\"definition of number,\\" as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of \\"restrictive conditions for universals\\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory. Udayana in particular developed theories on \\"restrictive conditions for universals\\" and \\"infinite regress\\" that anticipated aspects of modern set theory. According to Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti: Influence of Indian logic on modern logic In the late 18th- century British scholars began to take an interest in Indian philosophy and discovered the sophistication of the Indian study of inference. This process culminated in Henry T. Colebrooke's The Philosophy of the Hindus: On the Nyaya and Vaisesika Systems in 1824,Colebrooke, Henry Thomas \\"Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus\\" London: Williams and Norgate, 1858 available online at https://archive.org/details/essaysonreligio00colegoog which provided an analysis of inference and comparison to the received Aristotelian logic, resulting in the observation that the Aristotelian syllogism could not account for the Indian syllogism. Max Mueller contributed an appendix to the 1853 edition of Thomson's Outline of the Laws of Thought, in which he placed Greek and Indian logic on the same plane: \\"The sciences of Logic and Grammar were, as far as history allows us to judge, invented or originally conceived by two nations only, by Hindus and Greeks.\\"Mueller, Max \\"Of Indian Logic\\" Appendix To Thomson's Laws of Thought, London: Longmans Green and Co 1853 online at https://archive.org/details/anoutlinenecess03thomgoog Jonardon Ganeri has observed that this period saw George Boole (1815-1864) and Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) make their pioneering applications of algebraic ideas to the formulation of logic (such as algebraic logic and Boolean logic), and has suggested that these figures were likely to be aware of these studies in xeno- logic, and further that their acquired awareness of the shortcomings of propositional logic are likely to have stimulated their willingness to look outside the system. Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and had an influence on pioneering 19th-century logicians such as Charles Babbage (1791-1871), Augustus De Morgan, and particularly George Boole, as confirmed by Boole's wife Mary Everest Boole in an \\"open letter to Dr Bose\\" titled \\"Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century\\" written in 1901:Boole, Mary Everest \\"Collected Works\\" eds E M Cobham and E S Dummer London, Daniel 1931. Letter also published in the Ceylon National Review in 1909, and published as a separate pamphlet \\"The Psychologic Aspect of Imperialism\\" in 1911. De Morgan himself wrote in 1860 of the significance of Indian logic: \\"The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the Sanscrit and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic.\\" De Morgan, Augustus \\"Syllabus of a proposed system of logic\\", London : Walton and Maberly 1860; online at https://archive.org/details/syllabusofpropos00demoiala Mathematicians became aware of the influence of Indian mathematics on the European. For example, Hermann Weyl wrote: \\"Occidental mathematics has in past centuries broken away from the Greek view and followed a course which seems to have originated in India and which has been transmitted, with additions, to us by the Arabs; in it the concept of number appears as logically prior to the concepts of geometry. [...] But the present trend in mathematics is clearly in the direction of a return to the Greek standpoint; we now look upon each branch of mathematics as determining its own characteristic domain of quantities.\\"Weyl, Hermann \\"The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics\\", 1950, p.viii; online at https://books.google.com/books?id=jQbEcDDqGb8C See also Tarka- Sangraha *Debates in ancient India *Seven valued logic NotesReferences * Ganeri, Jonardon 2004.

Dual ignition coils (blue cylinders, top of picture) on a Saab 92. An ignition coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the ignition coil to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses. Ignition systems are not required for diesel engines which rely on compression to ignite the fuel/air mixture. Basic principles An ignition coil consists of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an ignition coil has an open magnetic circuit ‚Äî the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug. The primary winding has relatively few turns of heavy wire. The secondary winding consists of thousands of turns of smaller wire, insulated from the high voltage by enamel on the wires and layers of oiled paper insulation. The coil is usually inserted into a metal can or plastic case with insulated terminals for the high voltage and low voltage connections. When the contact breaker closes, it allows current from the battery to flow through the primary winding of the ignition coil. The current does not flow instantly because of the inductance of the coil. Current flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field in the core and in the air surrounding the core. The current must flow long enough to store enough energy in the field for the spark. Once the current has built up to its full level, the contact breaker opens. Since it has a capacitor connected across it, the primary winding and the capacitor form a tuned circuit, and as the stored energy oscillates between the inductor formed by the coil and the capacitor, the changing magnetic field in the core of the coil induces a much larger voltage in the secondary of the coil. More modern electronic ignition systems operate on exactly the same principle, but some rely on charging the capacitor to around 400 volts rather than charging the inductance of the coil. The timing of the opening of the contacts (or switching of the transistor) must be matched to the position of the piston in the cylinder so that the spark may be timed to ignite the air/fuel mixture to extract the most angular momentum possible. This is usually several degrees before the piston reaches top dead center. The contacts are driven off a shaft that is driven by the engine camshaft, or, if electronic ignition is used, a sensor on the engine shaft controls the timing of the pulses. The amount of energy in the spark required to ignite the air-fuel mixture varies depending on the pressure and composition of the mixture, and on the speed of the engine. Under laboratory conditions as little as 1 millijoule is required in each spark, but practical coils must deliver much more energy than this to allow for higher pressure, rich or lean mixtures, losses in ignition wiring, and plug fouling and leakage. When gas velocity is high in the spark gap, the arc between the terminals is blown away from the terminals, making the arc longer and requiring more energy in each spark. Between 30 and 70 milli-joules are delivered in each spark. Materials Formerly, ignition coils were made with varnish and paper insulated high-voltage windings, inserted into a drawn-steel can and filled with oil or asphalt for insulation and moisture protection. Coils on modern automobiles are cast in filled epoxy resins which penetrate any voids within the winding. A modern single-spark system has one coil per spark plug. To prevent premature sparking at the start of the primary pulse, a diode or secondary spark gap is installed in the coil to block the reverse pulse that would otherwise form. In a coil meant for a wasted spark system, the secondary winding has two terminals isolated from the primary, and each terminal connects to a spark plug. With this system, no extra diode is needed since there would be no fuel-air mixture present at the inactive spark plug.Horst Bauer (ed)., Automotive Handbook 4th Edition, Robert Bosch GmBH, 1996, pg.439-440 In a low-inductance coil, fewer primary turns are used, so primary current is higher. This is not compatible with the capacity of mechanical breaker points, so solid-state switching is used. Use in cars Diagram of the Citro√´n 2CV wasted spark ignition systemEarly gasoline (petrol) internal combustion engines used a magneto ignition system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in piston-engine aircraft to keep the engine running in the event of an electrical failure. The voltage produced by a magneto is dependent on the speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier.V. A. W. Hillier, Hillier's Fundamentals of Automotive Electronics, Nelson Thornes, 1996 , page 167 When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking and lighting, the ignition coil system displaced magneto ignition. In older vehicles, a single coil would serve all the spark plugs via the ignition distributor. Notable exceptions are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citro√´n 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just contact breakers, in a wasted spark system. =Modern ignition systems= Coil-pack of an Opel engine In modern systems, the distributor is omitted and ignition is instead electronically controlled. Much smaller coils are used with one coil for each spark plug or one coil serving two spark plugs (for example two coils in a four-cylinder engine, or three coils in a six-cylinder engine). A large ignition coil puts out about 40 kV, and a small one such as from a lawn mower puts out about 15 kV. These coils may be remotely mounted or they may be placed on top of the spark plug, known as direct ignition (DI) or coil-on-plug. Where one coil serves two spark plugs (in two cylinders), it is through the wasted spark system. In this arrangement, the coil generates two sparks per cycle to both cylinders. The fuel in the cylinder that is nearing the end of its compression stroke is ignited, whereas the spark in its companion that is nearing the end of its exhaust stroke has no effect. The wasted spark system is more reliable than a single coil system with a distributor and less expensive than coil-on-plug. Where coils are individually applied per cylinder, they may all be contained in a single molded block with multiple high-tension terminals. This is commonly called a coil-pack. A bad coil pack may cause a misfire, bad fuel consumption or loss of power.

The invasion ended the Pagan Empire, which disintegrated into several small kingdoms. Overview The battle was initiated by the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which sensed opportunity in the political turmoil caused by their successful 1283 invasion of the Pagan Empire in the Battle of Bhamo. After Bhamo, the Mongol army penetrated the Irrawaddy River valley and established garrisons there. The political turmoil of these events tempted Kublai Khan's grandson Esen-Tem√ºr, who was stationed in Yunnan, into action. Tem√ºr led a large army down the Irrawaddy river valley and captured the capital city Pagan, also sending military parties across the country to ensure submission. The Burmese king Narathihapate fled Pagan to Lower Burma prior to the battle, and the Burmese defense collapsed. The king is remembered in Burmese history as Tayokpyemin (lit. \\"the king who ran away from the Chinese\\"). In Lower Burma, the king was promptly assassinated by one of his sons, Thihathu of Prome. Aftermath The 250-year-old Pagan Empire now disintegrated. The kingdom was fractured into several small power centers as the Mongols did not fill the power vacuum in the searing Irrawaddy valley. The Mongol army instead stayed farther north in Tagaung (present-day northern Mandalay Region). In central Burma, another son of Narathihapate, Kyawswa, was installed as king by dowager queen Saw. But Kyawswa controlled only the immediate surrounding area of Pagan. Even in central Burma, the real power rested with three Pagan military commanders who through their small but well- disciplined army controlled the Kyaukse district, the most important granary of Pagan. Kyawswa had no choice but to recognize them as lords of Kyaukse. The brothers increasingly acted like sovereigns. Nearly ten years after the fall of Pagan, Kyawswa decided to become a Mongol vassal in January 1297. He received official Mongol recognition as the ruler of Burma in March 1298. Unsatisfied with their reduced status, the brothers dethroned Kyawswa in December 1298, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom, officially ending the Pagan Kingdom. The Mongol army's effort to install their new nominee, one of Kyawswa's sons, to the Pagan throne in 1301 was unsuccessful. Two years later, in 1303, the Yuan court decided to withdraw completely from Upper Burma, and the Mongol army left Tagaung.Htin Aung, pp. 65-81 NotesReferences  * Pagan Category:13th century in Burma Pagan Category:1287 in the Mongol Empire Pagan ","title":"Battle of Pagan"},{"id":"2015999","title":"Georgia Railroad and Banking Company"},{"id":"2016004","text":"The Howard DGA-15 was a single-engine civil aircraft produced in the United States by the Howard Aircraft Corporation from 1939 to 1944. After the United States' entry into World War II, it was built in large numbers for the United States Navy and also served various roles in the United States Army Air Forces. Design and development The Howard Aircraft Company (later Howard Aircraft Corporation) was formed in 1936 to build commercial derivatives of the Howard DGA-6 (named Mister Mulligan),Bushell 1987, p.42.\\"DGA\\" stands for \\"Damn Good Airplane\\" in designer/pilot Benny Howard's nomenclature. a successful four-seat racing aircraft which had won both the Bendix and the Thompson Trophies in 1935, the only aircraft ever to win both races.Bushell 1987, pp.40-41. These successes did indeed bring the DGA series much attention, and Howard produced a series of closely related models differing mainly in the engine type, consisting of the DGA-7, -8, -9, -11 and -12. Offering high performance and being comprehensively equipped, despite a high purchase price (with the DGA-11 selling for $17,865),Bushell 1987, p.43. these became coveted aircraft owned by corporations, wealthy individuals, and movie stars, such as Wallace Beery, who was himself a pilot. (In the movie Bugsy, Warren Beatty, playing the title role, is flown from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in a red Howard DGA-15.) In 1939, the Howard Aircraft Corporation produced a new development of the basic design, the DGA-15. Like its predecessors, the DGA-15 was a single-engined high-winged monoplane with a wooden wing and a steel-tube-truss fuselage, but it was distinguished by a deeper and wider fuselage, allowing five people to be seated in comfort. It was available in several versions, differing in the engine fitted. The DGA-15P was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engine, while the DGA-15J used a Jacobs L6MB and the DGA-15W a Wright R-760-E2 Whirlwind. In an era when airlines were flying Douglas DC-3s, the Howards cruising at 160 to 170 mph could match their speed, range and comfort with the rear seat leg room exceeding airline standards with limousine-like capaciousness, and high wing loading allowing the Howards to ride through most turbulence comfortably. =World War II= Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, about 80 DGA-8 through -15 aircraft had been built at the Howard Aircraft Corporation factory on the south side of Chicago Municipal Airport. With America's entry into World War II, most of the civilian Howards were commandeered by the military. The Army used them as officer transports and as air ambulances, with the designation UC-70. The Navy, in particular, much liked the aircraft and contracted Howard Aircraft Corporation to build hundreds of DGA-15Ps to its own specifications. They were used variously under several designations as an officers' utility transport (GH-1, GH-3), aerial ambulance (GH-2), and for instrument training (NH-1). A second factory was opened at Dupage County airport, west of Chicago, and about 520 DGA-15s were eventually completed. =Vintage years= DGA-15P modified with floats and added finlets for improved control. Renton, Seattle, October 1973 In their vintage years, Howards DGA series are prized more for their utility than for their clean lines. Contemporary cabin aircraft have already become antiques, living pampered lives as show pieces rather than working aircraft. In the 1960s a modification was offered by the Jobmaster company of Renton, Washington, including additional seating, windows, and float installation making Howard DGA-15s attractive to bush operators, and the large cabin proved popular with sky-divers as low-capital-outlay, low- operating-cost jumping platforms. With most of the working Howard DGAs retired from active commercial service, they have become popular as restoration subjects and as alternatives to more modern equivalents with higher cost of ownership. Almost 100 of the Howard variants are still flying, mostly DGA-15s. A few of the DGA-11s also still fly, including one out of Santa Paula, California, which is probably the world headquarters for Howards, with at least five flying out of that field. Superb travelling airplanes with much better visibility, headroom, and shoulder room than some contemporary cabin aircraft, they have very long \\"legs\\" with a fuel capacity of 151 gallons in 3 belly-mounted tanks, giving an endurance of more than 7 hours, for a range, at normal cruise (130 kn, 150 mph), of over 1,000 statute miles. With modern avionics, the Howard can compete in many respects with many contemporary light aircraft, due to its combination of room, comfort, speed, range and carrying capacity.

They refer to their land as Turkan. According to the 2019 Kenyan census, Turkana number 1,016,174, or 2.14% of the Kenyan population, making the Turkana the third largest Nilotic ethnic group in Kenya, after the Kalenjin and the Luo, slightly more numerous than the Maasai, and the tenth largest ethnicity in all of Kenya. Although this figure was initially controversial and rejected as too large by Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya, a court ruling (Feb 7, 2012) by Justice Mohammed Warsame stated that the Kenyan government accepts the 2009 census figures for Turkana. The language of the Turkana, an Eastern Nilotic language, is also called Turkana; their own name for it is ≈ãaTurkana or a≈ãajep a ≈ãiTurkana. The Turkana people call themselves ≈ãiTurkana (The Turkana). The name means the people of Turkan. They are mainly semi-nomadic pastoralists. The Turkana are noted for raising camels and weaving baskets. In their oral traditions, they designate themselves the people of the grey bull, after the Zebu, the domestication of which played an important role in their history. In recent years, development aid programs have aimed at introducing fishing among the Turkana (a taboo in some sections of The Turkana society) with very limited success. Famous Turkana include Paul Ereng, the 1988 800M Olympic Champion and 800M former indoor world record holder, supermodel Ajuma Nasenyana; and key Kenyan government officials, including: Kenyan Ambassador to Thailand, H.E. Dr. Richard Titus Ekai; Minister of Labour, Hon. John Kiyonga Munyes - MP; and Hon. Ekwee Ethuro, current Speaker of the Senate and former MP for Turkana Central. The Turkana refer to themselves as \\"Ngiturkan\\" and their land as \\"Eturkan\\". The Turkana ethnic group as a whole is composed of two major divisions, each composed of territorial sections. The major divisions are: the Ngimonia, divided into Ngissir and non-Ngissir sections; and the Ngichoro, divided into Ngilukumong, Ngiwoyakwara, Ngigamatak, Ngibelai, and Ngibotok.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lake_Turkana.aspx HistoryOrigins= The Turkana entered Turkana basin from the north as one unit of the Ateker confederation. This cluster split as a result of internal differences, leading to the emergence of distinct independent groups. The Turkana people emerged as a victorious group in the subsequent conflict, which led to enmity between the Turkana and other Ateker cluster groups, who formed military alliances against the Turkana. The Turkana emerged victorious again by co-opting young people from conquered groups. The military power and wealth of the Turkana increased in what is now the northern plains of Turkana. Turkana tradition often states that the cultivation of Zebu cattle and the rise of the diviners(ngimurok) allowed the Turkana to accrue such wealth and power. Both Zebu and the ngimurok continue play an important role in Turkana culture today. =Establishment= The establishment of the Turkana people developed as a distinct group which expanded southwards conquering ethnic nations south of its borders. The Turkana people easily conquered groups it came in contact with by employing superior tactics of war, better weapons and military organization. By the 1600s, the Turkana basin had been fully occupied by the Turkana and their allies. There was a relative long period of peace among indigenous ethnic communities around Turkana until the onset of European colonization of Africa. Sporadic conflicts involved Turkana fights against Arab, Swahili and Abyssinian slave raiders and ivory traders. =Colonial period= European colonization brought a new dimension to conflict with Turkana putting up a lasting resistance to a complex enemy, the British. The Turkana put up and maintained active resistance to British colonial advances leading to a passive presence of colonial administration. By the outbreak of World War I, few parts of Turkana had been put under colonial administration. From World War I through to the end of World War II, Turkana actively participated in the wars as allies of Britain against invading Italy. Turkana was used as the launching pad for the war against invading Italian forces leading to the liberation of Abyssinia. After World War II, the British led disarmament and pacification campaigns in Turkana, leading to massive disruptions and dispossession of Turkana pastoralists. The colonial administration practiced a policy of deliberate segregation of Turkana people by categorizing Turkana Province as a closed district. This led to marginalization and underdevelopment in the lead up to Kenya's independence. CultureClothing= Traditionally, both men and women wear wraps made of rectangular woven materials and animal skins. Today, these cloths are normally purchased, having been manufactured in Nairobi or elsewhere in Kenya. Often, men wear their wraps similar to tunics, with one end connected with the other end over the right shoulder, and carry wrist knives made of steel and goat hide. Men also carry stools (known as ekicholong) and will use these for simple chairs rather than sitting on the hot midday sand. These stools also double as headrests, keeping one's head elevated from the sand, and protecting any ceremonial head decorations from being damaged. It is also not uncommon for men to carry several staves; one is used for walking and balance when carrying loads; the other, usually slimmer and longer, is used to prod livestock during herding activities. Women will customarily wear necklaces, and will shave their hair completely which often has beads attached to the loose ends of hair. Men wear their hair shaved. Women wear two pieces of cloth, one being wrapped around the waist while the other covers the top. Traditionally leather wraps covered with ostrich egg shell beads were the norm for women's undergarments, though these are now uncommon in many areas. The Turkana people have elaborate clothing and adornment styles. Clothing is used to distinguish between age groups, development stages, occasions and status of individuals or groups in the Turkana community. Today, many Turkana have adopted western-style clothing. This is especially prominent among both men and women who live in town centers throughout Turkana. =Livestock= The Turkana rely on several rivers, such as the Turkwel River and Kerio River. When these rivers flood, new sediment and water extend onto the river plain that is cultivated after heavy rainstorms, which occur infrequently. When the rivers dry up, open-pit wells are dug in the riverbed; these are used for providing water to the livestock and also for human consumption. There are few, if any, developed wells for community and livestock drinking water, and often families must travel several hours searching for water for their livestock and themselves. Livestock is an important aspect of Turkana culture. Goats, camels, donkeys and zebu are the primary herd stock utilized by the Turkana people. In this society, livestock functions not only as a milk and meat producer, but as form of currency used for bride-price negotiations and dowries. Often, a young man will be given a single goat with which to start a herd, and he will accumulate more via animal husbandry. In turn, once he has accumulated sufficient livestock, these animals will be used to negotiate for wives. It is not uncommon for Turkana men to lead polygynous lifestyles, since livestock wealth will determine the number of wives each can negotiate for and support. Livestock also plays an important part in interactions between the Turkana and other neighboring groups, and is an important aspect of warfare in the region. Raids are not unusual in Turkana society and most of the time raids are conducted it is to steal cattle from neighboring groups such as the Taposa and the Pokot. In some cases, such raids have led to intense conflict in which dozens or even hundreds of people are injured or killed. In his book, Cattle bring us to our enemies: Turkana ecology, politics, and raiding in a disequilibrium system, J. Terrence McCabe cites several incidents in which raiding caused several deaths. McCabe notes that such raids often occur between the Turkana and the Pokot and that raiding seems to have increased in intensity over the last few years. =Food= Turkana mother preparing a meal. Turkana rely on their animals for milk, meat and blood. Wild fruits are gathered by women from the bushes and cooked for 12 hours. Slaughtered goats are roasted on a fire. Roasting meat is their favorite way of consuming meat. The Turkana often trade with the Pokots for maize, beans and vegetables and Marakwet for tobacco. The Turkana buy tea from the towns and make milk tea. In the morning, people eat maize porridge with milk, while for lunch and dinner they eat plain maize porridge (nang'aria) with a stew. Zebu are only eaten during festivals, while goat is consumed more frequently. Fish is taboo for some of the Turkana clans (or brands, \\"ngimacharin\\"). After the hunt, men go out again to gather honey, which is the only natural sweetener available in traditional diets. While the Turkana mainly rely on pastoralism they also cultivate some of their food. Multiple studies have made note of sorghum cultivation in Turkana society. One such study, Sorghum Gardens in South Turkana: Cultivation among a Nomadic Pastoral People, notes that while sorghum cultivation is quite productive it is more limited by environmental factors than pastoralism. The Jie, a long time ally of the Turkana, have sometimes been know to gift sorghum to the Turkana. =Houses= Houses are constructed over a wooden framework of domed saplings on which fronds of the Doum Palm tree Hyphaene thebaica, hides or skins, are thatched and lashed on. The house is large enough to house a family of six. Usually, during the wet season, they are elongated and covered with cowdung. Animals are kept in a brush wood pen. Due to changes in the climatic conditions, most Turkana have started changing from the traditional method of herding cattle to agro-pastoralism. =Traditional Religion= A clear boundary is not drawn between the sacred and the profane in Turkana society. In this regard, Turkana traditional religion is undifferentiated from Turkana social structure or epistemological reality‚Äîthe religion and the culture are one. The Turkana are pastoralists whose lives are shaped by the extreme climate in which they live. Each day, one must seek to find the blessings of life‚Äîwater, food, livestock, wives, children‚Äîin a manner that appeases the ancestral spirits and is in harmony with the peace within the community. Properly following the traditions (ngitalio) in daily life will certainly lead to blessing. Blessings are understood to be an increase in wealth, whether livestock, children, wives or even food. It is only through proper relationships with God (Akuj) and the ancestors, proper protection from evil, and participation in the moral economy of the community that one can be blessed. Essentially, Turkana believe in the reality of a Supreme Being named Akuj. Not much is known about Akuj other than the fact that he alone created the world and is in control of the blessings of life. There is also a belief in the existence of ancestors, ngipean or ngikaram, yet these are seen to be malevolent, requiring animal sacrifices to be appeased when angry. When angered or troubled, the ancestors will possess people in the family in order to verbally communicate with their family. There is also the recognition of ‚ÄúThe Ancestor‚Äù, Ekipe, who is seen as much more active in the everyday lives of people, yet only in negative ways. There is much concern over protecting one‚Äôs family and oneself from the evil of the Ekipe. Turkana Christians and missionaries equate ekipe with the biblical character of Devil or Satan and this has shifted more traditional understandings of ekipe away from ‚Äúan evil spirit‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Evil one‚Äù. Turkana religious specialists, ngimurok, continue to act as intermediaries between living people and ancestors and also help in problem solving in communities.The Arabs also brought Islam to the people and hence the men wear the cap whether they are Muslims or not. Ngimurok As in most African traditional religions, traditional religious specialists in Turkana are present and play an active role in almost every community event. Ngimurok help to identify both the source of evil, sickness or other problems that present themselves, and the solution or specific cure or sacrifice that needs to take place in order to restore abundant life in the family and the community. There are various types of diviners differentiated by the emuron‚Äôs source of revelation. According to Barrett, the ‚Äútrue diviners,‚Äù also known as the ‚Äúdiviners of God‚Äù, are the most respected of the ngimurok because they receive revelations directly from Akuj, normally through dreams. These ‚Äútrue diviners‚Äù follow in the pattern of the most famous Turkana ngimurok, Lokerio and Lokorijem. The latter regularly received dreams from Akuj informing him of the location of the British Army during early 20th century colonial struggles, and the former is said to have used the power and knowledge of God to divide Lake Turkana so that warriors could walk across the lake to steal camels. These ngimurok of God can still be found throughout Turkana, each in their own territory, alongside specialized ngimurok who have received specific abilities to read tea leaves, tobacco, intestines, shoes, stones and string. There are also hidden evil specialists, ngikasubak, who use objects in secret to work against people in the community, and ngikapilak, who specialize in pronouncing very strong curses employing the use of body parts from those recently deceased, but these are not included in the term emuron. Ngimurok are the people that Akuj and the Fathers speaks to in dreams; they are also the ones who can communicate with the ancestors to discern what sort of animal sacrifice is needed to restore peace, bring rain, find a remedy for a child‚Äôs illness, or who can properly bless the families at a wedding. The ngimurok in each area receive direct revelations from Akuj, who is still directly active and concerned with the creation. These ngimurok do not speak or receive messages through an intermediary god or spirit through possession. While ancestor possessions are common in Turkana, they normally occur among younger people at the home, so that the ancestor can communicate their message to those in the home. The emuron would then be consulted as to what should be done. Ngimurok are not known as people who are normally possessed. Apart from the ngimurok, there are also important clan rituals in Turkana that represent the acknowledgement and transitions of life force. The most important rituals are the birth rituals (akidoun), male and female initiation rituals that do not include circumcision (asapan and akinyonyo), marriage rituals (Akuuta), annual blessing sacrifices (Apiaret an awi), and death rituals (Akinuuk). Each of these rituals is overseen by the elders of the clan, both men and women. The elders also oversee the community-wide wedding rituals, but an emuron normally plays a role in blessing the marriage.

He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. He became Vice- President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada. Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907. Hays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered, and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters. Early life Charles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on May 16, 1856. His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when he was a child. Career In 1873, at the age of 17, he began his career in the railroad business working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. From 1877 to 1884, Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Beginning in 1884, he held the same position with the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway until 1886, when he became that company's General Manager. In 1889, he became Vice-President of the Wasbash Railroad and remained as such until 1896, when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada. In 1901, Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice-President and General Manager. In October 1909, he was appointed president of GTR, which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies. These included the Central Vermont Railway, the Grand Trunk Western Railway, the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad, the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway, the Southern New England Railway Company, the Canadian Express Company, and several others. In addition, he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies. He was Governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Montreal General Hospital and McGill University. He received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways. When Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896, it was near bankruptcy and under- performing its rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). On the advice of American financier J. Pierpont Morgan, the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive, \\"American\\" business practices to the company. He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated running rights with CPR. He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts, built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives. These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad. Transcontinental Railway Charles Melville Hays. At the time, the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad, within the borders of Canada, to run 3,600 miles from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1900, he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to Winnipeg, \\"and thence to the Pacific.\\" However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific, but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile, the government, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902. Hays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR). There were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP. *Firstly, he had planned to buy out the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), but the company resisted and instead provided competition. *Secondly, Hays lacked support from the Board of Directors in London; he wanted to link the GTR with the GTP, but the board would not back this plan. He thus proceeded on his own authority, making commitments that would ultimately ruin both the GTP and the GTR. *Thirdly, Hays faced opposition to his choice of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because there was not much traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia. Hays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable. After construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including Melville, Saskatchewan, which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains. He hired the famed architect Francis Rattenbury from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Ch√¢teau Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly, despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910. After Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands but failed to re-hire 250 previously-fired strikers despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as \\"heartless, cruel, and tyrannical.\\" By 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on \\"building to the very highest standards\\". Meanwhile, CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency. RMS Titanic In April 1912, Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP. He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the Ch√¢teau Laurier in Ottawa, Ontario, named after Prime Minister Laurier. The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25, 1912. Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy. Additionally, he might have had business with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson (son of Charles Peers Davidson), his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on B Deck, also known as the Bridge Deck. At 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, Titanic struck an iceberg. Hays helped the women in his party into one of the ship's 20 lifeboats, but he, his son-in-law, and his secretary remained and perished when the ship sank, along with 1,500 other Titanic passengers and crew. Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, \\"The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster.\\" One source, Hacking, names the daughter with Hays on the Titanic as \\"Margaret,\\" but it was his daughter, Orian, who was traveling with her husband, Thorton Davidson. That source does not mention Orian as a passenger on the ship. There was a 24-year-old woman, Margaret Bechstein Hays, on the Titanic, but she was staying in a different compartment from the C.M. Hays party with another group of people. She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 (with her Pomeranian, Lady), while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3. Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays, and Mrs. Thornton [Orian] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal, but other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York and took care of two young child survivors (Edmond and Michael Navratil), who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster. Margaret (Hays) Easton's 1913 wedding announcement says her father, Frank Hays, walked her down the aisle. Finally, Orian's death notice lists Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), not Margaret Easton, as a predeceased sister. =Death= Hays' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the Minia, and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. Two funerals were held for him on May 8, one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, the other in London at the Church of St Edmund, King and Martyr. C.M. Hays' tombstone in Montreal Legacy Hays died before he could see the GTP completed. He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. The period in which Hays led the GTR was its most prosperous era. However, his policies led to the GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP to which they did not agree. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse. The railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum, near Delson, Quebec. There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert, and the city of Melville, Saskatchewan, is named after him, as is the village of Haysport, British Columbia. Mount Hays, south of Prince Rupert, British Columbia is named for him. Charles Hays Secondary School in Prince Rupert is also named in his honour. Personal life He was survived by his wife, Clara Jennings (n√©e Gregg), whom he married in St. Louis, Missouri on October 13, 1881. They had four daughters: Orian (Mrs. Thornton Davidson, Mrs. Robert N. Hickson), Clara (Mrs. Hope Scott), Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), and Louise (Mrs. Grier).

While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3. Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

The class is used by other sanctioning bodies with compatible rules, such as the International Conference of Sports Car Clubs. The classifications within the Improved Touring group define cars that will run together competitively in a road race. While cars in different classifications may be on the track simultaneously, the only positioning that matters is between cars of the same classification. The rules for the class include the General Competition Rules (GCR), a section of the SCCA rulebook that defines the basic setup and preparation for cars in any class of SCCA racing. Improved Touring cars are also subject to the rules in the Improved Touring Category Section (ITCS) of the rulebook, which define the specific classes and provide the class-specific rules. GCR Rules The rules from the GCR applying to Improved Touring cars mostly involve safety and basic setup. The GCR specifies the construction, fabrication, and material used in installing a roll-cage, for example. It also explains the rules of the road during racing events, including the flags and right of way rules for passing maneuvers. Improved Touring is intended to provide a low barrier to entry by using a set of rules which limit modification of the cars while keeping the cars safe for competition. To this end, the cars are production-based models built after 1964 with a reasonable amount of limited modifications. The cars are run as-built by the manufacturer, except for modifications specifically allowed by the GCR or the ITCS. The Improved Touring category is broken into five classes based on the performance potential of the car. Those classes are Improved Touring A (ITA), Improved Touring B (ITB), Improved Touring C (ITC), Improved Touring S (ITS) and Improved Touring R (ITR). These basic rules make Improved Touring a popular class, since familiar and modern cars race together in groups which maximize the chances for a close finish. Rules This section is not an exhaustive set of rules; it is intended to give the reader an idea of the preparation level of the cars in this class. The ITCS specifies that cars may remove almost all of their interior components, as a safe race car has few flammable features inside and drivers do not want to worry about projectiles from inside their own cars during a race. For most cars, air induction to the point where the air meets either the carburetor or mass air flow sensor is unrestricted by the rules, so cars may be prepared with improved air intakes. Exhaust systems are also unrestricted, so exhaust systems including headers may be modified. Cars may have to remain under a maximum noise level, so mufflers might still be needed. Stock brake calipers and rotors must be used, but pad material is unrestricted. No internal engine modifications are allowed short of rebuilding to factory \\"blue print\\" specifications, though the car's ECU may be modified or replaced with an aftermarket unit. \\"Bolt-on\\" suspension modifications are allowed, including most coil-over shock‚Äìstrut systems. Relocation, reinforcement, or custom fabrication of mounting points is not allowed. DOT-approved tires are required, so full race tires may not be used. There are however some very high quality \\"DOT\\" tires available that perform very well at the track but are not actually intended for street use. Lightweight racing wheels may be used, but the sizes are limited by the rules. While the ITA, ITB, ITC, ITS and ITR classes allow different model cars in competition, the classes all use the same basic rules. The cars are grouped into the different classes based on their potential for performance. A sampling of popular cars and model years in each class includes: *ITA: Honda CR-X (1989‚Äì1991), Mazda RX-7 (12A engine, 1979‚Äì1985), Acura Integra (1.6-liter engine, 1986‚Äì1989) *ITB: BMW 318 (1984‚Äì1986) *ITC: Honda CR-X (1.5-liter engine, 1984‚Äì1987) *ITS: BMW 325 (E30 body, 1987-1991), Mazda RX-7 (13B engine, 1984-1991), Datsun 240Z (1970-1973) *ITR: BMW 328 (E36 body, 1996-1999), Porsche Boxster (2.5-liter engine, 1997-1999), Nissan 300ZX, Acura Integra Type R, Ford Mustang (V6 or 302), Mazda RX-8, Honda S2000 *IT7: Mazda RX7, 1979-1985 12a rotary References *General Competition Rules and Specifications, 2014, Sports Car Club of America. :: The current edition of this book is downloadable from the SCCA website at this page.

She is best known for chairing an inquiry whose report formed the basis of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. She served as Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge from 1984 to 1991. Early life and education Warnock was born Helen Mary Wilson on 14 April 1924 in Winchester, England, and was the youngest of seven children. Her mother Ethel was the daughter of the successful banker and financier Felix Schuster. Her father Archibald Edward Wilson (1875-1923) was a housemaster and German teacher at Winchester College and died before her birth. Her mother did not marry again. Warnock was brought up by her mother and a nanny. She never knew her eldest brother, Malcolm (1907‚Äì1969), who had autism and was cared for in a nursing home, spending his last days in a Dorset hospital. Another brother died when very young. Her other brother, Duncan Wilson (1911‚Äì1983), was a British diplomat who became Ambassador to the Soviet Union before taking up an appointment as master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. When Warnock was seven months old the family moved to Kelso House, a three-floor Victorian house, now the music centre at Peter Symonds College. She and her sister Stefana were cared for primarily by the family nanny. Warnock was educated as a boarder at St Swithun's School, Winchester, followed by Prior's Field School in the town of Guildford in Surrey. Warnock said that when she was a child she was embarrassed by her mother, who looked different from most people, often by wearing long flowing dark red clothes and walking with turned out feet. However, when Warnock was about 15 years old, she began to admire her mother's eccentricity and independent thinking. The family's inherited wealth offered Warnock a privileged education; starting in 1942 she studied classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Her studies were interrupted during the war whilst she taught for two years at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset. She returned to Oxford and graduated in 1948. CareerPhilosophy= From 1949‚Äì66, Warnock was a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St Hugh's College, Oxford. In addition to her husband Geoffrey Warnock, then a fellow of Magdalen College, her circle during this period included the philosophers Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, David Pears and Peter Strawson, as well the authors Kingsley Amis and David Cecil. She participated in radio debates on philosophy broadcast on the Third Programme. She was invited to write on contemporary ethics for a series published by Oxford University Press, which led her to study Sartre and Existentialism, resulting in three books published between 1963 and 1970. She was Talbot Research Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall from 1972 until 1976. She published a book entitled Imagination in 1976. From 1976‚Äì84, she was a senior research fellow at St Hugh's College, and was made an honorary fellow of the college in 1985. She served as mistress of Girton College, Cambridge frorm 1984‚Äì1991. She retired in 1992, but continued to serve on public committees and to write and edit books, including The Uses of Philosophy (1992), Imagination and Time (1994) and An Intelligent Person's Guide to Ethics (1998). She delivered the Gifford Lectures, entitled \\"Imagination and Understanding,\\" at the University of Glasgow in 1992. In 2000, she was a visiting professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London. Warnock wrote extensively on ethics, existentialism, and philosophy of mind. =Education= In the early 1960s, whilst still teaching at St Hugh's College, Warnock took a seat on the Oxfordshire Local Education Authority. From 1966 to 1972, she was Headmistress at the Oxford High School for Girls, giving up the position when her husband was appointed principal of Hertford College, Oxford. In the late 1970s, she published three books on the topic of education. In the 1980s and 1990s, she wrote a column for the Times Educational Supplement, as well as a pamphlet \\"Universities: Knowing Our Minds\\", and gave the Richard Dimbleby Lecture in 1985 on the topic, \\"Teacher Teach Thyself\\". =Broadcasting= Warnock was a member of the Independent Broadcasting Authority from 1972‚Äì83. In 1980, she was considered for the post of Chair of the Board of Governors of the BBC. =Public policy= Because of her background as an educationalist, Warnock was appointed in 1974 to chair a UK inquiry on special education. Her report, published in 1978, brought radical change in the field, by placing emphasis on the teaching of learning-disabled children in mainstream schools and introducing a system of \\"statementing\\" children in order for them to gain entitlement to special educational support. Warnock subsequently expressed dissatisfaction with the system that she helped to create, calling it \\"appalling\\" because of the expense of its administration and its tendency to deny support to mildly disadvantaged children. She recommended the establishment of a new inquiry. From 1979‚Äì84, she sat on a Royal Commission on environmental pollution. From 1982‚Äì84, she chaired the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology. Her report on this occasion gave rise to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which governs human fertility treatment and experiments using human embryos. Its effect has been to require licensing for procedures such as in vitro fertilisation and to ban research using human embryos more than 14 days old. According to Dame Susan Leather, a former chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, \\"perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared\\". From 1984 to 1989, Warnock chaired a Home Office Committee on animal experimentation; she was a member of the Government advisory panel on spoliation from 1998. In 2008, Warnock, a committed advocate of euthanasia, caused controversy with an opinion that people with dementia should be allowed to elect to die if they felt they were \\"a burden to their family or the state\\". Aged 90, Warnock took part enthusiastically in a review of her public life as documented by BBC Sound Archives (12 July 2014). =Charity appointments= Warnock was the President of Listening Books, a charity providing audiobooks for people who struggle to read due to an illness, disability, learning difficulty or mental health issue. She was a patron of The Iris Project, a charity that promotes the teaching of classics. Appointments and honours In the 1984 New Year Honours she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). Warnock was created a life peer on 6 February 1985, taking the title Baroness Warnock, of Weeke, in the City of Winchester. She sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher until her retirement from the House on 1 June 2015. Warnock was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to charity and to children with special education needs. Warnock was elected an honorary Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 2000Honorary Fellows ‚Äì website of the British Academy and an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2011.Fellow Baroness Mary Warnock FMedSci ‚Äì website of the Academy of Medical Sciences She was awarded an honorary D.Litt. degree by the University of Bath in 1987. She was made an Honorary Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1984, and of Hertford College, Oxford in 1997. In 2018, she was named as one of the TES ten most influential people in education, in recognition of her work on special educational needs. Personal life Warnock married Geoffrey Warnock, later vice-chancellor of Oxford University, in 1949. They had two sons and three daughters; he died in 1995. She died aged 94 on 20 March 2019. She was often described as an ‚Äúatheist Anglican‚Äù. Works As chair of committees of inquiry: * The Warnock Report (1978): Special Educational Needs.

It tells the story of an ambitious young woman trying to gain an education in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban. The title comes from a Federico Garc√≠a Lorca poem and is a tale of flourishing against the odds. The film premiered In Competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival and was awarded the Jury Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Plot Nogreh, a Pakistani immigrant in Kabul, Afghanistan begins covertly attending an all girls school against her father's wishes. Nogreh is one of the few girls at the school who dreams of one day becoming president. While searching for water one day after school she comes across several truckloads of Pakistani refugees and helps them resettle in the ruins she calls home. However the number of refugees overwhelms the shelter where her family have been living and they are eventually forced out by several other families. They manage to find shelter in an abandoned airplane but this too is eventually overcrowded by refugees. Nogreh meets a refugee among the ruins who is a poet. She asks him if he knows whether the president of Pakistan is a man or a woman and he, like everyone else, does not know. However, after befriending Nogreh and learning of her ambitions to be president he helps procure political speeches and goes with her to a photographer to get photos of her that she can use to campaign. Nogreh's father learns from some of the Pakistan refugees that his son has died. Unwilling to tell his daughter-in-law he moves the family further into the desert where his grandson dies of starvation and malnourishment. In the desert they meet an old man who is waiting by his donkey who is dying of hunger and thirst. The man had been trying to get to the city to speak on behalf of Osama Bin Laden to try to prevent him from being given to the Americans. Nogreh's father informs him he is too late and that the Americans have already invaded. After Nogreh's father buries his grandson the family continues on into the desert. Development At Five in the Afternoon was the first film to be shot in Kabul after the NATO invasion. It was an international co-production between the Iranian company Makhmalbaf Productions and the French companies Bac Films and Wild Bunch. Makhmalbaf had difficulty finding an actress willing to play the lead character. Her original choice for the role would not allow her face to appear on camera. Samira's 14-year-old sister Hana Makhmalbaf made a documentary about the making of the film, entitled Joy of Madness (Lezate divanegi). It documents Samira's trials and tribulations whilst trying to persuade people in Kabul to take part in her film. As a teenager, Hana was able to amass a lot of digital video footage unnoticed.

These petrochemicals have become a major part of the chemical industry today. Origin It may be possible to make petroleum from any kind of organic matter under suitable conditions. The concentration of organic matter is not very high in the original deposits, but petroleum and natural gas evolved in places that favored retention, such as sealed-off porous sandstones. Petroleum, produced over millions of years by natural changes in organic materials, accumulates beneath the earth's surface in extremely large quantities. The first commercial oil well was set up in 1859, two years after which the first oil refinery was set up. The industry grew in the late 1940s. Demand for products from the petrochemical industry grew during the World War II. The demand for synthetic materials increased, and this rising demand was met by replacing costly and sometimes less efficient products with these synthetic materials. This caused petrochemical processing to develop into a major industry. Before this, petrochemical industry was a tentative sector where various experiments could be carried out. The industry used basic materials: synthetic rubbers in the 1900s, Bakelite, the first petrochemical- derived plastic in 1907, the first petrochemical solvents in the 1920s, polystyrene in the 1930s. After that period, the industry produced materials for a large variety of areas‚Äîfrom household goods (kitchen appliances, textile, furniture) to medicine (heart pacemakers, transfusion bags), from leisure (running shoes, computers) to highly specialized fields like archaeology and crime detection. Crude oilBasics of crude oil= Crude oils are compounds that mainly consist of many different hydrocarbon compounds that vary in appearance and composition. Average crude oil composition is 84% carbon, 14% hydrogen, 1%-3% sulphur, and less than 1% each of nitrogen, oxygen, metals and salts. Crude oils are distinguished as sweet or sour, depending upon the sulphur content present. Crude oils with a high sulfur content, which may be in the form hydrogen sulphides, are called sour, and those with less sulphur are called sweet. = Operation = A process called fractional distillation separates crude oil into various segments. Fractions at the top have a lower boiling points than fractions at the bottom. The bottom fractions are heavy, and are thus \\"cracked\\" into lighter and more useful products. Directly from the well, raw or unprocessed (\\"crude\\") oil is not useful. Though light sweet oil has been used directly as a burner fuel, these lighter fragments form explosive vapors in fuel tanks, and thus are dangerous. The oil must be separated into various parts and refined before used in fuels and lubricants, and before some of the byproducts form materials such as plastics, detergents, solvents, elastomers, and fibers such as nylon and polyesters. Procedure Crude oil and natural gas are extracted from the ground, on land or under the oceans, with oil wells. Ships, trains, and pipelines transport extracted oils and gasses to refineries. Refineries then execute processes that cause various physical and chemical changes in the crude oil and natural gas. This involves extremely specialized manufacturing processes. One of the important process is distillation, i.e., separation of heavy crude oil into lighter groups (called fractions) of hydrocarbons. There are two processes of distillation: CDU process and VDU process. The objective of the CDU process is to distill and separate valuable distillates (naphtha, kerosene, diesel) and atmospheric gas oil (AGO) from the crude feedstock. The technique used to carry out the above process is called complex distillation. On the other hand, the objective of the VDU process is to recover valuable gas oils from reduced crude via vacuum distillation. Two of the fractions of distillation are fuel oil and naphtha, which are familiar to consumers. Fuel oil, is used for heating for diesel fuel in automotive applications. Naphtha is used in gasoline and also used as the primary source for petrochemicals. Refining is the processing of one complex mixture of hydrocarbons into a number of other complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. Refining is where the job of oil industry stops and that of petrochemical industry starts. The raw materials used in the petrochemistry industry are known as feedstocks. These are obtained from the refinery:naphtha, components of natural gas such as butane, and some of the by-products of oil refining processes, such as ethane and propane. These feedstocks then undergo processing through an operation called cracking. Cracking is defined as the process of breaking down heavy oil molecules into lighter, more valuable fractions. There are two kinds: steam cracking and catalytic cracking. In steam cracking, high temperatures are used. Catalytic cracking is when a catalyst is being used. The plant where these operations are conducted is called a 'cracker'. Once these operations complete, new products are obtained that serve as building blocks of the petrochemical industry: olefins, i.e., mainly ethylene, propylene, and the so- called C4 derivatives, including butadiene‚Äîand aromatics, so called because of their distinctive perfumed smell, i.e., mainly benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Then petrochemicals go through various processes that eventually contribute to the final output of products like plastics, soaps and detergents, healthcare products like aspirin, synthetic fibres for clothes and furniture, rubbers, paints, insulating materials etc. References External links  * Category:Chemistry Category:Petroleum Category:Natural gas ","title":"Petrochemistry"},{"id":"2016081","text":"Witzelsucht ( \\"joking addiction\\") is a set of pure and rare neurological symptoms characterized by a tendency to make puns, or tell inappropriate jokes or pointless stories in socially inappropriate situations. It makes one unable to read sarcasm. A less common symptom is hypersexuality, the tendency to make sexual comments at inappropriate times or situations. Patients do not understand that their behavior is abnormal, therefore they are nonresponsive to others' reactions. This disorder is most commonly seen in patients with frontal lobe damage, particularly right frontal lobe tumors or trauma. The disorder remains named in accordance with its reviewed definition by German neurologist Hermann Oppenheim, its first description as the less focused (pathologic giddiness or lunatic mood) by German neurologist Moritz Jastrowitz, was in 1888.  Signs and symptoms  Case studies = A condition rarely diagnosed, Witzelsucht has been well documented in the recent era in at least two cases: Case #1: A 30-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to the department of neurology for irritability, inappropriate behavior, and morbid hyperphagia with obesity. His inappropriate laughter and persistent pun and joke telling was a sharp contrast to his personality as an intellectual theological scholar, known for his exceptional memory as opposed to his sense of humor. This behavior was generally prompted by environmental stimuli such as physician‚Äôs rounds or blood sampling. To the patient, his behavior seemed normal, which explains why he remained nondiscriminating toward his jokes, their context, and their impression on those around him. Neurological examination revealed mild spastic left hemiparesis with minimal motor coordination and impairment of voluntary fine movements. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, in the right frontoparietal area. Additionally, verbal and performance tests showed evidence of poor concentration skills, high distractibility, and difficulty with visual-spatial tasks. The patient‚Äôs performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was severely impaired, suggesting frontal dysfunction.PhD, D.Z.Z., & Israel Hod MD, P.D. (1994).

Case #2: A 33-year-old man, James Harden, was admitted to the hospital with signs of a putaminal hemorrhage, including dense paralysis on the left side of his body and face, difficulty swallowing, and visual field defects on his left side. On the fifth day of hospitalization, he was alert and cooperative with no disorientation, delusion, or emotional lability. He then became euphoric and outspoken, speaking in puns and witticisms with an exaggerated smile. The content of his conversations, however, was not bizarre or random. He would work in puns and jokes while speaking his concerns about his other physical symptoms from the stroke in a coherent manner. Sometimes he would not crack a smile at something he said to make others around him laugh hysterically, while other times he could not appreciate others' jokes. During this time, KS also developed hypersexuality, using erotic words and inappropriate behavior toward the female hospital staff. Before his stroke, Kevin's family reported he did make jokes on occasion, but never in this bizarre manner, and never behaved impolitely to women. MRI tests showed bleeding at the right putamen, extending into the posterior and lateral portions of the right thalamus and defects in the thalamus and right basal ganglion. Another test showed deficits in recent memory, orientation, abstract thinking, drawing, and verbal fluency.Chen, Y., Tseng, C., & Pai, M. (2005). Witzelsucht after right putaminal hemorrhage: a case report. Acta Neurologica Taiwanica, 14(4), 195. = Altered sense of humor = In both case studies, patients showed an altered sense of humor, mostly in regard to producing and appreciating humor. The right hemisphere is involved with processing speed and problem solving, which plays a role in humor processing.Shammi, P., & Stuss, D.T. (1999). Humour appreciation: a role of the right frontal lobe. Brain, 122(4), 657-666. These patients have difficulty fully interpreting a joke's content, but can recognize the importance of the form of a joke. Patients with witzelsucht often find non sequiturs, slapstick humor, and puns funniest since these forms of humor do not require integration of content across sentences. In other words, the end of the joke is not dependent on the first part; one does not need to make a logical connection to understand humor. Patients show no change in understanding simple logic, and understand the importance of surprise in humor (hence why they choose slapstick humor instead of the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù punch line); however, once they have registered this surprise, they cannot connect the punch line to the body of the joke to fully appreciate the true humor behind the joke. Successful jokes require a juxtaposition of the sound and the meaning of words used to understand the punchline. However, patients with witzelsucht have difficulty connecting the two, resulting in an inability to appreciate humor.Goel, V., & Dolan, R.J. (2001). The functional anatomy of humor: segregating cognitive and affective components. Nature Neuroscience, 4(3), 237-238. Additionally, patients show no emotional reaction to humor, whether produced by themselves or others. This lack of responsiveness is due to dissociation between their cognitive and affective responses to humorous stimuli. That is, even when a patient understands that a joke is funny (based on quantitative brain activity), they do not respond with laughter, or even a smile. While they have grasped the cognitive basis of humor, they do not affectively respond. This is also considered a cognitive component of empathy, affecting one's ability to take the perspective of others; hence why patients often do not respond to humor produced by other people. = Hypersexuality = This symptom is much rarer than the unusual use of puns and nonresponsive sense of humor most notably seen in witzelsucht patients. Nonetheless, patients can still exhibit hypersexuality by making sexual comments at socially inappropriate times. Some signs of this behavior include impulsivity, poor judgment, deficits in emotional regulation, excess preoccupation with sex, and cognitive rigidity (difficulty in appreciating another‚Äôs emotion, inability to yield).Reid, R.C., Karim, R., McCrory, E., & Carpenter, B.N. (2010). Self-reported differences on measures of executive function and hypersexual behavior in a patient and community sample of men. International Journal of Neuroscience, 120(2), 120-127. More than likely this symptom is linked to amygdala damage that can occur during a stroke, which can also induce frontal lobe damage.  Humor recognition in the brain  Role of the frontal lobe = Damage to the frontal lobe has been related to changes in personality. The frontal lobes are crucial for the development of personality, sense of self, and humor development. Anatomically, there are meaningful connections between the frontal lobes (specifically the polar and ventral/medial areas) and other brain regions related to affective-emotional responses. Early cases of witzelsucht observed damage to the mesial-orbital region of the frontal lobe. In general, damage to this area results in puerility, disinhibition, and an inappropriate jocular affect. . The frontal lobes are also involved in processing narrative conversation and understanding abstract or indirect forms of communication, such as sarcasm. This is a critical role in humor appreciation. Subjects with damage to the right superior frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 8/9) choose punchlines which are simplistic and do not integrate content across a narrative. This region of the brain is responsible for problem-solving skills and holding information to recall during processing (i.e. working memory). Only damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, not the left, is linked to humor. Specifically, pathology in the right frontal lobe (specifically the superior and anterior regions) correlated with deficits in humor in patients as opposed to other brain regions in the right hemisphere. One of the main roles of the right hemisphere, which is organizing and integrating information, is found in the right frontal lobe. Additionally, it is also responsible for episodic memory, which is essential in humor appreciation. A person may remember experiences in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory. Appreciating humor requires integrated operations within the brain, all of which can be processed in the right frontal lobe. It has been considered a heteromodal cortex, which means that it responds to multiple stimuli, capable of interpreting internal and external sensory input. The coordination of these sensory interpretations are ideal for humor appreciation and production, one of the highest and most evolved human cognitive functions. = Functional behavior = One of the major theories of humor is the incongruity-resolution model, which considers humor appreciation as a problem-solving task.Samson, A.C. (2008). Cognitive and Neural Humor Processing: The influence of structural stimulus properties and Theory of Mind. docreroch, 1-249. The punch-line, which can be taken out of place from the body of the text, must be detected and then connected with the lead. This logical process is an important role in the frontal lobes; therefore, damage to this area of the brain leads to difficulty connecting the start of a joke to the punch-line. In incongruity-resolution, there is more information to be integrated within the frontal lobe (i.e. when the joke makes more sense, in a somewhat logical way, the scripts within the brain can be unified better.) Patients with witzelsucht cannot make that logical connection in incongruity-resolution jokes, hence why they communicate through nonsense humor, mostly in the form of puns and non sequiturs. Two other components related to the frontal lobes contribute to the social behavior of a witzelsucht patient. Previous studies have established a connection with the right hemisphere and emotional responsiveness. The specific anatomical location is still unclear, but it was shown that the right frontal operculum was most relevant in emotional gesturing. This, combined with the dissociation between cognitive and affective stimuli can explain why patients show no reaction to humor. Personality and drawing on past experiences have been shown to influence humor processing and appreciation. A person may remember past experiences in their own life in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory, which is processed within the frontal lobes. Additionally, this inability to remember past experiences could also cause a person to forget what is socially appropriate; which could explain why witzelsucht patients sometimes say hypersexual comments in public.  Hypersexuality in the brain  The amygdala plays a significant role in processing emotional stimuli and producing affective responses, which in turn is utilized in social interactions. The amygdala regulates the attachment of emotional significance to corresponding sensory stimuli. Lesions in the amygdala do not disrupt a specific sexual mechanism. Instead, they disturb the emotional processing of stimuli, which causes random and/or inappropriate responses. The amygdala has a positive effect on sexual behavior by allowing the appropriate attachment of emotional significance to external sexual stimuli.Baird, A.D., Wilson, S.J., Bladin, P.F., Saling, M.M., & Reutens, D.C. (2003). The amygdala and sexual drive: insights from temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. Annals of neurology, 55(1), 87-96. Previous human studies have shown an association between temporal lobe dysfunction and altered sexual behavior. There has also been evidence of hypersexual behavior after epileptic seizures. Epileptic foci can be found on the temporal lobe, near the amygdala. It has been postulated that there is an increased likelihood that a patient would exhibit hypersexuality directly after a seizure.Baird, A.D., Wilson, S.J., Bladin, P.F., Saling, M.M., & Reutens, D.C. (2002). Hypersexuality after temporal lobe resection. Epilepsy & Behavior, 3(2), 173-181. Due to limited cases studying the connection between witzelsucht and hypersexuality, studies concerning epileptic foci on the temporal lobe could be looked at to gain more information.  Relation to other diseases  Witzelsucht can occur in the context of frontotemporal dementia, a neurological disorder resulting from degeneration of the frontal lobes and/or anterior temporal lobes. There are a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with frontal lobe dementia, including progressive declines in social conduct, insight, and personal and emotional regulation and reactivity.Bourgeois, J., & Sacramento, CA. (2003). Moria and Witzelsu cht from Frontotemporal Dementia. Neuropsychopharmacology, 28, 1374-1382. The most common social changes that arise in patients include awkwardness, decreased propriety and manners, unacceptable physical boundaries, and/or improper verbal or physical acts. Childish, frivolous, or silly behavior is associated with damage to the right frontal, and most likely adjacent orbitofrontal lobe involvement. This can be associated with witzelsucht, as well as moria- a similar disorder resulting in childish euphoria and cheerful excitement.Mendez, M., Lauterbach, E., & Sampson, S. (2008). An evidence-based review of the psychopathology of frontotemporal dementia: a report of the ANPA Committee on Research. The Journal of chiatry and clinical neurosciences, 20(2), 130-149. Witzelsucht is considered a disorder of mirth or humor, which is distinct from disorders of laughter. Patients with witzelsucht are essentially insensitive to humor, but are capable of producing it while other patients excessively laugh, often at things that are not funny. The most common disorders of laughter are associated with pseudobulbar palsy, which can be caused by severe brain trauma, most commonly in the right hemisphere. Pathological laughter in this can be triggered by trivial stimuli, which could be disconnected from the underlying mood, and be combined with crying. Pathological laughter can also occur in the absence of pseudobulbar palsy. Gelastic (laughing) seizures are another neurological case of inappropriate or excessive laughter occurring in brief bursts. Treatment for these disorders can include antidepressants and antimanic agents.Mendez, M.F., Nakawatase, T.V., & Brown, C.V. (1999). Involuntary laughter and inappropriate hilarity. The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 11(2), 253-258.  Potential treatment  Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, were given to case study KS four months after initial stroke that started symptoms of witzelsucht. Changes back to his original behavior were noticeable after daily dose of 37.5 mg of venlafaxine for two weeks. In subsequent two months, inappropriate jokes and hypersexual behavior were rarely noticed. Due to the rareness of this disorder, not much research into potential treatments has been conducted.

Writing, production, and location were all factors in the piece‚Äôs progress. The journey to completion was not truly over until after Prokofiev‚Äôs time, when the piece was first presented in a full performance at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es on 25 November 1954, and was first premiered at the Venice Festival in 1955.Ed. Larue, Steven C. International Dictionary of Opera, Vol. 1: A-K. St. James Press: Detroit, 1993, 439. Bryusov‚Äôs novel Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel was based on a novel of the same name by Valery Bryusov. Prokofiev was more intrigued by the ‚Äúorgies‚Äù (here, indulgence of passion) presented in the novel rather than the story ideas.Taruskin, Richard. ‚ÄúAnother World.‚Äù Opera News, Vol. 60, No. 7 (December 1995). 8, accessed October 6, 2012, http://search.proquest.com/docview/1164853/1399C72BE8E1219F6AD/4 The novel was inspired by Bryusov‚Äôs own experiences with one Nina Petrovskaya, and was considered one of the beginnings of the Russian Symbolist movement known as Vesy, or ‚ÄúThe Scales.‚Äù Nina was the mistress of Andrey Bely. In their time together, Nina also came to know Bryusov in 1904, and this started to cause obvious concerns for Bely. There was an anticipated brawl on a remote road in Moscow, but a mutual friend of Bryusov and Bely prevented the fight. Nina, Andrey, and Bryusov inspired Prokofiev‚Äôs characters in his opera, making the novel the prime source of inspiration for the work.Nice, David. Prokofiev: From Russia to the West, 1891-1935. Yale University Press: New Haven, 2003, 166. The novel was also the basis for the libretto of Prokofiev‚Äôs opera, which Prokofiev himself wroteLarue, International, 439 with the help of Demchinsky.Elsworth, John. ‚ÄúProkofiev and Briusov: The Libretto of The Fiery Angel.‚Äù Slavonica 10, no. 1 (April 2004). Synopsis Originally the opera was in three acts and eleven scenes, but was eventually reorganized into five acts and seven scenes. =Act 1= Renata, a young woman searching for a missing love, resides at an inn. Ruprecht, a knight errant, meets Renata at the inn. She tells him that, since her childhood, she has been in love with an angel. This angel, Madiel, encouraged her to do good deeds, and at the age of seventeen she finally asked for his physical love. The angel, in response, glowed in fury, but agreed to return in human form. After Madiel‚Äôs promise, Renata had met Count Heinrich von Otterheim. Convinced that this was her angel returned to Earth, Renata immediately gave herself to him. One year later, Otterheim left. In denial, Renata begs Ruprecht to help her search for Otterheim.Larue, International, 439 =Act 2= As the two search for Otterheim, Ruprecht soon falls in love with Renata, although she does not share the feeling. They decide to resort to sorcery to find Otterheim, and a spell is cast. Three knocks are then heard at the door. Renata assumes the spell has worked and nearly goes insane at the thought of Otterheim returning. But nobody is there. Ruprecht and Renata seek out the powerful sorcerer Agrippa von Nettesheim. Once in his lair, they are met with his refusal to help; his concerns lie with the power of the Inquisition. =Act 3= Ruprecht learns that Renata has finally found Count Heinrich von Otterheim, who has rejected her. She begs to be avenged, learning that he was never her angel. Ruprecht attempts to exact revenge for Renata by dueling with Otterheim. The duel is one-sided, as Otterheim easily overcomes Ruprecht and injures him. =Act 4= Ruprecht and Renata have moved in together, but Renata now insists on joining a convent to better herself and for her soul‚Äôs sake. There is a comic relief, involving Faust and Mephistopheles at a tavern. (This tavern scene, used to break up the dark sarcastic nature of the opera, is sometimes left out.) =Act 5= Renata is in the convent, where the leaders accuse her of demonic possession. As an attempt to heal Renata ensues, all Hell essentially breaks loose (both on stage and in the orchestra) as the other nuns are also possessed. She is condemned by the Inquisitor to be burned at the stake.Larue, International, 440 Progress With no previous commissions or any actual production being present, Prokofiev set out to write The Fiery Angel at one of the only times of his life in which religion was considered for his works. The thematic style is more like Prokofiev‚Äôs pre-Revolution operas (such as The Gambler), even with the ambiguity. The only theme that strays from the ambiguous is the theme involved with the evil forces.Ed. Holden, Amanda. The New Penguin Opera Guide. Penguin Group: London, 2001, 693 The opera as a whole is a contrast to some of Prokofiev‚Äôs earlier operas (such as his opera The Love for Three Oranges) just by being a tragedy, and the story was considered very appropriate for Prokofiev‚Äôs dark and sarcastic style. The production of the opera was one of the biggest hurdles, for different reasons, Prokofiev faced. There was a large amount of extra material in the work, there were what was considered violations of theater, negotiations with different theaters both in Europe and America continued to fail. In the midst of it all, Prokofiev felt like he was unappreciated and unwanted, but his pride kept him striving for recognition.Nestyev, Israel V. Sergei Prokofiev: His Musical Life. Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 1946, 82 In 1926, Bruno Walter made Prokofiev an offer to have The Fiery Angel produced at a Berlin theater, which prompted Prokofiev to work on the orchestration. The orchestration was finished in 1927. The production was still unsuccessful.Nestyev, Musical, 107 The opera and inspiration came and went, but it was the promises of production that kept Prokofiev writing.Elsworth, ‚ÄúLibretto‚Äù, 2 Prokofiev, who had been working on the opera for years, was reluctant to let the music languish unperformed, and after hearing a concert performance of its second act given by Serge Koussevitzky in June 1928, he adapted parts of the opera to make his Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Op. 44, later that year. Reception The Fiery Angel was met with mixed reviews for different reasons. Largely, The Fiery Angel was, despite lack of productions, reviewed as Prokofiev‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Ä¶ strongest and most dramatically intense scores.‚ÄùEd. Holden, Penguin, 693 In a review of the Bolshoi performance of The Fiery Angel, it is said that Prokofiev‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Ä¶score is crazy, but shouldn‚Äôt sound chaotic.‚ÄùConrad, Peter. \\"Laughing at Stalin: Soviet Russia ruined Prokofiev's life but inspired his most comic, and lyrical, music.\\" New Statesman, Vol. 135 no. 4805 (2006), 35.e Prokofiev may have only been interested in the overarching story rather than the smaller details. It was also criticized that maybe the language would have been better in French rather than Russian.Clark, Fascinating, 13 Some even called the opera a ‚Äú16th-century Carmen with supernatural trimmings‚Äù amongst other mixed reviews.McAllister, Rita. ‚ÄúNatural and Supernatural in ‚ÄòThe Fiery Angel‚Äô.‚Äù The Musical Times, Vol. 111, No. 1530 (August 1970), 785 Another criticism is that The Fiery Angel is nothing but confusion and noise with the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù title.Taruskin, Another, 8 Using staging should not be there to make up for the music, but to mix with it and make a grand production.Clark, Fascinating, 13 Prokofiev was able to write the music how he saw fit, which appealed to many more than the staging has, according to different reviews.

The Institute of Education provides expert tuition for 4th, 5th and 6th Year students. As well as preparing students for the Leaving Certificate, fourth year students at the Institute have the option to study a selection of subjects from the Cambridge International GCSE programme (IGCSE) as well as CEFR Language exams.  Programmes Being a Senior Cycle-only school, The Institute provides several programmes to secondary-level students. Those who wish to study full-time at the school are known as day students and pay standard yearly fees. Students may also attend the school's part-time and evening grinds classes which take place in the evenings and Saturday mornings. These classes provide students with intense tuition support with fees based on the number of subjects taken. Intensive five-day revision courses are also available during normal school holidays at Christmas, Easter, winter mid-term break, in May and August. Study skills seminars available in September. The institute also runs preparation courses for the Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT). Self-financing The institute is one of very few secondary schools in Ireland that is not funded at least in part by central government through the Department of Education. As a result, the school is not subject to inspections from the Department, is not obliged to follow a certain curriculum and may pay teachers as it wishes, rather than according to the public service wages paid to most teachers in the country.

Early life Delp was born in Peabody, Massachusetts on June 12, 1951 to French-Canadian immigrants. He was raised in Danvers, Massachusetts.Pareles, Jon (March 10, 2007). Brad Delp, 55, Lead Singer for Boston, Dies. The New York Times Musical career In 1969, guitarist Barry Goudreau introduced Delp to Tom Scholz, who was looking for a singer to complete some demo recordings. Eventually, Scholz formed the short-lived band Mother's Milk (1973‚Äì74), including Delp and Goudreau. After producing a demo, Epic Records eventually signed the act. Mother's Milk was renamed Boston, and the self-titled debut album (recorded in 1975, although many tracks had been written years before) was released in August 1976. Delp performed all of the lead and all backing harmony vocals, including all layered vocal overdubs. Boston's debut album has sold more than 20 million copies, and produced rock standards such as \\"More Than a Feeling\\", \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\". Delp co-wrote \\"Smokin'\\" along with Scholz, and wrote the album's closing track, \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\". Their next album, Don't Look Back, was released two years later in August 1978. Its release spawned new hits such as the title track, \\"Party\\", and the ballad \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\". As they did with \\"Smokin'\\", Delp and Scholz collaborated on \\"Party\\", and Delp penned \\"Used to Bad News\\". After the first two Boston albums, Delp sang vocals on Barry Goudreau's self-titled solo album, released in 1980. Scholz's perfectionism and a legal battle with their record company stalled any further Boston albums until 1986 when the band released Third Stage. Delp co-wrote the songs \\"Cool the Engines\\" and \\"Can'tcha Say (You Believe in Me)/Still in Love\\" for the album, and both songs got significant airplay. Though well known for his \\"golden\\" voice with soaring vocals and range and singing all harmony parts on every song, Delp was also a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, harmonica and keyboards. He wrote or co-wrote songs for Boston, RTZ, Orion the Hunter, Lisa Guyer, and other artists. Delp while playing for his band Beatlejuice In 1991, Delp and Goudreau formed a band called RTZ. After Boston released the album Walk On in 1994 with Fran Cosmo on vocals, Delp and Boston reunited later that year for another major tour and Delp continued to record vocals on several albums and projects, including new tracks for Boston's 1997 Greatest Hits compilation and their 2002 release Corporate America. From the mid-1990s until his death in 2007, Delp played in a side project when he had time off from Boston ‚Äì a Beatles tribute band called Beatlejuice. During this time, Delp also co-wrote and recorded with former Boston bandmate Barry Goudreau and in 2003 released the CD Delp and Goudreau. https://www.barrygoudreau.com/discography.htm Personal life Delp was married and divorced twice, and had two children by his second wife, Micki Delp. He was a vegetarian for over 30 years, and contributed to a number of charitable causes. Death and aftermath Sometime between 11:00 pm on March 8 and 1:20 pm on March 9, 2007, Delp died by suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning at his home on Academy Avenue, in Atkinson, New Hampshire. He left various notes scattered from his car to the interior of his home. The Atkinson police discovered his body on the floor of his master bathroom after Pamela Sullivan saw a dryer vent tube connected to the exhaust pipe of Delp's car. Two charcoal grills were found to have been placed in the bathtub and lit, causing the room to fill with smoke. A suicide note was paper-clipped to the neck of his T-shirt, which read the same as a character's note from Twin Peaks: \\"Mr. Brad Delp. 'J'ai une √¢me solitaire'. I am a lonely soul.\\" Delp left four sealed envelopes in his office addressed to his children, his former wife Micki, his fianc√©e, and a couple who were not named by the media. He was 55 years old. The following day, Boston's website was temporarily closed down, the webmaster having replaced their home page with a simple black background and white text message: \\"We've just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll.\\" Delp's cause of death was ruled a suicide. The reason for Delp's suicide has been the subject of contradictory news reports and various lawsuits. A series of interviews conducted by the Boston Herald alleged that lingering hard feelings from Boston's disbandment in the 1980s and personal tension between Delp and bandleader Scholz drove the singer to commit suicide. Scholz denied these claims but lost the defamation suits he filed in response. Court documents from the trials detail Scholz stating that Delp was plagued by personal problems. Boston Herald attorneys pointed to testimony from former Boston members, other local musicians, Delp's doctor, and Delp's friends, including Meg Sullivan (his fianc√©e's sister), many of whom say the singer did not like Scholz, desperately wanted to quit the band and felt tormented by his role as middleman in an ugly conflict between Scholz and former band members. All of this was summarized in a 140-page statement filed by the Herald in April 2012. Additional sworn testimony by Meg Sullivan revealed an additional explanation for Delp‚Äôs suicide: Delp was housemates with Meg, his fiancee Pamela's sister, for two-and-a-half years before his death. On February 28, 2007, Meg discovered a hidden camera planted in her room. After confronting Delp, he admitted to planting the camera and later wrote a series of emails pleading for forgiveness. Todd Winmill, Meg's boyfriend, implored Delp to admit his wrongdoings to Pamela on March 3. After promising to tell her in a few days, Delp purchased the grills and tubing he later used to commit suicide. Pamela found his body on March 9. In the bathroom were several notes written by Delp, one of which read: \\"I have had bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide since I was a teenager ‚Ä¶ [Pamela] was my 'ray of sunshine', but sometimes even a ray of sunshine is no substitute for a good psychiatrist.\\" On October 16, 2007, Barry Goudreau released one final song with Delp on vocals titled \\"Rockin Away\\". Written and recorded in the summer of 2006, co-written with Goudreau, it‚Äôs an autobiography of Delp's musical career. According to \\"America's Music Charts\\", the song reached #20 on the rock charts in January 2008. On what would have been Delp's 61st birthday, June 12, 2012, Jenna Delp, Delp's daughter and President of the Brad Delp Foundation, released an MP3 on the foundation website of a \\"never before released\\" song which was written and recorded by Delp in 1973. It also was announced the foundation intended to release a complete album of Delp's solo work at some point in the future, which would encompass a span of 30 years of previously unreleased material written and recorded by Delp and his closest friends. On November 25, 2015, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found in favor of the Boston Herald and Micki Delp in a defamation lawsuit brought by Scholz. In its ruling, the court said that statements attributing Delp's suicide to Scholz were \\"statements of opinion and not verifiable fact and therefore could not form the basis of a claim of defamation.\\" On February 23, 2016, Scholz filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court of the United States to allow his defamation lawsuit to proceed.

Sir John Henslow designed her as one of the large class 74s; she was the only ship built to her draught. As a large 74, she carried 24-pounder guns on her upper gun deck, rather than the 18-pounder guns found on the middling and common class 74s. Career Newly commissioned, and captained by Robert Moorsom, she fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, where she sailed in Collingwood's column. Revenge was engaged at the Battle of Basque Roads in April 1809 under Captain Alexander Robert Kerr. In October 1810, Revenge captured the French privateer cutter Vauteur off Cherbourg after a five-hour chase. Vauteur had been armed with 16 guns, but she threw 14 of them overboard during the chase. She had been out of Dieppe for 45 hours but had made no captures. She was the former British cutter John Bull, of Plymouth, and was restored to Plymouth on 19 October.Lloyd's List, 23 October 1810. - accessed 10 November 2013. The report in Lloyd's List announcing this news appears to have confused names. Vauteur appears to have been Vengeur. There is no account of Revenge capturing a Vauteur, but on 17 October, Revenge captured the French privateer lugger Vengeur, off Cherbourg. The lugger crossed to windward of Revenge before daylight, and Revenge gave chase, finally capturing her quarry after three hours. Vengeur was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 78 men. She was one day out of Dieppe and had not taken any prizes. On 6 November, captured the privateer Surcouf. Revenge, Donegal, and the hired armed lugger would share in the prize money for Vengeur and Surcouf. On 13 November 1810, the frigates and Niobe attacked two French frigates ( and Amazone), which sought protection under the shore batteries near Saint-Vaast- la-Hougue. Revenge and Donegal arrived two days later and together the four ships fired upon the French for as long as the tide would allow. The operation cost Donegal three men wounded. √âlisa was driven ashore and ultimately destroyed as a result of this action; Amazone escaped safely into Le Havre. Fate Revenge served until 1842, being broken up in 1849. She was one of the first warships of the Royal Navy to be painted with the Nelson Checker.

Early life Paulson was born on December 17, 1974, in Tampa, Florida, the daughter of Catharine Gordon (n√©e Dolcater) and Douglas Lyle Paulson II. She spent her early life in South Tampa until her parents' divorce when she was five. After her parents' separation, Paulson relocated with her mother and sister to Maine, then to New York City. Her mother worked as a waitress, and Paulson lived in Queens and Gramercy Park, before settling in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She recalled of this period: \\"My mom was 27 years old [when we moved]. She didn't know a single person in New York City. She got a job at Sardi's Restaurant... She was so brave to be basically a debutante in Tampa, Florida, having a cotillion and a coming out balland she picked up and brought her two kids to the greatest city in the world, not knowing anyone. My mom's kind of my hero that way.\\" Throughout her childhood, Paulson spent her summers in Florida staying with her father, who was an executive at a Tampa door manufacturing company. She attended P.S. 29 in Brooklyn before attending Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Career1994‚Äì2007= Paulson began working as an actress right out of high school. She appeared in the Horton Foote play Talking Pictures at the Signature Theatre, and in an episode of Law & Order in 1994. The next year Paulson appeared in the Hallmark television film Friends at Last (1995) opposite Kathleen Turner, playing the adult version of Turner's character's daughter. She also starred in the short- lived television series American Gothic (also 1995), playing the ghost of a murdered woman. 2006 Drama Desk Awards In 1997, Paulson made her feature film debut in the independent thriller film Levitation, playing a woman who discovers she is pregnant after an anonymous sexual encounter. Leonard Klady of Variety noted that Paulson and her co-stars are \\"not supported by the script\\", concluding: \\"Levitation is a grim, convoluted saga of identity and belonging. An ill-fitting combination of melodrama and magic realism, the indie effort will have a decidedly difficult time in the theatrical arena.\\" She also appeared Off-Broadway in a fall 1998 production of Killer Joe. She subsequently played Elisa Cronkite in The WB comedy-drama series Jack & Jill (1999). The same year, she was also cast opposite Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton in the drama The Other Sister, playing the lesbian sister of a developmentally-disabled woman in San Francisco, and in a supporting part playing a hostage in the comedy Held Up, opposite Jamie Foxx. The following year, she had a small supporting role in the comedy What Women Want, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. Paulson had a minor recurring role in the HBO series Deadwood (2005‚Äì2006), and was a focal character in an episode of the FX series Nip/Tuck. She starred as the main character in the NBC series Leap of Faith. She was then cast in the period comedy Down with Love (2003) in a central role, portraying the friend and editor of a writer (portrayed by Renee Zellweger). In 2004, she had a supporting role in the ABC series The D.A., which was cancelled after only four episodes. In the spring of 2005, Paulson starred in a revival of The Glass Menagerie on Broadway, opposite future American Horror Story co-star Jessica Lange. Ben Brantley of The New York Times deemed the production as \\"misdirected and miscast... reality never makes an appearance in this surreally blurred production.\\" Later that year, Paulson appeared Off-Broadway in a production of Colder Than Here, opposite Lily Rabe (also her future co-star on American Horror Story). The production received an unfavorable review from Variety, with critic Dave Rooney writing: \\"Rabe speaks in an affected monotone while Sarah Paulson has the measured, upward-inflected delivery of a children's TV presenter... this mannered, melancholy play elicits a mainly impassive response, which is no small obstruction in a work dealing with loss.\\" Also in 2005, Paulson had a small role in the Joss Whedon- directed science fiction film Serenity. In the 2006‚Äì07 television season, Paulson co-starred in NBC's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, playing Harriet Hayes, one of the stars of the show-within-a-show. This role earned her a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

There are two types: process assemblies (EXE) and library assemblies (DLL). A process assembly represents a process that will use classes defined in library assemblies. CLI assemblies contain code in CIL, which is usually generated from a CLI language, and then compiled into machine language at run time by the just-in-time compiler. In the .NET Framework implementation, this compiler is part of the Common Language Runtime (CLR). An assembly can consist of one or more files. Code files are called modules. An assembly can contain more than one code module. And since it is possible to use different languages to create code modules, it is technically possible to use several different languages to create an assembly. Visual Studio however does not support using different languages in one assembly. Assembly names The name of an assembly consists of four parts # The short name. On Windows this is the name of the Portable Executable (PE) file without the extension. # The culture. This is an RFC 1766 identifier of the locale for the assembly. In general, library and process assemblies should be culture neutral; the culture should only be used for satellite assemblies. # The version. This is a dotted number made up of four values -- major, minor, build and revision. # A public key token. This is a 64-bit hash of the public key that corresponds to the private key used to signGiving a .NET Assembly a Strong Name the assembly. A signed assembly is said to have a strong name. The public key token is used to make the assembly name unique. Thus, two strong named assemblies can have the same PE file name and yet the CLI will recognize them as different assemblies. The Windows file system (FAT32 and NTFS) only recognizes the PE file name, so two assemblies with the same PE file name (but different culture, version or public key token) cannot exist in the same Windows folder. To solve this issue the CLI introduces the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) that is treated as a single folder by run-time, but is actually implemented using nested file system folders. To prevent spoofing attacks, where a cracker would try to pass off an assembly appearing as something else, the assembly is signed with a private key. The developer of the intended assembly keeps the private key secret, so a cracker cannot have access to it nor simply guess it. Thus the cracker cannot make his assembly impersonate something else, lacking the possibility to sign it correctly after the change. Signing the assembly involves taking a hash of important parts of the assembly and then encrypting the hash with the private key. The signed hash is stored in the assembly along with the public key. The public key will decrypt the signed hash. When the CLR loads a strongly named assembly it will generate a hash from the assembly and then compare this with the decrypted hash. If the comparison succeeds then it means that the public key in the file (and hence the public key token) is associated with the private key used to sign the assembly. This will mean that the public key in the assembly is the public key of the assembly publisher and hence a spoofing attack is prevented. Assembly versions CLI assemblies can have version information, allowing them to eliminate most conflicts between applications caused by shared assemblies. However, this does not eliminate all possible versioning conflicts between assemblies. Assemblies and CLI security CLI Code Access Security is based on assemblies and evidence. Evidence can be anything deduced from the assembly, but typically it is created from the source of the assembly -- whether the assembly was downloaded from the Internet, an intranet, or installed on the local machine (if the assembly is downloaded from another machine it will be stored in a sandboxed location within the GAC and hence is not treated as being installed locally). Permissions are applied to entire assemblies, and an assembly can specify the minimum permissions it requires through custom attributes (see CLI metadata). When the assembly is loaded the CLR will use the evidence for the assembly to create a permission set of one or more code access permissions. The CLR will then check to make sure that this permission set contains the required permissions specified by the assembly. CLI code can perform a code access security demand. This means that the code will perform some privileged action only if all of the assemblies of all of the methods in the call stack have the specified permission. If one assembly does not have the permission a security exception is thrown. The CLI code can also perform Linked Demand for getting the permission from the call stack. In this case the CLR will look at only one method in the call stack in the TOP position for the specified permission. Here the stack walk-through is bound to one method in the call stack by which the CLR assumes that all the other methods in the CALL STACK have the specified permission. The Assembly is a combination of METADATA and MSIL file. Satellite assemblies In general, assemblies should contain culture-neutral resources. If you want to localize your assembly (for example use different strings for different locales) you should use satellite assemblies -- special, resource-only assemblies. As the name suggests, a satellite is associated with an assembly called the main assembly. That assembly (say, lib.dll) will contain the neutral resources (that Microsoft says is International English, but implies to be US English). Each satellite has the name of the associated library appended with .resources (for example lib.resources.dll). The satellite is given a non-neutral culture name, but since this is ignored by existing Windows file systems (FAT32 and NTFS) this would mean that there could be several files with the same PE name in one folder. Since this is not possible, satellites must be stored in subfolders under the application folder. For example, a satellite with the UK English resources will have a CLI name of \\"lib.resources Version=0.0.0.0 Culture=en-GB PublicKeyToken=null\\", a PE file name of lib.resources.dll, and will be stored in a subfolder called en-GB. Satellites are loaded by a CLI class called \`System.Resources.ResourceManager\`. The developer has to provide the name of the resource and information about the main assembly (with the neutral resources). The ResourceManager class will read the locale of the machine and use this information and the name of the main assembly to get the name of the satellite and the name of the subfolder that contains it. \`ResourceManager\` can then load the satellite and obtain the localized resource. Referencing assemblies One can reference an executable code library by using the /reference flag of the C# compiler. Delay-signing of an assembly The shared assemblies need to give a strong name for uniquely identifying the assembly that might be shared among the applications. The strong naming consists of the public key token, culture, version and PE file name. If an assembly is likely to be used for the development purpose which is a shared assembly, the strong naming procedure contains only public key generation.

Her most prominent works are the Trait√© de la morale et de la politique (Treatise on Morality and Politics) and Du c√©libat volontaire (On the Celibate Life Freely Chosen). Suchon is considered to be the first philosopher to produce a significant body of work dedicated solely to the topic of women. Suchon's writing is unique because she specifically addresses women, as opposed to most moral philosophy of the time whose primary audience was men. She is considered the only female philosopher of her time without a male intellectual advisor or husband. In her works, Suchon argues that women are deserving of the natural rights of liberty, learning and authority. She asserts that a woman can live a fulfilling life while unmarried and promotes the power of voluntary celibacy on secular terms.  Early life  Gabrielle Suchon was born in Semur-en-Auxios (Burgundy), France on December 24, 1632 to Claude Mongin and Claude Suchon. Gabrielle's mother, Claude Mongin, came from a relatively well-off, land-owning family. Many of the men in the Mongin family had served as jurists in France. Gabrielle's father came from a line of minor nobles who had historically been public officials. Claude Suchon served as the King's prosecutor until his death in 1645. Gabrielle Suchon may have had a younger brother, also named Claude Suchon.  Education  Suchon was self-educated because women were barred from studying at public institutions during her lifetime. Her writings make clear that she was well-versed in the holy scriptures and the work of both classic and contemporary philosophers and writers. Suchon studied the works of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch and other ancient philosophers. She utilized their praise of female qualities or figures to craft her argument for women's equality. Suchon refers to the work of Scholastics such as St. Thomas and St. John of the Cross. She also responds to assertions from the notable feminist treatise Of the Equality of the Two Sexes (1673) by Fran√ßois Poulain de la Barre. Suchon cites evidence from various chapters of the Bible in her Trait√© de la morale et de la politique. She spent her early years in a convent where she most likely received the religious education of a nun. Nuns were forbidden from reading directly from the scripture without the interpretation of a male bishop, which implies that Suchon continued her biblical education outside of the convent. Suchon was self-educated; she gained her expertise of the Bible, the classics and contemporary philosophy after escaping the convent.  Adult life  Convent in Semur = Suchon's adult life is primarily pieced together through official church documents. Her whereabouts during many of her adult years remain a mystery. Most sources say that Suchon was sent to a Dominican convent in Semur after her father's death in 1645 and resided there until 1666. Recent historical research has disputed when and why Suchon was sent to the convent in Semur. Some speculate that Suchon was sent to the convent shortly after her father's death to alleviate her family's financial burdens. Others say that she may have been sent to the convent some years later after failing to secure a desirable marriage. = Contestation of vows = Church documents have revealed that on October 15, 1666, Suchon was legally transferred from the convent in Semur to the Jacobin monastery at Langres. It is unclear whether Suchon ever took residence at the Langres convent. Some speculate that Suchon may have used the guise of this transfer to escape entirely and travel to Rome. Suchon did file a petition to the pope to contest her vows and restore herself to lay person. Suchon's petition was read by the Congregation of the Council in Rome on September 10, 1672. Documents show that in 1673, Suchon was no longer on the roster of nuns at Langres. Suchon's desire to denounce her vows was the cause of the strained relationship with her family for most of her life. = Life as a lay woman = Very little is known about Suchon's life outside of the convent. Suchon most likely began her life as a lay woman in 1673. Evidence suggests that Suchon spent around twenty years in Dijon teaching and writing before she released her Trait√© de la morale et de la politique in 1693. Suchon remained unmarried her whole life. Gabrielle Suchon died on March 5, 1703 in Dijon, France after spending her last years teaching children and writing.  Works  Background = Suchon wrote while an intellectual debate called the querelle des femmes was taking place in Europe (14th-17th century). Querelle des femmes translates to 'the woman question'. Writers in the movement responded to attacks upon women by debating the moral and social nature of womanhood. Participants in the querelle des femmes were an unequal mix of male and female intellectuals. Men dominated the movement, even in a genre that centered around the condition of women. Due to the content of her work and the time in which she wrote, most historians consider Suchon to have contributed to this popular intellectual movement. The established structure of arguments belonging to the querelle des femmes movement consisted of two approaches: listing women throughout history whose actions exemplified their worthiness and analyzing the social and economic reasons behind women being seen as unequal. Suchon's Trait√© de la morale et de la politique differs and expands upon the model put forth by prominent writers in the querelle des femmes. Suchon is the only female participant in the querelle des femmes to write a treatise, a comprehensive and authoritative form of writing. In her treatise, she establishes that her style and approach is original and emphasizes her individuality as a writer. Her writing suggests that she believed her methods to be superior to the standard argumentative styles of the querelle des femmes. Suchon is the first philosopher to completely condemn marriage and to discuss female celibacy in a secular sense. Furthermore, she is one of the first philosophers to state that her audience is women, not men. This is significant because women were restricted from reading and partaking in intellectual work and essentially all established academics were men during her lifetime. Her perspective would have been considered radical by both intellectuals and the common person, male or female. =Trait√© de la morale et de la politique (Treatise on Morality and Politics)= Suchon originally published Trait√© de la morale et de la politique under the pseudonym 'G. S. Aristophile' in 1693. The pseudonym 'Aristophile' consists of the Greek roots aristo- meaning \\"excellence\\", and -phile, meaning \\"lover\\". Suchon's pseudonym is a play on words meaning 'lover of excellence'. Although Suchon uses a pseudonym, she is unafraid to reveal that she is a woman in the Preface of Trait√© de la morale et de la politique . The Trait√© de la morale et de la politique contains an analysis of female oppression and suggests a solution to this ancient, pervasive affliction. Suchon aims to motivate women to cast off the shackles of dependence and ignorance. Suchon's treatise is broken up into three sections: liberty, learning and authority. Suchon begins her treatise by stating that many women believe their inferior condition to be natural to their sex. Suchon condemns this idea and states that women have a capacity for learning and self-governance equal to that of men. She argues that the confinement of women to the private sphere is a mechanism of oppression. She urges women to resist societal expectations and to acquire education as a way to reverse their unjust subjugation to men. Suchon asserts that religion and scripture is being used as a tool to reinforce the subjugation of women and male supremacy. Her idea of female autonomy directly challenges the authority of husbands and church fathers. Suchon utilizes classical and religious texts to craft her argument for female empowerment. Her use of religious texts is a point of debate for modern historians. Post-enlightenment thinkers would classify Suchon's work as lacking in philosophical merit because it fails to exclude religious texts.  Liberty  In her section on liberty, Suchon depicts the complicated and extensive nature of women's deprivation of freedom throughout history. Suchon gives examples of admirable women in literature and throughout history in order to prove that women have the capacity to be independent of and equal to men. She asserts that both physical freedom and freedom to discover knowledge are natural rights. Suchon states that men oppress and degrade women, and women are forced to respect their oppressors. She argues that God created rational beings to be free and asserts that when women are given the right to true freedom, they can negate the age-old idea that women are inherently inferior to men.  Learning  Suchon describes women as essentially equal to men in intellect. She argues that \\"women's deprivation of knowledge originates not in divine or natural law\\" and attributes female oppression to man-made social constructions. She argues that \\"ignorance is a form of slavery\\", and advocates for education as the tool with which women can combat their subjugation to men. From a religious standpoint, Suchon argues that a good Christian strives to better themselves. Women are deprived of the tools needed to better themselves spiritually and socially, specifically through education. Suchon asserts that by denying women the right to knowledge they are denied agency in the public sphere.  Authority  In the third section, Suchon discusses power relationships between men and women. She asserts that when women are denied authority, they are prevented from acting upon the innate tendency to do what is right. Suchon argues that God gave power over nature to both men and women and therefore, men's supposed superiority to women is a distortion of God's will. Suchon emphasizes the negative effect on society and the world at large by female oppression. Suchon argues that by barring women from intellectual debate, society as a whole is being deprived of great thinkers. Suchon's treatise ends by raising the question of whether women can truly exercise their rights within a society that is created by and for men.Du Celibat Volontaire, Gabrielle Suchon (1700) =Du c√©libat volontaire (On the Celibate Life Freely Chosen)= In Du c√©libat volontaire, Suchon presents another possible solution for women to escape subjugation. Suchon She envisions female freedom as autonomy to exist actively, or to live an educated and informed life. She asserts that a life unfettered by societal constraints in which one is free to pursue intellectualism, is preferable to both marriage and religious vows. Suchon discusses celibacy through the lens of Neutrality. Suchon coins the term \\"Neutralist\\" and describes women who live the celibate life as such. The \\"Neutralist\\" is devoted to God, helping others and cultivation of the self. Suchon details the twelve benefits of female celibacy. A notable benefit of forgoing marriage is the ability to care for the poor instead of producing children. She points out that a celibate life is accessible to wealthier women, widows and poor women who work to sustain themselves. Suchon suggests friendship as a remedy to the melancholy that comes with having no familial attachments and commitments. Suchon views celibacy not as a religious virtue, but as a practical path to gaining individual autonomy and freedom for women. Suchon does not dismiss the fact that some women may have the desire and inclination to take religious vows and encourages those that do to follow the religious path. However, Suchon strongly condemns parents that force the religious life upon their young, naive daughters for self-serving reasons. Suchon rejects the widely accepted idea that women needed to be cloistered (segregated from men) to draw away the temptations of the flesh. In fact, she attests that nuns are equally as susceptible to sins of the flesh as secular women. She argues that while it was widely accepted that nuns held religious authority, Catholic clergymen reserved true divine knowledge for members of their own sex. = Reception = Suchon's work did receive some attention in France when she first released her writings. Both Suchon's Trait√© de la morale et de la politique (1693) and Du C√©libat volontaire (1700) were reviewed in Le Journal des Savants, one of the premier intellectual journals in France, the year they were published. Du C√©libat volontaire was also featured in another notable French journal, Nouvelles de la R√©publique des Lettres after its release. Recognition by these premier French journals shows that some intellectuals saw the quality of Suchon's work and took her perspective seriously.  Legacy  Suchon remained relatively undiscovered until the second revival of the Feminist Movement in the 1980s. Historians argue that Suchon's work did not gain significant popularity because male intellectuals discredited 'feminized' writing throughout the early modern era. In the 1980s, Suchon's life and work was studied by feminist historians and moral philosophers for the first time. It was not until the late 20th century that Suchon was established as an influential moral philosopher and feminist writer in the academic community. Suchon's work serves as a valuable historical document. Up until the 17th century, European women were offered two life paths: find a husband or become a nun. Marriage was greatly stifling to a woman's freedom and sometimes the nunnery was the only venue that women could gain independence from the confines of gender discrimination. Suchon's writing sheds light upon the difficulty women faced in getting an education, the realities of marriage and life in convents in the early modern era. The significance of Suchon's perspective is only properly illustrated when against the backdrop of cultural norms of the early modern era. Suchon is considered to be the most prominent pro-woman writer during the reign of Louis XIV, a time where both intellectual endeavors and economic freedom for women were greatly stifled in France. Marie de Gournay, a prominent pro-woman writer, is Suchon's most similar contemporary. On the occasion of the 300th anniversary of her death in 2003, a road was named after Gabrielle Suchon in her hometown of Semur-en-Auxois. = Distribution of works = A copy of Du c√©libat volontaire was found at the cloister of Billettes until the French Revolution, suggesting that Suchon's work was read in at least one convent. Historians have found physical copies of Suchon's Trait√© de la morale et de la politique in Paris, Grenoble, Dijon, Besan√ßon and Aix-en-Provence. Du C√©libat volontaire has been discovered in Besan√ßon, Paris, as well as in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library), G√∂ttingen, Florence and Rome. The wider dispersal of Suchon's second work could be a result of French readers travelling abroad or printers bringing the text to trade shows. = Position in Feminist history = Suchon wrote in a time in which 'feminist' was neither term nor a genre of writing and study. Suchon is best described as a proto- feminist because her writings largely reflect the direction of the future feminist movement. In recent years, scholars have called Suchon a precursor to one of the most notable feminists, Simone de Beauvoir. Suchon essentially proposes a new social and legal status for women. Her works serve as a call for women to break from gender expectations and to embrace a new freedom. In modern terms, Suchon could be considered one of the first female activists. Suchon is one of the first philosophers to specifically discuss the topic of human rights.

It is depicted as the principal weapon of the superhero Thor and Jane Foster. Mjolnir, which first appears in Journey into Mystery #83 (August 1962), was created by writer Stan Lee and designed by artists Jack Kirby and Joe Sinnott. Mjolnir is typically depicted as a large, square-headed gray sledgehammer, with a short, round handle wrapped in brown leather, culminating in a looped lanyard. The object is based on Mj√∂lnir, the weapon of the mythological Thor. Publication history \\"Mjolnar\\" was initially conceived by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby for the story \\"The Villain from Valhalla\\", in Adventure Comics #75 (Jun. 1942). Mjolnir debuted in Marvel Comics title Journey into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962), being the means by which physician Donald Blake transformed into Thunder god Thor Odinson (by striking it on the ground). The first use of the hammer's name was in the \\"Tales of Asgard\\" feature in Thor #135 (Dec. 1966) in a story by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The weapon's origin is eventually revealed in Thor Annual #11 (1983), with another version presented in Thor vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004). In a 2002 documentary with Kevin Smith, Lee says his brother and co-creator Larry Lieber originally referred to Mjolnir as the \\"Uru Hammer\\". Writer Roy Thomas eventually changed the name of the hammer to the mythologically correct name of \\"Mjolnir\\" and maintained the Larry Lieber concept of it being composed of fictional metal \\"uru\\". Origin Mjolnir's origin in Marvel continuity mirrors the original Norse legend. The hammer is created when Odin's adopted son Loki cuts off the hair of the goddess Sif as part of a cruel jest, and, when threatened with violence by Thor, promises to fetch replacement hair from the dwarf smiths. Loki commissions the hair from the Sons of Ivaldi, and the obliging dwarves create the hair and a magic ship and spear as gifts for the gods. Loki is convinced that no one can match their workmanship, and challenges a dwarf named Eitri to make finer treasures. Eitri creates a golden ring and golden boar spear with magical properties, and then begins work on a hammer. Loki panics at the sight of the treasures, and, afraid he will lose the wager, transforms himself into a mayfly and stings Eitri's assistant on the brow as he is working the bellows for the forge. The assistant stops for a moment to wipe away the blood, and the bellows fall flat. As a result, the hammer's handle is shorter in length than Eitri had originally intended, meaning that the hammer could only be wielded one-handed. Despite the error, the Norse gods consider Eitri to have forged the greater treasures. Loki loses the bet and in retaliation the Sons of Ivaldi sew Loki's lips shut. The ruler of the Norse gods, Odin, uses the hammer - called Mjolnir (\\"Grinder\\") by Eitri - and eventually passes it to his son Thor, on the condition that he first prove he is worthy to wield the weapon.Thor Annual #11 (1983) In the second volume of Thor, another version of the hammer's origin is depicted when Odin orders the dwarven blacksmiths Eitri, Brok and Buri to forge Mjolnir using the core of a star.Thor vol. 2 #80 (August 2004) The series The Mighty Thor provides another version of Mjolnir's origin: after an extended battle Odin traps a galaxy-sized storm called \\"Mother Storm\\" in a nugget of uru, which Odin orders the dwarves to use to create a weapon capable of using Mother Storm's power.The Mighty Thor vol. 2 #12 (Dec. 2016) Enchantments Odin placed several enchantments upon Mjolnir prior to Thor wielding the hammer: * No living being may wield it unless they are worthy. This is reflected in the inscription on the side of Mjolnir, which states: Whosoever holds this hammer, if they be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.Journey into Mystery #82 (Aug. 1962) For almost the entirety of Marvel continuity, this has exclusively been Thor. * Once thrown it will always return to the wielder's hand after being thrown. By hurling the hammer and holding the lanyard, Thor is capable of flight.Journey into Mystery #82 (Aug. 1962) * The wielder can control the elements of storm (lightning, wind, and rain) by stamping its handle twice on the ground.Journey Into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962) * Mjolnir can open interdimensional portals, allowing its wielder to travel to other dimensions (such as from Earth to Asgard);Journey Into Mystery #88 (Jan. 1963) * Also originally capable of creating chronal displacement and therefore allowing time travel.Journey Into Mystery #86 (Nov. 1962) This enchantment was removed by the entity Immortus with the Thor's consent to aid a planet trapped in LimboThor #282 (April 1979) This was eventually revealed to be a deception by Immortus to eliminate the superhero team the Avengers access to time travel.Avengers Forever #8 (July 1999) Thor, however, is still able to manipulate time with Mjolnir.Avengers #300 (Feb. 1989) * Originally transform Thor into the guise of a mortal, the physician Donald Blake, by stamping the hammer's head on the ground once and willing the change. When Thor transforms into Blake, his hammer takes the appearance of a wooden walking cane. Odin also stipulated that if Thor was separated from Mjolnir for more than sixty seconds, he would revert to his mortal persona until striking the cane once again.Journey into Mystery #103 (April 1964) The last enchantment was eventually removed and transferred to Stormbreaker, the hammer of character Beta Ray Bill.Thor #340 (Feb. 1984) After this the Donald Blake persona disappeared (eventually returning from the after life Thor vol. 3, #1 (2007)), and Thor assumed a civilian identity simply by changing into modern clothing (carrying Mjolnir concealed within a duffel bag). Thor eventually adopts the mortal persona of Jake Olson as penance for accidentally causing the original Olson's death during a battle, and simply pounds a fist to effect a change. During this period Mjolnir would disappear when Thor became Olson, and reappear when returning to his true form. Thor was also once again bound by the original rule whereby he would revert to Olson if kept away from Mjolnir for more than a minute.Thor vol. 3, #1 (July 1998) The enchantment eventually changes: during the Original Sin storyline, Nick Fury whispers an undisclosed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to pick up Mjolnir.Original Sin #7 (Aug. 2014). The change extends to other gods, as Odin also cannot lift it (Fury's comment to Thor was simply \\"Gorr was right\\", validating to Thor that an old foe's claim that gods brought only pain and suffering was correct).Unworthy Thor #5 (May 2017) The hammer is subsequently picked up by an unknown female - later revealed to be Jane Foster - who inherits the power and title of Thor, with the inscription changing to read if she be worthy.

In probability theory and its applications, factor graphs are used to represent factorization of a probability distribution function, enabling efficient computations, such as the computation of marginal distributions through the sum-product algorithm. One of the important success stories of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm is the decoding of capacity- approaching error-correcting codes, such as LDPC and turbo codes. Factor graphs generalize constraint graphs. A factor whose value is either 0 or 1 is called a constraint. A constraint graph is a factor graph where all factors are constraints. The max-product algorithm for factor graphs can be viewed as a generalization of the arc-consistency algorithm for constraint processing. Definition A factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function. Given a factorization of a function g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n), :g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n) = \\\\prod_{j=1}^m f_j(S_j), where S_j \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\\\\\}, the corresponding factor graph G=(X,F,E) consists of variable vertices X=\\\\\\\\{X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\\\\\}, factor vertices F=\\\\\\\\{f_1,f_2,\\\\dots,f_m\\\\\\\\}, and edges E. The edges depend on the factorization as follows: there is an undirected edge between factor vertex f_j and variable vertex X_k iff X_k \\\\in S_j. The function is tacitly assumed to be real-valued: g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} . Factor graphs can be combined with message passing algorithms to efficiently compute certain characteristics of the function g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n), such as the marginal distributions. Examples An example factor graph Consider a function that factorizes as follows: :g(X_1,X_2,X_3) = f_1(X_1)f_2(X_1,X_2)f_3(X_1,X_2)f_4(X_2,X_3), with a corresponding factor graph shown on the right. Observe that the factor graph has a cycle. If we merge f_2(X_1,X_2)f_3(X_1,X_2) into a single factor, the resulting factor graph will be a tree. This is an important distinction, as message passing algorithms are usually exact for trees, but only approximate for graphs with cycles. Message passing on factor graphs A popular message passing algorithm on factor graphs is the sum-product algorithm, which efficiently computes all the marginals of the individual variables of the function. In particular, the marginal of variable X_k is defined as : g_k(X_k) = \\\\sum_{X_{\\\\bar{k}}} g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n) where the notation X_{\\\\bar{k}} means that the summation goes over all the variables, except X_k . The messages of the sum-product algorithm are conceptually computed in the vertices and passed along the edges. A message from or to a variable vertex is always a function of that particular variable. For instance, when a variable is binary, the messages over the edges incident to the corresponding vertex can be represented as vectors of length 2: the first entry is the message evaluated in 0, the second entry is the message evaluated in 1. When a variable belongs to the field of real numbers, messages can be arbitrary functions, and special care needs to be taken in their representation. In practice, the sum-product algorithm is used for statistical inference, whereby g(X_1,X_2,\\\\dots,X_n) is a joint distribution or a joint likelihood function, and the factorization depends on the conditional independencies among the variables. The Hammersley‚ÄìClifford theorem shows that other probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks and Markov networks can be represented as factor graphs; the latter representation is frequently used when performing inference over such networks using belief propagation. On the other hand, Bayesian networks are more naturally suited for generative models, as they can directly represent the causalities of the model.

Appearing months before Captain America, the Shield has the distinction of being the first superhero with a costume based upon United States patriotic iconography. The character appeared in Pep Comics from issue #1 (Jan 1940) to #65 (Jan 1948). The name was used by MLJ/Archie for four characters. DC Comics' Impact line, which licensed the Archie properties, also used the name for several characters. In 2010, DC announced plans to integrate the Shield and other MLJ characters into the DC Universe, but in 2011 the rights to the characters reverted to Archie Comics. A fourth Shield was introduced in October 2015. Publication history The Shield debuted in MLJ's Pep Comics #1 (cover-dated Jan. 1940). Writer Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick created the character. With the American populace reacting to the beginnings of World War II and wartime patriotism stirring, the Shield debuted as the first patriotically themed hero. He was soon followed by three other patriotic comic characters: Captain America (March 1941), Minute-Man (Feb. 1941), and Captain Battle (May 1941). In 1959, a new Shield, Lancelot Strong, appeared under the Archie Adventure Series imprint in a series titled, The Double Life of Private Strong. It was cancelled after two issues. Red Circle Comics reintroduced Lancelot Strong in a new series titled, Lancelot Strong: The Shield in June 1983. The series was retitled twice, first with Shield-Steel Sterling in December 1983 and then with Steel Sterling in January 1984. In July 1984, the series ended with its seventh issue. In 1984, Red Circle Comics also released a series starring the Joe Higgins version of the Shield in a series titled Original Shield. It lasted four issues. In 1991, Archie Comics licensed their superheroes to DC Comics who created an imprint called Impact Comics. The company launched a fourth solo series, The Legend of the Shield. It featured two Shields, Joe Higgins, who led the series for the first thirteen issues, and Lt. Michael Barnes, his replacement. Barnes continued as the Shield until the title ended in October 1992.List of DC Comics imprint publications#Impact In 2015, Archie Comics announced the Shield's return in a new series penned by Adam Christopher and Chuck Wendig. This version of the character is a woman named Victoria Adams. The series will be published under the Dark Circle Comics banner. It was originally set to be released in April 2015 but was delayed until September 2015. Joe HigginsMLJ ComicsFictional character biography The origin story of The Shield appeared in Shield‚ÄìWizard Comics #1 (Summer 1940). He is really chemist Joe Higgins, the son of Lieutenant Tom Higgins. Tom was working on a chemical formula for super-strength which the Germans were after, and is slain by German saboteur Hans Fritz in the Black Tom explosion, for which Tom was blamed. After Tom's death, Joe continues to work on it while continuing his studies of chemistry. Joe finally figures out the solution, which requires applying the chemicals to certain parts of his anatomy (Sacrum, Heart, Innervation, Eyes, Lungs, Derma), and exposing himself to x-rays. This gives him super strength, the ability able to make great leaps, and invulnerability. Joe uses the initials S.H.I.E.L.D. as his secret identity. His white costume becomes the familiar colors under the process. He becomes an FBI agent (whose secret identity is known only to FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover) after clearing his father's name, and fights foreign agents and other threats to the U.S.Ask the Archivist ‚Äì \\"Didn't you guys used to publish superhero characters?\\" . Retrieved July 1, 2008. At the start of the strip, Higgins' partners are fellow G-Man Ju Ju Watson, and girlfriend Betty Warren. The Shield is joined by a kid partner, Dusty the Boy Detective, in Pep #11 (Jan 1941). Dusty's father had been killed by foreign agents, and he is adopted by Joe and given a costume. Both heroes wear their patriotic costumes beneath their street clothes and change for action whenever the need would arise. Dusty also partners with The Wizard's kid partner, Roy, as the \\"Boy Buddies\\". In Pep #20, Joe is called \\"The One and Only Shield\\" at the start of the story and \\"The Original Shield\\" at the end of the story because of the success of Captain America, another 1940s-era patriotic superhero. In his first appearance, Captain America had a shield similar to the main part of The Shield's costume, but it was changed to a round shield for the second issue over accusations of plagiarism. The Shield and Dusty were featured in the first crossover storyline in American comic books. The storyline had them team up with the Wizard (the headlining character from Top-Notch Comics) to stop the invasion plot orchestrated by Moskovia (a fictional country made up of elements from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union). The Shield was one of MLJ's most popular characters, even spawning a club, the \\"Shield G-Man Club\\". He starred in Pep, and several other MLJ titles: Shield-Wizard, Top-Notch Comics. But then a new character arrived who would overshadow him: Archie Andrews. He would take the Shield's cover spot on Pep, take his fan club, and cause the end of the MLJ superheroes. An older Joe Higgins appears in New Crusaders as the sole survivor of the Brain Emperor's attack on his fellow Crusaders. He gathers their teenage children to form a team dubbed \\"the New Crusaders\\". =DC Comics= The Red Circle Comics characters, aptly named \\"The Red Circle,\\" were again licensed by DC and rebooted. During the Discord crisis a version of the Shield character was seen helping Green Arrow and Black Canary, performing crowd control.Green Arrow/Black Canary #19‚Äì23 (2009) First appearing as a secondary character in The Web, another former MLJ hero, the new Shield is Lieutenant Joseph Higgins, stationed in Afghanistan, from where he tries to contact The Web to find his missing father.The Red Circle: The Web (2009) On the same day however his crew fall victim to Taliban terrorists, and Higgins is grievously wounded. To save his life, he agrees to be subjected to secret government experiments, after which an advanced, nanotech battle suit is merged to his burned epidermis. The suit appears on his body at will and grants him the same array of powers of the earlier incarnation, including superhuman strength, limited flight and advanced sensory abilities. Due to his severe injuries, the only major drawback is that if ever he tries to remove the war suit permanently, his bodily functions could shut down. Still fighting as the new, patriotic hero, he is again contacted by The Web, accepting his request for helpThe Red Circle: The Shield (2009) The Shield also appeared in the 2010 DC Comics mini series The Mighty Crusaders. Lancelot Strong In June 1959, a new Shield was published by Archie that had no connection to the previous version. Joe Simon was asked by Archie to create characters for a new \\"Archie Adventure Series\\" line of superheroes. Joe Simon created a new Shield- type of superhero, whose real identity was Lancelot Strong, who appeared in a new title, The Double Life of Private Strong. Joe Simon put together a team of artists including Jack Kirby to work for him on The Double Life of Private Strong. Lancelot's scientist father developed a method to create a superhuman by expanding the mind, which he used on his infant son. After his father was killed by foreign agents, Lancelot was adopted by a farm couple and raised as their son. Once he hit his teens, he discovered the truth of his background and his powers: strength, flight, near-invulnerability, vision powers, the ability to generate lightning, and a few more. His father had created a patriotic costume for him, and he started off as the new superhero, the Shield. He soon joined the Army, acting like a Gomer Pyle-style country bumpkin, while leading a double life as the Shield (hence the title of his comic). In 1999, Archie formally assigned all rights to Lancelot Strong to Joe Simon. Bill Higgins and Joe Higgins Jr. When Archie revamped their superheroes under their \\"Radio Comics/Mighty Comics\\" line, a third Shield was introduced as Bill Higgins and Joe Higggins Jr., sons of the original Shield. Bill first appeared in the new Fly-Man #31, and becomes one of the main founders of the Mighty Crusaders. It would be revealed that his father was turned to stone by the villain, The Eraser, and Bill was carrying on his father's work. Bill's 'powers', which seem to be enhanced strength and limited invulnerability, were derived from his costume. He would appear through the end of the Radio/Mighty Comics run. Originally they would switch the name from Bill Higgins to Joe Higgins Jr., from one appearance to the next. In the Red Circle Mighty Crusaders #1 the story established that Bill joined the Army and left his life as a superhero. In 2000 Archie Comics started using Joe Higgins Jr. as the Shield in Archie's Weird Mysteries, establishing that Bill and Joe Jr. were separate characters. Michael Barnes When Legend of the Shield was revamped, Lt. Michael Barnes, a married father with a young daughter, became the new Shield. Barnes would continue as the lead character until the series' 1992 cancellation and also appeared as the Shield in the six-issue miniseries The Crucible. Victoria Adams In 2015, Archie Comics rebranded their Red Circle Comics line under the new Dark Circle Comics banner. The new Shield debuted in her own new series titled The Shield in October 2015. Victoria Adams is the first female to take up the mantle of the Shield. The series ran four issues. She has continued in her role as the Shield in The Mighty Crusaders written by Ian Flynn.

(a.k.a. Tandem Enterprises, Inc.) was a film and television production company that was founded in 1958 by television director Bud Yorkin and television writer/producer Norman Lear. HistoryTandem Productions= In the early years, Yorkin and Lear initially established Tandem specifically for television production. The name was chosen because when launching their company, Yorkin and Lear were said to feel like two men riding uphill on a tandem bicycle. The company produced several variety and dramatic television specials such as the Fred Astaire specials, Henry Fonda and the Family, An Evening with Carol Channing and The Scene '66, to name a few. Tandem was also at hand for various unsold pilots throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including Henry T., Meet Me at Danny's and Barnaby (not to be confused with Barnaby Jones). The company also financed the production of theatrical films, some of which were released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists. Lear and Yorkin later turned their focus on situation comedy. The first success in that genre was All in the Family, which was based on the British sitcom Till Death Us Do Part. Before the series made its debut on January 12, 1971, Yorkin and Lear shot two unsold pilots for the series: one in 1968 called Justice For All and the other in 1969 titled Those Were the Days. Production for the series began in late 1970, following the third pilot episode which was picked up by CBS. More successful shows were also produced by Tandem; they were Maude (1972‚Äì1978), Good Times (1974‚Äì1979), and finally Sanford and Son (1972‚Äì1977). In 1977, Viacom Enterprises secured domestic and international television syndication rights for All in the Family which hit off-network reruns in Fall 1979. Columbia Pictures Television took over distribution for the series by 1991. In 1978, Tandem produced Diff'rent Strokes, which was the only show not to be produced by Yorkin nor Lear. Archie Bunker's Place was produced in 1979, Sanford in 1980 and Gloria, the final series to be produced by Tandem in 1982. Not many more shows were produced under the Tandem name, but many other shows were being produced under T.A.T. Communications Company during the early 1980s. Also in 1978, Tandem Productions launched P*I*T*S Films (an acronym which stands for \\"Pie In The Sky\\") as its television distribution arm for its parent company's programs (All in the Family was excluded, which at the time was distributed by Viacom). P*I*T*S Films was reincorporated as Embassy Telecommunications in 1982. =Bud Yorkin Productions and TOY Productions= After Yorkin ended his partnership with Lear in 1975, he collaborated with writers and producers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein (who wrote some episodes and produced Sanford and Son from 1974 to 1977) and established Bud Yorkin Productions, Inc. He still remained as the executive producer of the series. The first sitcom was Grady, a Sanford and Son spin-off starring Whitman Mayo. The series was canceled after twelve episodes due to low ratings. In 1976, Yorkin, Turteltaub, and Orenstein established TOY Productions, and the first sitcom for the new company was ABC's What's Happening!!. The series was suggested by the American International Picture Cooley High, written by Eric Monte. On February 19, 1979, TOY was acquired by Columbia Pictures Television and launched a new series, 13 Queens Boulevard. A year later, they co-produced the short-lived sitcom One in a Million, starring Shirley Hemphill. Two years later, TOY produced another sitcom, One of the Boys. It received negative reception, and after it was cancelled on April 24, 1982, TOY was folded. =1980s= After Norman Lear bought Avco Embassy Pictures, he dropped the name \\"Avco\\" and reincorporated T.A.T. Communications to Embassy Television. All series that were still produced by T.A.T. (such as The Facts of Life, The Jeffersons, and One Day at a Time) were produced under the Embassy name. All shows by Tandem Productions that were off the air were distributed by Embassy Telecommunications. In 1983, Ken Stump, the former associate producer for Tandem Productions and T.A.T. Communications was made in charge of production for Tandem Productions and Embassy Television. The same year in June, Lear and Perenchio bought out Yorkin's interest in Tandem.\\"Norman Lear Selected Press\\" Lear, Perenchio Sell Embassy Properties normanlear.com AL DELUGACH and KATHRYN HARRIS The Los Angeles Times, Retrieved on December 31, 2013 On June 18, 1985, Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio sold Embassy Communications, Inc. to The Coca-Cola Company for $485 million, but then Coke sold Embassy Pictures to Dino De Laurentiis since De Laurentiis didn't want to release his movies through a major studio anymore. Coke's plan was to keep the television division and to spin-off the other labels that weren't part of the deal. De Laurentiis later folded Embassy Pictures with the formation of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. The majority of the motion picture holdings are currently licensed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and StudioCanal. However, Columbia Pictures still retains Crimewave and Saving Grace (both co-distributed by Embassy Pictures). SPE also has the television rights to the Avco Embassy Film The Fog (1980) since a 2005 remake. After the sale of Embassy, CPT also produced and distributed the sitcom What's Happening Now!! which was co-produced by LBS Communications. The same year, Diff'rent Strokes moved to ABC from NBC after NBC cancelled the series. Tandem Productions remained active, but Coke and Embassy Communications launched Tandem Licensing Corporation as Tandem's licensing division. In 1986, Diff'rent Strokes was canceled due to low ratings and Tandem Productions was abandoned. Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications and Tandem Productions were merged with Embassy Communications and Embassy Communications became a full television studio than a holding company (later becoming part of Columbia/Embassy Television in November 1986). However, Tandem still remained as an in-name-only division of Embassy Communications until February 8, 1988 when it became in-name-only to Columbia Pictures Television and in turn an in- name-only sub-division of ELP Communications. The same year, Coca-Cola spun off and sold Embassy Home Entertainment to Nelson Holdings, Inc. and became Nelson Entertainment. CPT still retained the television rights to those Embassy movies by Joseph E. Levine, Avco Embassy Pictures, and Lear/Perenchio's Embassy Pictures.

She was born in Sweden of Swiss-French heritage.  Early years  When asked of her childhood, she has said, She had a convent education and learned various languages. She learned to ski and loved the outdoors life. At school her left hand was tied behind her back and she was made to write with her right hand though she was naturally a lefthander. Digard's breasts started developing at a young age, about which she commented, After leaving school she travelled to Italy and then France to improve her Italian and French. She then travelled to the Channel Islands and to London where she worked for a large hotel. Following this she travelled via Marrakesh to the Canary Islands where she worked during the winters for a jewellery firm on percentage payment. During summers she would travel around. She also worked in jewellery stores in Sweden and Switzerland. She met her husband in the Canary Islands.  Career  Digard burst into cinema in Sweden where she starred in several softcore erotic films. In 1967, she went to the U.S. where she soon began appearing in numerous sexploitation movies such as Uschi's Hollywood Adventure (aka Raquel's Motel, 1970), a film so low-budget it was shot without sound and then dubbed with a narrative voiceover. She also appeared in pornographic magazines. She was among the best known big bust models in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Magazines in which she appeared frequently include Knight, Cinema X, Latent Image, and Gent. Digard was cast in Russ Meyer's Cherry, Harry & Raquel! (1970) to provide the d√©nouement in a final interpretive dance scene symbolizing the death of the antagonist. She went on to appear in more of Meyer's films in the 1970s: Supervixens (1975) and Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979). She was also a co-producer on Up! and Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens. She also provided the narration for Tundi Horvath's character in Meyer's last film Pandora Peaks (2000). She starred in Ed Wood‚Äôs The Only House In Town (1971). She appeared as Mayday in the cult action comedy Superchick (1973) starring Joyce Jillson, and starred with John Holmes in I Want You (1974). She had a minor role as a prisoner in the cult classic Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1975), appeared as 'Super Girl' in Fantasm (1976) directed by Richard Franklin, appeared as a girl at party in The Killer Elite (1975) directed by Sam Peckinpah and had a small role in Chesty Anderson, USN (1976). She also had a role as a character called 'Pussy' in Female Chauvinists (1976). In 1977 Digard had a cameo appearance (naked in a shower) in the segment \\"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\\" in John Landis's The Kentucky Fried Movie. In 1979, she performed with John Holmes, Johnny Keyes, Serena, Candy Samples, Kitten Natividad, and Kelly Stewart in the pornographic film John Holmes and the All-Star Sex Queens from Zane Entertainment Group. In those years, she also starred in some \\"sexy wrestling\\" short-footage films, mainly for Triumph Studios and Ron Dvorkin's Bellstone.

John S. Rieske and co-workers first discovered and isolated the proteins in 1964. It is a unique [2Fe-2S] cluster in that one of the two Fe atoms is coordinated by two histidine residues rather than two cysteine residues. They have since been found in plants, animals, and bacteria with widely ranging electron reduction potentials from -150 to +400 mV.  Biological function (in oxidative phosphorylation systems)  Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (also known as bc1 complex or complex III) is an enzyme complex of bacterial and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation systems. It catalyses the oxidation-reduction reaction of the mobile components ubiquinol and cytochrome c, contributing to an electrochemical potential difference across the mitochondrial inner or bacterial membrane, which is linked to ATP synthesis. The complex consists of three subunits in most bacteria, and nine in mitochondria: both bacterial and mitochondrial complexes contain cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 subunits, and an iron‚Äìsulfur 'Rieske' subunit, which contains a high potential 2Fe-2S cluster. The mitochondrial form also includes six other subunits that do not possess redox centres. Plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (b6f complex), present in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, catalyses the oxidoreduction of plastoquinol and cytochrome f. This complex, which is functionally similar to ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, comprises cytochrome b6, cytochrome f and Rieske subunits. The Rieske subunit acts by binding either a ubiquinol or plastoquinol anion, transferring an electron to the 2Fe-2S cluster, then releasing the electron to the cytochrome c or cytochrome f heme iron. The reduction of the Rieske center increases the affinity of the subunit by several orders of magnitude, stabilizing the semiquinone radical at the Q(P) site. The Rieske domain has a [2Fe-2S] center. Two conserved cysteines coordinate one Fe ion while the other Fe ion is coordinated by two conserved histidines. The 2Fe-2S cluster is bound in the highly conserved C-terminal region of the Rieske subunit.  Rieske protein family  The homologues of the Rieske proteins include ISP components of cytochrome b6f complex, aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (phthalate dioxygenase, benzene, naphthalene and toluene 1,2-dioxygenases) and arsenite oxidase (EC 1.20.98.1). Comparison of amino acid sequences has revealed the following consensus sequence: : Cys-Xaa-His-(Xaa)15-17-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-His Rieske iron‚Äìsulfur center  3D structure  The crystal structures of a number of Rieske proteins are known. The overall fold, comprising two subdomains, is dominated by antiparallel Œ≤-structure and contains variable numbers of Œ±-helices. The smaller \\"cluster-binding\\" subdomains in mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins are virtually identical, whereas the large subdomains are substantially different in spite of a common folding topology. The [Fe2S2] cluster-binding subdomains have the topology of an incomplete antiparallel Œ≤-barrel. One iron atom of the Rieske [Fe2S2] cluster in the domain is coordinated by two cysteine residues and the other is coordinated by two histidine residues through the NŒ¥ atoms. The ligands coordinating the cluster originate from two loops; each loop contributes one Cys and one His.

The term may also refer to any disease or sign that strongly motivates withdrawal of an individual or entity from the trial, then often termed a humane (clinical) endpoint. The primary endpoint of a clinical trial is the endpoint for which the trial is powered. Secondary endpoints are additional endpoints, preferably also pre-specified, for which the trial may not be powered. Surrogate endpoints are trial endpoints that have outcomes that substitute for a clinical endpoint, often because studying the clinical endpoint is difficult, for example using an increase in blood pressure as a surrogate for death by cardiovascular disease, where strong evidence of a causal link exists. Scope In a general sense, a clinical endpoint is included in the entities of interest in a trial. The results of a clinical trial generally indicate the number of people enrolled who reached the pre-determined clinical endpoint during the study interval compared with the overall number of people who were enrolled. Once a patient reaches the endpoint, he or she is generally excluded from further experimental intervention (the origin of the term endpoint). For example, a clinical trial investigating the ability of a medication to prevent heart attack might use chest pain as a clinical endpoint. Any patient enrolled in the trial who develops chest pain over the course of the trial, then, would be counted as having reached that clinical endpoint. The results would ultimately reflect the fraction of patients who reached the endpoint of having developed chest pain, compared with the overall number of people enrolled. When an experiment involves a control group, the proportion of individuals who reach the clinical endpoint after an intervention is compared with the proportion of individuals in the control group who reached the same clinical endpoint, reflecting the ability of the intervention to prevent the endpoint in question. A clinical trial will usually define or specify a primary endpoint as a measure that will be considered success of the therapy being trialled (e.g. in justifying a marketing approval). The primary endpoint might be a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS). A trial might also define one or more secondary endpoints such as progression-free-survival (PFS) that will be measured and are expected to be met. A trial might also define exploratory endpoints that are less likely to be met. Examples Clinical endpoints can be obtained from different modalities, such as, behavioural or cognitive scores, or biomarkers from Electroencephalography (qEEG), MRI, PET, or biochemical biomarkers. In clinical cancer research, common endpoints include discovery of local recurrence, discovery of regional metastasis, discovery of distant metastasis, onset of symptoms, hospitalization, increase or decrease in pain medication requirement, onset of toxicity, requirement of salvage chemotherapy, requirement of salvage surgery, requirement of salvage radiotherapy, death from any cause or death from disease. A cancer study may be powered for overall survival, usually indicating time until death from any cause, or disease specific survival, where the endpoint is death from disease or death from toxicity. These are expressed as a period of time (survival duration) e.g., in months. Frequently the median is used so that the trial endpoint can be calculated once 50% of subjects have reached the endpoint, whereas calculation of an arithmetical mean can only be done after all subjects have reached the endpoint. =Disease free survival= The disease free survival is usually used to analyze the results of the treatment for the localized disease which renders the patient apparently disease free, such as surgery or surgery plus adjuvant therapy. In the disease-free survival, the event is relapse rather than death. The people who relapse are still surviving but they are no longer disease-free. Just as in the survival curves not all patients die, in \\"disease-free survival curves\\" not all patients relapse and the curve may have a final plateau representing the patients who didn't relapse after the study's maximum follow-up. Because the patients survive for at least some time after the relapse, the curve for the actual survival would look better than disease free survival curve. =Progression free survival= The Progression Free Survival is usually used in analysing the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event for the progression free survival is that the disease gets worse or progresses, or the patient dies from any cause. Time to Progression is a similar endpoint that ignores patients who die before the disease progresses. =Response duration= The response duration is occasionally used to analyze the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event is progression of the disease (relapse). This endpoint involves selecting a subgroup of the patients. It measures the length of the response in those patients who responded. The patients who don't respond aren't included. =Overall survival= Overall survival is based on death from any cause, not just the condition being treated, thus it picks up death from side effects of the treatment, and effects on survival after relapse. Humane endpoint A humane endpoint can be defined as the point at which pain and/or distress is terminated, minimized or reduced for an entity in a trial (such as an experimental animal), by taking action such as killing the animal humanely, terminating a painful procedure, or giving treatment to relieve pain and/or distress.Humane Endpoints From Netherlands Association for Laboratory Animal Science (NVP). Retrieved April 2011. The occurrence of an individual in a trial having reached may necessitate withdrawal from the trial before the target outcome of interest has been fully reached. Surrogate endpoint A surrogate endpoint (or marker) is a measure of effect of a specific treatment that may correlate with a real clinical endpoint but doesn't necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. The National Institutes of Health (USA) define surrogate endpoint as \\"a biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint\\".Controlled Clinical Trials 22:485‚Äì502 (2001)) Combined endpoint Some studies will examine the incidence of a combined endpoint, which can merge a variety of outcomes into one group. For example, the heart attack study above may report the incidence of the combined endpoint of chest pain, myocardial infarction, or death. An example of a cancer study powered for a combined endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS); trial participants experiencing either death or discovery of any recurrence would constitute the endpoint. Overall Treatment Utility is an example of a multidimensional composite endpoint in cancer clinical trials. Regarding humane endpoints, a combined endpoint may constitute a threshold where there is enough cumulative degree of disease, symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities to motivate an intervention. Response rates Each trial may define what is considered a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the therapy or intervention. Hence the trials report the 'complete response rate' and the overall response rate which includes CR and PR. (e.g. see Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and Small-cell carcinoma treatment, and for immunotherapies, Immune-Related Response Criteria). Consistency Various studies on a particular topic often do not address the same outcomes, making it difficult to draw clinically useful conclusions when a group of studies is looked at as a whole. The Core Outcomes in Women's Health (CROWN) Initiative is one effort to standardize outcomes. ReferencesFurther reading * AR Waladkhani. (2008). Conducting clinical trials.

Set in a wooded estate, it is one of three properties owned and managed by the National Trust in County Fermanagh, the others being Florence Court and the Crom Estate. The townland, which is in size, is situated in the civil parish of Derryvullan, in the historic barony of Tirkennedy, as well as Fermanagh and Omagh district.  History  The Castle Coole estate was purchased in 1656 by the Belfast merchant John Corry, grandfather of the first Earl. The estate is named for Lough Coole (from Irish Gaelic c√∫il, 'seclusion'), a lake surrounded by the Killynure hills. A r√°th here and a crannog in Lough Coole itself are reminders that the area has been settled since prehistoric times. Other lakes on the estate include Lough Yoan and Brendrum Lough. The site of a 17th-century house and bawn and formal garden at Castle Coole (grid ref: H2574 4333) are Scheduled Historic Monuments. Castle Coole was constructed between 1789 and 1798 as the summer retreat of Armar Lowry-Corry, the 1st Earl Belmore. Lord Belmore was the Member of Parliament for County Tyrone in the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin and a wealthy heir to of land throughout Ireland, acquired by ancestors with a successful background in merchantry. The income generated by the estates allowed Castle Coole to be constructed at a cost of ¬£57,000 in 1798, equivalent to approximately ¬£20 million today. The siting on the comparatively small estate in County Fermanagh was primarily due to its unspoilt rural location and natural environment amongst ancient oak woodland and small lakes, yet with proximity to the market town of Enniskillen for the domestic labour necessary for a large mansion. Additionally, several smaller family residences had been built on the Castle Coole estate preceding the mansion, including a dwelling of the King James period (later deliberately destroyed by fire) and a Queen Anne house built in 1709. Following the passage in 1800 of the Act of Union, the law politically uniting Britain and Ireland, the family moved from their main residence ‚Äì a small townhouse in Sackville Street, Dublin ‚Äì to Castle Coole, as the reason for living in Dublin, to be close to the Parliament, no longer applied. In 1951 the 7th Earl Belmore transferred the mansion to the National Trust, prompted by two sets of death duties or inheritance tax when the 5th and 6th Earls Belmore died without issue 18 months apart. However, the contents of the mansion, including much that is today shown to visitors, remain the Earl Belmore's property. The National Trust opens the mansion to visitors during the summer months, and the estate can be visited year-round. Between 1980 and 1988, the mansion was closed to the public while the National Trust undertook major restoration work, including the dismantling the fa√ßade to replace metal anchors that hold the stone in place as these were corroding. This was done with such sensitivity and care that today the weathered stone looked quite undisturbed. To celebrate the re-opening, the Queen Mother was invited to Castle Coole. As part of the transfer of ownership to the National Trust there is an agreement that the Earl Belmore retains an apartment in the S wing, currently used by his heir and family. The Earl himself lives in a small house elsewhere on the estate.  Architecture  Neo-classical in architectural style, Castle Coole was the work of two Georgian period architects who did not collaborate. Richard Johnston, an Irish architect, was initially commissioned and completed the basement. Johnston was dismissed in favour of the popular and fashionable English architect James Wyatt, who, rather than starting afresh, began where Johnston left off and completed the mansion on the same footprint. Wyatt adhered closely to the Neo-classical ideal of restraint, symmetry and meticulous proportions, with architectural features carefully scaled. An Ionic portico and flanking Doric colonnaded wings extend either end of the main block of the house. Wyatt probably never visited the site and sent drawings for the house from London. The very fine and varied plaster ceilings were all the work of the English artist Joseph Rose. Notable aspects of the mansion include the Portland stone fa√ßades and sober portico with Ionic capitals. Inside there more restrained grandeur with the entrance hall boasting four massive scagliola columns. A double-return cantilever staircase leads to an unusual double-height saloon at first floor that rises up a further floor with a bedroom gallery over-looking. Both spaces are decorated amply with Doric columns in scagliola of diminishing scale from lower to higher. Wyatt also designed some of the most important furniture in the mansion. Such architect- designed Neo-classical pieces still in the situation for which they are designed are rare, much of their aesthetic value arising from their surviving in the original location. Other furniture was placed by the second Earl, when the Regency style was in vogue and by later generations, so that the interior appearance today is many layered, not just neo-classical. Detail of Castle Coole portico, with bold capitals on Ionic columns giving scale and grandeur to a chaste composition A state bedroom, prepared in 1821 for King George IV (un-used by the King, who failed to arrive), retains original furnishings, state bed and flock wallpaper. A drawing room furnished in a French Empire style, a Grecian staircase hall, and a ladies' workroom furnished in a Chinese style reflect the importance of worldly knowledge and awareness during the Regency period. Family motifs, engraved into Italian marble chimneypieces and adorning the plaster frieze of the Entrance Hall, reflect the first Earl's pride in his family heritage. The rooms to the mansion's garden front have views of Lough Coole. Service areas There is an extensive basement under the house and extending some way under the adjacent northwest lawns. This below-ground area is partially restored and open to the public and contains kitchens, servants' hall, larders, wine-cellars, laundry, a Roman style plunge-bath, a brewery and other offices. Castle Coole has no above-ground service door. Wyatt sought to give the impression‚Äîoften sought by Neo- classical architects‚Äîof a perfect composition on ancient proportional principles, isolated in a \\"natural\\" landscape. Externally, the practical offices supporting the house are all accessed by a long inclined tunnel from the stable yard away, so that tradesmen, servants and estate staff approached and left the house unseen, with the architect's Neo-classical ideal composition above ground left seemingly undisturbed by day-to-day business. Numerous out-buildings can be found on the estate; those of interest include lodges, \\"Grand Yard\\", workshops, stables, and a \\"Tallow House\\" (originally used for candle-making, now a gift shop and reception area). The entrance to the service tunnel to the house is adjacent to the Grand Yard.  Estate  Much of the native oak, ash and beech planting of the landscape park remains, today grazed by cattle and sheep as originally intended. A considerable portion of the estate has been historically given over to agriculture and let to local farmers, a practice which continues today. A part to the South West has been taken by the Enniskillen Golf Club and here the original planting is compromised by moden golf course design. To the South East part of the estate was sold off for the Killyevlin Industrial Estate. A 'ha-ha' ‚Äì that is a ditch to control livestock movements without visual interruption to the landscape resulting from a fence or a wall ‚Äì can be found near the mansion. Vestigial remains of the earlier extensive parterres of the earlier Baroque house can be seen in the park, but are difficult to discern today, in spite of interpretation panels installed by the National Trust.  Family  The Belmore earldom is named after the nearby Belmore Mountain, west of Enniskillen. Corry had hoped to be named Earl of Enniskillen, until this title was given to the Cole family at Florence Court. Though the origins of the Corry side of the family can be found in Belfast, there is more uncertainty with the Lowry side. The Lowrys may originally have been from Dumfries in Scotland. As a member of the peerage of Ireland, the earl of Belmore had a seat in the Irish House of Lords until it was abolished in 1801 when the kingdom of Ireland was merged into the United Kingdom. The second and fourth earls subsequently sat in the House of Lords at Westminster as representative peers.  Workforce  Gate lodge at the entrance to the estate At its peak, Castle Coole employed around 90 staff, both indoor and outdoor. The basement of the mansion was entirely the domain of the indoor staff, and accommodation for the outdoor staff was mainly found in the buildings surrounding the Grand Yard. During the early stages in the mansion's history when the main residence of the Belmore family was in Dublin, a caretaker staff of 5‚Äì10 servants remained in the mansion when the family were away. This may help explain the excellent condition of the mansion today; continuous occupancy prevented decay and may have helped prevent major disasters, such as fires. As in many mansions, a hierarchy amongst servants formed. The Head Cook for instance enjoyed a two-room apartment above the warmth of the Kitchens. The Butler too enjoyed a personal apartment. A boot boy on the other hand had communal accommodation with other lower ranking servants.  New in 2006  Castle Coole re-opened to the public for the 2006 season on 17 March. A re-design of the Victorian Bedroom layout now commemorates four years of Australian influence at Castle Coole. Somerset Lowry-Corry, the 4th Earl Belmore, became the Conservative Governor of New South Wales on 8 January 1868 and served until 23 February 1872. At Government House, Sydney, the 4th Earl's first son was born on 1 May 1870, later to become the 5th Earl Belmore. Lady Belmore found the summer climate of Sydney oppressive and despite frequent retreats to Moss Vale, concern over his wife's health prompted the Lord Belmore to resign his governorship on 26 June 1871 allowing the Belmore family to return to Castle Coole the following year. Belmore Park, Sydney and Belmore Park, Goulburn testify to New South Wales railway developments brought about by Lord Belmore's governorship and his own personal popularity in Australia. As the bedroom of the 4th Earl and Countess at Castle Coole both prior to and following their four years in Australia, the Victorian Bedroom commemorates the connection. Admission to Castle Coole is by guided tour only.

Dobson Cellular Systems was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dobson Communications Corporation based in Oklahoma City. It was the provider of Cellular One-branded services in the United States. Dobson operated under the brand name of Cellular One, and provided service on a D-AMPS and GSM network. The company purchased the rights to the Cellular One name from Alltel in December 2005. Corporate history Formed in the 1920s, Dobson Communications originally operated a small wireline telephone network in Oklahoma. In 70 years, Dobson had evolved to become the nation's largest independent rural wireless provider. Dobson's operations in 60 markets were acquired through several purchases within the last 10 years. On June 29, 2007 AT&T; Inc. announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase Dobson Cellular division. The closing price was $2.8B USD or $13 per share. AT&T; also agreed to assume the outstanding debt of $2.3B USD. The sale completed on November 15, 2007, with market transition beginning December 9, 2007. The Cellular One brand name was sold to Trilogy Partners in February 2008. The Federal government prevented AT&T; from taking certain Dobson markets In Texas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky along the Ohio border and the I-75 corridor, due to the potential monopoly this would create in this area. After placing these markets in a trust for one year, the Kentucky markets were sold to Verizon Wireless in November 2008 with market transition to be completed by November 2009, and the others, TX-10 and OK-5, were sold to affiliates of MTPCS, LLC, which concurrently adopted the Cellular One brand under a license agreement with Trilogy Partners. Network Dobson was, for the most part, a rural provider. It claimed to be the largest provider of cellular services in Alaska as well as in Michigan. It was also the exclusive provider of GSM technology in many of its markets and has a few resellers such as TracFone and smaller MVNOs in particular states. It also provided voice and data roaming capability for many AT&T; and T-Mobile customers. Dobson had recently upgraded a majority of its GSM/GPRS towers with an EDGE overlay, providing an even faster data rate for their customers.

Alkhabaz, 104 F.3d 1492 (6th Cir. 1997)The full title of this case is United States of America v. Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz, also known as Jake Baker was a case brought against University of Michigan undergraduate Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz, a.k.a. Jake Baker, related to several incidents regarding snuff stories that he wrote while he was a student at the University of Michigan. Alkhabaz was charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. s 875(c), communicating via interstate or foreign commerce threats to kidnap or injure another person. The case raised immediate First Amendment concerns and is considered an important one in the history of cyber law. Background Jake Baker (born March 1974;On March 11, 1995, the Ann Arbor News said Baker was 20; on March 16 it said he was 21. given name Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz) was a student at the University of Michigan College for Literature, Science, and Arts. In October 1994, Jake Baker started submitting pornographic stories depicting fantasies of rape, torture, and murder to the alt.sex.stories Usenet group. On January 9, 1995, Baker submitted a story to alt.sex.stories detailing a fantasy about the rape, torture, and murder of one of his classmates, \\"Jane Doe.\\" The victim wishes not to be named as this has affected her life in many harmful ways. Baker's story was brought to the attention of University of Michigan authorities and he was arrested, determined to be a threat to the subject of his story as well as the rest of the student population. During the serving of a search warrant upon Baker's computer, University of Michigan police found several stories depicting rape, torture, and murder genre favored by Baker. They also found emails to a Canadian by the name of Arthur Gonda, depicting rape, torture, and murder. Their communications also began detailing a plan for the two men to meet and engage in a real-life depiction of their fantasies to rape, torture, and murder. On February 9, 1995 Baker was arrested by the FBI and he was later indicted for six counts of violating 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 875(c), which prohibits interstate communications containing threats to kidnap or injure another person. Five of the counts were determined by emails between Baker and Gonda. The sixth count was determined from the story about \\"Jane Doe.\\" Bail hearing The Magistrate Judge ordered Baker detained as a danger to the community and a United States District Court affirmed his detention. Upon Baker's motion to be released on bond, this Court ordered a psychological evaluation. When the evaluation concluded that Baker posed no threat to the community, this Court ordered Baker's release. Case resolution One of the counts - communicating a threat by publishing the story about \\"Jane Doe\\" on the Internet - was dropped against Baker. On June 21, 1995, the case against Baker was dismissed by Judge Avern Cohn due to lack of evidence that Baker would actually act out his fantasies. The Government appealed this decision, and on January 29, 1997, the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the lower court. Controversy Free speech advocates state that the Government violated Jake Baker's First Amendment right to free speech by charging him with a crime for writing stories. Others defended the Government's case by stating that Baker's stories were filth, snuff, and that Baker was intending to act on them. Baker stated that his stories were created as a form of therapy - so that he could act out his anger in a \\"harmless\\", legal way. Baker also stated that he was role playing within his emails to Gonda, and that he did not intend to act on his fantasies. This case was not only about obscenity and threats, but it was being watched by Internet advocates, namely that his stories were published over a wide medium, and that since the Internet is a medium beyond borders, that state even federal level laws were not able to be applied to it. Baker was charged with communicating a threat over interstate lines - a charge that may have not been able to hold, other than the fact that Baker published his stories and corresponded over the Internet. It has also been said that this case set a precedent for free speech on the Internet.  Timeline  *January 20, 1995 - DPS officers contact Baker. Baker waives his Miranda rights and admits to writing and posting the stories.

The party is interrupted by the Legion of Doom (Riddler, Weather Wizard, Sinestro, Mordru, Doctor Sivana, Giganta and Solomon Grundy), who announce they have hidden a deadly bomb in a secret location, and the heroes must follow clues to find it. It's all actually a ruse to trick the heroes into drinking Mordru's de- powering potion.

French Polynesia was an overseas territory until the constitutional reform on 28 March 2003 created the overseas collectivities. Then, on 27 February 2004 a law was passed giving French Polynesia the particular designation of overseas country while recalling that it belongs to the category of overseas collectivities. However, the Constitutional Council of France ruled that this description was merely a designation and not a legal status, as that would have been unconstitutional. The territory's new status meant a certain autonomy for French Polynesia in the Pacific region. This translated into the transfer of new areas of legal responsibility (civil law, commercial law, labour law) while protecting existing autonomy in the fields of health, development and town planning and the environment. In addition, French Polynesia gained the power to oppose the application of laws voted by the French Parliament that do not respect these areas of responsibility. Furthermore, it established French Polynesian citizenship based on permanent residency - a requirement for the right to vote in regional elections. However, France maintains control over justice, security and public order, currency, defence, and foreign policy. New Caledonia, which has the unique status of a sui generis collectivity, is also sometimes incorrectly referred to as an overseas country. The people of New Caledonia voted against becoming an overseas country and chose to remain part of France in the 2018 New Caledonian independence referendum and 2020 New Caledonian independence referendum, although the legislature may choose to hold another referendum in 2022.

Examples Unifying characteristics of this language in many books include: * allows comprehension of all other languages, including those of animals * a medium for magic * a mode of communication for a high class of people * difficult or impossible to lie in A popular example of this is found in the Young Wizards series of novels by Diane Duane. All creatures and things understand and, to a degree, can speak the Speech intuitively, but specifically, it is the wizards who use it as their primary language and means of performing their works of magic. It is incredibly detailed and describes things that other languages cannot. Describing something inaccurately in the Speech may result in catastrophic effects (including changing the nature of the thing or being therein misdescribed); therefore, wizards are advised to never curse or lie in the Speech. Spells are described in the Speech; the wizard tells the object/subject what he/she wants to happen to it. With a final word, the spell can be let loose to do what it was supposed to do. The written characters of \\"The Speech\\" are described in several of the books as resembling Arabic, and in Deep Wizardry, Nita's father mistakes the writing on the title page of Nita's Manual for Arabic letters. Other examples: *In the Pellinor series by Alison Croggon, the Bards of the land, magic users and Light bringers use the Speech, the ancient bardic language that activates magic. *In Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, a dead language called the Ancient Language is used for spellcasting and by elves. *In Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series, the True Speech is the language of magic. It is the native language of dragons, but wizards must learn it by study. Humans cannot lie in it, but dragons can. It is known by many names: the Old Speech, the (True) Language/Speech/Words of the Making, True Words, the Eldest tongue, the Dragon tongue, spellwords.

The network then changed the time slot from Tuesdays to Thursdays at 8:30 p.m., between Friends and Frasier, with this episode becoming a success as it attracted its highest audience ratings of the season. The previous episode, \\"Secrets and Lays\\", was watched by 9.6 million viewers.

Chicago Tribune's Steve Johnson opined that the episode \\"starts strong and then goes awry [...] It's funny for a while [...] But then it takes it to a ludicrous level, selling out its own internal logic by conspiring to put [Molly] Shannon and Messing into a ... catfight. At its best this series works a groove of pop-culture savvy; this visit from The Three Stooges by way of Dynasty will have you rolling your eyes in dismay.\\" Critics praised Shannon's performance in the episode. Bark wrote, \\"...the talented Ms. Shannon is winningly glossy and brassy [in this episode]. Someday soon she'll have her own sitcom. Bet on it.\\" Tom Feran of The Plain Dealer reported that Shannon's appearance on the show would make \\"a good introduction for viewers curious about Will & Grace.\\" The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert enjoyed the actress in \\"Grace, Replaced\\", writing that she is appealing as the Grace replacement.

According to the , it has a population of people.  History  Carmona was just a part of the big town of Silang. This is not surprising because in the early part of the Spanish regime Silang included what today are known as the municipalities of Indang: San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), and Maragondon. Moreover, Alfonso, Amadeo, and Mendez were mere sitios of Indang; Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza) was a part of San Francisco de Malabon or Malabon Grande; and Magallanes and Ternate were barrios of Maragondon. Furthermore, Maragondon itself had been a part of the Corregimiento of Mariveles on the opposite side of Manila Bay. According to research conducted in 1982, by Sangguniang Bayan members Ernesto Zamora, Salvador P. Manahan, Pio Purificacion, Narciso Levardo, and Romy Laurito, assisted by Municipal Secretary Rogelio D. Paular, it was found out that the history of Carmona began during the 15th century. As related by a reliable informant, three brothers coming from the mountain of Silang were said to be the first settlers in the place which was then called ‚ÄúLatag‚Äù, a Tagalog word for ‚Äúplain‚Äù due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. The settlement was not known to other residents of Silang until some of them also went down to the place, cleared some forest areas and established their residence. In 1595, Silang became a town and Latag was annexed as a part since then. Latag gradually developed into a community whose residents struggled hard to make it a town. Their burning desires were filled with hopes and fulfillment in 1856 when their move for the conversion of Latag into a town was spearheaded by a leader named Tiburcio Purificacion. Finally, by virtue of a decree issued on February 20, 1857 by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de Norzagaray, Latag became a separate municipality with the name it bears today: Carmona, named after the town of Carmona in the province of Seville, Spain. Yet until now, it had not been known where the name originated. During the Philippine Revolution in 1896, the gobernadorcillo of Carmona was Kapitan Damian Ermitano after the administrations of Tiburcio Purificacion, Mariano Mapanoo and Donald C. Virtucio, Augusto Manaog and Fabian Tenedero. After the revolution and the occupation of the country by the Americans in 1901, the first local executive of Carmona was Martin Reyes who was followed next by Marcelo Reyes, Prudencio Torres, Juan Alumia, Estanislao Paular, Marciano Mapanoo, and Juan Zamora. The mayors who assumed office after World War II were the following honorable men: Bernardo Hebron, Eulalio Reyes and Cesar Casal and Felino L. Maquinay. In 1959, the district of San Gabriel and San Jose of Barangay Kabilang Baybay was purchased by the National Government for the relocation of squatters from Metro Manila. On March 14, 1981, the relocation site, which teemed with people from almost every part of the country and was more popularly known as the resettlement area, became an independent municipality called General Mariano Alvarez. =Timeline of Carmona= * 1500‚Äì1600 ‚Üí Carmona history started with three brothers that came to the land of Carmona that was at that time called Labac. * 1595 ‚Üí Silang became a town; the former Sitio Labac became Barrio Latag. * March 9, 1746 ‚Üí They determined the boundaries of Silang and Bi√±an under a decree signed by Mayor Pedro Calderon Enriquez. * November 15, 1759 ‚Üí Two years after securing the independence of Carmona, the principales requested the Governor of Cavite for the reversal of the Canon on communal lands after constructing their own public buildings and irrigation works. * 1838 ‚Üí The movement of the inhabitants of Latag to become a town started. * February 20, 1857 ‚Üí Because of the great distance to the mother town, the principales and incumbent Cabeza de Barangay of Latag petitioned for its separation and conversion into a municipality.

The average humidity of Carmona is 81%. This makes the municipality cooler than the Metropolitan Manila Area where the average humidity is higher. =Soil properties= The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted with rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil. =Mineral resources= Cavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of the western part of the province. Carmona reserves and deposits of sand, clay and gravel materials are found in Sitio Ulong Tubig, Mabuhay. =Barangays= Carmona is subdivided of 14 barangays (the smallest local government unit) which handle governance in a much smaller area. * Bancal * Barangay 1 * Barangay 2 * Barangay 3 * Barangay 4 * Barangay 5 * Barangay 6 * Barangay 7 * Barangay 8 * Cabilang Baybay * Lantic * Mabuhay * Maduya * Milagrosa Demographics In the , the population of Carmona, Cavite, was people, with a density of . In the 2010 census, Carmona had a total population of 74,986 which represented a total number of households at 14,885.Demography  Carmona Cavite, Philippines =Population density= The highest densities are found in the Poblacion area (Barangays 1‚Äì8) and Barangays Milagrosa and Maduya, where land areas are significantly lower than the other barangays. Barangay Lantic posted development of the Kuok Property within the Lantic area; it is expected that the density will increase within the ten-year period. =Population distribution= Carmona's population is concentrated in Barangays 1‚Äì8 at the Poblacion area. Barangay Milagrosa is the most populated barangay, which posted a total population of 15,284. Dense population is also found in Barangay 9, the central business district of the municipality. Most population catalysts such as banks, town center, and commercial establishments are found in the Poblacion area. =Language= The main language spoken is Tagalog. In some areas they speak Chabacano or Chavacano, sometimes referred to by linguists as Philippine Creole Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language spoken in the Philippines. English is considered as the second language and is widely used as medium of communication in business and higher education. Other Philippine languages spoken are Waray, Bicolano, Cebuano, Ilokano, Pangasinense, and Hiligaynon. Chinese and Spanish are also spoken by some local residents. =Religion= The majority of inhabitants are composed of Roman Catholics, Protestants and other non-denominational groups. Economy Cottage industries include metal works, metalcraft, footwear industries, concrete products, tricycle assembly, rattan handicrafts and bakeries. Manufacturing firms engaged in handicraft (bags and shoes), furniture making, business retailing, personal and business services, and food based enterprises contribute to the municipality's trade and commerce. Mercantile activities in the municipality are concentrated at the Poblacion area and along Governor's Drive. Carmona has been classified as a first class municipality since July 1996, brought about by industrialization, real estate development and commercial activities. Carmona's progress accelerated after the conversion of more than fifty hectares of farmlands into industrial areas in 1998. Garment industries, steel fabrication, microchips and semi-conductors, tool fabrication, bus assembly, bulb factories, die casting and other small and medium-scale industries currently operate in the municipality. These investments continue to provide local employment, generate export earnings, increase municipal revenues and serve as vehicles for technology transfer. Foreign investments are pouring in as export-oriented industries continue to flourish. Employment rate: Out of a potential labor force of 24,918 (members 15 years old & above who are actively seeking for work), 98.03% are employed while 1.97% are unemployed. The presence of 8 industrial estates & 2 industrial compounds contribute largely to the high employment rate of the municipality. =Agriculture= An irrigation dam in Carmona. The economy of Carmona is generally agricultural. Almost half of its total land area is devoted to agriculture. In 2000, the total land area devoted to agriculture was 609 or roughly 19.60% of the total land area of Carmona, which is 3,902 hectares. 230 hectares are irrigated areas all of which are currently planted with rice and vegetables, 30 hectares are upland rice areas, 122.5 hectares are for diversified trees and crops, and the other 211.5 hectares are considered pasture land. There are 217 farmers in the Municipality engaged in planting and farming. Crops and livestock farmers are distributed among 14 barangays of Carmona. However, with the implementation of the CALABARZON growth area, the municipality of Carmona has slowly become an industrial enclave in the province. The advent of industrialization has threatened the agricultural base of Carmona. As of April 1999, land used for rice production has gone down; sugarcane plantation has decreased considerably and those land uses for other crops and vegetables totaled 84.5 hectares during the same year. At present, the programs and services of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are focused on five priority programs: a sustained self-sufficiency program for rice and corn, strengthening of production market linkage, an acceleration of livelihood program, aggressive assistance to organizational development of farmers, and assistance to agriculture-related priority programs of other government agencies. ;Crop production: The major crops produced in the municipality are lowland and upland rice and sugarcane. Other crops grown are corn, vegetables, root crops, and fruit trees. ;Fruits and vegetables production: In 2000, an area covering some 23.5 hectares was planted with various crops and fruit trees. These yielded an estimated 444 metric tons of assorted products. ;Livestock and poultry production: Livestock and poultry raising in the municipality are largely backyard family enterprises. Animals raised are generally for home consumption and an additional income source for the family. Total production of livestock and poultry in 1999 registered a head count of 7,907. Pigs raised both for human consumption or for breeding purposes are estimated at 1,675, while the equally popular poultry raising produced about 4,472 head. An estimated 1,013 head of cattle, 31 head of carabaos and 716 goats were also produced. Based on reports of the municipal Agricultural Officer, the total livestock and poultry production in the municipality is still below the sufficiency level for beef, pork meat and eggs.Local Economy  Carmona Cavite, Philippines =Industry= People's Technology Complex Industrialization in the '90s accounts for the rapid growth of Carmona's business community from an otherwise quaint agricultural town in the 1950s. Brought about by huge capital from the national government, the industrial complexes bolstered the increase of the municipality's revenues and the change in the people's lifestyle. There are eight existing industrial complexes in the towns. Its proximity to Manila and at the same time being the gateway to the Calabarzon area made Carmona a promising venue for business.Carmona Business Profile On the other hand, the local government has been very supportive of the investors. There are 114 factories in eight industrial parks/complexes to date. At present there are the eight industrial complexes strewn along the Governor's Drive, in a total of 419.31 hectares, making up 13.56% of the town's land area. Ranging from 9 to 100 hectares, these industrial estates are complete with amenities, secured, and in close coordination with the municipal government through the Carmona Business Club and other agencies. =Commercial and financial= One of the biggest commercial subdivisions in town is the Macaria Business Park in Barangay Mabuhay which houses Waltermart in its 13.13 hectare lot. Recently, fastfood chains and restaurants have been opened to compete for regular patronage at the Paseo de Carmona in Barangay Maduya. Moreover, numerous traders and retailers are housed in the bustling Carmona Public Market. The bulk of commercial activities come from wholesale/retail enterprises, which comprise a total of 619 establishments. There are also service-related establishments: businesses, food shops and amusement operators, with 35 banks and other lending institutions. Among the major banking institutions that cater to the financial needs of businesses in Carmona and neighboring towns are Bank of Philippine Islands (BPI), Metrobank, Banco de Oro (BDO), Chinatrust Bank, China Bank, RCBC, and Union Bank. Healthcare The Pagamutang Bayan ng Carmona ( and the Rural Health Unit (RHU) are government- owned and run healthcare facilities in the town. The main health center in the municipality is located in Barangay 4. A total of eleven barangay health centers or substations of the RHU are established in different barangays. In addition to the rural health units and the Pagamutang Bayan, there are also eleven private clinics operating in the municipality. Eleven clinics are privately owned and one clinic is under the supervision of government health workers.Social Sector  Carmona Cavite, Philippines Education The education sector in Carmona improved in many aspects of endeavor. In line with the local government's thrust of enhancing quality education, the Department of Education (DepEd), particularly the District of Carmona and Carmona National High School, with the full support of the local government unit, implemented various programs and projects that intensified the education sector in achieving its goals. As early as 1995, various programs for the improvement of quality education started with a vision of producing competitive students from both the elementary and secondary levels. Carmona posted a literacy rate of 89%. The local government started with the computerization of all schools. Each public school was given computer units and students were provided with computer lessons. This is in consonance with the belief that modern technology and equipment are considered factors in enhancing better education. To address the increasing number of enrollees and students, the LGU conceptualized the construction of 2-story buildings in different schools in Carmona. At present, the municipality has a substantial number of classrooms and teachers to meet the learning needs of the school age population. As of School Year 2005‚Äì2006, the municipality has 50 educational institutions, 28 of which are public schools while 17 are privately run. The public schools are categorized into 18 pre-schools, 9 elementary, 1 secondary, and 1 tertiary school. The private educational institutions are composed of 10 pre-schools, 7 elementary, 3 secondary/high school, and a computer college.Education ReferencesExternal links * Carmona Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * *Official website of Cavite *Official website of Carmonians * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] Category:Municipalities of Cavite ","title":"Carmona, Cavite"},{"id":"2016341","text":"Massy is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 14.7 kilometres (9.1 mi) from the center of Paris. Population Massy underwent rapid development within a short period of time, transforming from a large borough of 6,000 inhabitants in 1950 to a town exceeding 37,000 inhabitants in 1968. Since then, its population of around 40,000 has remained relatively stable. Its population is now going to grow again because of new constructions. The inhabitants of Massy are known as Massicois. Transport Massy is served by two interchange stations on Paris RER line B and RER line C: Massy - Verri√®res and Massy - Palaiseau. There is also a TGV station, called Massy TGV, which is adjacent to Massy - Palaiseau station and is one of only three specially-built TGV stations in the suburbs of Paris (the two others are at Disneyland Resort Paris and at Charles de Gaulle Airport). History The etymological origin of Massy is still very dubious. This name could result from the name of an owner of a villa of the Gallo-Roman time, original site of the village. Called Matius or Matheus, the name of his property then village would have been subjected to deformations due to language and the passing of time to become Massy. Located near the road between Paris and Chartres, the villa was undoubtedly built on a height (the Gaudon Mount) and formed the starting point of a human establishment. The argillaceous subsoil explains the formation of a clearing within the forest and the numerous stretches of water in the surrounding area. During the Middle Ages and until the end of the Ancien R√©gime, the lordly estates divided up the territory of the current commune, assigning a majority part to the ecclesiastical institutions and in particular the abbey of St-Germain-des- Pr√©s. In the 10th century, the line of the lords of Massy was established; their title of nobility was to become a barony (nowadays the Grimaldi-Monaco family). Before 1900, the history of the city was similar to that of the rural boroughs of √éle-de-France. After the Revolution, the town remained rural. The population followed an evolution identical to that of the rest of the region. It underwent the same wars, epidemics and rebellions. The Massicois practiced mainly agricultural trades (gardeners, vine growers), even if local arts and crafts were always present. The tile factory, abandoned after the Second World War, was the town's oldest industry. It is with the beginning of the 20th century that the face of Massy changes: from being a rural village, it transforms into a town increasing subjected to the attraction of Paris. Once with a population of just 1,400 people, nowadays, the town of Massy holds almost 40,000 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century, the development of railways supported the construction of industries. The first allotments were born at the beginning of the century. The city's urbanisation developed towards the districts of the Gravels and Villaine, where it was necessary to establish a school as early as 1927. It is the era of the ‚Äúsuburban house‚Äù. During the Second World War, the marshalling yard of Massy-Palaiseau was considered a strategic rail junction. The bombardments of these infrastructures caused 88 victims and material damage throughout the town. In the post-war period, the reconstruction and development of the parisian agglomeration and its suburbs metamorphosed the town's geography. The housing crisis provoked an outrage, thus the \\"castor\\" movement established some residences in the east of the city. The establishment of a housing scheme on 145 hectares of the communes of Massy-Antony caused the population of Massy to double. The creation of a 'Priority Construction Zone' in Villaine 10 years later was intended to even out the town's urbanisation. This abrupt development of the town also modified its social structure: rejuvenation of the population, arrival of foreigners, etc. During the 1960s and 1970s, questions are raised about rapid urban development: housing problems and shantytowns, lack of public resources, requalification of certain factory sites, delinquency, etc. To satisfy the needs for this new population, many new infrastructures were created such as schools, hospitals, sports centres, swimming pools, arts centres, nurseries and parks. The establishment of a TGV station in 1991 is an asset for the economic development of the city. Nowadays, certain amenities have an influence which exceeds the communal and departmental circles, in particular opera and theatre. (Author: Municipal archives of Massy). Administration Massy is divided into two cantons: The canton of Massy-Est contains 18,316 inhabitants; The canton of Massy-Ouest contains 19,396 inhabitants. Sports Massy has professional sports team in Rugby (Rugby Club Massy Essonne, playing Federal 1, third level of Rugby in France) and Handball (Massy Essonne HandBall, playin ProLigue, second level of Handball in France). Massy has one association football team in FC Massy 91. Massy also has major sports associations in climbing and swimming.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 19, 1997, to overwhelmingly positive reviews. In the series' sixth flashback episode, it is explained how Lisa got her saxophone. The episode was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss and was the first episode Jean wrote by himself, as all of his previous writing credits had been shared with Reiss. It was directed by Dominic Polcino and guest starred Fyvush Finkel, who appeared as himself portraying Krusty in a film. Plot Homer and Bart are watching television when they are interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. It lands in the middle of the street and is run over by traffic and stomped on by Nelson Muntz. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins. In a flashback to 1990, Bart goes to his first day of school, but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge that they need to nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster. On his way to purchase a new air conditioner, Homer discovers that a musical instrument is a way to encourage a gifted child, and subsequently sacrifices his air conditioner money to buy Lisa her first saxophone. In the present, Marge mentions that there is some money in the air conditioner account, so Homer decides to buy another saxophone for Lisa. Production This was the first episode for which Al Jean was credited as having written by himself. \\"Lisa's Sax\\" is the first episode that Al Jean had ever been credited as having written by himself. Before this episode, all of his writing credits had been shared with Mike Reiss. The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean, Reiss and David Stern, among others. According to Reiss, the final episode contained 80‚Äì90% of Jean's original script. It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show. \\"The Way We Was\\" was the first flashback episode and in it, Homer graduated from high school in 1974 and that made it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990. Jean conceived the idea for the All in the Family style opening while waiting to get tickets to the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it. The pastel drawing of Krusty was drawn entirely by Dominic Polcino, who revealed it was the only piece of original artwork created solely by him that was featured in an episode. He created the pastel drawing with this in mind. It was an easy episode for Polcino to direct due to the lack of crowds and being a \\"grounded episode\\". This is the last episode in which Doris Grau has a speaking role as Lunchlady Doris, although this episode aired nearly two years after her death. It would also mark the final time the character would speak until Season 18's \\"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\\" when she was voiced by Tress MacNeille. Cultural references While telling Bart and Lisa about 1990, Homer says, \\"Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with [...] crudely drawn filler material.\\" This is a reference to The Simpsonss debut as \\"bumpers\\" airing before and after commercials on The Tracey Ullman Show. The song \\"Those Were the Days\\" parodies the opening credits of the television show All in the Family. One of the people who run over the saxophone is a man on a tricycle, who promptly falls over. This is a reference to the show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. At the beginning of the flashback, the song \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\\" by Bobby McFerrin can be heard. In the flashback, Dr. Hibbert fashioned his hair and attire like Mr. T in The A-Team. Homer can be seen watching Twin Peaks and The Giant is then shown waltzing with the White Horse. In King Toot's music store, when Homer buys Lisa her first saxophone, there is a guitar in the background that is similar to Eddie Van Halen's \\"Frankenstrat\\" guitar. The photo beside Kent Brockman on the news has him modeled after the Coppertone Girl. At the end of the episode, Lisa performs a brief, cruder rendition of the hook of \\"Baker Street\\" by Gerry Rafferty on her new saxophone before the music segues into the original song. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Lisa's Sax\\" finished 51st in ratings for the week of October 13‚Äì19, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.2, equivalent to approximately 8.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following King of the Hill. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a terrific episode, full of amusing self- referential wit and it is especially nice to finally discover what it was that caused Bart to go down the path to the dark side.\\" Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, saying it is \\"not only very funny, but it's also loaded with Simpson heart.\\" A review of The Simpsons season 9 DVD release in The San Diego Union-Tribune highlighted \\"Lisa's Sax\\" along with \\"All Singing, All Dancing\\" and \\"Trash of the Titans\\" as some of the more memorable episodes of the series. Stephen Becker of The Dallas Morning News noted that season 9 \\"has a special affinity for Lisa\\", and highlighted this episode along with \\"Das Bus\\" and \\"Lisa the Simpson\\" in his review of the DVD. A segment of the episode where two schoolgirls chant the digits of pi while playing patty-cake is used by mathematicians Sarah J. Greenwald of Appalachian State University and Andrew Nestler of Santa Monica College in a website on the mathematics of The Simpsons.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality was named after General Mariano √Ålvarez, a native of the town of Noveleta, Cavite. With an area of just 11.40 square kilometers, it is the second most densely populated municipality in Cavite after Rosario. History General Mariano Alvarez was formerly a part of Carmona, Cavite. The province's third planned community was previously called Carmona Resettlement Project and was under the direct management of the People‚Äôs Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). The project started in March 1968 because of the need to clear the Quezon Memorial Park, Diliman, Quezon City of different shanties and other illegal constructions built on it. By 1974, the project lots became part of the full- fledged communities of poor and middle class residents coming from Quezon City, Manila, Makati and Para√±aque. Due to the popular clamor of the residents of the aforementioned resettlement areas towards the conversion of their locality into an independent municipality, the ten (10) Barangay Council of the communities of the then San Gabriel and San Jose, submitted resolution expressing their desire to the Sangguniang Bayan of Carmona which in turn favorably endorsed the idea through Resolutions No. 56-S-1978. By 1979, the idea soon began to speed up as the provincial deputy to the Interim Batasang Pambansa, Helena Benitez, and MP for Eastern Visayas and concurrent Minister of Local Government, Jose Ro√±o, pursued the separation of the growing communities, whose several of their residents were now working in the growing industrial factories in Carmona town and in other parts of the province, as well as in agriculture and small enterprises. The Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez came into existence upon the ratification by the majority votes cast in a plebiscite at Carmona and its duly constituted barangays within a period of 180 days after the approval of Batas Pambansa 75 and Parliamentary Bill No. 631 after which then President Ferdinand Marcos appointed the first set of local officials for the said town. Upon the effectivity of the specified legal acts converting Barangays San Jose and San Gabriel into the Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez, its proportional share in the obligation of funds, assets and other properties of Carmona was transferred to the newly created municipality upon the recommendation of the Commission of Audit, which was approved on June 30, 1980. The new municipality's first officials were officially inaugurated on March 14, 1981. The new town, for the next few years, was composed of the Resettlement areas of Barangays San Jose, San Gabriel and a portion of Cabilang Baybay. Barangay San Jose consisted of areas A and B while Barangay San Gabriel consisted of Areas C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. In 2006, the municipality celebrated its 25th anniversary with a line-up of activities participated in by the municipality‚Äôs residents. Gen. Mariano Alvarez also takes pride in being known as the ‚ÄúMushroom Capital of Cavite‚Äù because of the mushroom culture facilities in the town.

(\\"TK\\") Smith on guitars and lead vocals, Jim Nordstrom on bass and vocals, and Todd Nero on drums and vocals. For a time, the band also featured a young Trent Reznor on keyboards and lead vocals. Option 30's style was similar to that of Falco and early albums by The Police. The band performed at clubs in and around Northwestern and Central Pennsylvania, and Northern Ohio as often as three times a week while Nero and Reznor were attending Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. After Reznor departed, the band continued on as a power trio with Smith on lead vocals. At this point, the band began performing a number of additional original songs penned by Smith and Nordstrom. Option 30 broke up in 1986 Not long after Reznor left, he joined The Innocent then onto Exotic Birds and finally, forming his own band, Nine Inch Nails. Discography In 1985, a CD of original songs was released by the power trio titled, \\"Almost Live.\\" The CD included mostly live material recorded in Meadville and some additional studio recordings. Unauthorized CD In 1983, the band (with Reznor) recorded a number of demo tracks with local musician and engineer, John Trevethan, at his home studio. Soon after Reznor's departure, Nordstrom asked Trent to record vocals for some of his songs at a local engineer's studio (not Trevethan's studio). As a fan the local engineer was given the band's other recorded material. After Reznor became famous, the engineer thought there was a market for anything Reznor and in 1997 assembled a CD including tracks recorded at his studio, the previously recorded demo tracks from 1983, and a radio interview from 1984. The unauthorized CD was released in 1997 on the Shriek Records label. Despite his later career, Reznor had little songwriting input; all songs were written by Smith and Nordstrom, with the exception of \\"Ice House\\" (a cover of an Icehouse song), \\"Lies\\" (a cover of a song by The Thompson Twins), and \\"Der Kommissar\\" (a cover, with English lyrics, of a song by Falco). =Track listing= # \\"Ice House\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Edinboro radio interview\\" ‚Äì 1:17 # \\"Time & Chance\\" ‚Äì 3:23 # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 3:13 # \\"Abomination\\" ‚Äì 3:02 # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 1:50 # \\"Der Kommissar\\" ‚Äì 4:11 # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 4:30 # \\"Lies\\" ‚Äì 3:19 # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 2:54 # \\"Just Out Enough to Be In\\" ‚Äì 2:43 # \\"Equal Rights\\" ‚Äì 3:57 # \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" ‚Äì 3:09 # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 1:10 # \\"Pandora's Box\\" ‚Äì 4:02 Attempted reunion and unreleased material Jim Nordstrom made several attempts at reuniting the band to record more material, but none were successful due to scheduling conflicts.

A Democrat, among the offices in which he served was member of the Erie County Board of Supervisors (1914-1915), New York State Assembly (1915-1918), United States House of Representatives (1919-1938), and United States Senate (1938-1947). A native of Mount Morris, New York, Mead was raised in Buffalo. He attended the public schools of Buffalo and began working for railroads at age 12. He rose through the Switchmen's Union's ranks to become president of the Buffalo local. From 1911 to 1914 he was employed as an officer with the United States Capitol Police. While working in Washington, Mead attended courses at the Georgetown University Law Center. Mead began a political career in 1914 with election to Erie County's Board of Supervisors. He subsequently served in the state Assembly from 1915 to 1918. In 1918 he was election to the U.S. House, where he served from 1919 to 1938. In 1938 he was elected to the U.S. senate seat left vacant by the death of Royal S. Copeland. He served in the Senate until 1947. In 1946, he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor of New York. He was then appointed to the Federal Trade Commission, on which he served from 1949 to 1955. In retirement, Mead was a resident of Florida. He died in Lakeland on March 15, 1964. Mead was buried at Oakhill Cemetery in Clermont, Florida. Early life James M. Mead was born in Mount Morris, New York on December 27, 1885, a son of Thomas and Jane (Kelly) Mead. Mead moved to Buffalo with his family at the age of five. He attended Buffalo's grammar schools and began working at age 12. He was employed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad; his career included jobs as a water boy, lamp lighter, section hand, spike mauler, shop mechanic and switchman. Mead later worked for the Pullman Company as a mechanic on sleep car dynamos. He was subsequently employed as a switchman on the Erie Railroad, and was eventually elected president of the Switchmen's Union's Buffalo local. From 1911 to 1914 he was employed as an officer with the United States Capitol Police. Start of career Mead also continued his education during his railroad and police careers; he attended Buffalo's Caton School of Engineering and completed an engineering course of instruction at the Buffalo Institute of Technology. He also took courses at Canisius College and Catholic University. While working nights for the Capitol Police, Mead attended the Georgetown University Law Center during the day. As a well-known semiprofessional football and baseball player in the Buffalo area, Mead developed a following that aided his entry into politics. In 1913, Mead was a successful candidate for a seat on the Erie County, New York Board of Supervisors and he served in 1914. In 1914 he ran for the New York State Assembly. He won the Erie County 4th District seat and won reelection in 1916. Mead served in the sessions of 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918. In the Assembly, Mead won a reputation as a champion of worker's rights, including passage of a \\"full crew\\" law for freight trains, a law requiring workers to be paid every two weeks instead of every month, and an act mandating improved safety measures in train engine cabs. Among his successes were laws to improve the conditions of women and children in factories and enhancements to the state's worker's compensation laws. Mead's affability and power of persuasion marked him as an effective legislator despite the fact that he was a Democrat in a body controlled by Republicans. U.S. House In 1918, Mead defeated incumbent Republican congressman William Frederick Waldow for New York‚Äôs 42nd District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was reelected nine times, and served from 1919 to 1938. From 1931 to 1938, Mead served as chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads. In Congress, Mead was a strong advocate for worker's rights, and received credit for aiding the passage of several labor measures, including the Railway Labor Act, Railroad Retirement Act, and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Meade was the author of a law mandating a reduction in work hours for post office department employees to 44 hours per week, and later to 40 hours. While supplementing his education by taking college courses during his Congressional service, Meade was well-known for staying in good physical condition by trotting from campus to campus. At 6 feet 2 inches and 200 pounds, he maintained the athletic build of his youth, and was known as the House's best baseball and softball player. After 28 of his colleagues died during one session, Meade recognized the need for a Congressional gym and took the lead in organizing it and bringing it into operation. According to John W. McCormack, who served as Speaker of the House from 1961 to 1971, the House's Democratic leaders were grooming Mead to become Speaker. McCormack went on to say that the only reason he (McCormack) was placed on the path that enabled him to become majority leader and then Speaker was that Mead left the House when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. U.S. Senate In 1938, Mead defeated Republican Edward F. Corsi to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant after Royal S. Copeland died. He was re-elected in 1940, defeating Republican Congressman Bruce Barton. In the Senate, Mead succeeded to the chairmanship of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (the Truman Committee) after Truman was elected vice president in 1944. Under his leadership the committee continued Truman's effort to weed out wartime waste, corruption and inefficiency. The committee's investigations under Mead's leadership resulted in Representative Andrew J. May's imprisonment for bribery and an extended debate on whether Senator Theodore G. Bilbo would be permitted to take his seat after winning reelection in 1946. The committee uncovered evidence that the racist Bilbo had sanctioned violence against African American veterans who attempted to vote in Mississippi's 1946 elections. In addition, there was evidence that Bilbo had accepted bribes from defense contractors in exchange for actions on their behalf during the war. The issue was resolved when Bilbo's credentials were tabled so he could return to Mississippi and seek treatment for oral cancer, an illness which proved fatal. Later career Mead was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1942. He was the Democratic candidate for Governor of New York in 1946, losing to Republican incumbent Thomas Dewey. After Mead's defeat, he served on the Federal Trade Commission. Appointed in 1949, he became chairman six months later. He remained on the commission until 1955. From 1955 to 1956, he was the director of the Washington office of the New York Department of Commerce. Mead was also a New York delegate to the Democratic National Convention every four years from 1936 to 1952. Legacy In 1937, the Works Progress Administration built a Buffalo public library that was later named the James Mead Branch Library. Buffalo-area mail carriers recognized Meade's accomplishments on behalf of postal workers by naming their union local in his honor. Later life After retiring from New York's Department of Commerce, Mead moved to Florida. He settled in Clermont, where he owned and operated an orange grove. Retirement and death Mead died in Lakeland, Florida on March 15, 1964. He was buried at Oakhill Cemetery in Clermont. Family In 1915, Mead married Alice M. Dillon (1885-1964). They were the parents of a son, James Michael Mead Jr. (1918-1997).

Characteristics  A harp tuned to C-sharp major has all its pedals in the bottom position. Because all the strings are then pinched and shortened, this is the least resonant key for the instrument. Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D-flat major since it only contains five flats as opposed to C-sharp major's seven sharps. However, Johann Sebastian Bach chose C-sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in both books of The Well-Tempered Clavier, and Charles-Valentin Alkan chose C-sharp major for Etude Op. 35 No. 9 \\"Contrapunctus\\" in Twelve etudes in all the major keys, Op. 35.

Maurice Ravel selected C-sharp major as the tonic key of \\"Ondine\\" from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit. Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, Op. 17, in the key of C-sharp major.

The film was directed by Stephen Hopkins for Warner Bros. Pictures, Village Roadshow Pictures and Dark Castle Entertainment. The music for the film was scored by John Frizzell. Plot Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) and colleague Ben (Idris Elba) investigate claims of miracles. In Chile, they examine the corpse of a priest who remains in pristine condition despite being dead for 40 years. Eventually they discover that toxic waste helped preserve the body. In Louisiana, Katherine receives a call from a friend, Father Michael Costigan (Stephen Rea), who says that his photographs of her have developed burn marks that when assembled, form a sickle-like symbol \\"„Ñú\\", a possible warning from God, which she ignores. She meets Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey), a teacher from the nearby town of Haven, who asks Katherine to find out why Haven's river has turned red. The locals believe this is a biblical plague caused by a girl, Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), who they believe killed her older brother in the river. They travel to Haven, where Katherine sees the river is indeed entirely red. Katherine and Doug come across ruins of an old church, which Doug explains was destroyed one hundred years ago by several hurricanes, forcing the entire town to relocate. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses dead frogs seemingly fall from the sky. Doug invites them to spend the night at his house, where he reveals he comes from a long line of only children. That night, their dinner becomes rotted with flies instantly. Katherine and Ben get a call asking them to come to a nearby farm, where they find that the cows are dying of some unknown disease. Ben begins to question whether the events could actually have biblical causes, but Katherine remains unconvinced. The owner of the farm tells them that the McConnell family would be visited by people who appeared to be Satan worshippers, and that he possibly saw them making a sacrifice of some kind. Later that evening, Katherine tells Doug why she left the church; five years ago, she was an ordained minister. While doing missionary work in the Sudan with her husband and daughter, the locals sacrificed her family, believing they caused a drought. Katherine then has intense dreams that she and Doug have sex. Katherine goes to talk to Loren. Loren remains silent the whole time. Katherine notices that her leg is soaked in menstrual blood. Katherine helps clean her up and has a vision of Loren turning the river red. Loren's mother appears, asking if Katherine is there to kill Loren. Before she can explain, Loren attacks her and Katherine runs away. Ben and Katherine examine Loren's brother's body, finding the sickle-like symbol branded into his lower back. Test results prove the river contains human blood. The citizens, meanwhile, are shaving their children's heads, due to an outbreak of lice. Ben and Doug try to get the mayor to evacuate the town, but he and his staff are killed with boils. A posse gathers to kill Loren to try to stop the plagues. Katherine calls Father Costigan, who explains that he has researched a satanic cult which sacrifices every second-born child once they reach puberty to create a \\"perfect child with the eyes of the Devil\\" to bring them power. He believes that Loren is the devil child. He also states that an angel, who cannot be harmed by the cult, will destroy them. He insists that Katherine is the angel, as the term is sometimes used to mean servants of God. At that moment, a supernatural force burns Costigan's room, killing him. Katherine returns to the McConnell house, where she finds the cult's sacrificial chamber. There, Loren's mother says that Loren is \\"his servant\\" now, then kills herself. Outside, Katherine finds locusts everywhere. As the townspeople arrive, with Ben and Doug in tow trying to stop them, Loren causes the locusts to kill the posse. Doug runs away and falls in the river; Katherine locks herself in the house; Ben hides in a crypt, where he discovers skeletons and bodies of sacrificed children. He calls Katherine when Loren appears outside. Katherine finds Ben dead. She confronts Loren as darkness falls and fiery hail and thunder rains from the sky. Katherine is about to kill Loren, when suddenly she says something that Katherine told her own daughter in Sudan. Katherine asks how she can tell what is real. Loren answers \\"faith,\\" and shows her a vision of the truth. The cult, which actually encompasses the entire town and Doug, are shown trying to kill Loren since she has reached puberty. Loren escaped and her brother Brody stabbed her, but her wound miraculously healed, and Brody died. Katherine realizes that Loren is the angel God sent. She also sees that Doug killed Ben. The townsfolk surround them as Doug tells her that only an ordained servant of God like Katherine can kill Loren. He reveals that his family recruited the entire town into the satanic cult, believing that God had abandoned them because of the natural disasters. He invited Katherine to investigate the plagues because they hoped she would join them, since she had turned her back on God. Katherine refuses. A sudden fire then rains down on the town from God himself, killing the satanists, who all happened to be first born; all coming from a line of only children. Doug grabs Katherine as he is being lifted off the ground and killed, with Katherine being spared. As they drive away, Loren reveals that Katherine is pregnant. Katherine realizes that the dreams she had of sex with Doug was actually Doug having drugged and raped her. Since this is her second child, Katherine realizes that her unborn son, fathered by Doug, is the prophesied demonic child.

It's schlocky, spiritually shallow, and scare-free.\\" Controversy Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe, the Mayor of Concepci√≥n, Chile, formally objected to the producers of the film over its portrayal of the city in the opening scene. She pointed out that rather than being the dirty underdeveloped tropical city as shown in the movie, Concepci√≥n is an industrialized city with many universities and was surprised that such inadequate research of the setting had been carried out for a high budget movie.

She questions the boundaries of philosophy, while insisting upon philosophy's importance (for example, in \\"Ants and Women\\"). She is critical of professional philosophers' neglectful attitude to science, and argues that disputes within sciences are often epistemological (that is, properly philosophical). In Hipparchia's Choice (1989) she questions philosophy's pretensions to being a unique practice which achieves a pure clarity: philosophy is inevitably shaped by language, metaphor, and power relations. According to Le D≈ìuff feminists make a special contribution. Their critique of gender categories in philosophy, science, and the humanities is empirical, philosophical, political, and interdisciplinary. Feminists see clearly how discourses are elevated to the status of 'philosophical' by a process in which social power is involved.Frazer 2005. p. 508.

He has been inducted into four halls of fame for his achievements in wrestling. Wisniski is the father of professional wrestler Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine. He held numerous regional titles, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. He had long running rivalries with Bobo Brazil, Pat O'Connor, Buddy Rogers, Antonio Rocca, Lou Thesz, Harley Race, The Sheik, Wahoo McDaniel, Fritz von Erich, Bruno Sammartino, Johnny Powers, Antonio Inoki and Jack & Jerry Brisco. He alternated between being a villain and a hero (babyface) during the Golden Era in the 1940s through 1960s of wrestling. In 1975, he was injured in a plane crash; he suffered a broken back and was forced to retire from wrestling. He worked briefly as a manager before retiring altogether. He suffered from several health problems during his retirement, which worsened considerably after a fall in 2000. He died the following year. Professional wrestling career Valentine vs. Dory Funk Jr. in 1973 Valentine debuted as a professional wrestler in 1947, wrestling Karl Nowena in Buenos Aires. In order to make the matches as believable as possible Valentine insisted the men he faced in the ring hit him as hard as possible. From that he earned a strong reputation as being a very tough man. On New Year's Day, 1950, Buddy Rogers defeated Valentine in the finals of a United States title tournament. He also competed in the NWA's Capitol Wrestling territory. Jerry Graham, who was a co- holder of the Northeast version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship, selected Valentine in November 1959 to take over the title from Graham's injured partner. They were beaten for the title belts the following April, but Valentine took on a new partner, Buddy Rogers, to regain the championship by defeating The Fabulous Kangaroos on November 19, 1960. Wisniski's rivalry with the Kangaroos continued, as the Kangaroos regained the belts in a rematch one week later. Valentine went over one year without holding a championship before teaming with a new partner, this time Bob Ellis, to defeat the Kangaroos and take back the championship. Valentine & Ellis lost the belts to Buddy Rogers & Handsome Johnny Barend in a match where Arnold Skoaland subbed for Ellis, but the belts were still up, on Washington, DC TV. Rogers & Barend then defeated the real team of Valentine & Ellis 2 pins to 1 in a main event at Madison Square Garden. In Toronto, Valentine and three different partners won the International Tag Team title during 1963. Valentine left the territory without dropping the title. He wrestled in Japan in the mid-1960s and had a series of matches against Antonio Inoki. Those matches are regarded as the bouts that helped build Inoki into an elite wrestler in Japan, as Valentine was the highest-profile foreign wrestler Inoki had ever faced at the time. Valentine put over Inoki in the matches, dropping the Toronto version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship to him catapulting Inoki's career in the process. Valentine also continued to wrestle in the former Capitol Wrestling territory, which had since been renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation. While there, he had one last reign with what was then known as the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, as he teamed with Tony Parisi to hold the belts for seven months in 1966. Valentine later turned on Parisi, however. This ignited a brief feud with Bruno Sammartino, who was billed as Parisi's cousin. Because Valentine was also wrestling in Texas at the same time, he got only sporadic main event matches against Sammartino during this feud. Valentine then moved on to the Florida territory, where he won the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship three times. In Georgia, he defeated Tim Woods for the NWA Georgia Heavyweight title, on May 10, 1968, and repeated his win in a match against Doug Gilbert (not to be confused with the Doug Gilbert who was not yet born) to retake the title. In Missouri, Valentine competed for the Missouri Heavyweight Championship in a tournament to determine the inaugural champion. He defeated Baron von Raschke before withdrawing from the tournament due to focus his efforts on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Harley Race won the tournament and the title belt, Valentine defeated him to win the championship on January 19, 1973. He dropped the belt to Terry Funk the following month. Because Funk used a chair as a weapon in front of the referee, fans demanded a rematch. Valentine was unable to compete due to heart problems, however, so Gene Kiniski took his place and won the belt from Funk. In October 1972, Valentine defeated Jacques Rougeau for the International Heavyweight Championship, but was stripped of the title in January 1973, after he no-showed the rematch. In the National Wrestling Federation, Valentine defeated Johnny Powers for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship on September 1, 1972. Powers beat Valentine for the title in October, but Valentine won the title again from Abdullah the Butcher on October 19. He was stripped of the title following a match with Johnny Powers. On November 23, he captured the title from Powers, but lost it again in January. In the Japan Wrestling Association, Valentine won the International Tag Team title on February 22, 1973, and then the United National Heavyweight Championship on March 2. He lost the Tag title on March 6, and the United Heavyweight title on March 8. Back in the National Wrestling Federation, in August 1973, Valentine beat Jacques Rougeau, Sr. to win the North American Heavyweight Championship. He lost it to Johnny Powers in late 1973. In Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Valentine was awarded the Mid Atlantic Heavyweight Championship in January 1974, after Jerry Brisco left to work in Japan. Bearcat Wright defeated Valentine in a boxing match to win the title on May 13, 1974. He won the championship from Sonny King on November 4, and won the United States Heavyweight Championship on July 4, 1975. After Valentine was paralyzed in a plane crash, he remained active in professional wrestling as a manager in Paul Boesch's Texas-based promotion. From his wheelchair, Valentine managed Dale Hey, who competed as Dale Valentine in a storyline that saw the two promoted as brothers. The storyline did not last long, however. Personal life Valentine was originally from Maple Valley, Washington. He is said to have come from a dysfunctional family. He was a devout Christian for many years. He was married in the early 1950s and the marriage lasted 20 years until they divorced. He was later married to a woman named Sharon, who worked across the street from his apartment in the mid 1970s when they met. She later visited John as he was recovering in hospital from his 1975 plane crash. Some time later, the relationship ended as he didn't want her to see him in his condition. Years later, while on braces and crutches, he managed to drive around her neighbourhood for hours until he found her house. As he slowly walked to the front door, Sharon's daughter announced to Sharon that Johnny Valentine was in front of their home. Sharon, having been ill, refused to go to the door and hid. Valentine insisted he wouldn't leave until he saw her. When she finally came to the door, he asked her to marry him and she accepted. Following John's death, Sharon planned to write a book titled A Never Ending Love Story of a Wrestler and His Wife about their life together. He also had a son from a long ago previous relationship, Greg Valentine, who has wrestled professionally since 1970 and is best known as Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine. Ric Flair, who wrestled with Wisniski, has described him as a quiet person who kept to himself. He was also known for making his demands clear to employers and not backing down, and many stories continue to circulate about practical jokes, or ribs, that he played on his fellow wrestlers. On October 4, 1975, Valentine was in a private airplane (a twin-engined Cessna 310) with Ric Flair, David Crockett, Bob Bruggers, and Tim Woods. Because of the weight of the passengers, the pilot realized that he could not take off without reducing the amount of fuel the plane was carrying. Part way through the flight, the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed near Wilmington, North Carolina. The crash broke Flair's back, Bob Bruggers, Wisniski, and pilot Michael Farkus also broke their backs. A bone fragment became embedded in his spinal column, paralyzing him for life and forcing him to have a clamp implanted to hold the bones in his back together. Farkus died a year later having never awakened from a coma. Crockett and Woods suffered less serious injury. In August 2000, Valentine fell from his front porch, and had a number of injuries and complications. These included a fractured back, pneumonia, staph infection, collapsed lungs and kidney failure. Due to his many injuries he slipped into a coma. At one point he came out of it while his wife was singing to him. He began singing himself but fell back into the coma. His wife had purchased medical insurance through a health maintenance organization (HMO), but the organization was unwilling to pay for Wisniski's extended stay in the hospital. As a result, Lou Thesz's wife convinced the Cauliflower Alley Club to help contribute to Wisniski's medical bills. Those medical bills reached close to a million dollars. Valentine has been recognized for his wrestling career by several sources. Shortly after his death, he was named the 2001 recipient of Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Stanley Weston Award, a recognition given for lifetime achievement in professional wrestling. He has also been inducted into several halls of fame. He was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he joined the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame the following year. Valentine died peacefully in River Oaks, Texas on April 24, 2001. He was 72. His wife Sharon kept his ashes in her bedroom. She died in 2013.

Ordinary Affects. Duke University Press, 2007. . P.102 An event consists of a group of supposed shoppers who congregate at a large superstore (usually a Wal-Mart, Asda, or Sainsbury's) and slowly push empty shopping carts silently through store aisles. Participants will not purchase anything and seek to form a lengthy chain of non-shoppers, continually weaving and \\"whirling\\" through a maze of store aisles for up to an hour at a time. Participants describe their actions as \\"a collective reclamation of space that is otherwise only used for buying and selling\\". Whirl-Marters seek to mimic and mock what they perceive as the absurdity of the shopping process. Origins The activity was founded by the group \\"Breathing Planet Troupe\\" at a Wal-Mart store in Troy, New York, US on April 1, 2001. The group was seeking to respond to an article from AdBusters magazine that called for foolish activities in conjunction with April Fool's Day. Since that time, Whirl-Mart activities have spread to many other communities around the world, including Texas, Iowa, Arizona, and Pennsylvania in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It is often \\"celebrated\\" at noon on the first Saturday or Sunday of the month. Whirl- Marters are often very loosely organized, describing themselves as open to anyone wishing to show up and participate. In addition to being \\"just darned fun\\", the activity provides a legal outlet for would-be protesters to address \\"cathedral(s) of consumption\\" like Wal-Mart. Consequently, experienced Whirl- Marters (when confronted by security or store management) do not admit to being protestors and instead maintain that they are engaged in a peaceful \\"consumption awareness ritual\\". Whirl-Marters do not aim to block store aisles or interfere with legitimate shoppers, and typically will not speak unless addressed. Their aim is to create a non-disruptive, peaceful demonstration of how ridiculous they see Western consumerism to be. Participants are non- confrontational in seeking to make themselves silent examples rather than active propagandists. Some variations of the Whirl-Mart protest involve filling carts but then simply abandoning them or, when checking out, claiming to have forgotten the money to purchase the items in the overflowing cart, leaving said cart for the employees to clean up. Confrontations Participants claim they can generally talk their way out of being evicted from the store's corporate property (though the involvement of law enforcement officials in forcibly removing Whirl-Marters is not unheard of). When employees approach, Whirl-Mart participants generally scatter to various store aisles, forcing management or security to confront them individually. Participants will very rarely admit to or even address the topic of non- violent protest of commercialism or materialism, preferring to present themselves as would-be shoppers who are \\"still looking for something to buy\\" after spending up to an hour wandering aimlessly through a warehouse-sized superstore. Whirl-Marters often wear an identifying shirt or smock; in most jurisdictions it is not legally considered soliciting to wear a garment advertising a product, service, or cause. Some participants have attempted to document their activities with cameras or video recorders. The film or tape from these are often seized by store authorities. A few websites have video documenting Whirl-Mart events; however, in general, superstores do not permit cameras or video recorders on their premises--excluding security cameras used by the corporation itself.

It is the primary terminal for the Far Rockaway, Hempstead, and West Hempstead Branches. The terminal is located in the City Terminal Zone, the LIRR's Zone 1, and thus part of the CityTicket program.  History  The station was originally named Brooklyn in 1852, twenty years after the line was established as the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad, and wasn't originally a terminus. The original terminus was South Ferry. When LIRR subsidiary New York and Jamaica Railroad built a new line between Hunter's Point and Jamaica in 1861, the main line was relocated there, and the line was abandoned west of East New York, in compliance with Brooklyn's ban on steam railroads. West of East New York, the tracks were taken over by horse car lines. The Brooklyn station designation was replaced by the Flatbush Avenue station on July 2, 1877. That same summer local Atlantic Avenue rapid transit trains began to stop there on August 13. The old depot was renovated between July‚ÄìAugust 1878, when it began serving the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad. It was rebuilt again in June 1880. The headquarters for the Long Island Express Company was installed there in 1882, and gave the station a series of tracks that would later be known as the \\"EX Yard.\\" In 1888, the Union Elevated Railway built an elevated railway line and station that connected to the LIRR station, which was better known as the Atlantic Avenue (BMT Fifth Avenue Line). The Union Elevated eventually became part of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation. Further rebuilding took place again in 1893. Between 1904 and 1906, the Carlton Avenue Freight Yards were replaced by the Vanderbilt Avenue Freight Yards. This was just a portion of a major improvement project that included the complete reconstruction of the station. The second depot opened on April 1, 1907 with the depot at street level and the tracks installed underground. The station had a lobby that was larger than most LIRR stations, and contained subway type entrances to the tracks. It also served as a post office building until 1925, and contained a baggage depot, express buildings, some meat houses which were inherited from the previous version of the station, and a merchandise terminal for \\"less than carload freight\\" added on in 1908. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company built a subway line called the Eastern Parkway Line and a station on Atlantic Avenue, that connected to the station on May 1, 1908. The BMT also built two more subway lines on Pacific Street along the Fourth Avenue Line on June 22, 1915, and Atlantic Avenue along the Brighton Line on August 1, 1920. The connection to the BMT Fifth Avenue Line was lost on May 31, 1940.Ministry of Travel: The New LIRR Brooklyn Terminal; Forgotten New York Interior of the station, c. 1893 The station was refurbished and the exterior was sandblasted in the early 1940s. The decline of rail service after World War II led to the station's gradual demise, however. Track #1 was out of service on April 10, 1959. Former express tracks numbers 9-14 (\\"EX\\" Yard) were taken out of service on March 3, 1971. At some point, the express buildings became a parking garage. Local businesses were still allowed to utilize the station, such as a barber shop, restaurants, candy stores, a snack bar, a podiatrist's office, a dental office, a beauty school, and even a row of telephone booths. Those businesses were gone by 1978. The tracks that were originally numbered from south to north were renumbered from north to south on July 1, 1978. Despite efforts to repaint the lobby in the early-1980s, random vandalism plagued the station interior causing water damage that was so severe, the street level depot was closed in 1988, and portions were razed during the 1990s. On January 5, 2010, a new entry pavilion, designed by di Domenico + Partners, opened, providing improved connections between the LIRR, subways, and buses. In March 2010, the station was renamed Atlantic Terminal after a six-year reconstruction project, during which trains continued to operate. In 2014, the LIRR announced that service from Babylon and Hicksville will go directly to Atlantic Terminal during New York Islanders games at Barclays Center. Passengers would normally have to transfer at Jamaica to go to Babylon or Hicksville. However, in preparation for East Side Access project, most service to Atlantic Terminal will be provided by a high- frequency shuttle service to and from Jamaica. =Accident= During the morning rush hour of January 4, 2017, a train overran the bumper block at the end of track 6, injuring 103, none seriously. There were 650 passengers on the train, which had originated from Far Rockaway. The incident was compared to a September 2016 train crash at Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, wherein a train also overran a bumper block. The accident occurred at about 8:20 a.m. Two carriages of the six-carriage electric multiple unit involved were severely damaged when it collided with the buffer stop at a speed of . The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Railway Administration opened investigations into the accident. Station layout The LIRR terminal, one floor below the ground level, has three high-level island platforms adjacent to six tracks. Platform A is ten cars long, but the two easternmost cars on Track 1 are not accessible due to a large gap between the train and the platform. Platform B is eight cars long. Platform C is six cars long, but Track 6 only has enough space for four cars to meet the platform as it is adjacent to the northbound local platform of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line. Subway and bus connections Atlantic Terminal is connected to the New York City Subway's Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center complex, which is served by the . Buses serving outside the complex include B41, B45, B63, B65, B67, and B103. Nearby points of interest The rail terminal is adjacent to and below the Atlantic Terminal mall and near the Barclays Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, as well as Brooklyn Technical High School. The massive Pacific Park residential, commercial and sports complex, which includes Barclays Center, is being built near the station and above its yard tracks.

Berry's advocacy of the right of the small number of settlers to remain in Newfoundland, which was opposed by the British Committee for Trade and Plantations, was an important factor in determining the future course of European settlement in Newfoundland.

Sir John in 1684 erected a mural monument in Molland Church, which survives, which relates the injustices suffered by his father in this regard. Daniel's eldest two sons, thus deprived of their prospective patrimony, sought a career at sea, as was common for West-Country youths seeking their fortunes. The Berry family had been established from the reign of King Edward I (1272‚Äì1307)Risdon, Tristram, Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, p.347 near the north coast of Devon as lords of the manor of Nerbert or Narbor, which manor took their name and became known as Berry Narbor, today known as Berrynarbor.

Daniel Berry (1609‚Äì1654) In Molland Church, Devon, exists a mural monument erected in 1684 by Sir John Berry to his father Rev. Daniel Berry (1609‚Äì1654). It is inscribed thus: Under this monument lieth the body of Daniel Berry, B of D sometime minister of this church and that of the parish of Knowstone wherein he was born, who for his zeal in the support of the Church of England and loyalty to that martyr'd King Charles I was first sequestrated by the then rebels and ever after persecuted 'till he died, being the 18th day of Mar. 1653/4 and of his age 45, leaving behind him 7 sons, Robert, John, Daniel, Nathaniel, Anthony, Philip and Thomas, and two daughters Elizabeth and Anne, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of John Moore of Moorehays, Esq., who died 13 Octob. 1663, and lieth here likewise interred. The second of their sons, who received the honour of knighthood from his present Majesty K. Ch.2 for his long and many good services at sea, honouring the memory of all orthodox and loyal men of the late times and out of a pious regard of his father's sufferings, erected this monument, 17 day of Jul. AD 1684\\" Marriage Rebecca Ventris (d.1696), wife of Admiral Sir John Berry, portrait by Michael Dahl, matching pair with his portrait of her husband Berry married Rebecca Ventris (d.1696), of the Ventris family of Granhams, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, as identified from the arms of Ventris shown on her monument in Stepney Church, London.Daniel Lysons, The Environs of London, Volume 3: County of Middlesex: Stepney, 1795 The Heralds' Visitation of Cambridgeshire gives only a short pedigree of the Ventris family ending before Rebecca's birth, but gives the family's arms as: Azure, a dolphin between two bendlets wavy an annulet argent. She may have been a sister of Sir Peyton Ventris (1645‚Äì1691), eldest surviving son of Edward Ventris (d.1649), barrister. Her portrait was painted by Michael Dahl to form a pair with that of her husband.Generally believed to be portrait of Lady Berry, but stated by \\"Philip Mould Historical Portraits Picture Archive\\" to represent one of Sir John Berry's two sisters Elizabeth or Anne (as listed in John Prince's biography), due to the sitter being deemed \\"middle aged\\" and therefore too old to be the wife whom Sir John suggested in a 1689 codicil to his will might bear more children The marriage was without progeny. Rebecca married secondly Thomas Elton of Stratford Bow, London. Her mural monument exists on the east wall of the chancel of St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, and displays an heraldic escutcheon showing the arms of Elton (Paly of six, on a bend three mullets) impaling Ventris. It is inscribed with the following verse recorded by Daniel Lysons in 1795:Daniel Lysons,1795' 'Stepney', The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex (1795), pp. 418‚Äì488.

So she was dress'd whose humble life, Was free from pride was free from strife, Free from all envious brawls and jars, Of human life the civil wars, These ne'er disturb'd her peaceful mind, Which still was gentle still was kind. Her very looks her garb her mien, Disclos'd the humble soul within. Trace her through every scene of life, View her as widow virgin wife, Still the same humble she appears, The same in youth the same in years, The same in low and high estate, Ne'er vex'd with this ne'er mov'd with that. Go ladies now and if you'd be As fair as great and good as she, Go learn of her humility.\\" Monument at Stepney Mural monument to Sir John Berry, St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, London Bust of Admiral Sir John Berry, detail from his mural monument in Church of St Dunstan, Stepney A mural monument to Sir John Berry exists in St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, London, on the north wall, which he ordered to be erected at a cost of no less than ¬£150. Prince described the monument thus:Quoted by Prince, Worthies of Devon, p.73, also by Daniel Lysons, The Environs of London, Vol.3, Middlesex, Stepney, 1795 \\"It is all of white marble of about 10 foot in height and 5 in breadth finely polished.

Over his head are the arms of his family, underneath on a table of white marble is the following epitaph in black letters:Corrected as per existing monument > Ne id nescias lector D(ominus) Joannes Berry Devoniensis dignitate Equestri > clarus mari non tantum imperator de rege et patria quod et Barbari norunt > bene meritus magnam ob res fortiter gestas adeptus gloriam Famae satur post > multas reportatas victorias cum ab aliis vinci non potuit Fatis cessit 14 > Febr 16891689 per monument, Prince states in error 1691 baptizatus 7 Jan > 1635\\" (\\"Lest thou should not know, O reader, the famed Sir John Berry of > Devon, with dignity of a knight, not just ruler of the sea (as well know too > the Barbaries) having gained from King and Country well-deserved great glory > on account of matters happily conducted, satiated with the glory of fame, > after many victories brought home, as with others, was not able to defeat > the Fates.
