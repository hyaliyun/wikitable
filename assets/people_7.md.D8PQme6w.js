It stars Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Heather Graham, Carol Kane, Richard Masur, Michael Manasseri and Nina Siemaszko. The film was in production in late 1987. It was released on July 6, 1988, in the United States and grossed over $20 million at the North American box office. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Plot Southern California teenager Les Anderson (Corey Haim) tries to get his driver's license in order to impress his crush, Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham). He fails the knowledge portion of the exam, but inadvertently causes a computer surge. Les' failing marks are thought to be irretrievable, but the Department of Motor Vehicles lets him pass the exam after comparing him to his twin sister's high marks. He eventually passes the road test, but his real test scores are finally retrieved and his license is revoked. Les tries concealing the truth from his parents, but his mother finds out the truth and grounds him for two weeks. Les made plans to drive his grandfather's prized 1972 Cadillac Sedan de Ville prior and decides to sneak away anyway for a joyride with Mercedes. Mercedes and Les get drunk and accidentally cave in the roof of the car after dancing on it. Mercedes passes out; Les panics and goes to his best friend Dean's (Corey Feldman) house to have him fix the dent in the car's hood. Dean persuades Les to continue the joyride along with their friend Charles (Michael Manasseri), but are unaware Les still does not have his license. The three put Mercedes in the trunk of the car and continue their night on the town, causing even more damage to the Cadillac. Meanwhile, Les' pregnant mother wakes up her husband late in the night announcing she is in labor. The next day, Les drops off Charles and Dean at their homes. Mercedes wakes up and believes that the night prior was a dream. Les drops her off at her house, where they share a kiss. Les gets in trouble with his father after returning home with the completely damaged Cadillac. Les' mother is still in labor, but the car is unable to be put in drive, so he drives his family to the hospital in reverse. Les' mother is taken into the hospital, but a crane fails outside and a falling steel girder crushes the Cadillac, much to the shock of Les and his father. The family tries to explain the state of the Cadillac to Les' grandfather, but Les' grandfather laughs it off as he reveals he has severely damaged Les' father's own car, a BMW, in an accident. Les' father gives the BMW to him and jokingly tells him to take good care of it. Although Les thanks his father, he has changed his mind and doesn't want it anymore. Mercedes pulls up in a white Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet and picks up Les, who gets in the driver's seat and drives away with her without his license.

His real name was Kunito Higuchi. Biography A native of what is now part of Iida city in Nagano prefecture, Hinatsu graduated from Waseda University, and was later a professor of English literature at Waseda. He was influenced by the works of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe, and the Japanese writers Yukio Mishima and Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. His specialty was the translation of romantic and gothic poetry from English into Japanese. Always in poor health, and a fervent Roman Catholic, he always had an icon of the Virgin Mary in his room. In 1915 Hinatsu founded the magazine Shijin (Poets) with Daigaku Horiguchi and Yaso Saij≈ç. In 1917, Hinatsu published the first anthology of his own works, Tenshin no sho, which combined elements from both genre into what he described as ‚Äúgothic romanticism‚Äù. Using complex symbolism, his works were a distinct contrast from the realistic poetry then in vogue. His critical study, Meiji Taisho shi shi (History of Poetry in the Meiji and Taisho eras, 1929) was the first scholarly history of modern Japanese poetry, and was appointed a professor at the Waseda University Department of Literature in 1931. He resigned in 1935, but after receiving his doctorate in literature, returned to Waseda University as a professor in 1939. In 1949, he revised his History of Poetry in the Meiji and Taisho eras, expanding it into three volumes, which were awarded the 1st Yomiuri Prize in 1950. In 1952, Hinatsu accepted a post as professor of English literature at Aoyama Gakuin University; however, he suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1956, and returned to his native Iida. In 1961, he returned to Tokyo and his post at Aoyama Gakuin University, where he remained until his death in 1971. In 1986, the Hinatsu K≈çnosuke Memorial Building was opened in his honor at the Iida Municipal Museum in Iida, Nagano.

Œø Virginis is a G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G8 IIIa CN-1Ba1CH1. This indicates that it is a Barium star. Typically Barium stars are close binaries with a white dwarf companion, but no companion has been detected for Œø Virginis.

It is located south-east of the CBD, and contains the Brisbane Cricket Ground ('the Gabba') and the Princess Alexandra Hospital. It is crossed by several major roads including the Pacific Motorway. The suburb was once home to a large tram depot. Toponymy Experts are divided regarding the Aboriginal meaning of the name, preferring either 'whirling waters' (woolloon and capemm) or 'fight talk place' (woolloon and gabba).Our Brisbane History Because the area was low-lying and swampy, it was known as the One Mile Swamp. Although this name appears to be unofficial, it was in common use until the early 1890s. History left The suburb has a significant link to the history of transport in Brisbane. Between 1884 and 1969, the main railway locomotive depot for lines south of the Brisbane River was beside Stanley St. It was reached via a line that ran beside Stanley St, then crossing it, Logan Road and Ipswich Road to the main line at Dutton Park. By the 1960s, services from the depot were causing significant delays to traffic as they crossed these three major roads. The suburb was served by horse-drawn trams from 1885 to 1897, which were replaced by electric trams, which in turn ceased operation on 13 April 1969. All but one of Brisbane's trolleybus routes traversed the suburb, from 1953 to 1969. The Woolloongabba Fiveways (the intersection of Stanley Street, Main Street, Logan Road and Ipswich Road) was a complex junction with tram and railway lines, and tram and trolleybus overhead. Trams were controlled by a signalman, who operated the points (or switches) from a signal cabin near the eastern side of the junction. Trains were escorted across the junction by a flagman. Curiously, Queensland Railways always referred to the branch line as the Wooloongabba Branch, spelled with only one 'l'.\\"The Wooloongabba Branch\\" Milne, Rod Australian Railway History, August 2004 pp283-301 Tram No 499 ready to leave the Ipswich Road Depot, 1969 From 1927 until 1969, the largest of the Brisbane City Council's tram depots was on Ipswich Road between Cornwall Street and Tottenham Street (), opposite the Princess Alexandra Hospital, now the site of the Buranda Village shopping centre. This tram depot was also used by the council's buses. Brisbane Christian Spiritual Alliance Church (former), 2020 On 9 April 1938 the foundation stone of the Brisbane Spiritual Alliance Church was laid at 208 Logan Road (). It was dedicated to the memory of George Coxon and his wife Mary who bequeathed two blocks of land and ¬£2000 to the Church which they had established in 1924 following a split with another spiritualist church, after which they met in a building made of galvanised iron in Buranda. The architect was E. P. Trewern. The church was opened on Sunday 10 July 1938. A window in the western wall memorialised George Coxon. The church was still operating in 1990, but, as at 2020, is used as commercial premises.

History and profile The magazine was created by Clem Compton-Smith and his business partner, Margaret Smeeth, in 1975, with the financial backing of Labatt's. They and a tiny staff operated out of the manse of a church in Mississauga, Ontario. Canadian Living began as a half-million circulation title sold exclusively through supermarkets; the gimmick was a split run that enabled the magazine to devote a full page in each issue to each supermarket chain that carried it. The first issue appeared in December, 1975, and sold for 25 cents. The cover showed a male and a female hand about to snap a wishbone; the female hand belonged to Smeeth (billed in the magazine as editor Margaret Kelly), who was at the photo session and was not impressed by the hand of the female model who had been hired for the occasion. Compton-Smith's vision was of a Canadian-centric, general-interest magazine that would appeal to men and to women. To that end, along with the fashion and cooking sections that later became its mainstay, Canadian Living offered travel articles, wine- making tips and a woodworking column. While the third issue was at press, Labatt's acquired ownership of the magazine. A new publisher, Ken Larone, was parachuted in to replace Compton-Smith, who remained on staff until late 1976. The magazine was subsequently acquired by Telemedia, which also owned a French language counterpart, Coup de pouce. Canadian Living was acquired by Transcontinental in 2000. In 2014, the magazines were sold to the TVA Group subsidiary of Quebecor Media. The magazine has also produced television series for broadcast on Canadian television channels such as Slice, HGTV, Food Network, and CBC Television. Canadian Living is partnered with the Fast-moving consumer goods awards program Best New Product Awards and writes an annual feature on the winners of each year. The circulation of Canadian Living in 2018 was 340,597 copies with a readership of 3,087,00 readers. In 2019, a marketing firm took a survey of 17,000 Canadian shoppers, and Canadian Living was voted as the \\"most trusted\\" magazine in Canada.

He specializes in the goblet-shaped hand drum called djembe. He is also the founder of the Tam Tam Mandingue school of drumming. He is a member of the Manding ethnic group. Mamady Keita is a direct descendant of the great king Sundiata Keita who United the Mali Empire. Early life Ke√Øta was born in the small village of Balandougou, Guinea, in the northeastern prefecture of Siguiri, near the border of Mali. By age 5 Mamady Keita had developed his own technique of tone, slap, bass and learned the rhythms of his village and was playing Djembe in all of the ceremonies, celebrations and festivals. Technically, his actual initiation to the djembe started at the early age of seven, under Karinkadjan Kond√©, elder master djembefola of Balandugu, who initiated him to the secrets of the djembe. Ke√Øta was educated in the traditions of his village, learning the history and music of the Malinke people. At the age of twelve, he became a member of the first regional federal ballet of Siguiri after Balanka Sidiki, a recruiter for the group, came to Balandugu looking for performers. Career At the time, Guinea was governed by S√©kou Tour√©, who put special emphasis on Guinean culture through live performances and a system of local, regional, and national competitions that recruited the greatest artists of the land. During the National Festival in 1964, Ke√Øta, then aged fourteen, along with fifty other percussionists and numerous other artists, was selected by Guinea's Minister of Culture to form Le Ballet National Djoliba (The Djoliba National Ballet), which was intended to serve as a showcase for Tour√©'s revolution in Guinea. After nine months of training, he was one of only five percussionists retained. He was appointed lead soloist of Ballet Djoliba in 1965 and, in 1979, became its artistic director. He stayed with Ballet Djoliba until 1986, when he joined Ballet Koteba in C√¥te d'Ivoire. In 1988, Ke√Øta moved to Belgium where he worked as a performer and teacher. In 1991, he opened his first school Tam Tam Mandingue percussion school in Brussels, to be followed by additional schools in Europe, North America, and Asia, each run by a school director personally certified by Ke√Øta for his/her playing skill and teaching abilities. Since then, Ke√Æta has worked as a performer with his group Sewa Kan and recorded a number of CDs. He also teaches internationally, running international workshops in Europe, North America, and Asia, as well as an annual camp in Africa. He has published a large body of djembe teaching materials on CD and DVD, as well as an instructional book. He resides in Monterrey, Mexico.

He was Bishop of Oxford from 1699 to 1715, Bishop of Salisbury from 1715 to 1722 and Bishop of Durham from 1722 to 1730. Life The son of William Talbot of Lichfield, by his wife Mary, daughter of Thomas Stoughton of Whittington, Worcestershire, he was born at Stourton Castle, Staffordshire, around 1659. On 28 March 1674 he matriculated as a gentleman commoner at Oriel College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. on 16 October 1677, and M.A. on 23 June 1680. Talbot's first preferment was the rectory of Burghfield, Berkshire (1682), a living in the gift of his kinsman, Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. The deanery of Worcester was vacant after the deprivation of George Hickes as a nonjuror, and Shrewsbury's interest secured the appointment of Talbot in April 1691. Hickes drew up a protest (2 May) claiming a \\"legal right\\", which he affixed to the entrance to the choir of Worcester Cathedral. John Tillotson then gave Talbot (8 June) a Lambeth degree of D.D. In 1699 Talbot succeeded John Hough as bishop of Oxford (consecrated 24 September), retaining his deanery in commendam; he had been made D.D. of Oxford on 8 August. In the debate in the House of Lords following the trial (1710) of Henry Sacheverell, he was one of four bishops who spoke for his condemnation. His charge of 1712 maintained the validity of lay baptism against Roger Laurence. In 1718 he was made Dean of the Chapel Royal. On 23 April 1715 he was translated to the see of Salisbury, and resigned the deanery of Worcester. At Salisbury, through his son Edward Talbot, he was brought into connection with Thomas Rundle, Joseph Butler, and Thomas Secker, all of whom he helped by his patronage. On the death of Nathaniel Crew Talbot was translated (12 October 1721) to the see of Durham. There he became unpopular by promoting (February 1723) a bill empowering bishops to grant new mining leases without the consent of chapters. The bill was emasculated in the House of Commons, but Talbot in course of time managed the chapter through prebendaries of his appointment. He incurred further unpopularity by advancing the fines on his own leases and commending the example to the chapter. His profuse expenditure kept him short of money. Talbot died in Hanover Square, London, on 10 October 1730, and was buried on 14 October in St. James's, Westminster. Works Talbot published single sermons (1691‚Äì1717), his speech in the Lords on the Sacheverell case (1710), two charges (1712‚Äì17), and a circular to the Salisbury clergy directing collections for Moravians (1716). His volume of Twelve Sermons (1725 and 1731) follows the theology of Samuel Clarke. Family Talbot had two sisters, Frances Talbot and Catherine Talbot. His father was a descendant of Sir Gilbert Talbot and Elizabeth Knollys. He married, first, a daughter of Crispe, an attorney at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, who died without issue; secondly, Catharine (d. 23 Nov. 1730), daughter of Alderman Richard King of London, by whom he had eight sons and several daughters. The sons included: *Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot (c. 1685 - 1737) *Venerable Edward Talbot (c. 1693 - 1720), Archdeacon of Berkshire. He married Mary (d. 1784), daughter of George Martyn, prebendary of Lincoln; Catherine Talbot was their daughter. *Major- General Sherrington Talbot (c. 1699 - ?), father of Sir Charles Henry Talbot, 1st Baronet (see Talbot Baronets).

Yaya was raised in a culture that works, worships, lives and breathes to the beat of the drum. Thanks to his mother, being from the illustrious Berthe family (hunters, county chiefs, musicians...), young Yaya had the opportunity to hear some of the best musicians of the former canton Zangasso. The old musician, healer and sorcerer Nangape Kone became his protector and mentor. Arriving in Montreal, Canada, in 1967, Yaya graduated from the University of Montreal in Chemistry in 1973. Following a brief career as a chemist, Yaya returned to traditional African music. He was a co-founder of the music and dance groups Djembe-Kan and Cleba and a member of the African Troubadours with the World Music Institute as well as a faculty member with the Creative Music Studio, Woodstock, NY, and the Omega Institute. Yaya is currently teaching Applied World Percussion at Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY. He also offers workshops in traditional African healing, music and dance for the community. He was a seasonal lecturer at Carlton University, teaching Aural Training I & II from 1987 to 1992. In the meantime Yaya worked for Multiculturalism at Schools and the Community (MASC) in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, teaching more than 6000 students per year. From 1974 to 1986, he was a staff member of the Intercultural Institute of Montreal, Canada. There he organized workshops and lectures about different aspects of diverse cultures living in Montreal. Topics ranged from Alternative Medicine to Aging to Music in different cultures. He has performed throughout the USA, Canada, Asia (Japan, Singapore), Europe (France, England, and Belgium).  Biography  1 Early Years 1.1 Origin in Fienso''' In his book, The Healing Drum, Yaya Diallo wrote a lot of things about his mother and her famous family of Zangasso. He never wrote about his nomadic heritage. That is a missing link in his life that people do not know. Yaya Diallo's great grand father's name was Yoro Diallo. When he stopped in Fienso he changed his family name and opted for Sountoura instead. Sountoura and Diallo are the same name. In some parts of West Africa, Fula people (Fulani; ; ) are not welcomed, especially the Diallo family. Today in Mali, all people whose family name is Sountoura are Diallo, which is a living fact. In order to be accepted in Fienso, Yaya Diallo's ancestors were sponsored by a Minianka family called Zango-o where the last name is Kone. Even today, the two families have a special relationship, brotherhood and sisterhood. Yaya Diallo's family was semi- nomadic. One part stayed in Fienso and the second was nomadic in the hostile Miniankala. Minianka farmers used to hate Fula people because the animals destroyed crops and young plants. In order to travel, Fula people have to be initiated to the most secret societies. Yaya Diallo's grandfather, Flantio became a powerful man who was feared by everyone. When he touched you with his magic stick, you got diarrhea. Flantio took back the name Diallo. He married Yaya's grandmother, gNire Kone, from the powerful family Kone of the village Ziena. She was a midwife. A marabout (seer) Fula made a prophecy to Flantio saying that one of his grandsons would be well known in the world using paper and sound. This is similar to the one they made to his mother. At that time, most of Minianka had never seen a piece of paper. 1.2 His Father Yaya Diallo's father, Sibo Diallo, was a Nia Messenger from his birthday until 1974 when he became Muslim. He was a medium. During the rituals of Nia Society he came into a trance while his youngest brother was playing Nia Ngoni (African bass guitar). In his trance, Yaya's father could predict the future of the village people, family by family. he predicted diseases, bad weather, disasters, death, gender of babies in their mother's womb with a surprising accuracy. For each disease, he recommended the herbs to use. Only the initiators understood his language. In his daily life, he knew a lot of medicinal herbs. He was a specialist of the digestive system and all diseases related to it. He was the mentor of Nia Borotali (the messengers of Nia). He could read and translate the 266 characters of Nia. He died April 19, 1995 before Yaya Diallo. In Africa, it is a blessing to have the last word of one's dying father, and Yaya had it and participated in the funerals. Yaya Diallo's mother died on 2 February 1997. 1.3 Nomadic life 1950-1953 Each male child in Diallo's family from the age of four to 21 years had to live a nomadic life; Each female child lived nomadically from the age of six until she was married at 16 or after. To survive in nature, Yaya Diallo had to learn useful things. At first he learned that to live, he should be strong; this is natural selection. He should have some basic needs: Listening- he had to know the sound of hungry lions, hyenas, etc.; Observation- he should look at what's around him, snakes, scorpions; Smelling- to protect himself, Diallo learned deadly smells. Also, he learned the paradox of nature which is: the plant near a poisonous plant has the antidote of the poison. We have a poison and its antidote. Many human diseases have their medications in nature. Yaya Diallo knows how to cure or stop the symptoms of some illnesses: diarrhea, flu, headaches, and the bites or stings of scorpions, snakes, bees, and wasps. As Fula in Yaya Diallo's family, they breed cattle and sheep. They were always moving, looking for some good place where the animals could get good grass and water; where there were no harmful insects that could give infectious diseases to the cattle. They built temporary huts near a village. Women go to the village to sell or trade dairy products like milk and butter and to buy the ingredients for food: rice, fish, and flour. They cooked and slept in the temporary huts. During the day, Yaya Diallo herded animals in order to feed them. He had to follow the rhythm of the animals; that is a good school for patience. By some nights, predators such as hyenas and lions came and attacked animals. The shepherds had to hunt them away. Those were the difficult times. When one animal is killed, all the animals were stressed for days. Sometimes they called musicians to play so animals went away. Yaya Diallo was subdued to some familial taboos. It is absolutely forbidden to cut down flowers and end the process of reproduction of green plants. Never cut down trees without good reason. 1.4 Family values To be a successful man, one should put a lot of big, heavy necklaces around his wife's neck. He has to hang big golden earrings from his spouse's ears. To be wealthy and respected like a wealthy man, one should have a big herd of cattle and a lot of sheep. At the school of Nature, Diallo had time to observe and learn. Daily he met many animals: predators, birds, reptiles, herbivores, and all kinds of insects. He also learned about plants. All those factors justified why Diallo was a good biology student and his interests in medical herbs. In 1953, Diallo went to French school at Zangasso, his mother's native village. During school, Diallo was sedentary. As soon as school stopped he joined the nomadic people. When he came to North America, that was the end of his nomadic life, but as a musician he loves traveling. He said, \\"The school of traveling is unique. You can not learn in books what you learn when you travel.\\" 1.5 Western education Diallo started French school in 1953. At the time French school was considered a curse for villagers. According to the prediction of villagers, Yaya Diallo could not stay in school for two years, \\"he is not even good enough to be black, how can he succeed in the white man's school?\\" Since he went to the classroom he was ranked among the five best students out of 51 in total. He successfully went through all kinds of difficulties. In 1959, the last year of primary school in Zangasso, his teacher Arouna Dembele believed that Yaya Diallo could be one of the best Africans in Sudan to succeed in the contest required to go to Lycees and colleges. He failed the contest, for some reasons he had explained in the Healing Drum, but he succeeded in completing the exams for the certificate of primary studies. It was the first and last degree of the Federation of Mali (Mali-Senegal) which lasted only three months, from June to August. This diploma is a historical document. From 1959 to 1960, he came back to school and succeeded in the contest and went to the College Moderne of Sikasso. In the 7th grade there were 120 students coming from all schools of the Sikasso Region. The best 30 students would go to the Lycee Henri Terrassons de Fougeres at Bamako. That school became Lycee Askia Mohamed in 1962-63. In spite of all kinds of difficulties, Yaya Diallo was ranked among the top thirty students (Healing Drum, pp. 143‚Äì145). He successfully got the D.E.F: Diploma of Fundamental Studies in 1964. In order to help his mother, he wanted to go to a special school to become a teacher, but his mother refused his request. He was oriented to biological studies (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology). In 1966, he succeeded in both writing and oral exams and obtained the first part of Baccalaureal Francais (Malien). In 1967, the last year of secondary school, he was one of the best students in biology for the last twenty years according to the biology teacher Madame Le Blanc. That meant he could have a scholarship from the World Health Organization to go to medical school in France. The teacher had made good recommendations to medical schools. In April 1967, Yaya Diallo got the scholarship from Canada to become a Sanitary Engineer. he accepted that offer. With tears, his biology teacher did recommendations to Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. He came to Canada with the reputation of being horrible at drawing: arts or technical. He came to Montreal on September 22, 1967, two weeks before the mid-term exams. He studied in the metric system in Africa and had exams with the British system. All his textbooks were in English, as well. He lost one year trying to adapt to the new environment and system. In 1968-69, he passed all exams except technical drawing. His teacher PM Cote told him, \\"There is no engineer without drawings.\\" He took the course again and failed. Canada government recommended him to go to intensive drawing class. He refused the request, lost his scholarship, and became an illegal alien. His girlfriend's father, manager of Stuart Biscuit, found him a job in the factory. He worked hard, got money and went to study organic chemistry in order to understand the chemical products in herbs and plants. It was a blessing for him. From 1969 to 1970 he was working full-time by night (4pm-2am) and school full-time (8am-3pm). In October 1970, he stopped because there was the October Revolution in Montreal. In 1973, Diallo got his diploma: specialized bachelor's in organic chemistry. 2 Brief career as a chemist 2.1 University of Montreal May‚ÄìSeptember 1973 After graduation he was hired by Dr. Robert Marchesseault, the Head of the Department of Chemistry, to work on a special project for Domtar Inc. Using Ziegler-Natta catalysts, Diallo was to determine how to make waterproof paper from rolls of paper in movement. There was nothing new. It was easier to make waterproof paper in a stable position rather than on the rolls of paper that are produced in factories. The team had built a mechanical system for the purpose of conducting this experiment. At one side, the paper unrolled, went in the solvent, and then entered in the catalysts in which it was injected with a gas, ethylene. Ziegler-Natta catalysts controlled the size of the polymers (polyethylene) inside and outside the paper at the movement. The paper went out of the products, travelled a distance of two feet, the time needed to be dried. Then the dried paper wound around a bar to make a roll of waterproof paper. Several tests were then performed. Diallo put one piece of paper in water for one day and another for one week to find out if they absorbed water. The final product was sent to Domtar at Pointe-Claire. There, paper was submitted to a pressure of 1,000 pounds in order to homogenize the surface of the paper. To prove the utility of the project, Diallo had to determine the time of the paper in the solvent, the time in the products, and the time the paper needed to be dried. He also had to calculate the quantities of the solvent, of the products, and of the wastes as plastics. Yaya said, \\"I like this project. I studied chemistry to get my hands wet. I like the technical aspect of sciences. I want to make products.\\" He interrupted his career to apply for the Canadian government waiver for illegal aliens. 2.2 Interruption In August, Diallo learned that the Canadians made an armistice for illegal aliens and especially for students. He went to get registered as a student at H.E.C. (Hautes Etudes Commerciales), a business school. He got the requested papers to stay in Canada. He went through nightmares. The officers of immigration were outraged because Diallo's case became very popular. Look at the case: He came with a scholarship that he lost and still stayed in Canada. He studied at the same university, got a social security number, worked at a factory and at the department of chemistry without questions. People who know the man say, \\"That is Yaya Diallo. That is him.\\" For eight months, the immigration's officers gave him a hard time. He had to come to their office twice a week and each time he met a new officer. On March 1974, he received an order to leave Canada or he would be deported in two days. He met the right people at the right time and was given permission to stay in Canada. He had the choice to stay and study or to become an immigrant. He became an immigrant in 1974 and a Canadian citizen in 1983. 2.3 Second short career as a chemist In 1975, Diallo was ready to go back home to Mali. In the newspaper he saw a contest in which the winner would get a job at the Department of Geology at the University du Quebec in Montreal. He took a piece of paper, identified 9 mistakes out of 10 in the formulation of the problem and won the contest. He was hired to work with a double collector mass spectrograph. In the Geology Department, Dr. Claude-Marcel Hillaire was in charge of the project. Using the stable isotope, Carbon-13 for dating instead of Carbon-14 which was radioactive. In the entire world, there were only four double collector mass spectrograph. One was in London where they were conceived and built. One was in Australia, another in Montreal, and the last, Yaya has forgotten where it was sold. Useful project for people living in desert countries: The first step was to collect carbon dioxide from the sample. Under a vacuum of 0.001 Torr, one attacked the sample with a weak acid such as phosphoric acid. The carbon dioxide appeared as a gas. This gas then went through a trap that was immersed in ice at 0 degrees to retain water vapor. After that, it continued its way to the following trap which was kept at -80 degrees Celsius. The dry vapor was trapped at -180 degrees Celsius where it was a solid. that last trap was immersed in liquid nitrogen. One fixed the sample and the standard called Chicago on the spectrograph. The two gasses were injected in the machine that collected the mass 44 of the sample and the standard on one side while on the other side, it collected the mass 45 of the two gasses. Based on the difference between the mass 44 of the sample and the standard side, and the difference between the mass 45 of the two gasses, one could calculate the relative age of the sample using a complex formula and Fortran IV on the computer. This part was a nightmare. According to the literature, this new technique could be used to estimate the age of water trapped underground. Every six months, a sample was taken and analyzed. If the age was the same, that meant that there was no new source of water to that specific location. Only by watching the differences between the mass 44 and 45 of the sample and the standard one, could one make a conclusion that water was unchanged. People who use wells in the desert could be warned that one day they would lack water. When the differences changed, that meant that there was new water, so people could use the water without worries. This technique can be used to determine the age of nitrogen in plankton, as well. Yaya Diallo was enthusiastic to work on the project. One day the destiny called him (Healing Drum). 3 Musical career Yaya Diallo said, \\"For my people, with its rich musical context, exposure to music begins in the wombs when pregnant mothers join in the community dance...when infants are then wrapped onto their mother's backs with a cloth and taken into the dancing circle with everyone else.\\" This statement is quoted by Mickey Hart in his book Planet Drum, pp. 88\\\\. That was Yaya Diallo's first music and dance lessons. During his early childhood, he was exploring the balafons which were kept in his paternal family. In his native village, Fienso, he was learning Peenyi (Dounou), spiritual balafon, morals, proverbs, and philosophy with his mentor Nangape Kone. Sounkalo Kone and Issa Koroma gave him djembe (daykaylaykay) lessons. Yago Kone was his biology and Moukolo (equivalent of Congo) teacher. In Zangasso his grandfather taught him hand and stick drum techniques. After his death, his grandfather continued to teach him music and wisdom in his dreams. That is the most important part of his musical education. Sotigui Kone was his religious tama (talking) drum teacher. When he was six years old, Yaya Diallo had his first drum sculpted by the blacksmith Nianso Koroma. He formed his first music group with the goals and dreams to impress his grandfather. he felt and was disappointed. In order to live with Minianka people Yaya Diallo had to have several initiations. He is always interested in the religious and mystical aspects of the music. He learned the music and the instruments which go with each step of the rituals. In different secret societies he was playing the instrument that sustained the rhythm or and tempo. 3.1 Practice time Listening is the most important tool for learning in oral traditions. As a shepherd, Yaya Diallo was using his body, pieces of wood and stones as musicalt instruments. By tradition he should play flute or sokou (one string violins) but he did not like those instruments which are easily portable. During the day he was listening to the musicians from different villages who were playing for groups of collective farmers to motivate people to work fast. He also listened to birds, insects, and by nights, orchestras of frogs when he was near a small river. In Sikasso the capitol of balafons, he was in Heaven listening to the finest players in 1960-61. In Bamako, djembe is the main instrument, for six years at the Lycee, he heard great djembe players. As a students at the Lycee, it was not a good thing to listen to traditional music. 3.2 Musical career in Montreal, Canada 1976-77 When Yaya Diallo quit his job, he met Alama Kanate from C√¥te d'Ivoire, with two Senegaleses Boubacar Gueye and Moustapha Seck. They founded a band called Djeme-kan. The group did small performances for weddings and cultural events without good results. The Senegaleses abandoned the group and were replaced by a Congolese guitarist and singer, and Alain Tagny, a dancer from Cameroun. After two successful nights at the National Biblioth√®que de Montreal on St. Denis Street Alama Kanate claimed that the group belonged to him. So Djeme-kan was divided in two parts. 1977-78 Yaya Diallo and Alain Tagny created Cleba, meaning that the sun is shining for everyone, so white people were accepted in the group. That music unit was successful and played for big events such as St. John Baptist Celebration on main stages. In May 1978, the group did a tour in Saguenay-Lac- Saint-Jean outside of Montreal. It was a fiasco. Montreal Canadiens, the Montreal Hockey team, was in the finals against the New York Rangers. nobody could compete with this team in Quebec. The most important thing was that in the 1970s, French Canadians were not ready to see white men playing African instruments and white women dancing to African music. When they came back to Montreal, people were not motivated to continue, so they quit the group. 3.3 Hard time in his life October 1977-February 1978 To survive, Diallo had money from unemployment for ten months. Very broke, he got training to sell Grolier Encyclopedias. He had to knock at doors all day long and by night he met targeted families. In small cities, people were not ready to see a black man walking on the streets in the darkness in their neighborhood. That was a problem. In February, he went to the north of Quebec called Abitibi where the average temperature was -40 degrees Celsius. He had suffered for a week and had sold only two encyclopedias. Back in Montreal, he quit the job. 1978-79 Yaya Diallo was homeless, jobless, and hopeless in spite of two prophecies. He was dating Helen Alemany, his son Teli Diallo's mother. He was teaching drum classes at the space they had rented for Cleba. He was jamming at La Grande Passe on Ontario Street and Chez Dumas on Emery Street. In Montreal they called him a \\"chum,\\" meaning people who dream big but are not capable of doing anything great. 1979-80 At the Centre Monchanin, now Intercultural Institute of Montreal, he started to teach African dance to a group of women. At the end of the project, Diallo was hired to work at the center in 1980. He worked part-time and became a staff member and Treasurer of the board from 1980 to 1987. 1980-90 While he was working at the Center, he met a multi-billionaire, Madame Dominique de Menil from Houston, Texas. She invited Yaya Diallo to accomplish a difficult mission. On June 20, 1981, she wanted to reward ten people or organizations in the world at her chapel; The Rothko- the Rothko Chapel Rewards in Recognition of commitment to truth and Freedom. For the rituals, Yaya Diallo's recommendations were the best among several options. For each nominee, Yaya Diallo had to play an appropriate beat according to the type of commitment. For example, for Las madres de La Playa de Mayo Buenos Aires, Argentina, he played the rhythm for people who had lost men, women, children. For Warren Robbins, son of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, founder and director of the Museum of African Arts, Washington D.C., who had accomplished a mission impossible, Yaya Diallo played a special music for brave people. When the journalist Zwelakhe Sisulu's name was announced, Diallo played a beat for courage and motivation. Sisulu was also a National President of the Media Worker's Association South Africa, Johannesburg. December 1981 In Houston, Warren Robbins was impressed by Yaya Diallo's wisdom and invited him for some events in Washington D.C. Diallo met some leaders of the Black community (today called African Americans) especially the group of African Heritage. he performed at an Evening of Balafon music feature Yaya Diallo and Pascal Milogo at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington on December 27, 1981. This concert was sponsored by the National Museum of Art's African Art program. He was invited to talk on the radio station, La Voix de l'Amerique hosted by George Collinet. Unfortunately he did not meet with George Collinet who was on vacation. His messages were heard in 250 countries. \\"Young people, build your own country, there is no room for everybody in the USA. American youth should not be your role models.\\" To meet Africans living in Washington D.C. he did a Balafon concert at the popular Malian restaurant \\"The Baobab.\\" 3.4 Creative Music Studio, Woodstock, NY, CMS: Diallo conducted drum workshops and did some concerts with his group from Montreal. He performed at CMS Summer Festival '81: World music on Sunday July 12 '81 as Yaya Diallo from Mali. People such as John Abercrombie, Karl Beger, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, Ingrid, Jack de Johnette, Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden, and Dewey Redman had performed at CMS. Diallo was a faculty member from 1981 to its end.Yaya Diallo CMS 3.5 Introduction to jazz music Baikida Carrol, a jazz horn player from St. Louis, invited Yaya Diallo to join in one of his two groups to play at Public Theater NY, on Friday November 14, 198?. The first team called Bush Wish included Nana Vasconcellos, Bresil, Yaya Diallo and others. The second team was composed of Julius Hemphill and Antony Davis. Randy Weston appeared both nights. Even that Yaya Diallo said that he knew nothing about jazz, he felt at home in jam sessions with Baikida Carrol, Julius Hempell, and Antony Davis, and others. 3.6 Dream time 1980-82 In 1980, Yaya Diallo made his first LP record, produced by Stephen Conroy through his company Onzou Records. The LP release was done at the Art Gallery the same day of the opening of one of the most popular clubs, Izaza in Montreal. With some good musicians of Montreal and two dancers, Yaya Diallo did an excellent performance at L'Improvu on Monday, March 2, 1981, during the second LP release. The media, people wanted to see more from him. From March 31 to April 5, Diallo came back to L'Improvu located at L'Iroquois, Place Jaques Cartier Vieux Montreal. The performances were original and excellent. The phenomenon of Yaya Diallo was born in Montreal. Karl Parent, a journalist of CBC International was amazed by what he heard at L'Improvu and offered to Yaya Diallo the opportunity to make the music of a documentary film. Yaya Diallo did the music of the documentary film Leopold Cedar Senghor, Former President of Senegal. The film was presented at CBC TV on Tuesday, May 1981. (See TV program. Ici Radio-Canada, Vol. 5, no. 22) 1982-90 After a short time of glory in Montreal, Diallo's music career was going nowhere. He started working part-time at the Intercultural Institute of Montreal while he opened African dance classes at 310 West st. Catherine, moved to Cooper Building on St. Laurent, and finally to Building Dance on Mont-Royal St and Pine Ave at Montreal. He had three classes of 40 students each a week. Meantime he created his band, Kanza, and had time to raise his first son Teli. In June 1983, Yaya Diallo was invited through the Institute to participate in a symposium at Namur Belgium. That symposium was organized for European scholars and experts in intercultural cooperation by University De La Paix. The questions were: What are unifying myths of the world? Who has the right to define the criteria of good life for the world? In July, he went back to Namur, Belgium, to assist in an intercultural colloquium organized by 200 non-profit organizations coming from all over the world. After a week of work using six languages, Yaya Diallo was in charge of writing a report in French of the symposium with his old friend Adama Samassekou who was living in Paris, France. Yaya Diallo came back to Montreal with 10 cassettes and did the work by himself. In Namur, Yaya Diallo had shared a room with Professor Alpha Oumar Konare who became President of Mali for two five-year terms (1992‚Äì2002) and was chairperson of the African Union. His friend Adama Samassekou was Minister of Education in Mali. He was Yaya's Diallo's third roommate. Some non-profit organizations did not like Diallo's opinions and his conclusions of the symposium. In September, Yaya Diallo wrote the most controversial and critical article about the international cooperation in French, entitled, La Cooperation est-elle possible? (Is Cooperation Possible?) This article is published in Interculture (October‚ÄìDecember 1983, Vol. XVI, No. 4 cahier 81, pp. 9‚Äì17). With a grant from the Ministry of Multiculturalism of Canada, Diallo wrote the Profil Culturel Africain. This document was first published in 1985 by the Intercultural Institute of Montreal. Many teachers, researchers, students, and seekers of exoticism, as well as Africans searching for their roots have had recourse to it. In spite of that relative success, it is completely out of print. In October 2001, it was translated in English as At the Threshold of the African Soul. The Fulani-Minianka Way, Intercultural Issue No. 141. This document is the heart of the book, Healing Drum, African Wisdom Teachings. Diallo's international reputation came from his writings and his name is associated with the Healing Drum, as writing books is his destiny. Diallo said, \\"I don't want to be associated with a record company.\\" In 1982, as a musician, Diallo played two weeks at CNE (Canadian National Exhibit) in Toronto. In 1986, he played at the International Exhibit in Vancouver BC, at Folklife, and at Canadian Pavilion. In 1987, he stopped working at the Institute and started to tour to schools with the program made by the former General Governor of Canada, Jeanne Sauve. The same year, he started teaching two courses, Aural training I and II, at Carlton University. Diallo also was one of the first artists of the program made by Jan Andrews and Jennifer Cayley: \\"A Change to Give.\\" The organization became MASC, Multiculturalism at Schools and Communities. Diallo worked for MASC from 1988-2004. Diallo did some performances with his band, Kanze, at the Festival Culture Canada 88, at Ottawa-Hull: more than five festivals Nuits d'Afrique with Ballattou; Festival 1001 Nuits; at Club Soda 1989, 1990, The Spectrum de Montreal. In 1987, Diallo collaborated with others of so-called French-speaking countries to make the song \\"Franc Parler\\" for the Summit of Francophony at Quebec City. The Healing Drum was published in 1989. The president of Inner Traditions, his wife and his staff came to Montreal to meet the community. He bought food for the people of Balattou, for two nights the kanza played. We had a press conference with The Gazette, La Presse, and Voir. After Montreal the company had planned tours Yaya Diallo. He went to bookstores and Universities, he signed books and did lectures all over the United States. Mickey Hart, the drummer of the Grateful Dead, wrote his two books, he has quoted Diallo's work several times in each book and gave his opinion on how good he thought The Healing Drum was. The phenomenon of The Healing Drum was born. For several years Diallo did workshops, lectures and debates. The World Music Institute contacted him, he became a member of the artists they manage. They booked him everywhere they could as a solo artist. In 1993 they created the African Troubadours, and they too booked shows everywhere. Other people like Everyone's Drumming with Dounoukan, Relaxation Company, Dombaa Folee had produced Diallo's music, and organized the promotion of the products. _\\"Schools Kick off Black History Month.\\" Buckner Elementary School.

Like other people working for MASC, Diallo was asked to offer his workshop \\"Music without Money.\\" With Stones, pieces of wood, small pipelines, bamboo sticks, children learned how to make quickly the instruments, and how to play together as an orchestra. The Queen Mother Elisabeth II of England in visit in Canada wanted to see the workshops made by people from different cultures. The Queen accompanied by the Prime Minister of Canada, Bryan Mulroney arrived to Yaya Diallo workshop, she was happy to see how one could make children happy with stones, woods‚Ä¶. She hanged her hand to shake Diallo's hand, Diallo did not understand, the cameras took the image of the Queen's hands hanging in the air. That was the embarrassing part. Back to Montreal, Diallo's friends teased him, are you a separatist French Canadian. The RCMP did a background check of all participants. They did the something with children's parents before they chose them. For a week Diallo did workshops and shows on small stages. The last day there was the big show where ten groups from different cultures had to play one piece of music together. Diallo's band was composed of musicians from Haiti. _1987-89, in 1987 Yaya Diallo started teaching three classes enroll training I and II at Carleton University in Ottawa, meantime he was doing tours at several schools in Ontario, Ottawa region, and in Quebec Outtaouais. While he was working with Mapou Ginin a local music and dance group from Haiti, living in Montreal. In December 1988, he combined his group Kanza to make the first show ever by a local world music group living in Montreal. At Club Sods of Montreal. The door of club Soda was closed to the so-called world beat musicians. The show was great, so there were no excuses to keep the door closed to foreign music Fanta Kone from Guadeloupe, Delphin Pandoue from Cote d' Ivoire, and Josiane Antourel from Martinique three female dancers approached Yaya Diallo to make some performances. After six months of hard work, Diallo combined the three professional dancers with his band Kanza to make a comeback show in the Club Soda. The show was phenomenal. Diallo had the challenge to open one more Closed door, the spectrum de Montreal. The mission was accomplished; the door was opened for local world beat music. To get in, each bad had to say if you could open the door to Yaya Diallo, you should open it for everyone. In August 1989, Josian Antoural invited Yaya Diallo to the \\"Festival Village Marin.\\" Le Festival de la me (Festival of the Sea). Several Caribbean Islands came to celebrate the Caribbean Sea. Yaya Diallo said it was one of the best times in my life. Diallo was surprised to find out that the beat that he was playing over and over again with his band in Fienso, Mali was the most popular beat in Martinique. Diallo's song \\"Mouwa\\" was a hit in Martinique. During each performance, there were more than five encores. For two weeks Diallo played and listened to unknown top musicians of Caribbean Sea. _Centre College. Danville, KY. African voices festival celebrates African and African-American culture.

He was editor of the Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny from 1945 until his death in 1999, except for three years in the early 1950s. Early life and education Turowicz was born on 10 December 1912 in Krak√≥w, the son of Klotylda (Turnau) and August Turowicz, a judge.http://www.jerzyturowicz.pl/ewa- prejsner/http://www.readingmalopolska.pl/en/miasta-w- szlakach,31,krakow,1300.chtm In 1930, he joined a Catholic youth organization, called Rebirth. He graduated from Jagiellonian University in 1939 with a degree in philosophy. Career and activities Turowicz was appointed chief editor of G≈Ços Narodu in 1939. During World War II, he worked in the underground journals. In 1945, he became editor of the Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, which he also cofounded. It was financed by Adam Sapieha, Archbishop of Krak√≥w. However, there is another report, arguing that Sapieha was loosely related to the weekly. Turowicz made his career there, through all the changes in the political and social nature of the country. He served as the editor of the weekly until his death in 1999, with only a three-year interruption from 1953 to 1956. The reason for this interruption was the refusal of Turowicz to publish an obituary for Joseph Stalin. During this period the weekly was under the control of the communist regime and the editor was Jan Piwowarczyk. In 1956, Turowicz both returned to his editorial post and was made a member of the Sejm, Polish Parliament, along with other Catholic figures. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. He was a member of the Round Table negotiations during the Polish revolution in 1989, leading to the fall of communist regime in the country. Turowicz's articles published in various dailies and other publications were compiled and published by the Znak publishing house in 1963, in 1990 and in 1999. Personal life and death In 1938, Turowicz married Anna GƒÖsiorowska and they had three daughters, one of whom is the psycholinguist Magdalena Smoczy≈Ñska.Biography of Jerzy Turowicz on website of Tygodnik Powszechny He died of a heart attack in Krak√≥w on 27 January 1999. His grandson is Polish- American cinematographer Lukasz Jogalla and his great-grandson is American actor Pico Alexander. Legacy and awards In 1995, Turowicz was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, the highest state award of Poland and silver Krak√≥w service medal.Postanowienie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 3 maja 1994 r. o nadaniu orderu In 1998, Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz produced the documentary, Ordinary Kindness (Zwyczajna dobroƒá), telling the story of Turowicz. On 10 December 2012, the 100th anniversary of Turowicz's birth, a plaque in honor of him was unveiled in Krak√≥w. A street in Krak√≥w is named after him.

Starring two ghosthunters, players are tasked with travelling across different countries, capturing enemies and throwing them as bouncing ball, jumping on and off platforms to navigate level obstacles while dodging and defeating monsters in order to save the world. Designed by Makoto Kikuchi, Tumblepop was developed by most of the same team that worked on several projects at Data East. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later ported across multiple platforms, each one featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version. The title was met with mostly positive reception from critics and players alike, gaining a cult following since its initial release. However, other version were met with a more mixed response from reviewers.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Tumblepop is a platform game reminiscent of Bubble Bobble, Pang and Snow Bros., where players assume the role of ghosthunters through ten levels consisting of ten stages set in different parts of the world (Moscow, Egypt, Paris, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Antarctica, Australia, Japan, Space and Moon), each with a boss at the every tenth stage that must be fought before progressing any further, in an effort to defeat monsters, ghosts, aliens and other oddball characters as the main objective.Tumblepop instruction booklet (Game Boy, US) Each player can suck enemies into a vacuum-cleaner-like devices, however enemies will escape from the player's vacuum-cleaner and kill their character if they are kept for too long. Once an enemy has been captured into the vacuum-cleaner, players can spit them back as rolling balls, which will rebound off of walls until eventually shattering against a wall. Any enemies the tumbling ball rolls into are eliminated and reveal hidden bonus items that are crucial for reaching high-scores such as collectable letters of the alphabet found in randomly appearing bubbles to gradually spell the word \\"TUMBLEPOP\\", the progress of which is permanently displayed at the bottom of the screen. The word goes back to default after completion. When completed, players are transported to a bonus level which gives them the opportunity to obtain higher scores and an extra life, although this level is strictly timed. If the player takes too much time to complete a level, a vampire-like beast will come and try to kill the players, which is invincible and this also counts during boss encounters. When players bowl an enemy over, it may drop other items like gems, money or power-ups. Players can also stun enemies with the beam emmited from the vacuum-cleaner. The game hosts cameos of characters from other Data East games such as Karnov, Atomic Runner Chelnov and Joe & Mac. If a single player is downed, their character is immediately respawned at the location they start at on every stage. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the characters' firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  Tumblepop was developed by most of the same team that worked on several projects at Data East, with Makoto Kikuchi serving as its designer. Hidemi Hamada, Kei Ichikawa and Minoru Sano acted as programmers, while several artists like Atsushi Takahashi, Chie Kitahara, Hiroshi Tada and others were responsible for the pixel art. The soundtrack was handled by Gamadelic members Mihoko Ando, Tatsuya Kiuchi and Tomoyoshi Sato. Tumblepop was first released on November 1991 in Japan by Namco, Leprechaun Inc. in North America and Mitchell Corporation in Europe. In 1992, a Game Boy version was first released in Japan by Data East and later in North America by Sunsoft on March 1993. The Game Boy version incorporates a world map that does not resemble Earth; levels are contained in different cities on that map that the player can walk between. If a city proves too difficult, it is also possible to drop out of it and come back later via a password system. Enemies in a given city approximately correspond to those in an area in the arcade version, though there is not necessarily any link between the real world's cities and the game's cities. In addition, this version also incorporates a shop in which players can spend their points to buy power-ups. It has since been re-released on both the Nintendo 3DS' Virtual Console by G-Mode and the AntStream service.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Tumblepop on their 1 December 1991 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. In the February 1992 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number eight spot in popularity. The arcade original has gained a cult following since its release. Computer and Video Gamess Julian Rignall gave high praise to the visuals, sound and \\"addictive\\" gameplay. Both Emmanuel Castro and Burno Sol of Spanish website Vandal gave it a positive retrospective outlook. Likewise, Juan Garcia of IGN Spain also gave it a positive retrospective outlook.

It is also known by the name Dryopithecus africanus. A joint publication of Wilfrid Le Gros Clark and Louis Leakey in 1951, \\"The Miocene Hominoidea of East Africa\\", first defines Proconsul nyanzae. In 1965 Simons and Pilbeam replaced Proconsul with Dryopithecus, using the same species names.A now amusing anecdote is told of Louis' reaction to this change by Virginia Morell, \\"Ancestral Passions\\", Chapter 21. Louis attended a presentation by the young David Pilbeam, then a graduate student, in Chicago in 1965. Louis interrupted by yelling at Pilbeam to \\"shut up\\", among other words. Not finding any support among his mentors and supporters, Pilbeam told Louis to shut up and went on with the presentation. This event is said to have assisted his career. In 1967, Louis defined Kenyapithecus africanus on seven fossils from Rusinga Island. He saw it as an ancestor of wickeri and also of man, with a date of 20 mya in the middle Miocene. Another fossil found by the VanCouverings on Rusinga in 1967 seemed to confirm africanus. In 1969 Simons and Pilbeam moved Kenyapithecus africanus into Dryopithecus nyanzae. By 1978 the genus had recovered from the Dryopithecine event and was back to Proconsul. In that year Andrews moved Clark & Leakey's 1951 Sivapithecus africanus into Proconsul nyanzae. In 2015, it was moved into the new genus Ekembo.Kieran P. McNulty, David R. Begun, Jay Kelley, Fredrick K. Manthi and Emma N. Mbua (2015). \\"A systematic revision of Proconsul with the description of a new genus of early Miocene hominoid\\". Journal of Human Evolution. 84: 42-61. doi:10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.03.009. A more recent discovery by Ward et al. in 1999 and reclassification splits Kenyapithecus africanus away again and lumps it with Equatorius africanus, which would move it to the subfamily Afropithecinae with Afropithecus turkanensis. As Ekembo, Kenyapithecus may not be in the same clade as apes and humans, but as the older Equatorius, it may be. Morphology Ekembo nyanzae had a dental formula of 2:1:2:3 on both the upper and lower jaw. The upper premolars of E. nyanzae were large. This species had a relatively thick enamel on the molars. The mandible of this species was relatively robust. E. nyanzae had an average body mass of about 30.0 kilograms. Range E. nyanzae lived on the continent of Africa and the fossils were found in areas that suggest it lived in a dry, open woodland environment.

He was later hired by EA and wrote the fighting game Budokan: The Martial Spirit (1989). Career After taking a 6-week summer computer class at school when he was 13, Tobey saved for a year to purchase a Commodore PET 2001 for $800. He learned BASIC and then 6502 machine language and moved to the Apple II. At 16, Tobey and a friend worked on a combat flight sim called Alpha Strike for the Apple II for two years. When they went to Boston for the 1983 Applefest they were invited to meet Rod Nakamoto, a game industry executive, who praised the game and introduced them to Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak. Wozniak was amazed by the visual effects Tobey had achieved with the game. He had recently joined the Board of Directors of Electronic Arts, and he gave Tobey a business card with a message for EA President Trip Hawkins written on the back: \\"Trip, Please consider this flight simulator as the finest Apple game ever done. Woz\\". Tobey was still only a senior in high school. Less than two weeks later EA flew him and his parents to Northern California for a meeting. Game programmer Bill Budge urged Tobey to sign a development deal. After his graduation in June he rejected a rival offer from Sir-Tech and committed to EA to produce the newly renamed Skyfox, becoming their second-youngest developer. Tobey initially continued work on the game at home for several months, but when there was one month left in the schedule EA suggested that he come to California. As it turned out, he would work at the EA offices in San Mateo for almost a year before completing the game. He worked closely with producer Stewart Bonn and with Richard Hilleman, both of whom later held senior management positions at EA. Although nominally an independent developer, Tobey worked in the EA offices alongside other employees. Key to the title's evolution during that year was its re- structuring as a mission-based game, a structure that would be emulated by many later combat flight sims. When the game was released in 1984 it became one of EA's biggest early hits, selling over 400,000 copies. In 1988 Tobey joined EA as an employee and programmed the martial arts fighting game Budokan: The Martial Spirit.

His name and age are not established in the text; however, he is estimated to be 7‚Äì10 years of age, and is often named as Andrew, for ease. He is Shakespeare's typical child character‚Äîcute and clever. While Lady Macduff and her children are mentioned in Holinshed's Chronicles as the innocent victims of Macbeth's cruelty, Shakespeare is completely responsible for developing Macduff's son as a character. The boy appears in only one scene (4.2), in which he briefly banters with his mother and is then murdered by Macbeth's thugs. The scene's purpose is twofold: it provides Shakespeare's audience with a thrillingly horrific moment, and it underscores the depravity into which Macbeth has fallen. The brutal scene has often been cut in modern performance. Andrew is viewed as a symbol of the youthful innocence Macbeth hates and fears, and the scene has been compared by one critic to the biblical Massacre of the Innocents. He is described as an \\"egg\\" by his murderer, further emphasising on his youth before his imminent death.  Role in the play  In 4.2, Lady Macduff bewails her husband's desertion of home and family, then falsely tells her son that his father is dead. The boy does not believe her and says that if his father were really dead, she'd cry for him, and if she didn't then it would \\"be a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.\\" Macbeth's henchmen arrive, and, when they declare Macduff a traitor, the boy leaps forward to defend his absent father. One of the henchmen stabs the boy who cries to his mother as he dies, \\"Run away, I pray you!\\". This highlights the loyalty, affection and love which make up this character.  Cuts in performance  The on-stage slaughter of Macduff's son was often cut in 19th- century performances on the grounds of taste. The child was carried off-stage, and the murder left to the spectators' imaginations. Very often, the entire scene was cut, not only on the grounds of taste but, in an age of elaborate scenery and lengthy scene shifting, on time constraints and production costs in mounting a superfluous scene verbally summarised to good effect almost immediately in 4.3.Bevington, David. Four Tragedies. Bantam, 1988  Analysis  Samuel Taylor Coleridge commented: > This scene, dreadful as it is, is still a relief, because a variety, because > domestic, and therefore soothing, as associated with the only real pleasures > of life. The conversation between Lady Macduff's and her child heightens the > pathos, and is preparatory for the deep tragedy of their assassination. > Shakspeare's fondness for children is every where shown;‚Äîin Prince Arthur, > in King John; in the sweet scene in the Winter's Tale between Hermione and > her son; nay, even in honest Evans's examination of Mrs. Page's schoolboy. > To the objection that Shakspeare wounds the moral sense by the unsubdued, > undisguised description of the most hateful atrocity‚Äîthat he tears the > feelings without mercy, and even outrages the eye itself with scenes of > insupportable horror‚ÄîI, omitting Titus Andronicus, as not genuine, and > excepting the scene of Gloster's blinding in Lear, answer boldly in the name > of Shakspeare, not guilty. The murderer cries as he stabs the boy, \\"What, you egg! ... Young fry of treachery!\\"Macbeth 4.2.1833-5 This hints at the reason Macbeth is so eager to have him killed. Macbeth, seeing that, as the Three Witches foretold, he is destined to be a King with no offspring to inherit the throne, is determined to kill the offspring of others, including Fleance and Macduff's son.Barroll, J. Shakespeare Studies. New York: Burt Franklin, 1976. pp. 272 The tension that exists between Fleance, Banquo's son, and Macbeth would be made stronger by the existence of a child of Macbeth, should he be portrayed as having one‚Äîwhether his own natural son, or adopted. As Lady Macbeth says \\"I have given suck, and know / How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me\\".Macbeth 1.7.533-4 Seeing Macbeth in a fatherly perspective produces a combination of both tender and ambitious fatherliness in him. All that Macbeth does to others' sons in the play, then, is for his own heir. (Lady Macbeth, at least, has had a child, but no actual son of Macbeth is mentioned in the play‚Äîthe \\"babe\\" may have been a girl, or died young, or‚Äîmore likely‚Äîbeen a reference to his historical stepson Lulach, from Lady Macbeth's previous marriage, Macbeth's heir but not his own son.) Some productions show this tenderness by having Macbeth frequently pat Fleance on the head, or attempt to do so, but be denied it when Fleance withdraws to his father. This rivalry between groups of fathers and sons (Banquo and Fleance, Macduff and his son, Macbeth and his lack of a son) is seen as an important theme of the play.Rosenberg, Marvin. \\"Lady Macbeth's Indispensable Child.\\" Educational Theatre Journal. (March 1974) 26.1 pp. 14‚Äì19. One scholar views the scene as parallel to the Massacre of the Innocents, in which Herod had the children of Bethlehem killed to protect his throne. The boy's innocent image is strengthened by his mother calling him \\"poor monkey\\" and a \\"prattler\\".Charney, Maurice. All of Shakespeare. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993. pp. 288 Throughout the play, Macbeth is concerned with controlling the future. Since children are symbolic of the future, they represent his biggest threat. Macduff's son, in his bold denunciation of the murderers, is a strong symbol of the danger Macbeth faces. Paradoxically, the more Macbeth tries to rid himself of the human emotions (compassion, love) that lead to children, the less capable he is of meeting this threat and controlling his future.Stoll, Elmer Edgar. \\"Symbolism in Shakespeare.\\" The Modern Language Review. (Jan 1947) 42.1 pp. 9‚Äì23  Performances  Orson Welles' daughter, Christopher, played the role of Macduff's son in her father's controversial 1948 film adaptation of the play. In PBS's Great Performances Series' TV movie of Macbeth with Patrick Stewart as Macbeth set in a nameless 20th-century militaristic society, Macduff's son is played by Hugo Docking.

Early life  From a samurai-class family of Ashigarashimo District, Kanagawa (part of present-day Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture), Kitamura was interested in liberal politics at an early age, and played a minor role in the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. He attended the T≈çky≈ç Senmon Gakk≈ç (which later became Waseda University), but was expelled due to his radical political views. After almost a year of vigorous political activities, which occasionally involved robbery to raise funds, he started questioning the purpose of the movement and left to become a writer. He was also baptized as a Christian in 1888.  Literary career  Kitamura married Ishizaka Mina at the age of 19 in 1888, and in the same year he self- published the long verse Sosh≈´ no shi (\\"The Poem of the Prisoner\\"), which was the longest Japanese poem written in free verse up until that time. He followed this with the poetic drama H≈çrai kyoku (\\"The Drama of Mount H≈çrai\\"). He claimed to be influenced by the works of Byron, Emerson and Carlyle; his wife's Christianity also greatly influenced his outlook. Kitamura turned from poetry to essays, and wrote works extolling the \\"life-espousing views\\" of the West, over the \\"life-denying view\\" of Buddhism and traditional Japanese Shinto thought. His attempts to explore the nature of the self and the potential for the individual, particularly in his seminal work Naibu seimei ron (\\"Theory of Inner Life\\"), are regarded by some as the starting point of modern Japanese literature. Kitamura was also drawn to the Quaker movement, and founded a pacifist society, the Japan Peace Association (Êó•Êú¨Âπ≥Âíå‰ºö), in 1889. He was a close associate of Shimazaki T≈çson, whom he strongly influenced towards the romantic literary movement. Kitamura was hired as an English teacher at the Friends Girls School in 1890. He frequented the Azabu Christian Church. In 1893, he took over the post held by Shimazaki T≈çson at Meiji Girls School (now Meiji Gakuin University). He also submitted literary criticism to the literary magazine Bungakukai, which he helped launch with Shimazaki T≈çson in 1893. Around this time he began to show signs of mental instability and depression. Before dawn on 16 May 1894, Tokoku hanged himself in his garden at his home near Shiba Park in Tokyo. His grave is at the temple of Zuisho-ji in Shirokane, Tokyo.  References  * Irokawa Daikichi. Kitamura Tokoku. Tokyo Daigaku Shuppankai; (1994).

The quest is to locate and rescue the Tendricks' long-missing daughter, Andria, who was kidnapped by a mysterious cult calling themselves The Children of the Change. The entire game takes place on the island of Ahkuilon, which is home to the town of Misthaven, where Tendrick rules. As the player progresses through the story, it is revealed that Locke was once the king of an ancient empire centered on Ahkuilon. This warrior-king made a pact with a demon god, but he found the price of his wife's soul too much to bear and could not go through with her sacrifice. For this reason he was condemned by the demon god to an eternity of suffering in Anserak and his mighty empire was destroyed and pulled into the earth. The cult that the newly resurrected Locke finds himself facing is in fact led by the avatar of the same demon god he betrayed ages ago. As he explores Ahkuilon in pursuit of the missing Andria, Locke finds himself facing enemies both new and ancient. Many characters in the game hint that there is a \\"darkness\\" surrounding Locke and some even seem to know of his past. As the story builds to a climax it becomes clear that not all is as it seems and that history may yet repeat itself.  Gameplay  Revenants combat system functions slightly differently depending on the control method used. Locke can be controlled with the mouse to perform standard attacks with minimal player input. In addition, the player can use the keyboard for finer control, gaining access to three different basic attack types as well as the ability chain them into special combos, some of which result in special death animations. These specialized kill moves are enemy- specific, and range from crushing spiders with a stomp to beheading hostile swordsmen. A gamepad or joystick can also be used in a similar way to the keyboard method, with nearly every move or command able to be mapped to buttons or button combinations. In addition to permanent upgrades to his attributes, like strength and agility, Locke gains extra fighting abilities after a level threshold has been reached (every 3 levels, including levels 1 and 3 and up to level 24). It is also possible to combine certain movements into a fluid cycle of attacks. A martial arts master in town provides Locke with the necessary training when he achieves a sufficient level. In addition to melee combat, there are also a number of talismans which can be combined to cast magic spells. Certain combinations can be found in scrolls starting with basic spells and progressing to more complicated ones. Spells vary from freezing to poisoning, and certain spells lock opponents in place, allowing Locke to combine a magical attack with a special combat move. Bows cannot be found in the single-player game, but are available in multiplayer, giving players the ability to engage in ranged combat. Development Revenant underwent three name changes during development. It was first announced under the title \\"Forsaken: The Thrall of Chaos\\". The graphics were developed with Direct3D. The game was originally planned to be single-player-only. Reception In the United States, Revenant sold 37,000 copies by March 2000. Commenting on these figures, GameSpot's writer Desslock noted that the game \\"sold quite poorly\\". The game received generally positive reviews from critics. Jim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Diablo fans who need a quick fix will enjoy it, but it doesn't do much to transcend its genre.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Role-playing video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Hack and slash role-playing games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:1999 video games ","title":"Revenant (video game)"},{"id":"2744091","text":"Propriano () is a commune in the Corse-du-Sud department of France on the island of Corsica.

James brown was born in the Whitletts area of Ayr but lived most of his life in Annbank where he went to school. He had started working in pits from the age of 12 and he later would become Secretary of the Ayrshire Miners' Union and of the Scottish Miners' National Union. He unsuccessfully contested North Ayrshire in January 1910 and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Ayrshire from 1918‚Äì1931 and from 1935 until his death in 1939. He was awarded the OBE in 1917, appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1930. He was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1924, 1930 and 1931, and he also taught in the local sunday school in Annbank. He was a member of the Scottish National War Memorial committee formed in 1918 by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the Liberal Party MP Robert Munro, which was tasked with forming a permanent memorial for World War I at Edinburgh Castle. In 1927 he criticised the decision to include Walter Thomas Monnington's painting Parliamentary Union of England and Scotland, 1707 in the Palace of Westminster which he said in a debate should \\"get rid of this disgraceful picture and put something in its place which would be more true to history than it is.\\" His Labour Party colleague, Dundee MP Tom Johnston further described the outrage at the inclusion of the painting by saying \\"the only historical painting in St Stephen's Hall representing an incident in Scottish history deals with an act of national humiliation.\\" In his authorised biography Bill Shankly said that Brown won the election in South Ayrshire as the local voters \\"wouldn't vote Conservative\\" but that he was \\"too mild\\" and not a \\"keen socialist\\" for some of the more militant Labour members. He was granted the Freedom of the Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1930, and of Girvan in 1931 and was awarded an Honorary LLD by the University of Glasgow in 1931. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Ayrshire. His life story \\"From Pit To Palace\\" by Alexander Gammie was published in 1931. He was the great-great uncle of the future first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament David Steel.

It was generally an alternative to the Woodside Amusement Park in Fairmount Park until its closure. The park operated under the name Six Gun Territory from 1972. After closure, announced in April 1976, the park sat vacant until the land was cleared for a large shopping mall known as Willow Grove Park Mall, which opened in August 1982. The mall pays homage to its predecessor by displaying banners and other objects which hark back to the land's days as an amusement park; a merry-go- round built and installed in 2001 operates within the mall. Aerial view of Willow Grove Park in 1926 The park originally was conceived by one of the three Philadelphia area traction companies, the Peoples Traction Company, as a means to encourage weekend customers on the trolley line, a practice that led to the coining of the term trolley park. Willow Grove was one of the premier amusement parks in the United States for a long time, until it was eclipsed by the openings of Disneyland and other more modern theme parks beginning in the 1950s. The park was served by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co. (PRT) and later Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) Route 6 streetcar line. In its most recent configuration, Route 6 began at the Olney Terminal of the Broad Street subway, principally traversing Ogontz Avenue in the city, crossing the city line at Cheltenham Avenue, and then proceeding on private right-of-way near Limekiln Pike, street running on Keswick Avenue in Glenside, and then mostly side-of-the-road private right-of-way until reaching the park. The line was fully double-tracked. Streetcar service to the park ended in 1958 when the Pennsylvania Highway Department (predecessor to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) acquired portions of the private right-of-way near Limekiln Pike for construction of the Pennsylvania Route 309 Expressway. President's Conference Committee (PCC) design streetcars were used on Route 6 beginning in the 1940s. After the loss of trackage for the Route 309 Expressway, Route 6 was cut back to a loop and terminus at Cheltenham and Ogontz Avenues at the city line. Starting in September 1968, Route 6 streetcar service was operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) until rail service was permanently replaced by bus in 1986. One of the biggest attractions in the park was the music pavilion, at which John Philip Sousa and his band played every year, but one, between 1901 and 1926. The pavilion was demolished in March 1959. A documentary of the park was created in 1991 titled Life was a Lark at Willow Grove Park [NTSC / 1991 / 50 MINS]. The title is based on the popular park slogan \\"Life is a lark at Willow Grove Park\\". A book from Arcadia Publishing entitled Willow Grove Park (2005) includes over 200 photos of the park and is the only comprehensive history of the park. The thoroughly researched book also corrects many of the historical inaccuracies that have grown up surrounding the history of the park. In popular culture James A. Michener wrote a novel entitled The Fires of Spring, telling the story of a young orphan boy named David Harper growing up in a poorhouse in Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which is near Willow Grove. Harper works at an amusement park named Paradise which is loosely based on Michener's own experiences as a young man when he worked at Willow Grove Park. The park is referred to by Claudette Colbert in the 1934 film She Married Her Boss. Bill Cosby wrote and performed a stand-up routine called \\"Roland and the Roller Coaster,\\" describing his childhood ride on the roller coaster at Willow Grove Park.

The school includes grades 9-12 and offers a wide range of academic and extracurricular activities. It is known as an art school, drawing many students from around the Greater Toronto Area into its arts programs. The science programs are well developed, with multiple fully functional science labs.  Motto  The official motto of the school is \\"Let Talent Flourish\\", which is featured in many of the school's murals and artistic expressions, most notably a mural based on Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night, featuring the motto, hidden in the position of the stars. The motto is also featured in the 'boys' foyer'. History O'Neill CVI is the oldest secondary school in Oshawa, opened in its present location in 1909 as Oshawa High School. High school classes had been held in the Central Public School downtown for many year prior to this, so the school's roots go back well into the 19th century. The original building is still in the core of the school, but is not visible from outside. After several major expansions during the 1920s, OHS became Oshawa Collegiate and Vocational Institute in 1930. In the post-war era, when Oshawa began building other high schools, OCVI was renamed O'Neill Collegiate and Vocational Institute after long-time principal, Albert O'Neill, who had led its expansion and transition to collegiate status. O'Neill celebrated its 75th anniversary (as OCVI, though it is actually much older if the OHS days are included) in 2005 with a mural in the library and a reunion of students and teachers. Academics O'Neill is home to a Performing Arts program (PA), a Visual Arts program (VA), and a program for identified Gifted and Enriched students. PA and VA programs draw students from across Durham Region, and O'Neill was mentioned in the Toronto Star as a prestigious arts school in Southern Ontario. The Gifted program, however, only draws students from across Oshawa, as the other cities in Durham Region have their own Gifted schools. The Gifted and Enriched courses are offered from Grade 9 to Grade 11. Due to O'Neill's large numbers of Gifted and Enriched students, it far surpassed the Durham District School Board's average on the EQAO testing, to be one of the top schools in the region. On the 2016 EQAO Assessment of Mathematics, O'Neill failed to meet the DDSB average.http://ddsb.ca/Parents/HelpingYourChildSucceed/EQAO/EQAO%20Math/O%20Neill%20CVI.pdf  Library  The O'Neill CVI library has a lounge area with couches and chairs, study rooms, work desks, and books. The library features a commemorative mural, created to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the school. It features the inukshuk sculpture that was originally outside the school in the back garden. This sculpture was dismantled by unknown perpetrators after school hours and was never rebuilt.  Arts programs  O'Neill is known for its arts programs. The visual arts program is used to promote interest in visual-art based careers by introducing students to many forms of artistic media and allowing them to experiment and explore with various artistic ventures. The performing arts program is similar, but involves the study of performance-based art, (dance, drama, music, etc.) taught though the use of many public performances for both the community and the school. = Specialized visual arts program = Some art classes require students to participate in auditioning for the program which involves an interview and a letter from your former elementary school art or homeroom teacher. These normally involve specialized art styles or techniques, such as cartooning or photography. = Open studio = The visual arts department allows students to stay after school to work on art projects with the school's full roster of art supplies, or participate in various workshops, which can involve teaching by local experts on such subjects as fresco painting or wire sculpting. = Murals = There are many murals throughout the school, which are mostly created by students but occasionally by members of the art department. These include the war memorial mural in the memorial foyer, the dancers murals on the first floor, and the rainforest mural in the law hallway. Extracurricular activities O'Neill offers many extracurricular activities, such as several choirs and bands; the School Reach team; sports teams in football, soccer, rugby, cross country, curling, basketball, volleyball, golf, STAR (Students Together Against Racism), the Spirit Committee, Eco Club, the Breakfast Club, the Robotics Club, the Leadership Club, DECA, and GSA (Gay- Straight Alliance).

Port Perry High School is the oldest High School in Durham Region being first established in 1871. The school has a population of roughly 1250 students coming from many of the surrounding areas. The school is located on Rosa Street just up the road from historic downtown Port Perry. PPHS is home to the Port Perry Rebels. History Some accounts suggest the intent to establish a high school in Port Perry dates to January, 1868, when James R. Youmans corresponded with the Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, Edgerton Ryerson, regarding the appropriate textbooks required to conduct instruction of grammar school students. In September, 1868, Port Perry Grammar School opened in the second-floor room of the Common School located on Ottawa Street in Port Perry, with an enrollment of 24 boys and 2 girls. Between 1868 and 1873, enrollment fluctuated between 23 and 64 students, with a maximum of 6 girls during that period. In 1871, as a result of \\"An Act to Improve the Common and Grammar Schools of Ontario\\", the name of the Grammar School was changed to Port Perry High School. In 1873, construction began on the Port Perry Union School, a facility that would house the Public and the High School in a single location. When the new building opened at the corner of Queen and Rosa Streets, 64 students were enrolled in the Classical and the English programs offered at the High School. From 1874 to 1926, the population of the High School varied substantially, with a high of 127 students in 1880. Several Port Perry High School students fought in the Great War of 1914-18; ten students died in action during the war. A plaque was erected to honour them by the staff and students of PPHS in June, 1919. It was recently restored and is located at the south parking lot entrance of the school, outside the Library- Resource Centre. In April, 1926, a massive fired destroyed the 50-year-old structure. Lost in the flames were the entire archives of school records dating to the opening of the Grammar School in 1868 and the Common School of 1858. As well, generations of school photographs were not only lost, but probably stoked the fire that completely engulfed the school. The site of the building is commemorated by a plaque located on High School Hill, the park located at the corner of Queen and Rosa streets in Port Perry. In May, 1927, a new facility for Port Perry Public and High School opened on Rosa Street, a few steps north of the Union School site. The new school featured 11 classrooms, six for the High School and five for the Public School. The building also featured a gymnasium (the Senior Developmental classroom is now located in this space), and an assembly hall (the Drama Room currently occupies this space). The cost of construction for the \\"New School\\" was $100,000. Eight Port Perry High School students sacrificed their lives during the Second World War. A commemorative plaque in recognition of their valiant efforts also sits outside the school's Library-Resource Centre. Many of the High School's students contributed at home as well, working tirelessly on farms across Scugog and Reach Townships to contribute to the war effort. By 1952, the cornerstone to a new Public School in Port Perry was laid on Queen Street, just west of Ottawa Street. The movement of public school students to what is now R.H. Cornish Public School opened several classrooms to students enrolled in the High School's programs. However, the existing school facility did not meet the needs of the community or of the growing enrollment Port Perry High School was experiencing. Under Principal Grant MacDonald's leadership, an aggressive expansion program brought a new wing north of the existing building (with a combined gymnasium/auditorium) in 1961 and a second addition which included a second smaller gymnasium, central offices, a cafeteria, classrooms and a full technical facility in 1967. In 1998, a third phase of expansion brought a modern music education facility to PPHS (located in the old 1967 Library), and a brand new Library/Resource Centre was erected south of the 1927 building. in 2012, a fourth phase of expansion brought a new Science wing south of the Library/Resource Centre. Port Perry High School also received new Outdoor Education, Cosmetology and Culinary facilities. Rebels athletics PPHS offers Basketball, Badminton, Football, Hockey, Rugby, Wrestling, Volleyball, Golf, Soccer, Swimming, Tennis, Ultimate Frisbee, Track and Field and Cross Country. The Rebels compete in LOSSA (Lake Ontario Secondary School Athletics). The Rebels Boys' senior rugby team won an OFSAA Championship in 1999 and an OFSAA Bronze Medal in 2006. The Junior Boys' team earned a Barbarian Cup Silver Medal in 1996 and 1997. The Junior Girls' rugby team won a LOSSA Gold Medal in both 2009 and 2010. Notable graduates Several distinguished individuals have graduated from Port Perry High School since its inception in 1868. Herbert Alexander Bruce, who graduated in 1885, was a World War I surgeon to the British Armies in France, a founder of Wellesley Hospital in Toronto, the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario from 1932 to 1937, and the M.P for the riding of Toronto-Parkdale from 1940 to 1946. Several Port Perry High School Graduates are leaders in Canadian business and industry. These include George Cope, 1981 (President and CEO, Bell Canada Entreprises). Neurologist Vladimir Hachinski, 1968, is an international authority on stroke prevention. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2008 \\"for his contributions to the field of neurology, notably as a clinician and researcher in the field of stroke and dementia.\\" George Burnett attended the school as a student, later taught at the school, and coached the Edmonton Oilers.

James Grant Duff states that he was called \\"the Maratha Machiavelli\\" by the Europeans. Early life Balaji Janardan Bhanu was born in a Chitpavan Brahmin family in Satara in 1742 and was nicknamed 'Nana'. His grandfather Balaji Mahadaji Bhanu had migrated from a village called Velas near Shrivardhan during the days of the First Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath Bhat. The Bhats and the Bhanus had family relations and a very good friendship existed between them. The two families had respectively inherited the 'Mahajan' or village-head positions of the towns of Velas and Shrivardhan. Balaji Mahadji had once saved the Peshwa from a murderous plot by the Mughals. The Peshwa therefore recommended Chattrapati Shahu to award the title of Phadnavis (one of the Ashtapradhan) on Bhanu. Later, when the Peshwa became the de facto head of state, Phadnavis became the main minister who held key portfolios of Administration and Finance for the Maratha Empire during the Peshwa regime. Nana was the grandson of Balaji Mahadji Bhanu and had inherited his grandfather's name, keeping up with the tradition. The Peshwa treated him like family and extended to him the same facilities of education and diplomatic training as his sons, Vishwasrao, Madhavrao, and Narayanrao. He continued to be the Phadnavis, or the finance minister, for the Peshwa. Peshwa administration Nana Fadnavis In 1761, Nana escaped to Pune from the Third Battle of Panipat and rose to great heights, becoming a leading personage directing the affairs of the Maratha Confederacy, although he was never a soldier himself. This was a period of political instability as one Peshwa was rapidly succeeded by another, and there were many controversial transfers of power. Nana Phadnavis played a pivotal role in holding the Maratha Confederacy together in the midst of internal dissension and the growing power of the British East India Company. Peshwa Madhav Rao Narayan with Nana Fadnavis. Nana's administrative, diplomatic, and financial skills brought prosperity to the Maratha Empire and his management of external affairs kept the Maratha Empire away from the thrust of the British East India Company. He displayed his best warfare skills in various battles won by Maratha forces against the Nizam of Hyderabad, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the English Army. After the assassination of Peshwa Narayanrao in 1773, Nana Phadnavis managed the affairs of the state with the help of a twelve-member regency council known as the Barbhai council. The council was Nana's mastermind plan to protect Madhavrao II, son of Narayanrao, born posthumously to Gangabai, the widow of Narayanrao, from the Peshwa family's internal conflicts. The Barbhai Council was an alliance of influential Sardars (generals) led by Nana. Other members of the council were Haripant Phadke, Moroba Phadnis, Sakaram Bapu Bokil, Trimbakraomama Pethe, Mahadji Shinde, Tukojirao Holkar, Phaltankar, Bhagwanrao Pratinidhi, Maloji Ghorpade, Sardar Raste, and Babuji Naik. During this time, the Maratha Empire was significant in size with a number of vassal states under a treaty of protection who recognized the Peshwa as the supreme power. Nana died at Pune on the 13th of March, 1800. Following his death, Peshwa Baji Rao II placed himself in the hands of the British, provoking the Second Anglo-Maratha War that began the breakup of the Maratha confederacy. Menavali palace Rear entrance to Nana Phadanvis' house (Nana phadanvis wada) which is still preserved today in the same condition as when Nana built it in 1780. Location: Menawali near Wai in Satara district of Maharashtra. Bhavan Rao Trymbak Pant Pratinidhi of Aundh and Raghunath Ghanshyam Mantri (of Satara) bestowed the village of Menavali upon Nana Phadnavis in December 1768. Nana Phadnavis settled the village and built a Wada (A mansion with inner courtyards), a Ghat (steps) leading from the mansion to the Krishna river, and two temples, one dedicated to Lord Vishnu and another to Meneshwar (‡§Æ‡•á‡§£‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) Lord Shiva. The architectural combination of a wada-type residence, a ghat on a waterbody, and a temple was typical of the Peshwa era. However, most of these palatial structures fell into disuse and disrepair after the lands and estates of the owners were taken away by the government after India became a republic in 1947. The Nana Phadnavis Wada on the bank of the river Krishna at Menavali is one of the very rare places where such a combination is preserved intact. The Nana Phadnavis wada is a large structure with six quadrangles, or courtyards, and a perimeter-protection wall. This construction of the complex was completed around 1780. Other notable wadas nearby are the Raste Wada and Ranade wada in Wai. After Nana Phadnavis died in 1800, the Peshwa Bajirao-II confiscated the wada. The British General Wellesley (brother of Lord Wellesley), Duke of Wellington, returned the property to Nana's wife Jeeubai on 25 March, 1804. After her death, Sir Bartle Frere (governor of Bombay) handed over the property to Nana's descendants. The Nana Phadnavis wada today remains with his descendants. Having split the major part of his properties between themselves, the wada is still owned jointly by them all. Ghats, which were originally nothing more than simple stone steps descending into a river, evolved during the Peshwa era into an elaborate arrangement of terraces with separate areas for different activities such as bathing, washing, filling water, and performing religious rites. Temples were traditionally built on ghats. Nana, being the Peshwas' \\"Phadnavis\\", transcribed and maintained their documents of accounts and administrative letters in the ancient \\"Modi\\" script. These documents, known as the famous \\"Menavli Daptar\\", were preserved in the wada at Menavali. There is a dark, musty, narrow, steep staircase concealed in the metre-thick wall, leading to the floor above. The staircase was once secret and easily secured, admitting only one person at a time into Nana Phadnavis's darbar hall. Nana Phadnavis's reception \\"darbar\\" hall has an attached bedroom with a teakwood bedstead. The bedstead is an intricately carved four-poster. The floor is paved with clay and cow dung. Wadas are systems of open courtyards with increased security. Nana's corridors on the upper floor are lined with teakwood lattice work. A concealed escape stairway in the wall leads out of the wada. Descending the stone steps leads to the ghat on the river Krishna. On descending the steps and turning right, one sees a peaceful and rather drab view of Pandavgarh in the distance. The bell house of the Meneshwar temple houses a six-hundred-and-fifty-kilogram bell. This bell was captured by Bajirao I‚Äôs brother Chimaji Appa from a cathedral in the Portuguese fort at Bassein. Dating from 1707, the five-alloy bell bears a bas- relief of Mary carrying the infant Jesus Christ cast into it. An ancient tree with a massive coniform trunk has a platform constructed around it as old as the wada itself. This tree featured in the Bollywood movie Swades. In the movie, the village elders hold a Panchayat on the stone platform around this tree. Several Bollywood movies have been shot there, using the wada as an exotic location, notably Yudh (Jackie Shroff/Tina Munim), Mrityudand (Madhuri Dixit), Goonj Uthi Shehnai, Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hain (Govinda), Gangaajal (Ajay Devgan), Sarja (Ajinkya Deo), and Swades (Shahrukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi). The film crew of the movie Swades once camped at the ghat to shoot some footage. The crew cleaned and painted the old stone walls of the ghat and the temples.

History Arthur Harbour was roughly charted by the French Antarctic Expedition (1903‚Äì1905) under Jean-Baptiste Charcot. It was surveyed in more detail in 1955 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), who established a station near the head of the harbour. It was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) in 1956 after Oswald Raynor Arthur, then Governor of the Falkland Islands. =Station N= Arthur Harbour was the location of the British research Station N, which was active from 28 February 1955 to 10 January 1958. The Station was loaned to the United States government in June 1963. In January 1965, it was converted into a biological laboratory for use by American personnel from nearby Palmer Station. Station N was destroyed by fire on 28 December 1971, while under renovation by the British Antarctic Survey. The debris was removed in 1991, and only concrete foundations now remain.  Geography  alt= A number of features in and around Arthur Harbour were named and charted by various Antarctic surveys and expedition groups. Prior to 2005, Norsel Point was considered the northern headland of Arthur Harbour, but is now considered a part of Amsler Island, just off the coast. Bonaparte Point, named by Charcot for Roland-Napol√©on Bonaparte, marks the southern edge of Arthur Harbour. In addition to Amsler Island, Humble Island, Litchfield Island, Torgersen Island, and Dietrich Island are all off the coast of Arthur Harbour. =Important Bird Area= Some 214 ha of land and sea in northern Arthur Harbour, about 1‚Äì2 km north-west of Palmer Station, was listed as Important Bird Area (IBA) number 013 by BirdLife International until being delisted in 2015. The site comprised Norsel Point, Humble Island, Breaker Island, Elephant Rocks and Torgersen Island, along with the intervening marine zone. Some of the islands have been designated Restricted Zones within ASMA 7: Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin. The site was an IBA because it supports colonies of breeding seabirds, including Ad√©lie penguins (11,500 pairs), macaroni penguins, southern giant petrels and imperial shags. Litchfield Island remains listed as IBA number 014.

Matth√§us Schiner (or Schinner, c. 1465 ‚Äì 1 October 1522) was a bishop of Sion, Cardinal and diplomat. He was a military commander in several battles in northern Italy. Biography He was born in M√ºhlebach (in what is now the Swiss canton of Valais), the son of the farmer and carpenter Peter Schiner and Katharina Zmitweg; his uncle Nicholas Schiner, later Bishop of Sion (Sitten), gave him his early instruction. He embraced the ecclesiastical career, and eventually became parish priest of Aernen (1496), and canon and dean of the cathedral of Sion. When his uncle resigned, he was made Bishop of Sion (20 September 1499). Schinner's diplomatic skill and his influence on the allied Swiss Confederacy made him the right hand of Pope Julius II and Pope Leo X in their efforts to unite Italy and expel the French. In 1511, as a result of an alliance brought about by Schiner, the Swiss made two unsuccessful campaigns against Milan. As a reward for securing this alliance, he was made Bishop of Novara and also cardinal in 1511. In 1512, as papal legate for Italy and Germany, he was; appointed commander of a Swiss and Venetian army, drove the French from Milan and established Maximilian Sforza as duke. However, as Louis XII again captured Milan after the death of Julius II, Schiner once more took the field at the head of the Swiss Confederates, and defeated the French in the battle of Novara (1513). The Duke of Milan rewarded Schiner with the margraviate of Vigevano. When under Francis I of France the French recrossed the Alps, Schiner led the Swiss troops, part of which had retired, at the unfortunate battle of Marignano (1515). In 1516 he raised another army with the aid of England, but was unable to regain Milan. He now sought to attain his end by an alliance between the pope, the emperor, England, and Spain, for which purpose he went himself in 1516 to London, but the reconciliation of the Swiss Confederacy and the emperor with France made the alliance abortive. During his long absence from home the French party there, under his bitter enemy George Supersax, raised a rebellion and drove him from Sion. He lived for several years at Zurich (1517‚Äì19), and thenceforth mostly at the court of the emperor. He supported the election of Emperor Charles V in 1519, for which he was made bishop of Catania in Sicily (November 1520). In 1521 he led an army of Swiss Confederates in the imperial campaign against Francis I for the possession of Milan. But for his passionate hatred of France, he would have been elected the successor of Leo X; however, Pope Adrian VI called him to Rome as administrator of the States of the Church. He died there of the plague without having seen his diocese again. His varied and large scattered correspondence is the only literary work he left. The date of his birth has been disputed, as the statements concerning it differ nearly twenty years. The year is unknown, and all direct indications are lacking. We know, however, that he attended the School of Lupulus at Bern, which was not opened until 1493. As Schiner was a priest in 1492, the year of his birth could not be later than 1470.

Battle of the Little Big Horn It has been written that during the battle, Lame White Man wore a captured cavalry jacket, which was found tied to the cantle of a saddle. This account is disputed by his grandson, John Stands In Timber. He stated that he wore nothing during the battle but a blanket tied to his waist and moccasins. This information was told to him by his grandmother Twin Woman. Lame White Man was shot and killed by U.S. soldiers on the west slope of Battle Ridge, where he had led a charge. Later a Miniconjou Lakota warrior (believed to be Little Crow) mistook him for an Army Indian scout and scalped him before realizing his mistake.

He also designed and built an early mechanical calculator.  Life Much of the knowledge of Fowler comes from his son, the Reverend Hugh Fowler, who produced a biography of his father which was published in the Transactions of the Devonshire Association in 1875.Fowler, 1875 He was born in 1777 in Great Torrington, Devon and lived his whole life there. His father was a cooper and he received a basic education at a local school. At about the age of 13 he was apprenticed to a fellmonger. He was largely self-taught, with a particular interest in mathematics, teaching himself from such works as John Ward's Young Mathematician's Guide and Nicholas Saunderson's work on fluxions: The Method of Fluxions. He established himself as printer and bookseller, later becoming a partner in and manager of the local bank. He was also the treasurer of the Torrington Poor Law Union.Fowler, 1875, p.172-3 He married Mary Copp in 1813 and they had eleven children, many of whom died before reaching adulthood. He died on 31 March 1843 of Dropsy of the Chest. Fowler has a memorial window in the Chapel of St James in the Church of St Michael and All Angels in his native Great Torrington. The window was commissioned by his son Hugh around 1864. The border shows two of his inventions: the thermosiphon and a calculating machine. InventionsThermosiphon= Fowler patented the thermosiphon in 1828 (British patent number 5711). It was the first convective heating system. A system based on his design was installed at Bicton, part of the Rolle Estate and received great acclaim in the Gardener's Magazine of 1829. Unfortunately due to innate flaws in the patent system of the time (under which a new version of a design with minimal changes was not covered by the original patent), the thermosiphon was copied by numerous other manufacturers and Fowler did not have sufficient funds to conduct legal proceedings. =Binary and Ternary Tables= As treasurer of the Poor Law Union, Fowler had to calculate poor law rates for each of the parishes. To do this he needed to know the value of each parish relative to the Union as a whole, and then knowing the overall fees to be collected by the entire Union, calculate the fraction that each parish owes. These calculations were made much more complicated due to the pre-decimal currency system in use the time meaning that all values had to be converted to farthings before doing any calculations and then converted back into pounds, shillings and pence afterwards. To assist with these calculations he devised a system using lower bases to simplify the calculations and in 1838 he published Tables for Facilitating Arithmetical Calculations. This contained a table of binary numbers for values from 1 to 130048, and a table of balanced ternary numbers from 1 to 3985807 along with instructions on how to use the tables to simplify the types of calculations he needed to perform. =Calculating machine= In 1840 Fowler produced a mechanical calculating machine which operated using balanced ternary arithmetic. This machine was designed to give mechanical form to the techniques described in his book, Tables for Facilitating Arithmetical Calculations. The choice of balanced ternary allowed the mechanisms to be simple, though the values had to be converted to balanced ternary before processing and the results converted back to decimal at the end of the calculation. Apprehensive in case his ideas should again be stolen, he designed and built the machine single-handed from wood in the workshop attached to his printing business. To compensate for the limited precision achievable using wooden components, he constructed the machine on a large scale; it was 6 feet long by 3 feet deep and 1 foot high (1800 x 900 x 300 mm). The use of balanced ternary meant that the machine was not suitable for performing addition and subtraction because of the overhead of the conversion to and from base 10. It was more useful for problems (like those Thomas Fowler needed to solve as Treasurer of the Poor Law union) where there are a large number of intermediate calculations in between the conversions to and from ternary. It could perform both multiplication and division. An improved model, created in 1842 was exhibited in the museum of King's College London for a time. Fowler was advised that he should construct a new machine in metal but he was not able to afford it and the government refused to provide any support. The machine was dismantled and returned to his son some time after Fowler's death.Fowler, 1875, p.173-4 Though the machine did not survive to the present day, a replica has been constructed from a two-page description of it made in the 1840's by the prominent mathematician Augustus DeMorgan. Starting in 1999 a team of Mark Glusker, Pamela Vass and David Hogan created a concept model of the most simple machine that satisfies the description written by Augustus DeMorgan. The completed model was presented to the Great Torrington Museum in August 2000. This replica now resides at the Science Museum in London. The team are looking for funding to find more evidence about the machine's operation and appearance, and then to build the entire 55-digit machine that Fowler envisioned using techniques and materials more appropriate to the 19th century.

In May 2014, it was announced that McAlpine was expecting her first child and Fiz temporarily departed on 14 November 2014, returning on 19 June 2015. In November 2017, McAlpine took a break from filming to take part in the 17th series of the ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and her exit aired on 18 December 2017, she returned on 2 March 2018. In April 2018, McAlpine announced that she is expecting her second child; she took maternity leave from the show on 5 December 2018 and returned on 30 August 2019. Fiz initially appeared as a troubled teenager briefly fostered by Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) at the age of 16. She later started working at the Underworld factory. Fiz was involved in a murder storyline in which her husband John Stape (Graeme Hawley), committed three murders and had Fiz help him bury the bodies. She had to implicate other people in order to cover for John. She gave birth to her daughter Hope prematurely, in the live 50th anniversary episode with McAlpine becoming the first actress to act out a birth live on a soap opera. Storylines Fiz's first appearance was as a troubled sixteen-year-old fostered by Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Her boisterous attitude clashes with the pair and Roy gets angry with her when she starts a small fire in the flat while cooking chips. Fiz claims Roy hit her; the claim is quickly dismissed and Fiz is sent to another foster family. Fiz reappears a few months later, having dropped out of school, and gets a job as a machinist at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory. She is initially dismissive of Roy and Hayley, but when Hayley is held on remand for kidnapping Wayne Hayes (Gary Damer), a boy the Croppers were trying to save from his abusive stepfather, she changes her mind, recognising the Croppers are the only parental figures who truly cared for her, and takes it upon herself to look after Roy in Hayley's absence. Fiz made her interest in Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) clear, kissing him. When his fianc√©, Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie), found out, she broke up with him, and Tyrone and Fiz became a couple. When Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), the son of Tyrone's surrogate parents Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera (Elizabeth Dawn), is arrested on a false assault charge after coming out of hiding to take Jack to hospital, Fiz sells the story to the newspapers. The Duckworths are initially angry but it results in a witness coming forward to clear Terry. Fiz convinces Mike to use some designs she has done at the factory but she has accidentally plagiarised other designers and Mike sacks her. She stages a topless protest on the roof of the factory, which results in her getting her job back but sees Tyrone break up with her. Fiz is nearly arrested on a trip to Blackpool with Tyrone, Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), since unknown to the others Kirk has broken into the caravan they are using. When Maria leaves town, Fiz moves into her old room in the flat above the salon, sharing with Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor), who soon becomes a close friend. She sleeps with Kirk but believes he would not be interested in a relationship; Toyah manages to convince the pair to become a couple. Maria returns and is unhappy to find herself not only sharing with Fiz but with Kirk in regular attendance. Fiz is caught in the middle when Maria becomes pregnant by Toyah's boyfriend John Arnley (Paul Warriner) and supports her when she has an abortion. Toyah leaves town not long afterwards, after saying a fond farewell to Fiz. Fiz subsequently finds herself called on to play agony aunt to a succession of unlucky in love flatmates: Maria, Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) and Claire Casey (Julia Haworth). Fiz becomes friends with Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) and is one of the few people to believe he is innocent of assaulting corrupt policeman Mick Hopwood (Ian Gain). Les introduces Fiz and Kirk to his new girlfriend, who turns out to be Fiz's mother Cilla (Wendi Peters). Fiz learns Cilla has left her younger brother Chesney (Sam Aston) home alone and Les brings him to live on the street. When Fiz and Kirk break up, Tyrone declares his interest again. Fiz and Tyrone sleep together but are interrupted by Tyrone serenading her with \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". Both Kirk and Tyrone propose: Tyrone hires a horse to do so on horseback, while Kirk steals an expensive ring from a jeweller's. When Fiz finds out, she enlists Tyrone to return the ring secretly and Kirk is let off with a caution. Despite not getting engaged, Fiz reunites with Kirk. Kirk's parents emigrate and sign their kennel business over to him. He and Fiz move into the adjacent house but Fiz is not happy looking after dogs and soon moves out. Kirk instead employs Molly Compton (Vicky Binns), a girl Fiz bullied at school to cope with being bullied herself. Molly considers taking Kirk off Fiz as payback but ends up dating Tyrone instead. When first Cilla and then Les leave the area, Fiz moves into No. 5 with Kirk and Chesney. Eventually, Fiz is reacquainted with her first boyfriend, John Stape (Graeme Hawley), who is now working at Weatherfield High School. Fiz leaves Kirk, declining his proposal of marriage, and starts dating John, moving back into the salon flat with him. When John begins an affair with student, Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan), Fiz thinks he is having an affair with Rosie's mother, Sally (Sally Dynevor), whom he has been teaching. However, the truth is revealed on Christmas Day 2007, when John inadvertently mixes up Fiz and Rosie's presents. When Fiz returns, she is shocked to learn what has happened but bravely decides to move on with her life and applies to be Chesney's guardian. Chesney and his beloved Great Dane, Schmeichel are allowed to return home after Fiz moves into No. 5. Initially, she clashes with Kirk's girlfriend, Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). While she is happy that Kirk has moved on, she is unhappy with Julie's attempts to be Chesney's carer, feeling that it is her job. After a few months, they become friends. Fiz receives numerous unknown phone calls. She discovers that it is ex-boyfriend, John, seeking a reconciliation, but declines his requests. He takes a job with StreetCars so he can be close to her, and buys Chesney a bike for his birthday. Fiz and John become friends again and she soon agrees to give him another chance. However, Fiz ends things when she realises that he wants them to move into his grandmother's house in the countryside. Fiz becomes worried when he constantly claims that he has to go to his grandmother's house to 'feed the cat' and eventually discovers that he is holding Rosie hostage there, supposedly for ruining his relationship with Fiz. Fiz releases Rosie, and John is arrested for kidnap and false imprisonment. John continues to send Fiz cards and letters while he is on remand, and is eventually sentenced to 2 years in prison. Soon after John's kidnapping of Rosie is revealed, Fiz receives some bad news about Chesney. He and Kirk are visiting Cilla in South Africa (their adventures are shown in Coronation Street: Out of Africa) and Cilla tells Fiz that Chesney has been in an accident. When Fiz arrives, she is very upset to see Chesney in a wheelchair. She is relieved, yet angry, when they tell her that it is a scam to win a Sunshine Families competition with a ¬£500,000 prize. Fiz later returns to Weatherfield. Fiz decides that she still loves John and wants to marry him. She proposes to him by writing a message so that she is allowed into the prison, after talking about him being on suicide watch. Fiz is allowed to see John briefly and as he is led away, Fiz asks him if he will marry her. John instantly agrees. John later sends Fiz his grandmother's engagement ring and a visiting order. She sees him and he places the engagement ring on her finger. Fiz and John marry on 28 September 2009. The wedding is held in the prison chapel but Fiz cannot go through with the ceremony without Chesney's support, revealing that all of their friends and neighbours are against the marriage. John does his best to persuade Fiz to go ahead regardless but she refuses, walking out and collapsing in tears outside the prison. Just as it seems that Fiz's big day is doomed, Chesney arrives with Roy and Hayley. He apologises to Fiz and he is there when Fiz and John marry. Fiz is shocked to hear of the letters that John has written to the Street residents, informing them that he will soon be released and asks for their backing to live there with Fiz. The street is split down the middle: for instance, the Croppers agree, but Eddie Windass (Steve Huison) (despite never having met John and baked his and Fiz's wedding cake) is against it. When Sally learns of the letters, she is left fuming and angrily organises a protest meeting in The Rovers for that evening. At the meeting, Sally gives a speech against John, wanting residents to write back and refuse his request, which Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) completely backs. However, Roy fights John's corner, with Ken Barlow (William Roache) pointing out that John is entitled to live wherever he wants and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) outright supports him, to the disgust of Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones). As Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) expresses his neutralness, Fiz gives an impassioned speech about how John is sorry and wants to set things right, pointing out how Sally and Rosie have been compensated for John's actions. Fiz's speech is applauded by the majority of residents, much to the disgust of Sally and Dev. The residents all write back, with the overwhelming majority agreeing to let him return to Weatherfield. In mid-November, John is released. Sally, furious that John has moved back to the street, paints the windows of No. 5 black during the night. Fiz, furious, wants to phone the police - particularly after Sally admits what she has done in front of witnesses - but John refuses. He and Fiz spend the day scraping the paint off and accept Graeme's help in repainting the upstairs of the house to match. Rosie does not seem to care that he is living across the street until, swindled out of her compensation by Luke Strong (Craig Kelly), the acting owner of Underworld whom she had been having a fling with, she tells John that she has decided to return to college and study to be a doctor. She asks him for ¬£50,000 to fund this and is stunned when he refuses so she tries blackmailing him, claiming that he had grabbed her and locked her in Roy's Rolls, where he is now working. Sally and Kevin call the police and John is arrested but released pending further inquiries. That night in the pub, he challenges Rosie about her version of events and, when unable to answer his questions, she reveals that she has lied. Furious, Kevin orders her to apologise the next day and withdraw her statement to the police. Sally also apologises to John and Fiz and asks them not to press charges. John agrees but Fiz is openly angry. The Stapes and the Websters both agree to stay out of each other's way. John meets one of his ex-teacher colleagues, Colin Fishwick (David Crellin), in the caf√©, who invites him and Fiz to his leaving party before he emigrates to Canada. Whilst at the party, Colin makes it clear to John that he wants to stop teaching. John thinks up a plan to start teaching again himself, by stealing Colin's identity as he has a clean CRB. Fiz is initially incredulous when John tells her about his plans but, because she loves John, she soon weakens and agrees to go along with his plan. They both agree to keep the truth from Chesney, who has not been particularly fond of John since his affair with Rosie. Eventually, Fiz sees what risk John is taking and they begin to row. Fiz later leaves to go on holiday, alone. Fiz returns from her holiday and announces that she is 12 weeks pregnant with their first child. The couple make up and John promises to never lie to her again. Fiz goes into labour only six months into her pregnancy following injury in the explosion of Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and Leanne Battersby's (Jane Danson) bar, The Joinery, so she is sent to hospital and gives birth to a baby girl, whom she names Hope. Straight after her birth, Hope is transferred into an incubator as she is three months premature. Due to her prematurity, her immune system is failing and is diagnosed with an infection. Fiz is told that Hope will need a transfusion in order to fight the infection. John has a breakdown following his involvement in three deaths, unbeknownst to Fiz. Fiz is left at home alone with baby Hope, who has now been allowed to leave the hospital. Joy Fishwick (Doreen Mantle), Colin's mother, asked her solicitor to track down her son before her death, and \\"Colin\\" is tracked at Number 5. Horrified, Fiz forces herself to pretend to be Mrs. Fishwick. The solicitor informs Fiz of Joy's death and that she has left her fortune to Colin. John returns home in March 2011 and things seem to look up, but John realises all of the new things that Fiz has bought, which she dishonestly explains are from money she received when the factory girls had a whip-round for her. In April 2011, John decides to stop taking his medication, despite Dr. Matt Carter's (Oliver Mellor) objection. Joy's solicitor turns up at No. 5, with Fiz having to pose as Mrs. Fishwick again. The solicitor reveals that Joy's house had been sold and the money is to be transferred into Fiz's (i.e. Mrs. Fishwick's) bank account. John is furious with Fiz for what she has done, thinking it is all over for him. John suffers another breakdown, locking himself in the bookies, after which he runs away. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Dr. Carter suggest that they call the police, but Fiz, knowing the potential imprisonment of both her and John, decides to wait and see if he returns. The police arrive at Fiz's home to notify her and Chesney that John had been caught on CCTV boarding a ferry at Holyhead. Eventually, Fiz confesses her role in the crime and so the police arrest Fiz for Colin's murder. At the police station, Fiz is interviewed for the murder. She is taken into custody but is released and then attends Magistrates' Court. The incident is deemed too serious, so she is sent to Crown Court. Fiz is charged with three murders after John flees the country to Ireland. Fiz is remanded in custody and faces trial at Crown court. Fiz is denied bail and is sent straight to prison to await trial. Fiz struggles with life in prison and to cope without Hope, who has been left in the care of Roy and Hayley. She is offered a place in the Mother and Baby unit, but refuses as she feels it is no place to bring her baby up. She becomes even more distressed when she is forced to do some cleaning in the mother and baby unit, as seeing other mums with their babies upsets her and reminds her of her daughter. Fiz soon changes her mind and requests a place in the unit, but is forced to wait. Horrified when she finds her cellmate, Ginny Portis (Ashley McGuire), unconscious from a drug overdose, Fiz is shocked to discover that her friend Ruth Walsh (Rebecca Callard) has supplied the drugs. When Fiz plans to reveal Ruth's drug supply to the governor, Ruth threatens to make her life a misery. Fiz eventually gets a place in the mother and baby unit, but is beaten up by Ruth and other girls when Ruth is removed from the unit for dealing drugs. Ruth and her friends continue to torment Fiz. After Ruth trashes her room, Fiz stands up to her and tells her to keep away from she and Hope. Upon learning the date of Fiz's trial, it is revealed to the audience that John has returned. Spotting Rosie from his car, who is trying to sell her boyfriend Jason's flat, he poses as a potential buyer named Mr. Chips. He turns up at the flat and ties Rosie up, insisting that it is all her fault that he and Fiz are so miserable and trying to force her to turn up at the court and tell them that it is John who is responsible for the deaths, allowing him to release Fiz but not go to prison himself. His plan fails, however, and he has to drive away at a high speed and crashes his car. Fiz's trial begins and she provides her evidence before the jury leave to consider their verdicts. Fiz is found not guilty of the murders of Joy and Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley), but the jury find her guilty of Colin's murder. Fiz later learns that John has returned, but is in a critical condition in hospital after his car accident. Fiz goes to the hospital and tells John that she forgives him for everything he has done. John gives the police his statement and he then dies from his injuries. Fiz then breaks down in tears and whispers to him that he will always be \\"her John\\". Unfortunately, John was too late. Fiz is sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 15 years. Fiz and Chesney are devastated. Fiz asks Chesney to organise John's funeral. He initially refuses, but after his girlfriend, Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote), convinces him to, he agrees. Chesney later receives a phone call from Fiz saying that she has been granted bail before her review. Fiz later begins a feud with Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede) after she nearly slices Fiz's fingers off at work using a sewing machine. When Kirsty later attacks Fiz in her own home, Fiz realises that Kirsty is beating up her fianc√© Tyrone. Fiz helps Tyrone through his dilemma with Kirsty but ends up developing feelings for him and they begin an affair. When Kirsty beats up Tyrone again, Fiz advises Tyrone to marry Kirsty so he can gain custody of his daughter Ruby. Kirsty accepts Tyrone's proposal but discovers Fiz and Tyrone's affair the day before the wedding. She humiliates the pair at the church, as many of the residents watch as Kirsty reveals Fiz is Tyrone's mystery lover. During an argument at the top of the stairs, Kirsty attempts to hit Tyrone again but ends up falling down the stairs. Fiz, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain), Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver), Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) and Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst) race round to the house to see what has happened, and Kirsty tells the police that Tyrone has been abusing her for months. Tyrone is arrested, which devastates Fiz. Tyrone's court hearing arrives, and Kirsty's mother Alison (Dawn Hope) tries to persuade Kirsty to tell the truth, but she refuses. After Kirsty assaults Julie, Kirsty confesses to the jury that she has been beating Tyrone. Tyrone is freed and Kirsty is sent to prison. Fiz is later distraught to hear that Hayley has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. There is further devastation when Fiz is told that Hayley's tumour is terminal, and only has six to twelve months to live. Fiz promises Hayley that she will take care of Roy after she has died. Fiz and Tyrone are present at Roy's birthday party in The Rovers on 20 September 2013, and Fiz asks Hayley and Roy whether they would like to spend more time with Hope and Ruby, which they both accept gladly. Fiz is puzzled when Hayley walks out on Roy and moves in with her and Tyrone. Unknown to Fiz, Hayley has recently told Roy that when her cancer spreads, she intends on ending her own life. While Fiz and Tyrone are at work, Hayley collapses at home and when Fiz returns, she calls for an ambulance. She accompanies Roy to the hospital and is told that Hayley has an infection. Following the incident, Hayley moves back in with Roy. In January 2014, Fiz is devastated when she learns from Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) that Hayley has died. Fiz is unaware, however, that Hayley committed suicide after drinking a lethal cocktail. She and Tyrone rush over to the caf√© flat, where Fiz finds Hayley's corpse on the bed with Roy's arm around her. Chesney later arrives, and he, Fiz, Tyrone, Anna and Carla Connor (Alison King) all try to help Roy through his grief. A few days later, Roy is struggling to come to terms with Hayley's death, but Fiz learns that Hayley killed herself, and angrily confronts Roy and shouts at him. Anna tries to get through to Fiz that it is what Hayley wanted and that it was not assisted suicide, but Fiz only listens to Carla. On the day of Hayley's funeral, Fiz, Carla, and Anna try and persuade Roy to attend, as he is refusing. He eventually attends, but in the middle of Fiz's eulogy, Roy stands up and interrupts her speech. He tells the upset residents that Hayley was the love of his life and that he will miss her dearly, which relieves Fiz, Carla, and Anna, as they all thought he was going to tell them about Hayley's suicide. Following the funeral, Roy leaves Fiz and Anna a note explaining that he has gone to visit his mother Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) for a while. The pair start to panic, however, when a pipe bursts at the caf√© and realize that Roy has been away for 10 days. They call Sylvia, but her sister Jean answers the phone and explains that she hasn't heard from Roy is six months and that Sylvia is in Tenerife. Fiz calls the police, and they explain Roy's situation, without revealing Hayley's suicide. When the police leave, Fiz and Anna have many arguments about his whereabouts, as Tyrone tries to calm the bickering women down. When they get home, Fiz reveals to a stunned Tyrone that she believes that Roy is dead. In mid- February, Roy returns with no explanation of his whereabouts. He later explains that he has been stopping in a hotel by a steam museum. Fiz is later concerned when Roy doesn't come out of his flat, and that he keeps making continuous trips to the toy shop. It is revealed that he is building a model railway track, which puzzles Fiz, but fascinates Tyrone and Chesney. In October 2014, Cilla returns to the street and reveals that she is seriously ill, suffering from osteoporosis. Although Fiz is sympathetic towards her mother, Chesney cannot forgive her for the way she treated him as a child, especially when his son, Joseph (Lucca-Owen Warwick), suffers a minor injury, whilst in her care. When Cilla reveals that she has been advised to attend a clinic in Wolverhampton, so that they can help her recover, Fiz decides to go and look after her mother, leaving Hope and Ruby in Tyrone's care. On Christmas Day, Tyrone, Hope, and Ruby go to stay with Fiz and Cilla for a few days and on his return, Tyrone reveals that Hope and Ruby will be staying with Fiz, for a while. In October 2015, it is revealed Hope is suffering from a type of childhood cancer called neuroblastoma, plunging Fiz and Tyrone into panic. Hope was eventually cured, but Fiz and Tyrone's insistence to provide a perfect Christmas to her in case it turned out to be her last. This later gave them financial issues. In August 2019, Hope is referred to a specialist school due to her disruptive behaviour and is home taught by care worker Jade Rowan, who moves in with Fiz and Tyrone. Jade begins to orchestrate incidents with the intention of letting the blame fall on Hope in order to cause a rift between her and Fiz, while manipulating Hope into thinking she is on her side. Jade is later revealed to be the daughter of John Stape and has been attempting to avenge his death, feeling that Fiz caused his downfall and that Hope is not safe with her as a result. She enlists the help of social services in order to have Hope taken away, lying that Hope has been physically abused by Fiz at home. Creation Fiz initially appeared as a troubled teenager briefly fostered by Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) at the age of fifteen. She leaves and then returns to Coronation Street, and starts working at the Underworld factory. Her nickname is presumably due to her distinctive afro-like hair, however she was born as Fiona. Her mother, Cilla (Wendi Peters) and her little brother, Chesney (Sam Aston) are introduced when they come to live on the street with Les Battersby (Bruce Jones). Fiz has a bad history with her mother, who has often left her in care and never prioritised her children. Fiz Brown as she appeared in 2001.The character first appears onscreen during the episode broadcast on 22 April 2001. The character of Fiz is a good-hearted young woman who has made many puzzling decisions and is often unlucky in love. Actress Jennie McAlpine stated that she would prefer the character to stay unlucky in love because she enjoys portraying the rowing and screaming that comes with it rather than seeing her character living happily ever after. Fiz's personality has taken some rapid transformations over the years. Starting out as a dopey teenage tearaway, she is now responsible for her younger brother, constantly trying to do the right thing by him and sometimes failing. When interviewed about this on the soap opera's official website, McAlpine stated: \\"I like Fiz, I think she is a good person. I know she does get it wrong sometimes, but she is just trying, she's just trying to get it all right, she doesn't always but she does try.\\" During the same interview she then said: \\"Oh, Fiz has changed over the years. Luckily she's changed because I don't think I'd be here if she hadn't because she started off being a pretty, pretty bad girl actually, causing loads of trouble for Roy and Hayley.\\" Development In November 2012, The Sun newspaper reported that romance will blossom for the old flames as Fiz continues to support Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) through his domestic violence ordeal with girlfriend Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede). It was reported that Kirsty would deliberately cause injury to Fiz's hand, according to the Daily Star, Fiz would attempt to fix her machine at the factory when it breaks only to get her hand trapped when Kirsty switches the power back on. Fiz apparently needs emergency medical attention due to the bloody injury and soon starts spreading the word that Kirsty harmed her on purpose. She is quoted as telling Tyrone: \\"Kirsty said she didn't do it and you might believe her, but in your head I don't think you do. What's she going to do next? She injured you and now she's injured me. Who's going to be next, Ruby?\\" McAlpine spoke about the storyline and told What's On TV: \\"Kirsty continues to look after Fiz and stays with her while she is treated at the hospital and even returns home with her. She is quite sinister and when she finally leaves, Fiz is quite shaken by Kirsty's behaviour. Fiz has now seen how scary Kirsty can be with her own eyes. Fiz is not soft, she has spent time in prison before, but she has now seen what Tyrone has to cope with when Kirsty gets angry.\\" She added: \\"Fiz really cares about Tyrone. Fiz is also very stubborn and has a sense of justice. She will probably want to see this through to the end - she wants the truth to come out. She wants Tyrone to be happy and feels this can never be the case while he is still involved with Kirsty.\\" McAlpine said that her emotional scenes with Hawley (John Stape) were very draining and very hard work. She told The Mirror: \\"It's been very draining. Not emotionally, because I never take my work home with me, but genuinely physically exhausting. It's tiring having to cry continuously and I take a long time to recover from that. My face goes all red and my eyes sting for ages afterwards. I'm not a good crier!\\". She added: \\"I've always been a huge Corrie fan. Being a Northern girl it was always on in my living room. And even today, I love sitting down and catching up with what's going on. This is my dream job.\\" McAlpine admitted that her wedding plans caused her to receive a mixed reaction from viewers. On This Morning, McAlpine revealed: \\"It has divided the nation - some people think she's absolutely mad. But it's funny, before I proposed and did that big thing with the banner, everyone was saying, 'Oh, I think you should marry him', and now I've taken the decision into my own hands I don't think they like it now. I think people aren't happy about it now. They liked the idea but now they are worried.\\" McAlpine added: \\"He didn't mean to do it for five weeks - he didn't mean to lock her up for that long, I know that. I do believe him.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Fiz Brown at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional factory workers Category:Television characters introduced in 2001 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional machinists Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Fiz Brown"},{"id":"2744227","text":"Marlon Beresford (born 2 September 1969) is an English former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

H√∏gnorsk typically accepts the initial reforms that, among other things, removed certain silent letters of etymological origin, while keeping most of the Landsm√•l grammar intact. Professor Torleiv Hannaas is often credited for introducing the term 'H√∏gnorsk' in an article in 1922. He used it analogously to High German (Hochdeutsch),Hochdeutsch is the linguistic term for the southern and central dialects of German, spoken in the more mountainous parts of the German language area, in contrast to Low German (Plattdeutsch or Niederdeutsch) spoken mainly in the North German Plain. However, non-scientifically, Hochdeutsch (unlike its English equivalent \\"High German\\") is the common word for \\"Standard German\\". Scientific German term for Standard German are Neuhochdeutsch (\\"New High German\\") or Standarddeutsch (\\"Standard German\\"). pointing out that Ivar Aasen, the creator of Nynorsk orthography, had especially valued the dialects of the mountainous areas of middle and western Norway, as opposed to the dialects of the lowlands of eastern Norway, which Hannaas called flatnorsk (Flat Norwegian, like Plattdeutsch). The written High Norwegian language is a tradition originating from the first version of the New Norwegian written language (then called Landsm√•l), as it was built by Ivar Aasen and later used by classical New Norwegian authors as Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Arne Garborg, Olav Nygard and Olav H.

The H√∏gnorsk movement grew out of opposition to the official Samnorsk policy which aimed at leveling out the differences between Nynorsk and the other main variety of Norwegian language, Bokm√•l. Reforms to this end were carried through in 1938 and 1959. Initially there was considerable resistance against these reforms, but the resulting standard is now widely accepted. H√∏gnorsk is currently supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet and the activists behind M√•lmannen, but has relatively few active users. The basis for the High Norwegian language direction, is a wish to preserve the New Norwegian written language as an independent language, free of the strong influence from Bokm√•l that today's New Norwegian has.

The local authority was Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council. The former area of the district is now mostly part of the London Borough of Croydon in Greater London, with parts in the Tandridge District and the Borough of Reigate and Banstead in Surrey. Creation The population of Croydon Rural District doubled from 1901 to 1911 as suburban house building took place, with 11,389 in Coulsdon and 2,853 in Sanderstead in 1911. In both cases, the population was much higher than would be typical for rural parishes. Surrey County Council made an order in 1914 to abolish the rural district and this was completed in 1915. The new Coulsdon and Purley Urban District consisted of the parish of Coulsdon, including the settlements of Coulsdon and Purley, and the parish of Sanderstead. Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council replaced Coulsdon Parish Council, Sanderstead Parish Council and Croydon Rural District Council. By 1921 the population was 18,140 in Coulsdon and 3,351 in Sanderstead, and the total population had risen to 21,491. Changes On 1 October 1929, 59 acres were gained from Godstone Rural District, transferred from the parish of Warlingham to Sanderstead. The Local Government Act 1929 required county councils to review the districts within their areas. On 1 April 1933 as part of a county review order under the act, the parish of Farleigh was transferred from Godstone Rural District. The boundaries with Beddington and Wallington Urban District, Carshalton Urban District and Caterham and Warlingham Urban District were subject to minor adjustments. 1,421 acres were gained from the abolished Reigate Rural District, consisting of parts of the parishes of Chaldon, Chipstead and Merstham, included the village of Hooley. The boundary with the County Borough of Croydon was adjusted on 1 April 1933 and again on 1 April 1936. Governance In 1915 the electoral wards were Coulsdon, Kenley, Purley, Sanderstead and Woodcote. The electoral wards in 1937 were Coulsdon East, Coulsdon West, Kenley, Purley, Sanderstead, Selsdon and Farleigh, and Woodcote. The rates charged for the district were one of the lowest in Outer London and below the average for the part of Surrey within the Metropolitan Police District.The Government and Misgovernment of London, William A. Robson, (1939) Coat of arms The coat of arms were granted on 14 May 1952.Coulsdon and Purley Urban District (Civic Heraldry). Retrieved 15 January 2008 Some charges from these arms were used, together with some charges from the coat of arms of County Borough of Croydon, to form the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Croydon in 1965. Abolition The urban district was within the Metropolitan Police District and part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The commission proposed that it should form part of Greater London, to be combined with Caterham and Warlingham as a new borough.Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London: 1957‚Äì1960: Report, 1960, HMSO The government broadly accepted the proposal, adding the County Borough of Croydon to the new borough. Caterham and Warlingham Urban District Council requested that their area be excluded from Greater London and this was accepted by the government. Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council also requested to be excluded, but were turned down.HC Deb 18 May 1962 vol 659 cc156-7W Charles Doughty, MP for Surrey East proposed an amendment to the London Government Bill to exclude Coulsdon and Purley but was defeated.HC Deb 20 February 1963 vol 672 cc445-599 On 1 April 1965 the urban district was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Croydon in Greater London. Farleigh and Hooley transfers It was anticipated that the practice of combining whole existing units of local government might provide an unsatisfactory boundary in some places. The London Government Act 1963 Section 6 (4) provided a mechanism for communities on the edge of Greater London to petition for transfer to a neighbouring county. The legislation required the petition to be submitted between 1965 and 1970, to be signed by more than 300 local electors and for the area to be transferred to have no more than 10% of the borough's local electors.London Government Act 1963 Section 6 (4) Following this procedure, in 1969 Farleigh was transferred back to Surrey to form part of the Chelsham and Farleigh parish in Godstone Rural District and Hooley became part of Banstead Urban District.Greater London, Kent and Surrey Order 1968 References Category:Districts abolished by the London Government Act 1963 Category:History of the London Borough of Croydon Category:1915 establishments in England Category:History of local government in London (1889‚Äì1965) Category:Urban districts of England ","title":"Coulsdon and Purley Urban District"},{"id":"2744241","text":"Brignancourt is a commune in the Val-d'Oise department in √éle-de-France in northern France.

He first appeared in 15 January 1986 and became the show's main antagonist until the character was killed off in 8 December 1989, just two episodes after the series celebrated its 3000th episode. The character's story arc began with Alan visiting Weatherfield to reconcile with his long-lost daughter Jenny (Sally Ann Matthews), following the death of her mother and his ex-wife Pat ‚Äì who was reported to have been killed in a car accident. This works successfully and Alan subsequently moves into Weatherfield to live with Jenny and her foster mother Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox), whom he gradually establishes a relationship with as the pair end up falling in love with each other. Alan later plans to marry Rita in a surprise wedding between them, but is left unhappy when she doesn't go through with it and prefers for them to remain partners. Throughout his time on the show, Alan exhibits a volatile and temperamental streak due to his psychopathic nature. This proves evident at the times where the character inflicts his behaviour onto Rita's several friends and neighbors alike. During the course of his story arc, Alan has an affair with local barmaid Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins); beats up her troublesome customer, Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), at The Rovers Return Inn public house for badmouthing him; repeatedly clashes with the pub's landlady Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear); sparks a feud with Jenny's boyfriend Martin Platt (Sean Wilson); threatens to hurt Rita's business partner Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow) and her husband Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) for intruding on his plan to make changes at Rita's shop called \\"The Kabin\\"; planned to buy the Weatherfield garage from its departing manager, Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten), until the latter decided to stay in the street with his wife Gail (Helen Worth) and cancelled the sale before Alan could bid for the new ownership; harbored unrequited romantic feelings for his client Carole Burns (Irene Skillington); dismissed Jenny's engagement to her fianc√© Patrice Podevin (Franck Dubosc) after she ran away to France to stop her father controlling every aspect of her life; tried unsuccessfully to go into partnership with his boss Dave Craig (Alan Hulse) upon creating his own business, initially dubbed \\"Bradley Securities Limited\\" and later renamed \\"Weatherfield Security Systems\\"; and attempted to rape his receptionist Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) after she rebuffed his efforts to spark a romance between them. The follow-up of his attempt to rape Dawn proved to be Alan's downfall, after Rita finds out about just not the incident and his other misdeeds ‚Äì but also learns that Alan had fraudulently posed as her late husband, Len (Peter Adamson), and mortgaged her house without her own consent to start his own business. When she reports his crime to the building society to stop him from further exploiting her assets, Alan tries to kill Rita and is consequently arrested as a result. He is soon released and Alan proceeds to torment Rita for months, which leads to her having a breakdown and fleeing to Blackpool. Because of this, Alan becomes shunned in Weatherfield and practically loses everything ‚Äì including his daughter ‚Äì all around him. He eventually tracks down Rita after uncovering her whereabouts from The Rovers' landlord, Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough), and travels to Blackpool in a bid to prove to the community that he didn't kill her. The character's attempt to force Rita in returning to Weatherfield with him leads to Alan chasing her onto an oncoming Blackpool tram, which narrowly misses Rita and ends up fatally hitting Alan ‚Äì consequently killing him off and thus ending his reign of terror for good. Depicted as one of the best soap villains of all time and in the programme itself, the character Alan Bradley served as an inspiration for future antagonists on the show; including Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) and Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). StorylinesBackstory= Alan Bradley was born on 20 July 1939. At somepoint he married a woman named Pat, and in 1971 she conceived a daughter ‚Äì which they named Jenny (Sally Ann Matthews). During that time, Alan became his own master; he liked the free life of a bachelor and spent little time at home. In part this was because his job installing air conditioning systems took him all over the country. In 1978, Alan and Pat split up and he left home ‚Äì not to see Jenny again for eight years. He and Pat were subsequently divorced. By the end of 1985, Alan was living in digs in Scarcroft ‚Äì near Leeds. =1986‚Äì1989= In January 1986, Alan was tracked down by social services when Pat was killed in a road accident. He learned that Jenny, now fourteen, was living in Weatherfield ‚Äì a fictional district in Greater Manchester ‚Äì with her foster mother, the local shopkeeper Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox). The news prompted Alan to go to Weatherfield from Leeds and collect his daughter, but Jenny resented him for abandoning her. With Rita's help, Alan convinced Jenny to give him a chance. He got a transfer to Weatherfield and rented a flat near the street so that Jenny could live with him without changing school. Alan had been seeing a lot of Rita and he was attracted to her, up to the point where he regularly visits her at the latter's own shop ‚Äì The Kabin. While she also developed feelings for him, Rita was shocked to learn that Alan exhibits a masculine and aggressive streak ‚Äì as it often reminds him of her late husband Len (Peter Adamson). By the time their relationship had become passionate, Alan had doubts about his relationship with Rita and began two-timing on her with her friend Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins) ‚Äì who worked as a barmaid at the local public house, The Rovers Return Inn ‚Äì after finding her a flat in his building. Gloria was youthful and glamorous; a woman he could more easily take charge of than he could Rita. This escalated when Alan learned that the street's troublemaker, Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), was pestering Gloria. He later confronted Terry and warned him to stay away from Gloria, but soon learned that Terry was causing trouble for Jenny as well. When Alan confronted him again in The Rovers to warn him off Jenny and then Terry called him a \\"demolition man\\", Alan lashed out at Terry and brutally attacked him before being kicked out by the pub's landlady ‚Äì Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). Later on, Alan apologized to Gloria for losing his temper and explained that he previously had a two-year suspended sentence for assault ‚Äì further claiming that its relation to his past is still hanging down on him. By then, Alan began to date both Gloria and Rita without either's knowledge ‚Äì and eventually sleeps with Gloria. The women eventually realised that he was two-timing them. When Rita told Alan that she was aware of his two-timing behaviour, he admitted to sleeping with Gloria and was forced by Rita to choose which of the two he wishes to be with. He ended up choosing Rita after Gloria had already ended her relationship with Alan after confronting him about his affair. Alan and Rita managed to slowly rebuild their romance and put their rocky start behind them. By September 1986, Alan was made redundant and his pride kept him from telling Rita; however, she discovered this from fellow resident Mavis Riley. A new job soon came up for Alan in Liverpool, and Rita convinced him to take it even though it meant three months in Dubai; Alan agreed to take the job and later arranges for Jenny to move in with Rita. In January 1987, a year after he had first arrived in Weatherfield, Alan returned to the news that Jenny had been in a car crash in Rita's car. When he visited his daughter, Alan learned that she has been dating her schoolmate Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) and suspected that he had caused the crash knowing that Martin often sped in his car. Alan later confronted Martin and was ready to hit him, but Jenny admitted that she'd been the one who was driving. Martin and Jenny later confessed to the police, with a little persuasion from Alan, but Rita refused to press charges so nothing came of it. Alan thanked Rita and told her he would compensate her from the money he was earning in Dubai. He then continued to woo Rita and sought to take the next step by proposing to her. Despite expecting Rita to say yes, Alan was astonished when she said no, with Rita stating that she preferred for them to just carry on as partners. Following his return from Dubai, Alan moved in to Rita's house and began to spend more quality time with Jenny, which partly helped took his mind from the disappointment of Rita declining his proposal. Alan soon took an interest in The Kabin, opening a video library and installing an electric till within the shop to modernise it. His changes worried Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow), as she suspected that Alan was worming his way into The Kabin ‚Äì just as he had done with Rita's affections ‚Äì and might plan to have her replaced. Mavis confided to her husband Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) about her suspicions and he questioned Alan about this on Mavis' behalf. In response, Alan threatened Mavis and Derek to stay away from him; Rita soon learned what Alan was doing and told him to not make any more changes at her shop. Soon enough, Alan felt emasculated by being second to Rita financially and decided to buy Tilsley's Garage when Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) made plans to move down south with his wife Gail (Helen Worth), but at the last minute, the couple pulled out of the sale. Alan, unhappy that his chances of buying the garage were ruined, still had his heart set on marrying Rita and, thinking she needed more convincing, booked a surprise wedding for them at the Weatherfield Register Office. He planned to lure Rita there under the pretext that they had been invited to a friend's wedding. When they got there, Rita couldn't believe Alan had actually planned for her own surprise wedding. Rita promptly got back into the taxi that she had come in. Alan left feeling humiliated, slowly came to realise that Rita would never marry him. By the time Jenny turned sixteen, she decided to leave school despite Alan wanting her to stay and complete her A-Levels. Alan and Rita later found out that Jenny had gone to France to escape them from telling her what to do. Alan furiously went to France to find her, but he came back empty-handed. She returned to the Weatherfield in October 1987 with the news that she was marrying a French student, Patrice Podevin (Franck Dubosc), after they were now engaged. Alan thought Jenny was too young and immature to get married and refused to give his blessing. While Rita opposed Alan's views and gave Jenny her own blessing, Alan proved to be right when Jenny cheated on Patrice with Gary Grimshaw (Colin Kerrigan); Patrice broke off the engagement to Jenny and Alan later comforted her when her ex-fianc√©e went back to France on his own. While he managed to reconcile with Jenny in light of her broken engagement, Alan became bored with merely running the video library and sought to expand his business interests. In 1988, he found a job fitting burglar alarms. Alan soon wanted to go into partnership with his manager Dave Craig (Alan Hulse) and asked Rita to loan him ¬£6,000 to buy into the business. When Dave wasn't interested, Alan decided to set up on his own business, creating Bradley Securities Limited using Rita's money to buy a company car. Despite her reservations, Rita gave Alan a loan and helped him set-up his potential business setting him up in Len's old Builder's Yard. In the summer, Alan started to ignore Rita and became romantically interested with one of his clients Carole Burns (Irene Skillington). This continued to the point that Alan left Rita, telling her that he was tired of the way she \\"coldly\\" puts him down. In response, Rita demanded that he return the money that she had loaned to him; he reluctantly complied and Alan was later forced to vacate the yard. Alan moved out of Rita's house but his business collapsed as both the bank and Carole both refused to give him a loan. In November 1988, he left Carole and again returned to Rita and Jenny. They were initially sceptical towards Alan until he explained that he didn't come back because of the money, but had plans to set up a shop without needing a penny from her. Without Rita's knowledge, he stole the deeds to her house and re-mortgaged it for ¬£15,000 by posing as Len whose name was still on the deeds to Rita's house. With cheque in hand, Alan told Rita the bank had given him a loan; Rita believed him and Alan later transferred his business to a shop unit in Curzon Street, renaming it Weatherfield Security Systems to cover his tracks with the building society. Alan did everything to keep the truth from Rita, whilst also trying to retain his \\"family-man\\" relationships with both her and Jenny in the process. He had all letters from the bank re-directed to the shop and handled all mail and phone calls himself. The business grew more successful when Alan employed Martin to be his assistant, partly at Jenny's urging, and later hired the newly-arrived Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) to become his receptionist. Alan quickly fancied Dawn and asked her out, telling her Rita was just his landlady, but she wasn't interested. This only encouraged him and he soon confided to Dawn his feelings to her in March 1989. When she rejected his romantic appeals, Alan attempted to rape her, but she managed to escape by rushing out onto the street. The incident proved to be Alan's downfall as Dawn not only told Rita about the incident, but she also exposed his fraudulent scheme by telling Rita about the letters and phone calls that were asked for Leonard Fairclough. This prompted Rita to investigate Alan's activities, and she was gobsmacked to learn what he had done. On the night Jenny celebrated her eighteenth birthday, Rita confronted Alan for his deceit and he admitted to committing fraud, before arguing how his actions had led to the success of the business he started. Alan was totally unfazed with the way how Rita reacted towards discovering his lies, but his mood changed when he learns that she had just stopped this from going any further; Rita had earlier visited the building society and, after finding out the conditions of Alan's bank loan, exposed his deceit by confirming Len's fate. Alan grew enraged when Rita ended their relationship by telling him that he is finished and that his time was up. In response, he lashed out at Rita as she answered a phone call from Jenny. Jenny had wanted to check to see if her father and foster mother were alright. After forcefully stopping Rita from answering the call, Alan hit and then tried to suffocate her with a cushion. Rita was saved by Jenny and Martin, returning from a party, came in the house. Alan promptly fled from the house and drove out of Weatherfield, leaving Jenny and Martin to look after Rita before she was taken to hospital. The next day, Alan found himself wanted by the police after Rita had told them about what he did and Jenny learned about her father's activities. He phoned Jenny and asked her to meet him at a train station, with his passport and money. Jenny reluctantly met up with her father at his request, but the police followed Jenny without her knowledge and Alan was arrested when Martin and the police caught up with him. As he was taken into custody, Alan believed that Jenny shopped him to the police and disowned her. He then learned nobody had reported him to the Police, and Jenny's Police guard was stood-down. Alan was charged with deception and actual bodily harm and spent six months on remand. When Jenny later visited her father in prison, he asked her to beg Rita to play down what had happened; however, Jenny refused when she realised that her father was only thinking about himself and ignored his wishes. In October 1989, Alan's trial started. He pleaded guilty to deception and actual bodily harm in a bid to avoid going to prison. This worked successfully as Alan was given two years in prison, but walked free as he had already served enough time in prison on remand without bail. Rita was horrified by the verdict and became convinced Alan was going to take revenge on her. Her fears quickly proved to be correct when Alan resorted to torment Rita out of spite for the way she destroyed his business and ended their relationship. He first visited Rita while she was alone at her house, claiming that he was there to see Jenny. Tensions grew when she asked him to leave. He refused and continued to intimidate Rita, leaving her desperately afraid. Alan later moved into a bedsit near the street and landed himself a job at the building site near Rita's house, wanting to stay close to her. When Jenny confronted her father about what he was doing, he told his daughter that he was staying in Weatherfield claiming to still love her ‚Äì as well as caring for Rita. Jenny reluctantly accepted this and Alan's false claims ended up sparking trouble between his daughter and Rita, up to the point where Jenny wrongly claimed that Rita was being vindictive and turns against her. When Rita learned that her shop had been vandalised, she quickly suspected Alan of being the culprit and the police took him in for questioning. Alan proved to be innocent when the police caught a gang of children trying to sell videos that were stolen from The Kabin. A few weeks later, Rita disappeared without a trace and Alan was again questioned by the police. He was once more cleared when any evidence of his alleged involvement proved insufficient. He was nevertheless suspected by his fellow neighbors of killing Rita and burning her at the building site. Alan later went to The Rovers and ended up getting drunk, which prompted Rita's longtime friend and neighbour Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) to confront him about her fate. When Percy continued to pester Alan over what he supposedly did to Rita, he threatens to attack Percy ‚Äì which prompted his friends Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff) and Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley), along with Terry's father Jack (Bill Tarmey), to all stand up to Alan. At the point where Alan was being hounded by everyone in The Rovers, he grabs a bottle and prepares to attack them until Jenny's best-friend Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) rushes into The Rovers ‚Äì telling them that the police have found something at the building site. This causes everyone to rush outside, assuming that it is Rita's body that has been found. Alan reluctantly joins them after Alf's wife and Gail's mother, Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), sarcastically asks if he is bothered enough to feel curious in knowing what the police will find at the site. It soon transpired that Rita had actually gone over to Blackpool to recover from a breakdown, which occurred in light of Alan's treatment of her. Despite this and the fact that was found at the building site, Alan lost his job because of the trouble it had caused with the police. Alan became overly bitter and swore revenge on Rita, blaming her for ruining his life. He soon learns of Rita's whereabouts after overhearing The Rovers' landlord, Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough), confiding to Bet that Rita is in Blackpool. Alan later follows Bet to Blackpool, with the intent on finding Rita and taking her back to Weatherfield to prove to everyone that he didn't kill her. He forced his way into the hotel where Rita was staying in, only to instead find Bet there before threatening her and demanding to know where Rita was. With Bet was unwilling to tell him, Alan deduces that Rita would be coming back to the hotel after finding her clothes in the wardrobe. He then returns to his car to await for her. As Rita walks back towards the hotel, Alan spots her and orders her to get in his car. When she refuses, Alan forces her into the passenger seat, only for her to jump out just as he returns to the driver's side. Alan promptly chases Rita across the road, where they end up running into the direction of an oncoming Blackpool tram ‚Äì which narrowly misses Rita but ends up hitting Alan, killing him. The tram promptly stops at the impact of accident, as Bet rushes outside to comfort Rita. =Legacy= Later on, Alan is confirmed to have officially died and news of his death becomes public knowledge in Weatherfield ‚Äì with Jenny becoming devastated to learn about her father's death. She later attends his funeral with Martin and Sally, along with the latter's husband Kevin (Michael Le Vell), supporting her in attendance. The impact of Alan's torment on Rita and his subsequent death continues to negatively affect her relationship with Jenny. However, they eventually reconcile when Jenny comes to accept that her father had truly never loved her and this signals the end of Alan's reign of terror once and for all. Reception The character Alan Bradley is well-received by critics. The episode that aired on 13 March 1989, where Alan tried to kill Rita by suffocating her, attracted over 25 million viewers when combining the original broadcast with the omnibus, while the following episode on 15 March 1989 with Rita in hospital and Alan hiding from the police, attracted 26.93 million viewers, which is the highest combined rating in the shows history. The episode that aired on 20 March 1989, attracted an audience of 19.01 million for its original Monday night broadcast and was the shows highest-rated single broadcast of the year. The first episode of series 2 of Phoenix Nights contains a visual reference to the death of Alan Bradley, where flowers with a sign 'In Memory of Alan, 8 Dec 89', RIP' are tied to a lamp-post beside the tram line. Both Eden and co-star Barbara Knox have stated that they regret the death of Alan, wishing that he had returned in some fashion at a later time.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/mark-eden- relives-coronation-streets-903920 https://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/articles/barbara-knox-rita-and-meAlan Bradley has been consistently voted as one of Coronation Street 's greatest villains in several polls since. On 8 December 2009, Mark Eden unveiled a blue plaque to mark the 20-year anniversary of the screening of the famous Coronation Street episode. The plaque is located outside The Strand Hotel, North Promenade, Blackpool which was the venue chosen for the filming of much of the footage. In further episodes of Coronation Street references to Alan occur, most recently in the episode aired April 2015 when Jenny called into Rita's shop The Kabin, in which Norris Cole asked her if she was travelling to the shops by tram; intended as a cutting quip referencing the way Alan died. In June 2016, Alan's daughter Jenny would save her ex-boyfriend Kevin Webster's (Michael Le Vell) little son Jack (Kyran Bowes) from a tram ‚Äì once again referring to Alan's iconic demise.

He hailed from Nsanje, a district on the southern part of Malawi. From the country's independence in 1964 until 1980, Chakuamba was a key figure within the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), which was the sole legal political party. During the rule of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, he held many cabinet positions and was Commander of the MCP youth group Malawi Young Pioneers. Chakuamba opposed John Tembo. In February 1980, Chakuamba was charged, on the behest of Tembo and Kadzamira, with sedition and given a 22-year prison sentence. He was released from jail in July 1993, a month after voters endorsed a return to multiparty politics in a referendum. Upon his release, he joined the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) but soon returned to the MCP and became secretary-general of the party. In February 1994, the MCP announced that Banda was to be the party's presidential candidate in the forthcoming general election; Chakuamba was the vice-presidential candidate. In Malawi's first multiparty elections, held on 17 May 1994, Bakili Muluzi and his UDF party defeated Banda and the MCP. Banda retired from politics in August 1994 and Chakuamba succeeded to the party leadership. In February 1999, an electoral alliance between the MCP and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) was announced in preparation for upcoming elections that would take place in May. Gwanda Chakuamba was chosen as the coalition's presidential candidate while AFORD leader Chakufwa Chihana was selected as the vice-presidential candidate. The move created serious divisions within the MCP because Chakuamba didn't select his political rival and fellow party member John Tembo to be his running mate. Thousands of Tembo's supporters were reported to have mounted protests to demand Chakuamba's resignation. In the 15 June 1999 elections, Muluzi and his UDF were again victorious, and Chakuamba took second place with about 45% of the vote.Elections in Malawi, African Elections Database. Despite declarations from international observers that the elections were largely free and fair, the MCP-AFORD coalition filed two petitions with the high court, challenging Muluzi's victory and the results in 16 districts claiming irregularities. The court later dismissed the claims. In October 2002, Chakuamba was briefly arrested (before being freed on bail), accused of forging a letter purported to be from Muluzi that offered bribes to members of parliament if they would support his attempt to change the constitution to run for a third term as president.\\"Malawi opposition leader freed\\", BBC News, 22 October 2002. In the months prior to the 2004 elections, Chakuamba left the MCP and created the Republican Party (RP). The RP joined forces with six other parties to form the Mgwirizano Coalition. Chakuamba was selected as the coalition's presidential candidate. According to official results, he placed third in the 20 May 2004 election, behind Bingu wa Mutharika of the UDF and Tembo of the MCP, winning 25.7% of the vote. Soon after the vote, before any official results were announced, Chakuamba claimed to have won the election and said that exit polls showing Mutharika in the lead were false.\\"Malawi hopeful claims poll win\\", BBC News, 22 May 2004. Mutharika was sworn in as president on May 24, although Chakuamba denounced his victory as fraudulent.\\"Clashes over new Malawi leader\\", BBC News, 24 May 2004.

He initially backed Muluzi, who attempted to run again as the UDF candidate, for the 2009 presidential election.

Chakuamba switched sides again at the time of the May 2009 presidential election, supporting President Mutharika against Tembo, who was the joint candidate of the MCP and UDF. As an NRP candidate, Chakuamba also ran for a parliamentary seat from Nsanje North Constituency, but was defeated by DPP candidate Frank Ellias. The NRP won no seats in the election, and shortly after its defeat, Chakuamba again announced that he was retiring from politics, saying he would focus on farming.

Analysts assess sector trends, create segment taxonomies, size markets, prepare forecasts, and develop industry models. Industry analysts usually work for research and advisory services firms, and some analysts also perform advisory (consulting) services. Typically, analysts specialize in a single segment or sub-segment, researching the broad development of the market rather than focusing on specific publicly traded companies, equities, investments, or associated financial opportunities as a financial analyst might. Coverage The IIAR provides this official definition:http://analystrelations.org/2013/08/27/new- iiar-best-practice-primer-paper-who-are-industry-analysts-and-what-do-they-do/ An information and communications technology (ICT) industry analyst is a person, working individually or within a firm, whose business model incorporates creating and publishing research about, and advising on how, why and where ICT-related products and services can be procured, deployed and used. That is not to say that industry analysts do not focus on specific market participants and their product and service portfolios, or that financial analysts ignore industries. Gideon Gartner, one of the industry analyst business pioneers, was a former financial analyst before launching the Gartner Group in 1979.http://www.gartner.com/technology/about.jsp But industry analysts do research in the context of a specific sector or market segment, along with the competitive offerings of the other public and non-public companies that comprise the market. In many industries there is significant overlap between the work product of industry analysts and financial analysts. The information technology and consulting industries, however, are examples of industries where a significant proportion of important market participants are not publicly traded entities with readily available information and highly regulated disclosure requirements. Most analyst firms focus on one or more market segments, such as cloud computing, wireless communications, audit services, or pharmaceutical industry safety monitoring. Analyst firms and the analysts that work for them are continuously expanding and shifting their coverage areas to keep pace with trends like technological convergence or media convergence, for example. This is because demand for industry analyst research services is closely associated with the frequency of change in an industry. So the largest analyst firms tend to have extremely dynamic offerings, and the concentration of service offerings of all market players tends to focus on industry areas that are currently undergoing change. History There are three industry analyst firms that have been in continuous operation since 1970 or earlier. Computer Review is the oldest analyst firm that has been in continuous operation since its inception in 1959, as Adams Associates. International Data Corp has been providing industry analyst and publishing services since 1964, and continues to be operated as a private company by its founder, Patrick Joseph McGovern. The last of the three, the Yankee Group, was founded by Howard Anderson in 1970.http://www.yankeegroup.com/about_us/ Anderson ran the firm until 1999. Many industry analyst firms and analysts trace their roots to one of these three firms, particularly IDC, Gartner and the Yankee Group. George Colony, for example, was an analyst at the Yankee Group before founding Forrester Research. Dale Kutnick was also a Yankee Group analyst and equity holder before joining Gartner and later founding the Meta Group, which was subsequently purchased by Gartner. Yankee Group was ultimately acquired by 451 Research in 2013. Jim Lundy and Mike Anderson were analysts at Gartner before they founded Aragon Research. Industry analyst business A community of more than 740 analyst firms spans the world.http://analystrelations.webexone.com/login.asp?loc= Research and advisory staffs at these companies range from one person to more than 1,000. Well-known analyst firms using \\"traditional\\" business models include 451 Research, Gartner, IBISWorld, International Data Corporation, Informa Telecoms & Media, SNL Kagan, Ovum Ltd, Yankee Group, Digital Clarity Group and Aragon Research. The \\"traditional\\" business model, based on continuous information services (CIS, aka subscriptions) where analysts author reports that are then sold to many clients is under pressure.http://analystrelations.org/2011/10/12/thoughts-on-the-analyst- business-and-music-industry-business-models/ Several firms are designing new analyst business modelshttp://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=188100576 based on contemporary technologies, open-source licensing concepts, emerging markets, loosely federated analysts, and/or a more radical and visible emphasis on offshoring. Notable examples of analyst firms developing models based on social media such as Canada's ConneKted Minds and \\"open research and analysis\\" include RedMonk, MWD Advisors, Quocirca, ResearchFarm, Freeform Dynamics, Omnisperience and Cambashi, all based in or having offices in the United Kingdom, and US-based Wikibon, an open-source project. Singapore-based Springboard Research (now owned by Forrester) exemplifies progressive use of offshoring research and Experton and Experture exemplify loose federations of independent analysts. capioIT exemplifies firms which focus on emerging geographic and technology markets. Roles and deliverables Industry analysts provide a combination of syndicated and client-sponsored (bespoke) market research, competitive intelligence, and management consulting services. Deliverables take many forms that can be grouped as follows: * publications like research reports, white papers, research notes, and newsletters * advisory services that include inquiries, briefings, consulting projects, study findings presentations or bespoke speaking engagements (for instance at internal client meetings or industry events) * events such as conferences, seminars, roundtables * market analysis, such as quantitative market trends, forecasts and market shares. Analyst firms serve a management decision support function at corporations and public service organisations and for the vendors, regulators and investors serving those industries.http://www.cio.com/article/32163/IT_Advisory_Services_Bad_News_for_Analysts_Good_News_for_CIOs/1http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/fac/isrp/wp-3-02.pdf Industry analysts serving buyers of technology-based products and services, where the largest concentration of industry analysts provide services, work with three primary groups of clients: * Commercial and public service entities that use technology-based products and services. * Vendors providing products and services to commercial and public service organizations, and the channel intermediaries that resell or aggregate these products and services, including hardware manufacturers, communications companies, software firms, IT services providers, value-added resellers, mobile network operators, and content aggregators. * Organizations that invest-in, regulate, or support the vendors and intermediaries, including investment banks, anti-trust regulators, chambers of commerce, and leasing companies. The subjects of research conducted by analysts include many of the same stakeholders that also buy services from analysts. This has caused the integrity of the research to be questioned, which is covered in more detail below. These research subjects include product and service buyers, users, and implementers; the product and service providers themselves, including their key supply chain partners; and sources of investment capital for the vendors, capital for client purchases of vendor products and services, and regulators. Analysts also perform at least passive sales support for their firms, such as contributing to sales meetings, contracts, project profitability, or lead generation programs. This is necessary because the clients are paying for their expertise and must have an opportunity to assess associated capabilities. At most firms, analysts set research agendas in close cooperation with clients, design surveys, analyse findings, and write research. They may also conduct the surveys themselves, or they may work with third parties or interns to perform the data collection. Increasingly, analyst firms and their subcontractors employ online survey tools and offshoring to reduce research costs and turnaround time. In some cases, analyst firms are mining new sources of information from research partners, like consumer cell phone bills, RFID-enabled point of sale data, and analytics on Web traffic. Typically, technology and service providers work to influence the analyst research agenda and coverage of their firm, and to build trusted relationships with individual analysts. This is done through a specialized marketing function called industry analyst relations or analyst relations, where some analyst relations staff members specialize themselves in certain product, service, industry, or geographic areas of the vendor organization. This function not only facilitates effective two-way communications between the analyst firm and the vendor, it attempts to concentrate and control spending on industry analyst research and advisory services. It has become a common practice for analyst firms to assign a central \\"vendor relations\\" contact within their organization, to coordinate briefing, reprint and similar requests from vendors. Commercial and public sector client organizations have now assigned sourcing and procurement category managers as the primary contact for research and advisory services firms as well, to concentrate and better leverage spending on related products and services. Skills Companies participating in the industry analyst profession have not adopted universal standards for employee education, skills, or professional conduct. Some firms adhere to standards set by competitive intelligence, market research or other professional associations. Overall, this situation results in competitive differentiation among analyst firms. Most analyst firms require above-average written and oral communication skills. Integrity and transparency issues Analyst objectivity and accuracy is an issue that is frequently debated.http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=178601879https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/12/analyst_nytimes/ Much of the criticism appears to focus on the business relationships between analysts and the technology providers that are the subjects of their research. In short, analyst firms often rely heavily on revenues from the technology providers they cover (e.g., Darwin magazine, March 2001). This source of revenue is a significant component of the business models of most analyst firms. Individual analysts and teams conduct research on industry segments where a vendor may provide products or services, and that same individual or group may provide research deliverables or advisory services to a vendor serving that segment. The analyst is then expected to provide independent objective advice to buyers of those products and services. This matrix of relationships presents opportunities where conflicts can arise. This is exacerbated by the training many vendor analyst relations professionals receive, where they are advised to focus spending on analysts that have the most ability to influence purchases of goods and services by clients, and to bypass controls analyst firms may have in place to preserve that objectivity by limiting direct access to certain analysts for non-research purposes. There is also the issue of analyst firms signing boilerplate confidentiality agreements with vendor firms. This occurs when licensing research or performing advisory work, or when conducting detailed briefings in advance of announcements. The language in those agreements often limits the disclosure of certain information that may be disclosed to analysts in the normal course of their research, limiting their ability to fully disclose research findings to buyers of any research deliverable. Some research organizations now refuse to sign confidentiality agreements with vendors or service providers. But there may be a legacy of agreements in place that perpetually limit disclosure for some large vendor clients, so some of the smaller firms have limited work with vendors. Burton Research, for example, enforces a cap of 20% of revenues to be derived from product vendors or service providers. Burton is now owned by Gartner, and continues to limit its vendor expenditures. Real Story Group is a small boutique firm that performs research on products and publishes evaluations. It works solely for buyers and refuses to accept business from vendors that are subjects of its evaluations. Despite a few exceptions, buy side industry analysts represent a small minority of analyst firms today. Even research firms whose services are tailored specifically to the interests of product and service buyers often derive some proportion of their revenues from vendors and service providers, since that information is important to them as well. Another side to this debate is that analyst firms create hype and influence markets in several wayshttp://analystrelations.org/2012/09/26/guest- post-why-it-vendors-should-take-industry-analysts-more-seriously/ or at even influence deals directly when speaking to end-user buyers. The debate over objectivity and independence has always been an active one, with some firms using independence (in absolute and relative terms) as a source of strategic differentiation. Other factors that affect research integrity include transparency with regard to research methodology and survey sampling, theoretical or shallow vs. in-depth or hands-on expertise of analysts, emphasis on qualitative over quantitative research, and the overall efficacy of a firm's research offerings toward the goal of improving the quality of business and technology decisions.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zdbln/is_200212/ai_ziff34905/printhttp://www.crmbuyer.com/rsstory/56053.html  See also  * Analyst * Market research * Analyst relations  References  Category:Market research ","title":"Industry analyst"},{"id":"2744258","text":"Mikhail Prusak (left) with Vladimir Putin.

The cricket writer Colin Bateman commented, \\"Gladstone Small overcame a hunched physique to become a remarkably effective fast-medium bowler and one of the most popular characters on the county circuit\\". Early life Small was born in Barbados, and moved to England shortly after his fourteenth birthday, which at the time was past the normal cut-off for a change of cricketing nationality. However, he applied for eligibility to play cricket for England, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) accepted his application. Small has Klippel‚ÄìFeil syndrome, which accounts for his distinctive \\"no neck\\" appearance. His life story was made into a documentary by director Pogus Caesar in 1995, and broadcast on Carlton Television for the Respect television series. He is a graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University. Playing career Primarily he bowled outswing, but his propensity for unreliable bowling gave selectors cause for concern. However, in his third Test, during the 1986‚Äì87 Ashes, Small was a last minute replacement for the fourth Test, and rose to the challenge, taking 5-48 in Australia's first innings and claiming two wickets in the second. He was given the Man of the Match award, and this was to be the highlight of his career. Small was in England's squad for both the 1987 and 1992 Cricket World Cups.

The game is based on the Warner Bros. series of cartoons featuring Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf. Controlling Ralph, the player must steal sheep from under Sam's nose while navigating through a series of levels, including two secret levels and a bonus level. Plot After another failed attempt at stealing a sheep from Sam Sheepdog, Ralph Wolf returns home after his shift to relax and enjoy some television in his chair. Daffy Duck bursts in and declares that Ralph is the newest contestant on the game show \\"Sheep, Dog, and Wolf\\" or as Daffy likes to call it, \\"Who Wants to Be a Sheep Stealer\\". In this show, Ralph is tasked with successfully stealing sheep from Sam in a variety of environments, though he is not allowed to harm the sheep in any way. Despite many obstacles and encounters with various characters such as Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Gossamer, Toro and Road Runner, Ralph is finally able to steal Sam's entire flock, but as he is declared the winner, Marvin the Martian gatecrashes the show, angry at Ralph and Daffy because a specific sheep that Ralph was forced to fire into the sky using Yosemite Sam's cannon in order to win actually landed on Planet X while Marvin was experimenting with his instant Martians, causing a serious accident which led to the Martians scattering across the planet. Marvin forcibly takes Ralph to Planet X with the task of recovering the Martians. Ralph eventually completes his task and is returned home by Marvin along with the stranded sheep. However, once inside, the sheep is revealed to be Sam in disguise, who grabs Ralph and prepares to beat him vengefully when Ralph's alarm clock sounds and he wakes up from his sleep, revealing that the game's events were only a dream. Disappointed, Ralph goes outside to start another shift of sheep stealing from Sam. Gameplay The goal of each level is to steal one of the sheep from Sam Sheepdog's flock without him noticing and escort it to a marked area. Ralph is able to jump, tiptoe as to not make noise, and dash in case he needs to escape from danger. To aid Ralph in obtaining the sheep, Ralph can mail order various gadgets from Acme, such as rocket packs and dynamite. Certain items can be combined; for example, a fan can be used on a bottle of perfume to have its scent attract one of the sheep from afar. Ralph can also collect lettuces to lure the sheep towards places where Ralph is unable to carry them, such as on a weak bridge. When approaching Sam, an icon shows up in the corner of the screen, showing that Ralph is in Sam's area. Sam's face shows where Sam's line of sight is, with the centre position looking in Ralph's direction. When it is green, Sam is unable to see or hear Ralph, but he is close to Sam's range. While it is orange, he is in Sam's area and Sam will be able to hear Ralph if he makes too much noise, and see him if he is not hidden in a bush or behind something. If Sam sees or hears Ralph, the icon will turn red and Sam will chase Ralph until he catches and punishes him, or Ralph escapes from his area. With almost each level passing, Sam becomes faster and faster, eventually faster than Ralph so more caution is needed when sneaking around in his area. Each level also has a hidden clock in machine to earn bonuses. Reception The game was met with positive to average reception upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 73.04% for the PlayStation version and 75.00% for the PC version, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100 for the former version.

He was amongst the earliest advocates of equal temperament, and through this advocacy was highly influential to the harmonic basis underlying almost all of subsequent Western music. Life Born in Benneckenstein, Werckmeister attended schools in Nordhausen and Quedlinburg. He received his musical training from his uncles Heinrich Christian Werckmeister and Heinrich Victor Werckmeister. In 1664 he became an organist in Hasselfelde; ten years later in Elbingerode; and in 1696 of the Martinskirche in Halberstadt. Musical compositions Of his compositions only a booklet remains: pieces for violin with basso continuo, with the title Musikalische Privatlust (1689). Also some organ works remains: Canzon in a-minor, Canzona in d-minor, Praeludium ex G, Canzonetta in D-major. Theoretical works Werckmeister is best known today as a theorist, in particular through his writings Musicae mathematicae hodegus curiosus... (1687) and Musikalische Temperatur (1691), in which he described a system of what we would now refer to as well temperament (named after Bach's opus, \\"The Well-Tempered Clavier\\") now known as Werckmeister temperament. Title page of Andreas Werckmeister, Orgelprobe (1698). Werckmeister's writings particularly his writings on counterpoint were well known to Johann Sebastian Bach. Werckmeister believed that well-crafted counterpoint, especially invertible counterpoint , was tied to the orderly movements of the planets, reminiscent of Kepler's view in Harmonice Mundi. According to George Buelow, \\"No other writer of the period regarded music so unequivocally as the end result of God‚Äôs work,\\" . Yet in spite of his focus on counterpoint, Werckmeister's work emphasized underlying harmonic principles. List of works * Musicae mathematicae hodegus curiosus...

School of the Air is a generic term for correspondence schools catering for the primary and early secondary education of children in remote and outback Australia where some or all classes were historically conducted by radio, although this is now replaced by telephone and internet technology. In these areas, the school-age population is too small for a conventional school to be viable. History The invention of the pedal radio by Alfred Traeger around 1929, and particularly the involvement of educator Adelaide Miethke in formulating and developing the idea of using the existing Royal Flying Doctor Service of radio communications, were pivotal in the establishment of the School of the Air. The first School of the Air lessons were officially sent from the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Alice Springs on 8 June 1951. The service celebrated its 50th jubilee on 9 May 2001, ahead of the real jubilee on 8 June.Ashton, Jean (1978) School of the air.

Each student has direct contact with a teacher in an inland town such as Broken Hill, Alice Springs or Meekatharra. Each student typically spends one hour per day receiving group or individual lessons from the teacher, and the rest of the day working through the assigned materials with a parent, older sibling or a hired home-stay tutor. Originally the students received their course materials and returned their written work and projects to their hub centre using either the Royal Flying Doctor Service or post office services. However the extension of Internet services into the outback now enables more rapid review of each child's homework. As the children are in isolated situations, the School of the Air is frequently their first chance of socialisation with children outside their immediate family. This is supplemented by 3 or 4 annual gatherings where the children travel to the school to spend one week with their teacher and classmates. Studies have shown that such education has a parity with, if not better, standards than traditional methods of schooling.Imamura, E (1987).

Together via Migros supermarkets, ≈ûok discount stores, international Ramstore shopping centers, online shopping, wholesale stores, and mobile sales units, Migros Turkey serves an estimated 160 million customers. As of Nov 2014, the company operates a total of 1,156 stores: 852 Migros stores, 212 Tansa≈ü stores, 24 5M stores and 27 Macro Centers stores in Turkey, 41 Ramstores in Kazakhstan and North Macedonia, according to its web site. News reports in February 2008 indicated that BC Partners has agreed to buy Migros T√ºrk in Turkey's biggest-ever leveraged buyout. The London-based firm will trade Koc Holding 1.98 billion TL for a 51 percent stake in Migros T√ºrk. Later BC increased its stake to 98 per cent. In 2011, the group sold approximately 20% back to public market investors. BC Partners revealed in January 2015 that it would sell its 40.25 percent stake in its supermarket chain Migros to the Turkish conglomerate Anadolu Group for around $2.74 billion. The Migros logo The logo of Migros Turkey is similar to an older version of the Swiss Migros logo but uses a dotted i, as the dotless I represents a different letter in the Turkish alphabet with phonetic value , a close back unrounded vowel. As in Switzerland, the supermarkets are categorized in three size classes of M, MM and MMM but with another size 5M: * M Migros supermarkets are selling basic groceries and a limited number of non-food products * MM Migros stores offer a wider range of non-food articles besides the basic groceries * MMM Migros stores have a larger product spectrum ranging from stationery to textile products, electric household appliances to bakeries, books and cosmetics * Additionally there is a fourth class, the 5M Migros have the widest product selection and are found mostly in the Anatolian Tigers or tourist areas of the southwest coast, as well as in Ankara. * Additionally there is a fifth class, the Migros jet, mini-markets in boroughs, formed by acquisition of Tansa≈ü resembling its Mini Tansa≈ü line. Migros vends some products under its own label. History thumb The municipality of Istanbul founded Migros Turkey in 1954 as a joint venture with Swiss Migros Cooperatives Union. Initially, Migros Turkey operated via 45 sales trucks (the same as its Swiss counterpart) only later to open stores fronts ‚Äì the first in 1957 Beyoƒülu, Istanbul. In 1975, the Ko√ß Group took control of the company by acquiring a majority of its shares. Thereafter, Migros rapidly increased the number of stores in Istanbul, establishing the necessary infrastructure for purchasing fruits and vegetables directly from producers and farmers. In 1981, a central perishables warehouse was opened. It is still in use, with some alterations and improvements. In 1988, following development in Istanbul, 4 large stores were opened in ƒ∞zmir, and infrastructure investment were started in the Aegean region. In addition to neighborhood stores in Istanbul and ƒ∞zmir, larger stores were opened in new residential and suburban areas ‚Äì an MM market in ƒ∞zmir, followed by two MMM stores in Istanbul, in 1991. Since late 1990, almost all of the older stores have been renovated, equipped with fully automated systems, introducing computerized and automatic cash registers. In 1991, Migros became a publicly traded company. Around this time, Migros extended its chain of supermarkets to other large cities, such as Antalya, Ankara and Bursa, and the resorts destinations of Marmaris, Bodrum, Silivri and Yalova. In 1992, payment with credit card and customer satisfaction questionnaires were introduced. On its 40th anniversary, the company expanded in Ankara with two more stores and in Adana and Mersin. In 1994, Migros was named \\"the most successful company in Turkey\\" and was also shown as one of the most successful companies in Europe by the Euromoney magazine. 1995 brought a rapid growth to Migros with the opening of stores in 17 provinces, including Southeastern Anatolia and Adana, Gaziantep, Edirne, Tekirdaƒü and Eski≈üehir. In 1995, Migros introduced a low-cost brand outlet named ≈ûok. Started in Istanbul, the discount markets expanded to Ankara and ƒ∞zmir. ≈ûoks offer both food and non food items. =Rapid growth= In 1996, Migros Turkey introduced nearly a new store every week, establishing 51 new stores. A supermarket was opened in Erzurum, and by the end of the year, 75 million people were being served by 124 stores in 20 cities and six regions of Turkey. In 1997, it increased the number of stores in Turkey to 169, serving 125 million customers. As in previous years, it opened 50 new stores and shopping centers in 1998 and expanded its service to 27 cities in total. Throughout 1999, its growth rate reached two stores per week on average, adding 108 new stores and two shopping centers. In 1996, Migros opened its first store outside of Turkey ‚Äì a Ramstore in Baku, Azerbaijan ‚Äì followed up the next year with a shopping center in Moscow, Russia. With the success of the first Ramstore in Baku, four new stores were opened in Azerbaijan. Migros opened a second, larger, Ramstore shopping center in Moscow's Maryina Roscha district.

Also in 1999, Migros Turkey launched its online presence, Kangurum, hosting more than 25,000 products from 60 different stores, ranging from refrigerators, wedding rings, toys, bouquet arrangements, and tomatoes to vacation reservations. Migros presented the Bakkalƒ±m (literally: My Grocery) store format in the first quarter of 2000, spreading in Istanbul, ƒ∞zmir and Ankara; they number 700, today. Throughout 2001, Migros Online added Antalya and Adana to its service area. In 2001, Kangurum introduced wholesale market service, with B2B providing corporate transactions.

In 2003, Migros opened its first retail store with direct access to subway in Metrocity, a shopping mall in the Levent district of Istanbul. There are currently approximately 7 million customers holding Migros Club Cards. In 2006, –∞ Ramstore was opened in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan through Kazakh subsidiary. It is reported that Migros Turk's market share was 8.6 percent at the end of 2006, compared with 5.3 percent for its second place competitor. Ramstores in Sofia, Bulgaria were closed down in 2007. In September 2007, Migros sold its 50% interest in Ramenka, which operated 53 Ramstores in Russia and other Eastern European countries, for US$542.5m to its venture partner: Enka Holdings (Enka Insaat Sanayi AS). In 2006, that operation accounted for about a fifth of Migros's revenue of US$3.3 billion. In February 2008, BC Partners Ltd. agreed to acquire Migros T√ºrk TAS, Turkey's largest supermarket chain, for about US$3.2 billion in the country's biggest-ever leveraged buyout, gaining 961 stores in Turkey and nearby countries through the acquisition.

He published more than 20 novels, mostly mysteries and crime thrillers, some under the pseudonym Bill Peters. His novels were adapted for a number of films, among them Odds Against Tomorrow (1959), a noir tale of three losers, starring Harry Belafonte; The Big Heat (1953), starring Glenn Ford as a cop who will do anything to get his man; Shield for Murder, about an honest cop going bad; and Rogue Cop (1954), a film noir directed by Roy Rowland, about a crooked cop trying to redeem himself. The Big Heat received an Edgar Award in 1954 as Best Motion Picture, which McGivern shared as author of the original novel. He also published more than one hundred science fiction stories during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote for television and film. Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois, to an Irish-American family, McGivern grew up in Mobile, Alabama. After serving in the Army in World War II and studying at the University of Birmingham in England, McGivern returned to the US. He worked for two years as a police reporter for the Philadelphia Bulletin and later as a writer for The Evening Bulletin. His first novel was published in 1948. In 1947, he married Maureen Daly, a journalist and author of the bestseller Seventeenth Summer (1942). William and Maureen McGivern co-wrote Mention My Name in Mombasa: the Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad, which covered their times and adventures living oversees, including in Kenya; Torremolinos, Spain; and Ireland. In the early 1960s, McGivern moved to Los Angeles to write for film and television. His credits include the TV series Ben Casey, Adam-12, and Kojak; and the William Castle film, I Saw What You Did (1965). McGivern died in Palm Desert, California in 1982, aged 63.

It is located from the center of Paris. It was formally twinned with Hove, East Sussex in The United Kingdom. The former village of Champrosay is now part of the commune. Draveil is situated between the banks of the Seine and the Forest of S√©nart which gives the whole town a very green environment. In fact, the official motto of the town in Latin is \\"Inter undas et arbores\\", which can be translated into English as \\"between water and trees\\", a reference to its location between the Seine and the Forest of S√©nart. Hardly a third of Draveil's area has been developed, thus offering a preserved environment to its inhabitants. Draveil also hosts a large green park called the \\"Base de loisirs du Port-aux-Cerises\\" that covers over 175 hectares including trees, lakes and activity areas including a horse-riding club, an amusement park for children, an open-air swimming-pool, football field, tennis courts, acrobranche rope park, a small marina with berthing space for about thirty boats, etc. With a score of 7,16/10, Draveil ranks 49th among the 100 best French towns with a population of over 20,000 inhabitants. This result is a survey conducted permanently among the French population and takes into account the following factors : environment, security, medical facilities, cultural events, sports, shops and transport. Inhabitants of Draveil are known as Draveillois. History Human presence in Draveil during the Neolithic period is suggested by the discovery of a menhir called the \\"Pierre √† Mousseaux\\" dating from the fourth millennium BC and confirmed by the presence of tools and weapons in flint cut found in the Mainville quarter of Draveil. The Gauls named the place Dracvern meaning \\"the spirit of the Alder\\". The Romans called it Dravernum. In the Merovingian period a money minting facility was installed here, which minted one-third of a gold sol called \\"Draverno\\". Famous inhabitants A list of famous people who were either born or lived in Draveil include : * Eug√®ne Delacroix, painter * Ivan Turgenev, writer * Nadar, photographer * Edmond de Goncourt, writer * Charles Euphrasie Kuwasseg, painter * Alphonse Daudet, writer * Marie Laurencin painter * Jean-Jacques Annaud, cinematographer *Paul Lafargue, Marxist political writer/activist * Joffrey Torvic, footballer Schools The town has eight preschools * Ecole √©cole Champrosay * Ecole maternelle Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry * Ecole maternelle Hameau de Mainville * Ecole maternelle Jean Jaur√®s * Ecole maternelle Jules Ferry * Ecole maternelle Le belv√©d√®re * Ecole maternelle Le Parc de Villiers * Ecole maternelle Pierre Brossolette It also has ten primary schools * Ecole √©cole Champrosay * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Hameau de Mainville * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Jean Jaur√®s * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Jules Ferry * Ecole √©l√©mentaire L Orme des Mazi√®res * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Le belv√©d√®re * Ecole √©l√©mentaire Le Parc de Villiers * Ecole primaire priv√©e Notre-Dame (private) There are three middle schools: * Alphonse Daudet * Eug√®ne Delacroix and * Notre Dame (private). Draveil has one professional high school named \\"Lyc√©e Nadar\\". High schools around Draveil are either public like Lyc√©e Rosa Parks in Montg√©ron. There are three respected private institutions around Draveil: * Institut de Saint Pierre in Brunoy * Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion in √âvry and * Lyc√©e Saint Louis Saint Cl√©ment in Viry-Ch√¢tillon. These private schools have a merit-based entrance scheme, have European curriculum, teach languages such as Chinese, etc. Facilities for children The infant department at the Mairie supervises a wide-range of day- care centres namely a family cr√®che, collective cr√®ches like L‚Äô√éle-aux-Bambins and Pomme-de-Rainette, parent-run day-care centres like cr√®che T√©tine et Doudou and two other day-care centres \\"Mazi√®res\\" and \\"Villiers\\" that offer √† la carte hours. During school vacations, children are offered activities in \\"centres de loisirs\\" organised in the school premises in Villiers, Mazi√®res, Jean-Jaur√®s, Brossolette, Belv√©d√®re, Champrosay, Jules-Ferry, Mainville, Saint-Exup√©ry and Pierre et Marie-Curie. Besides, the Mairie also organises a sports-oriented programme for kids between 8 and 14 called \\"Totalement sport\\". Sports A wide range of sports facilities are available at the \\"Base de loisirs du Port-aux-Cerises\\" namely, cano√´ing, kayaking, sailing, football field, tennis courts, minigolf, skatepark and horse-riding. A rowing club and a yachting club are based on the banks of the Seine. Two other swimming pools (Caneton and Mainville) that offer different activities like aquagym are also available. In the Bergeries quarter of the town, the COSEC Ferdinand-Buisson offers facilities for handball, table-tennis, badminton, gymnastics and martial arts. Other sports complex around the town organise activities such as volleyball, tennis, athletics, basketball, boxing, roller-blading, etc. Health A survey in 2010 found that there were thirty-eight doctors (general practitioners and specialists), fourteen dental surgeons, eleven pharmacists, etc. Public Transport Many buses ply between many areas in Draveil round-the-clock on a regular basis. Fares for the buses are included in the Navigo pass. Buses from Draveil also serve Juvisy, Orly Airport, Rungis International Market and other neighbouring towns. Draveil is not directly linked to the Paris M√©tro network. This is a result of a decision taken by the local authorities in order to keep land developers at bay and preserve the town's provincial charm. The Paris metro network can be reached from Juvisy station, which is across the Seine. Juvisy station has two RER lines to reach the centre of Paris within 15 minutes: RER line C and RER line D. This station is located in the neighboring commune of Juvisy-sur-Orge, from the town center of Draveil.

What had been a small Greek settlement of unknown name that originated in the late 7th century BC and that acted as a port for the city of Barca, inland, he transformed into a city that enclosed 280 hectares within its walls. Ptolemais probably served as the residence of the Ptolemaic governor of the region but, in spite of its large area, its population did not rival that of Cyrene, which under Roman rule became the capital of the region that, from then on, and still today, is called Cyrenaica. However, the term \\"Pentapolis\\" also continued to be used.O. Brogan, \\"Ptolemais (Tolmeta), Cyrenaica, Libya\\" in Richard Stillwell et alii, The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites (Princeton University Press 1976) Villa of Columns Ptolemais became a Roman possession in 96 BC. It was soon included in the Roman province of Crete and Cyrenaica. With Diocletian's alteration of the administrative structure, Ptolemais became the capital of the province of Libya Superior or Libya Pentapolis. It later decayed and was replaced as capital of the province by Apollonia. The 365 Crete earthquake struck the region and destroyed all the five major cities of the Pentapolis. Ptolemais survived the tragedy in relatively good condition. It served as capital of Cyrenaica until 428. The city was destroyed by the Libyans in 411. During the reign of Justinian I the city was rebuilt, but it never regained its powers and was again destroyed during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th century.  Remains  Buried in the sands, the town's ruins have been remarkably well preserved.Kraeling, Carl H. et al. (1962) \\"Ptolemis, City of the Libyan Pentapolis\\" The Oriental Instuitute, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Excavation of the site began in the 1930s, revealing a planned city of rectangular shape, some 1650 by 1400 metres (about one square mile) and composed of blocks of about 180 by 36 metres. It held a hippodrome, an amphitheatre, and three theatres, the smallest of which, used as an odeon, was adapted for water spectacles in the 4th or 5th century. A Roman aqueduct, probably of the time of Hadrian, brought water from 20 km away, which was stored in two large open reservoirs in the east of the city, while further west a porticoed space, now called the Square of the Cisterns, stood above a set of seventeen vaulted cisterns, capable of holding 7,000 kilolitres. These were rediscovered during the Italian occupation, when they were found to be used as a hiding place for rebels, two or three hundred of whom could easily hide in them. West of the city stands a conspicuous and tower-like Hellenistic mausoleum, known as Qasr Faraoun. There are many chamber tombs in the quarries east and west of the city, which have yielded a few tombstones and numerous inscriptions. Important sculptures and inscriptions have also been found within the city, including imperial edicts such as that by which Diocletian attempted to fix prices. In 2001 an archaeological mission from Warsaw University started excavations on the site. In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Ptolemais in 1937 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in Benghazi were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artifacts which were part of the so-called Benghazi Treasure. The objects have not been traced.  Bishopric  The Ptolemais of Libya, whose ruins are located near the Libyan city of Tolmeita, was also the Seat of the ancient Christian bishopric of Libya Pentapolitana.Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 5, —Å—Ç—Ä. 324; vol. 6, —Å—Ç—Ä. 349; vol. 7, —Å—Ç—Ä. 314‚Äì315; vol. 8, —Å—Ç—Ä. 471‚Äì472.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, (Parigi, 1740), vol.II, coll. 617‚Äì622.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, (Leipzig, 1931), p462 Ptolemais became a Catholic Church diocese at an early stage, since it seems to have been the see of the Pentapolitan bishop Basilides to whom, in a letter of about 260 quoted by Eusebius,Eusebius, Church History, 7:26:2. Pope Dionysius of Alexandria said he had sent a copy of a commentary on Ecclesiastes. Another early bishop of Ptolemais is Saint Theodore of Sykeon, martyred during the anti-Christian persecutions. The First Council of Nicaea confirmed the custom whereby the bishop of Alexandria held authority over the churches in the Pentapolis, although they were not situated in the same Roman province.First Council of Nicaea, canon 6 Accordingly, none of the bishoprics in the Pentapolis was a metropolitan see for the others, but all acted as suffragan bishops of Alexandria. Ptolemais was the home of Arius, after whom the Arianism condemned at Nicaea in 325 was named. Secundus, who was bishop of Ptolemais and a patron of Arius, is listed among those present at the council. He refused to accept its decree and was deposed by the bishop of Alexandria, but later recovered power. His Arian successor Stephanus was deposed in about 360. Synesius was bishop of Ptolemais from about 407 to 413, and was succeeded by his brother Evoptius, who took part in the Council of Ephesus (431), which condemned Nestorius. The acts of the Second Council of Constantinople (553) were signed by Georgius of Ptolemais. The last bishop of Ptolemais mentioned by the sources is Gabriel (6th century), the signing Archbishop Gabrielis Pentapolis. Information on all of these can be found, for instance, in Michel Le Quien's work. No longer a residential bishopric, Ptolemais in Libya is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 993 David Cheney, Diocese of Ptolemais of Libya, at Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

He was the most famous plectrum banjoist of his era. Early years Born in Reading, Massachusetts,DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 212. Peabody taught himself to play the violin, mandolin, guitar and banjo while very young.  Military service  In March 1916, at age 14, Peabody enlisted in the U.S. Navy by lying about his age, and served in World War I on an S-14 submarine. During this period he received the nicknames \\"Happiness Boy\\" (for his ebullient personality, especially when performing) and \\"Little Eddie\\" (a comic reference to his short stature).  Career  After Peabody's 1921 discharge from the Navy, he began a long career in show business, beginning with Vaudeville. His successful recordings for the Columbia Company made him a household name. Peabody's energetic playing style, which included fast triplets, glissandos and cross-picking simulating the sound of two banjoists, prompted a 1920s reviewer to nickname him \\"King Of The Banjo\\"‚Äîa sobriquet he retained the rest of his life. In the 1930s, Peabody promoted the plectrum banjo by visiting many of England's BMG (Banjo, Mandolin and Guitar) clubs which were popular in the years prior to World War II. When the U.S. entered WW II, Peabody returned to the Navy as a morale officer with the rank of Lt. Commander. He performed in shows for servicemen and directed the music and band departments of the Great Lakes Training Station near Chicago, Illinois. After the war, Peabody attempted to restart his concert career. By then, most Vaudeville halls had closed and musical tastes had changed. In 1948, the Art Mooney Orchestra resurrected the 1920s standard I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover and created interest in both nostalgic music and the banjo. Capitalizing on this trend, Peabody recorded several albums for Dot Records and performed at the supper clubs which were popular at the time. His subsequent TV appearances made him a household name once again. He went on to produce records, appear in movies, and inspire generations of banjoists who continue to emulate his spirited style. Later accomplishments In partnership with the Vega Banjo Company of Boston, Peabody developed a new type of plectrum banjo called the Vegavox, featuring a resonator that rose the full height of the banjo's body. (Traditional resonators are about half as high.) This increased the banjo's interior resonation space, giving it a distinctively mellow tone. The Vegavox also featured a \\"top-tension\\" design that allowed the head's tension to be adjusted without removing the resonator. The Vegavox was produced primarily in four-stringed plectrum (22-fret) and tenor (19-fret) versions; however, some five-string models were made as special orders. Peabody also developed a special electric banjo‚Äîfirst with Vega, and later with the Fender Company and Rickenbacker‚Äîcalled the Banjoline. It was tuned as a plectrum banjo but with the 3rd and 4th strings doubled in octaves, as on a 12-string guitar.*The Banjo Wizardry of Eddie Peabody, Dot Records DLP-3023 (mono) (date not known), liner notes The Banjoline is now a highly prized collector's item, although it is seldom used in live performance. Peabody performed for national leaders around the world. In 1958, Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded him a distinguished People To People Award for meritorious service in both the military and show business. According to one broadcast veteran, a radio announcer once mis-introduced Peabody by saying, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Eddie Playbody will now pee for you\\". Personal life In the 1920s Peabody married his business manager Maude Kelly. After making several visits to the Mission Inn in Riverside, California, the Peabodys lived in Riverside from 1928 to 1939 when they divorced. In 1940 he married Ragna Kaupanger, a Norwegian-American nurse and United Airlines flight attendant. They had two children, Eddie Jr. and George Robert Peabody. Peabody continued to perform until his death in 1970, at age 68, due to a brain hemorrhage suffered while onstage at the Lookout House Supper Club in Covington, Kentucky. His wife, Ragna Peabody, died in 2002. See also * American Banjo Museum Hall of Fame members  Further reading  * The Tin Pan Alley Song Encyclopedia, Thomas S.

Located on the Velian Hill, between the eastern edge of the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum, in Rome, it was dedicated to the goddesses Venus Felix (\\"Venus the Bringer of Good Fortune\\") and Roma Aeterna (\\"Eternal Rome\\"). The building was the creation of the emperor Hadrian and construction began in 121. It was officially inaugurated by Hadrian in 135, and finished in 141 under Antoninus Pius. Damaged by fire in 307, it was restored with alterations by the emperor Maxentius. History The temple was erected on the remains of Emperor Nero's Domus Transitoria, and subsequent Domus Aurea, and first the Colossus of Nero was moved and placed near the amphitheatre, which shortly afterwards became known as the Colosseum. An elaborate domed rotunda from the Domus Transitoria is still intact beneath the temple, an extravagant architectural design which included marble-lined pools and paving in multicoloured opus sectile.John Bryan Ward-Perkins, Roman Imperial Architecture, Yale University Press, 1994. p 57, Unimpressed by Hadrian's architectural design for the temple, his most brilliant architect, Apollodorus, made a scornful remark on the size of the seated statues within the cellae, saying that they would surely hurt their heads if they tried to stand up from their thrones. Apollodorus was banished and executed not long after this.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 69.4 According to the ancient historian Ammianus Marcellinus the temple was among the great buildings of Rome which astonished the Emperor Constantius II on his visit to the city in 357.Lanciani,Rodolfo Amedeo (1901) The Destruction of Ancient Rome The sanctuary was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Further restoration was performed under Eugenius, a short-lived usurper (392‚Äì394) against Theodosius I, whose policy was the restoration of Pagan cults and temples. However, as with many of Rome's majestic ancient buildings the temple was later targeted for its rich materials. In 630 Pope Honorius I with the consent of the Emperor Heraclius, removed the gilt-bronze tiles from the roof of the temple for the adornment of St. Peter's.Lanciani,Rodolfo Amedeo (1901) The Destruction of Ancient Rome Temple of Venus and Roma seen from the Colosseum A severe earthquake at the beginning of the 9th century is believed to have destroyed the temple. Around 850 Pope Leo IV ordered the building of a new church, Santa Maria Nova, on the ruins of the temple. After a major rebuilding in 1612, this church was renamed Santa Francesca Romana, incorporating Roma's cella as the belltower. A somewhat fanciful vedute engraving by Giovanni Battista Mercati depicts the site in 1629. The vast quantity of marble that once adorned the temple has all but disappeared due to its use as a raw material for building projects from the Middle Ages onwards. The Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani makes reference to his discovery of a lime kiln in close proximity to the temple in his work The Destruction of Ancient Rome. Architecture Bronze follis struck by Maxentius in Rome 308 - 310 AD. This coin is commemorating the reconstruction of the temple of Roma following the fire in 307 AD. Roma holding globe and sceptre seated within hexastyle temple with shield on the ground is depicted on the reverse. It was set on a platform measuring x . The peripteral temple itself measured x and high (counting the statues) and consisted of two main chambers (cellae), each housing a cult statue of a god-- Venus, the goddess of love, and Roma, the goddess of Rome, both figures seated on a throne. The cellae were arranged symmetrically back-to-back. Roma's cella faced west, looking out over the Forum Romanum, and Venus' cella faced east, looking out over the Colosseum. A row of four columns (tetrastyle) lined the entrance to each cella, and the temple was bordered by colonnaded entrances ending in staircases that led down to the Colosseum. As an additional clever subtlety by Hadrian, Venus also represented love (Amor in Latin), and \\"AMOR\\" is \\"ROMA\\" spelled backwards. Thus, placing the two divinities of Venus and Rome back-to-back in a single temple created a further symmetry with the back- to-back symmetry of their names. Within Venus' cella was another altar where newly wed couples could make sacrifices. Directly adjacent to this altar stood gigantic silver statues of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. The west and east sides of the temple (the short sides) had ten white marble columns (decastyle) while the south and north sides featured twenty columns. All of these columns measured in width, making the temple very imposing. Most of the remains are incorporated in the church of S.Francesca Romana and due to the rebuilding by Maxentius. A coffered vaulted ceiling replaced the original wooden roof and the walls were doubled in thickness to take the increased load. The walls were inset with niches with small statues between small red porphyry columns standing above the floor on a plinth, all fronted by a colonnade in red porphyry.Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide, A. Claridge, 1998 , p. 114 Today Canopy erected at the Temple of Venus and Rome during Good Friday ceremonies Since the papacy of John Paul II, the heights of the temple and its position opposite the main entrance to the Colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform. This may be seen in the photograph at right where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the Pope as well as an illuminated cross, on the occasion of the Good Friday ceremony. The Pope, either personally or through a representative, leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the Colosseum. The Temple has now been reopened to the public after an extensive restoration programme that lasted 26 years. Access to the temple is included in tickets for the Colosseum, the Forum and the Palatine Hill.  See also  * List of Ancient Roman temples NotesReferences * Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro. 1987.

The term 'local' means that the prison holds people on remand to the local courts, as well as sentenced prisoners. Leicester Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated immediately north of Nelson Mandela Park (formerly Welford Road Recreation Ground). According to Colin Crosby, a Blue Badge guide based in Leicester,http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk tourists invariably ask if the prison is 'Leicester Castle', due to the embattled, medieval design of its frontage, and its unique appearance has also made it one of the city's most celebrated landmarks. Known throughout the nineteenth century as the 'County Gaol', today the prison has become synonymous with the thoroughfare on which it stands, and is commonly referred to as 'Welford Road Prison', or simply, 'Welford Road'.BBC Radio Leicester website, \\"Where I Live in Leicester\\", 24 September 2014 History The prison was designed by Leicester county surveyor William Parsons to resemble a castle and cost ¬£20,000. The oldest part dates from 1825, and it was opened in 1828. The gatehouse including the adjoining building to north and south and the perimeter wall are grade II listed. The journalist William Cobbett, who wrote about his journeys around England in the early 19th century, criticised the people of Leicester for being proud of their new prison, feeling that it would be more praiseworthy to have an absence of crime.Royal Geographical Society: A free self-guided walk in Leicester, 2012 The prison's distinctive, red brick perimeter walls are thought to be the highest in the country, with an estimated height of 30 feet.http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk/location/leicester/leicester-prison/ The only known escape by a prisoner through scaling the wall was an ill-fated one, made by renowned 'safe-blower', Albert Hattersley on the evening of 18 December 1953. Hattersley made his way through a skylight in the prison's workshop and used webbing and a long pipe which he had broken from a wall in the workshop toilets to help him scale the wall. He then chose to drop by his fingertips from a part of the wall which was located above the governor's garden, in the hope that the soft earth would help break his fall. However, Hattersley suffered a broken ankle, with his right tibia protruding the skin. After several hours on the run, he was re-captured the following day.Leicester Mercury, 19 December 1953 In 2014, it was reported that prison officers had thwarted a similar plan for an escape over the wall by an inmate who was serving six years for robbery. In describing what was envisaged by the inmate as a \\"Shawshank Redemption-style prison break\\", the Leicester Mercury reported that following a search of his cell, prison guards had discovered torn bed sheets tied together \\"to form ropes\\", along with mattress covers adjusted for use in negotiating barbed wire. It was reported that they also discovered a \\"boarded-up section\\" in the cell, with a panel that could be removed to access a hole the prisoner had been digging.Leicester Mercury, 17 January 2014 Building The gatehouse, adjoining buildings and perimeter wall are Grade II listed. It was built between 1825-28 by William Parsons, the county surveyor, and received additions between 1844-46 by M.J. Dain. Executions at Leicester Prison There have been 23 executions carried out at Leicester Prison, between the years 1829 and 1953. The youngest person executed was John Swift, aged 19 in 1877, and the oldest was Thomas Bloxham, aged 62, in 1887. With the exception of the first four executions (carried out for offences of horse theft and highway robbery), all executions were carried out for offences of murder. All of those executed were male, with the exception of Sarah Smith in 1832 and there have been two triple executions, in 1829 and 1877, and two double executions, in 1903 and 1944.Source: Capital Punishment UK, website =19th Century public executions= Executions at Leicester Prison were originally carried out publicly, typically attracting many thousands of spectators. On 20 April 1829, a triple execution was carried out in front of the newly opened prison when Charles Forrester (21), John Hinton (25) and William Varnam (24) were hanged for horse stealing. In reporting the incident, the Leicester Chronicle newspaper noted that after the executioner had pulled caps over the faces of the condemned men, \\"a short but painful suspense took place, owing to some difficulty in removing the bolt which causes the platform on which they stood, to fall\\". It was also noted that about half of the huge crowd that had assembled to watch the event were women and children.Leicester Chronicle, 25 April 1829 On 7 April 1830, John Watkins (28) was hanged for highway robbery.http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/1828.html On 26 March 1832, a particularly large crowd attended the hanging of Sarah Smith, a 28 year old woman from Mountsorrel. She had killed Elizabeth Wood, a woman in her care, by adding arsenic to her tea.Leicester Mercury, Executions of Samuel Haywood (article) 12 April 2012 This was the only execution of a female to be carried out at Leicester Prison. Also in 1832, a prisoner hanged at Leicester became one of the last two men in England to be gibbeted. James Cook (21) was a bookbinder, convicted of the murder of his creditor Paas, a manufacturer of brass instruments, in Leicester. He was executed on Friday 10 August 1832 in front of the prison. Following his execution it was noted: \\"The head was shaved and tarred, to preserve it from the action of the weather; and the cap in which he had suffered was drawn over his face. On Saturday afternoon his body, attired as at the time of his execution, having been firmly fixed in the irons necessary to keep the limbs together, was carried to the place of its intended suspension.\\" His body was displayed on a purpose-built gallows, 33 ft high in Saffron Lane near the Aylestone Tollgate and, according to The Newgate Calendar, \\"thousands of persons were attracted to the spot, to view this novel but most barbarous exhibition; and considerable annoyance was felt by persons resident in the neighbourhood of the dreadful scene. Representations were in consequence made to the authorities, and on the following Tuesday morning instructions were received from the Home Office directing the removal of the gibbet.\\" Gibbeting was soon after abolished in England, in 1834http://www.medievalwarfare.info/torture.htm William Hubbard (23) was hanged on 1 April 1846, for the murder of his wife at Leicester, having cut her throat with a butcher's knife.Leicestershire Mercury, 4 April 1846 John Fowkes (45) was hanged on 19 March 1856 for the murder of his 20 year old nephew, John Acres Fowkes, at Snarestone.Leicester Journal, 21 March 1856 The last public execution at Leicester Prison took place on 25 July 1856, when an estimated crowd of 25,000 gathered to watch the hanging of William (\\"Peppermint Billy\\") Brown, aged 33, for the murder of Edward Woodward, a 78 year old tollgate keeper of Thorpe Arnold and his ten year old grandson.Butt, Stephen: Melton Mowbray Through Time, Amberley Publishing, 2009http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk/location/leicester/leicester-prison/ Following the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 public executions were abolished and all hangings thereafter were carried out inside the prison, behind closed doors. =19th Century private executions= For a short period between 1876 and 1877, executions at Leicester appear to have been carried out at the Borough Gaol on Highcross, where two hangings are recorded as having been carried out - those of John Thomas Green (41) on 20 December 1876Morpeth Herald, 20 December 1876 and John Henry Starkey (28) on 31 July 1877.Leicester Journal, Fri 3 August 1877 Both men were hanged for the murder of their wives. Hanging was resumed at the County Gaol on Welford Road on 27 November 1877, when the last triple execution to be carried out at the prison took place. James Satchwell (28), John Swift (19) and John Upton (32) were executed for the murder of Joseph Tugby, a 65 year old pedlar. Tugby had been drinking with the three men at the Stamford and Warrington public house in Coalville before they had followed him and kicked him to death at a nearby railway bridge. The scaffold upon which Satchwell, Swift and Upton were hanged was specially strengthened for the job by the executioner, William Marwood.Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 28 November 1877 On 16 August 1886, James Banton (27) was hanged for the murder of PC Thomas Barratt at Breedon-on-the-Hill by the executioner William Berry.Sky, Nicola: \\"Grim Almanac of Leicestershire\\", 2013 On 11 February 1887, Thomas Bloxham (62), was hanged for the murder of his 48 year old wife, Ann, at their home in Fairfax Street, Leicester. Bloxham, who believed his wife had been unfaithful, first attempted to shoot her with a revolver but missed, after which he cut her throat, almost severing the head. Bloxham then tried to commit suicide by turning the revolver on himself, but the gun misfired, at which point he gave up and called the police.Sky, Nicola: \\"Grim Almanac of Leicestershire\\", 2013 On 10 December 1894, John William Newell (42), was hanged for the murder of his wife at Loughborough. Newell had beat his wife to death with a coal hammer at their grocer's shop on Woodgate, believing that she had been sleeping with a lodger. After killing her, Newell went into the street and confessed of his deed to a patrolling policeman.

The newspaper reported that seven years earlier in 1993, Inquest, a charity which campaigns for the families of people who die in custody, had described HMP Leicester as the \\"suicide capital of the prison system\\".Will Woodford, Guardian newspaper, 22 March 2000 In 2001 Leicester again hit headlines as a 'failing prison' and David Ramsbotham, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, declared that it should be shut down. In 2004 the Prison Reform Trust described Leicester as one of the most overcrowded prisons in the country, and suggested that its true design capacity was around 200. In November 2006 an inspection report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Leicester Prison after nine inmates died there in a 28-month period. Continued overcrowding and poor health at the prison were also highlighted. The prison in 2014 Leicester is a local prison for adult males, sentenced and on remand from the local courts. The main living accommodation is a long rectangular cell block with four landings, with full integral sanitation and in cell electricity. Employment for inmates at the prison centres around Education, Kitchen and Domestic Cleaners. Education at Leicester Prison is provided by Milton Keynes College, and is mainly focused on vocational and foundation subjects. The prison also has a library provision, gym and chaplaincy covering a variety of faiths.

It often refers to a mode of criticism that locates the reasons for such conditions in a society considered to be in a flawed social structure. It may also refer to people adhering to a social critic's aims at practical solutions by way of specific measures either for consensual reform or powerful revolution.  Protest experience with political theories  Repression experienced by a minority often leads to protest. Without sufficient resolution of the dispute, a social criticism can be formulated, often covered by political groups (political monopoly). For protesting people within a social movement, it is often frustrating to experience failure of the movement and its own agenda. The positivism dispute between critical rationalism, e.g. between Karl Popper and the Frankfurt School, is the academic form of the same discrepancy. This dispute deals with the question of whether research in the social sciences should be \\"neutral\\" or consciously adopt a partisan view. Academic forms Academic works of social criticism can belong to social philosophy, political economy, sociology, social psychology, psychoanalysis but also cultural studies and other disciplines or reject academic forms of discourse. In literature and music Social criticism can also be expressed in a fictional form, e.g. in a revolutionary novel like The Iron Heel by Jack London; in dystopian novels like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (1953), or Rafael Grugman's Nontraditional Love (2008); or in children's books or films. Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe furthered the anti- slavery movement in the United States, and the 1885 novel Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson, brought about changes in laws regarding Native Americans. Similarly, Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle helped create new laws related to public health and food handling, and Arthur Morrison's 1896 novel A Child of the Jago caused England to change its housing laws. George Orwell and Charles Dickens wrote Animal Farm and A Tale of Two Cities, respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature. Animal Farm, written in 1944, is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in which the farm animals revolt against their human masters. It is an example of social criticism in literature in which Orwell satirized the events in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution. He anthropomorphises the animals, and alludes each one to a counterpart in Russian history. A Tale of Two Cities also typifies this kind of literature. Besides the central theme of love, is another prevalent theme, that of a revolution gone bad. He shows us that, unfortunately, human nature causes us to be vengeful and, for some of us, overly ambitious. Both these books are similar in that both describe how, even with the best of intentions, our ambitions get the best of us. Both authors also demonstrate that violence and the Machiavellian attitude of \\"the ends justifying the means\\" are deplorable. They also express their authors' disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature. According to Frederick Douglass, \\"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.\\"From Douglass' speech in 1886 on the 24th anniversary of emancipation, Washington, D.C. The authors imply, that even if we begin with honourable intentions, there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control. Animal Farm portrays this nature through parodying events in real history. Given the right conditions, these events could happen anywhere. Take for example, a leader becoming overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power. In A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens examines the inner soul, and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions, where desperation and anger reign, and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside. Every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless, opportunistic being like Napoleon or Madame Defarge, if placed in the right place, at the right time. Social criticism is certainly present in opera (e.g. The Cradle Will Rock or Trouble in Tahiti) and other types of classical music, such as the Symphony No.13, called \\"Babi Yar\\", of Dmitri Shostakovich. Other musical expressions of social criticism are frequent in punk and rap music, examples being \\"Pretty Vacant\\" by Sex Pistols and \\"Brenda's Got a Baby\\" by 2Pac. Heavy metal and industrial rock bands such as Black Sabbath, Metallica, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails and Megadeth also use social criticism extensively, particularly in their earlier works.

In 1929, the commune of Saint-Mand√© lost one-quarter of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a small part of which belonged to Saint-Mand√©, leaving Saint-Mand√© as a small rump commune after the territorial losses of 1860 and 1929.

Career Dello started his career as a musician in the skiffle era of the 1950s and was a founding member of the rock and roll band Grant Tracy and The Sunsets, after which he joined Steve Darbyshire's backing group, The Yum Yum Band, in the mid-1960s. This led onto him forming Honeybus, with whom he scored the hit single \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\" in 1968. He wrote songs with all his bands (and also for The Applejacks). The Dello-penned song \\"Do I Figure In Your Life?\\" has been covered by Dave Berry, Joe Cocker, Iain Matthews, Dave Stewart, Paul Carrack, Dana, Kate Taylor, Saturday's Crowd and Pierce Turner. His co-writer was Ray Cane. Dello was also a session musician, and he was hired for Unit 4 + 2, The Scaffold and The Roulettes. Quickly leaving Honeybus rather than tour and promote the single, he next cut a solo album Into Your Ears in 1971, and also worked with John Killigrew. Ultimately he quit the music industry for other interests during the 1970s. Since then Into Your Ears has become a collectable album, with copies selling for over ¬£1,200 in perfect condition.

Vocalist Carl McCoy is the only original band member to be featured on this album. McCoy along with John \\"Capachino\\" Carter (original Nefilim collaborator) spent eighteen months recording new demos in McCoy's mobile recording studio, dubbed \\"The Ice Cage\\" which took them to various places, including Norway. According to McCoy, Ice Cage sessions generated enough material for a double album, yet it was ultimately decided to narrow the track listing down to one disc. While McCoy has acknowledged that additional musicians were recruited for the writing and recording process,\\"The people who worked on the demos of \\"Mourning Sun\\" are the same musicians who played on the final recordings. The tracks were very long at the beginning, and required important work on their structures and arrangements.

Founding When TDT premiered in 1967 it was the first regular nightly current affairs program on Australian TV, and it extended ABC's award-winning coverage of current affairs, which had begun in the early 1960s with its flagship weekly program Four Corners. Background TDT was hosted for the first eight years by journalist Bill Peach. The original on-air team consisted of executive producer Allan Martin, and producers Sam Lipski and Ken Chown in Sydney and Bill Pritchard in Melbourne. The original reporters were 60 minutes, Gerald Stone Frank Bennett, Peter Luck, and Gordon Bick in Sydney; Gerald Lyons, Mike Crewdson and Brian King in Melbourne; and Eric Hunter in Canberra. Shortly after, Eric Hunter replaced Mike Crewdson in Melbourne and Mike Willesee became the program's first full-time political reporter. The fact that Melbourne reporters contributed to the programme with original material is often overlooked. Clive Hale hosted a South Australian version.Clive Hale, ABC Media Release, archived at Internet Archive, 6 June 2005 The impetus for this program sprang from Ken Watts, then ABC Director of Television, supported by Neil Hutchinson, ABC Controller of Programs. Watts had been in London and seen the BBC Tonight program, which ran from 1957 to 1965, and was one of the most popular programs in the UK at that time. He was determined to introduce a similar program into the ABC schedule. His first move was to second ABC Drama producer Storry Walton with a brief to identify reporters and on-air talent for a Sydney-based program with the working title of Tonight. Bill Peach was Walton's early nomination for compere, while Willesee, then Press Gallery reporter for the Perth Daily News was immediately hired after an impressive performance while being interviewed on the second night the program went to air. Watts knew that to support such a daily program would require a minimum of two on-line producers alternating, and for these he nominated Sam Lipski and Ken Chown in Sydney, supported by Bill Pritchard in Melbourne. The appointment of additional staff, obtaining and scheduling film and studio resources and setting the style and shape of the program along the lines he envisaged were further requirements. There was also the complexity of setting up contributing units in each state, and the utilization of the developing microwave networks allowing those units to feed into the Sydney studios, which would originate the program. Watts' next move was to find an executive producer with sufficient experience to take charge of the overall production. For this he looked to Allan Martin in New Zealand. Watts had met Martin and knew that he had worked as a producer/director for eight years in London for Associated- Rediffusion Television, and he was well aware of the BBC Tonight program. Martin had returned to NZ as TV Production Supervisor and later became Chief Producer NZBC TV initiating programs of the Tonight format in the four main centres of NZ entitled Town and Around. Watts offered Martin the position of executive producer. Having been assured by Watts that on-air staff had been identified, Martin proposed a start of six weeks after his arrival in Australia in late February 1967, and although confronted by a lack of facilities was able to meet that deadline. In March he issued a five page memo to all staff regarding what had been known as the Tonight project. It detailed operations in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, and the staff for the program, with dummy runs beginning on 27 March and transmission beginning on 10 April 1967. Martin, who was adamantly opposed to using the BBC title, made it clear in the memo that the program would be This Day Tonight. Having visited staff in all states it was clear to him that many of those involved in the production were unsure of the format. He attached an appendix to the operational memo which clearly outlined the nature, style and intention of the program.Original documents Allan Martin sighted T. Jeffrey Vanguard Productions Pty Ltd. Sydney Noted Australian journalist, author and filmmaker Tim Bowden also worked on the show as a producer. Other producers included Stuart Littlemore and John Crew. Journalists It was a training ground for a generation of leading Australian TV journalists, including Gerald Stone (later the producer of the Australian 60 Minutes), Richard Carleton, Caroline Jones, Sonia Humphrey, Mike Willesee, George Negus, Mike Carlton, Allan Hogan and Peter Couchman. TDT was renowned for its hard-hitting interviews, a craft brought to a high degree of perfection by Carlton and Negus; the program subjected Australian politicians to a novel degree of questioning and raised the hackles of politicians on both sides who were unused to being placed under such scrutiny. It also broke new ground with its famous \\"empty chair\\" tactic, naming politicians who had declined to appear on the show and showing the empty chair where an absent invitee was supposed to be seated. However, TDT sometimes took a more irreverent approach to stories. One notable example of its occasionally controversial editorial approach was a musical comedy sketch that satirised the actions of then-NSW Premier Robert Askin, who was reported to have ordered his driver to \\"run over the bastards\\" when anti-war demonstrators threw themselves in the front the car in which he and visiting U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson were travelling. TDT also ran annual April Fool's Day stories, including the \\"Dial-O-Fish\\" (an electronic device attached to a fishing rod that could be set to catch any desired species), a story alleging that the Sydney Opera House was sinking into the harbour, and a bogus report about the supposed abolition of the 24-hour clock and the introduction of a metric (or decimal) time system. Each of these reports generated considerable feedback, with hundreds of viewers reportedly taken in by the hoaxes. Awards TDT won many awards during its run, including Logie Awards for \\"Best New Program\\" in 1967, \\"Personal Effort Award - Special Commendation, Production Current Affairs Allan Martin\\", \\"Most Outstanding Coverage of Political Affairs\\" in 1971 and \\"Outstanding Contribution to TV Journalism\\" in 1977. Axing The show was axed in 1978, and replaced with Nationwide. Current affairs in the 7.30 time slot was reintroduced with The 7.30 Report in 1986.

Description Air Assault on Crete is a two-player wargame that simulates the German paratroop attack on Crete on May 20, 1941; one player takes on the defense of Crete by Allied forces, and the other player controls the invading German forces. The game provides a series of scenarios designed to simulate the various skirmishes and battles over the ten-day campaign at a company/battalion level. The 3-part 66\\" x 8\\" mapboard uses a hex grid scaled to 1.6 kilometres per hex. Other components include a 24-page rulebook and over 500 die-cut counters. Each turn, the German player completes five phases, and then the Allied player completes three phases: * German Play Segment ** Aircraft Placement & Bombardment Phase ** Airborn Assault and Air Landing Phase ** Sea Movement Phase ** Movement Phase ** Combat Phase * Allied Play Segment ** Sea Movement Phase ** Movement Phase ** Combat Phase Players can choose the Basic Game, with simplified rules and victory conditions, or the Advanced Game. A separate bonus game, Invasion of Malta, 1942, is also included. The game simulates Operation Hercules, a proposed German invasion of Malta that was planned by the German High Staff but never initiated. This game has its own counters and a separate 11\\" x 16\\" mapboard, and uses the same rules system as Air Assault on Crete. =Victory conditions= In the Basic Game, if the Germans can seize one airfield and hold it for four turns, then the German player wins the game. In the Advanced Game, there are several routes to victory: * If the Germans fail to seize an airfield by Turn 8, then the Allied player wins. * If the Germans seize an airfield by Turn 8, the Allied player can still win by successfully evacuating combatant and non- combatant units via any of seven designated escape routes on Turn 8 or later. If the Allied player has inflicted more than 75 German casualty losses, and has evacuated 80 casualty points in combat units or non-combatants after Turn 8, then the Allied player wins. If both of these conditions are not met, then the German player wins. Reception In the November-December 1978 issue of The Phoenix (Issue 16), Ralph Vickers called Air Assault on Crete \\"a good game for exercising your skills of simulating your own plans and out-guessing your opponent.\\" While Vickers found most of the rules had \\"good internal logic\\", he criticized one rule about evacuation that prevented non-combatant units from leaving their initial sector until Turn 8, saying, \\"What rationale can make this convincing and realistic?\\" While Vickers agreed that without this rule, the game \\"won't hang together\\", he called the rule \\"hocus-pocus\\". Despite this fault, Vickers concluded by giving the game a thumbs up, saying, \\"this is a game that is going to stay high on the popularity charts for a long time.\\" In The General, Vance von Borries pointed out that even if the German player is able to capture one or more airfields, the game is far from over if the Allied player can evacuate as quickly as possible. \\"Although the German player has the unique ability to lauch [a] humiliating aerial envelopment, the Commonwealth player can still turn that euphoric and overconfident airborne glory into a bloody fool holding an empty bag. Air Assault on Crete is, in that respect, probably the most satisfying wargame ever developed.\\" In The Escapist, John Keefer said, \\"The game does a good job of approximating the troop strengths, drops and reserves from the battle, offering several scenarios set over the course of the 10-day battle.\\" Further reviews *Campaign, Issue 85: \\"Thumbnail Analysis: Air Assault on Crete\\" (Don Lowry) *Campaign, Issue 86: \\"Review, Analysis and Impressions\\" (John G.

Early life  He graduated from Perm State Technical University in 1981 and received a degree from the Higher School of the KGB of the USSR in Moscow in 1985, after which he entered service in the KGBhttps://abcnews.go.com/Travel/perm-russias-cultural- capital/story?id=8915173https://www.voanews.com/europe/russian-city-moving- tanks-culture . He subsequently graduated from the Law Department of Perm State University in 1988. He received his PhD in economics in 1990.  Career  Chirkunov was the trade representative of Russia to Switzerland from 1991 to 1994. After that he worked with the business group ¬´Eks¬ª. He was also a deputy of legislative assembly of Perm Oblast from 1997 to 2000. After this he became the representative of the region at Federation Council of Russia. He was appointed acting governor of Perm Oblast in 2004, and was confirmed as governor of Perm Krai in 2005 (after the merger of Perm Oblast and Komi- Permyak Autonomous Okrug). Chirkunov played a role in Vladimir Putin's rise to power, something he came to regret. = Perm = Despite this history, Chirkunov left a mark as a reform-minded governor of Perm. He commissioned Marat Gelman, a prominent political scientist and art curator, to oversee \\"Project Perm\\" and revitalize the city to become a European center of culture. Gelman aspired to create an \\"artistic perestroika.\\" Perm, a city of brutal Soviet architecture and home to just under a million people, became an anomalous and relatively free political space under Chirkunov. While the Kremlin crushed opposition parties and independent media, \\"in Perm artists were encouraged to experiment, journalists could criticize, and visitors might think they were in Western Europe, rather than middle Russia.\\" Project Perm included a Museum of Contemporary Art; the White Nights Festival, a summer event which drew up to a million visitors; and the Perm-36 gulag museum, the only museum of the Soviet gulag experience and its terror, run by its former prisoners. = Resignation = After Putin's re-election in 2012 amid widespread protests, the Russian state cracked down heavily on political dissent as well as the sponsorship of independent artistic expression such as that in Perm. Chirkunov resigned as Perm governor in April 2012, after suffering constant verbal attacks on state television.

Portrayed by Deena Payne, the character first appeared on 10 August 1993, and remained until 13 January 2011, becoming one of the longest serving characters, after nearly 18 years in the show. Viv currently serves as the seventeenth longest running character in the history of the show. In November 2007, it was confirmed that Payne had asked for a break. To explain her absence Viv was sentenced to three years' imprisonment after she pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to defraud. Actually conman Freddie Yorke stole the charity money and left her to take the blame. Viv was off- screen for eleven months, but made two brief appearances in October 2008. In June 2009, Payne resumed the role and returned on-screen in July. On 11 October 2010, it was announced Payne would leave after 18 years on the show. The character was killed off in January 2011, when Viv who was trapped in a fire alongside Terry Woods (Billy Hartman), who was attempting to rescue her, when an explosion engulfed the Post Office, which instantly killed both Viv and Terry respectively. On 13 January 2012, the village held a memorial service in memory to both Viv and Terry as a mark of respect. CreationCasting= Viv was introduced in 1993 as part of the new Windsor family introduced by series producer Nicholas Prosser, who cast Payne in the role. Payne had started out as a dancer She trained with raunchy Hot Gossip's choreographer, Arlene Phillips, performed in stage musicals and was a member of the band Cats U.K., as well as singing with pop stars such as Alan Price and B. A. Robertson. In 1992, Payne had her first child, William. He was still a baby when Payne was offered the role of Viv Windsor a year later. \\"'It was a big decision,\\" recalls Deena, \\"because I had got my life quite well balanced. I didn't really think any further than getting work that would suit me as a mum.\\" This part came along and it meant either travelling on a regular basis up and down from London to Yorkshire or moving up here. Deena took the job and, for the first six months, she found a small cottage, where she brought William up, and hired a nanny. Payne then realized that that wasn't working, so Deena and her husband Steve both moved up to Leeds - Steve suggested that they rent a house in Yorkshire and still keep the house down south. =Personality= Deena had no problems tackling the role of Viv, a wife and mother in a family themselves moving from London to Yorkshire, Viv was the backbone of the Windsor family but later cheated on husband Vic by having an affair with Woolpack manager Terry Woods in 1996. [...] 'I saw exactly who she was,' [...] . ' Viv is An Essex girl with high heels and colourful clothes - but slightly clashing in the way the colors are actually co-ordinated. She opens her mouth first and thinks afterwards - her reactions are quicker than her head but she has a heart. Viv's a very passionate woman and she gets angry when she has no emotional outlet.She loses any patience she might have and doesn't think before she speaks. She sees everything in black and white.If she thinks something's wrong, then it's wrong - end of story. No one can ever persuade her to see their point of view. 'There is a softer side to her, though, as she can be funny and enjoys a bit of banter with Emily, who now helps out in the post office. I don't actually think Viv's comic side has been sufficiently explored. When Vic was still alive, he and Viv had this great repartee ~ a bit like Jack and Vera Duckworth in Coronation Street. It's a shame that we weren't able to make more of it. Development In November 2007 Payne called an urgent meeting with Producer Kathleen Beedles, where Payne revealed that she needed a rest from the hectic filming schedule. Payne told the Daily Star that after 16 years of enjoying the part of Viv, Payne felt she was ready to take a break. In order to spend some time with her family, and be a supportive mother through my son's GCSE year. In August 2008 Payne's sabbatical storyline reached its climax, when Viv was wrongly imprisoned for fraud, by conman Freddie Yorke (Keith Woodason). Viv was sentenced to three years in prison. Viv returned in July 2009, after two recent appearances in October 2008. In June 2009 Payne resumed her role on a regular basis, and her return episode aired on 14 July 2009. Storylines Viv arrives in Beckindale to view the post office with her husband, Vic (Alun Lewis), and their children, Scott (Toby Cockerell; Ben Freeman), Donna (Sophie Jeffery; Verity Rushworth) and Kelly (Adele Silva). She finds it hard to adapt to country life and does not realize how much her children are affected by the plane crash in December 1993. She intended to sue the Sugdens after Donna has an accident on their tractor and later supports Vic when he appears in court for assaulting looters. In June 1994, Reg Dawson (Niven Boyd), Viv's ex- husband and Scott's father, arrives in the village after being released from prison. He later takes Viv and Shirley Turner (Rachel Davies) hostage during a siege at the post office. Reg tries to shoot Viv but kills Shirley instead when she throws herself in front of her in an attempt to protect her. Reg later dies after being shot by a police marksman and Viv is rescued, unharmed. Reg leaves her ¬£30,000 in his will, on condition that she gets a divorce from Vic. Viv, however, declines and stays with Vic. In 1995, Viv is annoyed when Tina Dingle (Jacqueline Pirie) flirts with Vic and she bars Kim Tate (Claire King) from the post office when she and her husband, Frank (Norman Bowler), threaten them with eviction. After being arrested for standing at the barricades when Frank attempts to evict the Dingle family from their home, Viv regrets helping the Dingles and tries to make them leave the village. In 1996, after winning a dance competition with Terry Woods (Billy Hartman), Terry tries to persuade her to have an affair with him. Viv attempts to stay faithful to Vic at first when she is initially tempted. Viv later kisses Terry for comfort but later embarks on an affair with him until Vic cons her into thinking that she has won the lottery. She starts to hate him and eventually moves out to live with Terry in the Woolpack, but soon returns to Vic for her children's sake. In 1997, Viv unsuccessfully tries to stop Kelly running away with Tom Bainbridge, a teacher whom she has an affair with. Viv blames Terry when Donna collapses after drinking alcopops and moves back into the post office.She also starts a campaign against Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher) at school and tries to seduce Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt), but he rejected Viv's advances. In 1998, when Kelly announces her pregnancy, Viv disapproves but tries to be supportive when Kelly suffers a miscarriage. Viv eventually moves back home and is falsely accused of hitting Kelly but she is delighted when Scott returns home from the army. When Vic takes her on a birthday treat, the couple are reconciled, but on Christmas Day, Vic is killed in a robbery at the post office by Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) and Viv ends the year desperately trying to hold her family together. In 1999, Kelly gets engaged to Roy Glover (Nicky Evans), and Viv offers to pay for their wedding. She also agrees to lend Scott, Kelly's ¬£5000 inheritance money from Vic to help build his business without Kelly's knowledge. But after Roy and Kelly's offer on a cottage was accepted they needed Kelly's money for the deposit. Horrified, Viv asks her friend Stella to lend it to her but when Kelly finds out, she punches Viv. In 2000, Viv starts the new year by deciding to sell the shop. Viv throws Kelly and Scott out of her house after they sleep together and she goes on holiday to Spain. Viv briefly becomes attracted to Carlos Diaz (Gary Turner), the new diner chef. A hosiery salesman, Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw), changes Viv's life almost immediately, and after he seduces her with his charm, he moves in with her. Her friend, Carol Wareing, reappears, and announces she will be staying with them. Viv tells Bob she wants more commitment from him. In 2001, Viv and Bob's relationship experiences problems but in February, they get married. Carol and Viv strike a deal that Viv would sell her the Post Office, planning to buy the B&B; but Carol goes behind Viv's back and buys the B&B; for herself. Furious at her friend's betrayal, Viv throws Carol out of the house and she responds by hiding a bag of frozen prawns in a curtain rail. Bob's excuses make Viv suspicious and she entraps him into admitting the existence of another wife, Barbara. Viv forgives him, and decides to try and raise some cash for a honeymoon by entering the Naughty Nylons competition organised by Bob's firm. Viv wins and Bob is fired. The move infuriates Viv so much that she throws Bob out and the couple begin divorce proceedings. To make matters more difficult for Viv, Scott begins a relationship with Bob's daughter Dawn (Julia Mallam). Alone and unhappy, Viv begins flirting with her employee and best friend Emily Kirk's (Kate McGregor) husband Paddy whom she had previously tried to seduce eight years earlier. A misunderstanding leads Paddy to confess to sleeping with Viv, resulting in Emily smashing up the shop, resigning from her job and announcing their deception to all the villagers in The Woolpack. Viv is at her lowest point and things only get worse when Scott is injured, following a violent showdown at Home Farm with Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell), mother of his daughter, Jean (Megan Pearson). The accident brings Kelly back to the village and although there is still some tension between them, Viv seems to enjoy having her around again. Viv's luck later changes for the best when she and Bob finally reconcile after working together in a cooking competition and Viv excitedly begins planning their second wedding. The event intended to be a double wedding with Donna and her fianc√©, Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock). Bob tells Viv that he wants to get back in touch with all his children. Viv sets about contacting them and discovers that he has children with every single one of his wives, except her. On their wedding day, Viv is horrified when Bob fails to arrive. It transpires that Bob has actually spent the night in a hotel after a vasectomy reversal and is taken prisoner by his ex-wife and Dawn's mother Jean Hope (Julie Higginson) who begs him to leave Viv and get back together with her. When Bob finally arrives they have a row, but walk down the aisle and tie the knot for a second time. Although they spend months trying for a baby, Viv does not seem able to get pregnant. After a test, Viv is sure she is pregnant but it later transpires to be a false alarm. The Hopes are told Viv may be too old to have another child. Thrown into despair, Viv asks Donna to be a surrogate mother, in exchange for a deposit on a dream house for herself and Marlon. After Dawn's death in the showhouse explosion, Bob is devastated and the day of Dawn's funeral, Viv discovers she is pregnant and expecting twins. Bob initially tells her that he does not want any more children but he is with her when she gives birth to Cathy (Gabrielle Dowling) and Heath (Sebastian Dowling) on 9 February 2007. Viv starts parenting classes in the caf√©, telling parents how to raise their children and what routines they should follow. This leads to a few angry residents including Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox), saying that Viv is being a busybody. Viv begins raising money for children's charities, a drive which gains a higher profile when Ashley (John Middleton) and Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) lose their son Daniel to cot death. But the man she entrusts with the charity money, Freddie Yorke (Keith Woodason), takes it and vanishes. Viv and Bob go to the police but Viv implicates herself when she admits moving funds around. Viv and Bob try to keep the investigation a secret, but she is arrested at a party thrown for her at The Woolpack in honour of her charity efforts. Viv and Bob are charged with conspiracy to defraud and whenever Viv tries to clear her name, she makes matters worse. With the help of a private investigator, Viv finds Freddie, but he threatens her children's lives and physically attacks her, putting stolen money in her bag as a goodbye present before getting away. On 20 August 2008, after Donna nearly dies in a car accident whilst pursuing Freddie, Viv pleads guilty in court and is later sentenced to three years imprisonment. Her voice is later heard on a recording she makes of a bedtime story for Bob, Heath and Cathy. Viv appears briefly on 10 October, when Bob pretends to be a postman so he can see her. He does this when she is doing prison work, and Bob tells Viv he loves her. She is seen again on 16 October, when Bob pretends to be a drama teacher under the name of Terry Woods, in order to see Viv. He and Viv perform a piece of drama together where Bob explains to Viv about a man whose wife refuses to see him while she is in prison. This makes Viv cry as she tells Bob that the reason she does not want to see him was so he would remember her how she wanted him to and that her children could see her in her current predicament. Viv starts crying and reveals to everyone who \\"Terry\\" really is. In July 2009, Viv sends Bob a letter asking him to visit. As Viv had refused to see Bob while she was in prison, he assumes she wanted to end their marriage, and chooses not to see her. Instead, he has comfort sex with Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams). The next day, Viv, after being granted early release for good behaviour, returns to the village. She needs money to pay for her taxi and returns to the caf√©/post office, only for Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) to mistake her for a thief and restrain her until Paddy clears up the confusion by identifying Viv. Viv is upset at the changes during the past year, particularly when the twins do not recognize her. Viv soon reveals that she had not been in touch with Bob and the children because she had been appealing against the length of her sentence. Bob is furious, but when his anger reduces Viv to tears, he apologizes. The next day, Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) informs Viv that Brenda now owns half of the business. She goes to Essex for a week to visit Donna to see how she is getting on after leaving her husband, Marlon, and the village for a new job during Viv's absence. Seeing that Donna is happy and has a new boyfriend, Viv returns to the village where she clashes repeatedly with Brenda. They eventually call a truce after Viv hears Brenda talking about her money worries and Viv tells Terry, who was currently Brenda's boyfriend. Brenda and Viv then make an effort to get on so that the shop and the caf√© run smoothly. Viv's life seems to be back on track, but things decline again when it is revealed that Bob had had sex with Brenda's adoptive daughter, Gennie, his son Jamie's girlfriend whilst she was in prison. Viv splits up with Bob after coming to the realisation that they are both no longer compatible. She then displays envy regarding Bob's friendship with Lizzie Lakely (Kitty McGeever). In August 2010, Viv begins bonding with fellow Londoner Hazel Rhodes (Pauline Quirke), but again becomes jealous when Hazel befriends Bob. Viv finds it very hard to accept the split, and she later hopes that it will not be permanent. She tries to reconcile with Bob by getting his attention by using their children as an excuse and faking break-ins at the shop, after Bob helps her after a real burglary. She also attempts to make Bob jealous by pretending that she has moved on and makes up stories about men she has met whilst out. After being encouraged by her former lover Terry after he finds out that she had faked the burglaries, Viv resumes her love of salsa dance classes and genuinely seems to be trying to move on and adjust to being single again, having fun and seeking a new boyfriend. Terry supports Viv through this and accompanies her to the dance competitions as he used to when they had their affair, and encourages her to look to the future and be happy. Viv misinterprets his friendliness, and makes a move on him believing he wants to restart their relationship and kisses him and he hesitates before leaving the cafe in shock. Terry later visits Viv and lets her down gently and tells her that he was just trying to cheer her up and that he regards her as a special friend and that they cannot get back together as he is with Brenda. After Terry leaves, Viv drowns her sorrows by drinking a bottle of wine. She falls asleep on the sofa and is oblivious when the post office and flat catches fire after corrupt police officer Nick Henshall (Michael McKell) starts a fire at Victoria Cottage and it spreads to surrounding buildings. Bob and Terry break into the shop to try and rescue Viv and the twins. Bob rescues Cathy and Heath and makes it out alive and Terry attempts to rescue Viv. The Post Office explodes and Terry and Viv are killed. Despite being one of Emmerdale's longest serving characters, Viv's funeral, agreed by Bob, Donna, Scott and Kelly, was held in her hometown in Essex, off- screen. In 2014, it's revealed that Viv knew that Donna had a daughter named April Windsor (Amelia Flanagan) after her split with Marlon, April's biological father, which stuns Bob. In November 2017, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) mentions Viv to Laurel on fireworks night saying Heath doesn't like fire after Viv's death.

She has been called the \\"Audubon of Botany.\\" Life Mary Vaux Walcott, 1914 Painting of Balsamorhiza sagittata (arrowleaf balsamroot) by Walcott Mary Morris Vaux was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a wealthy Quaker family. After graduating from the Friends Select School in Philadelphia in 1879, she took an interest in watercolor painting. When she was not working on the family farm, she began painting illustrations of wildflowers that she saw on family trips to the Rocky Mountains of Canada. During the family summer trips, she and her brothers studied mineralogy and recorded the flow of glaciers in drawings and photographs. The trips to the Canadian Rockies sparked her interest in geology. In 1880, at the age of nineteen, Vaux took on the responsibility of caring for her father and two younger brothers when her mother died. After 1887, she and her brothers went back to western Canada almost every summer. During this time she became an active mountain climber, outdoors woman, and photographer. Asked one summer to paint a rare blooming arnica by a botanist, she was encouraged to concentrate on botanical illustration. She spent many years exploring the rugged terrain of the Canadian Rockies to find important flowering species to paint. On these trips, Vaux became the first women to accomplish the over 10,000 feet ascent of Mount Stephen. In 1887, on her first transcontinental trip via rail, she wrote an engaging travel journal of the family's four-month trek through the American West and the Canadian Rockies. Over her father's fierce objections, Mary Vaux married the paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott, who was the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in 1914, when she was 54. She played an active part in her husband's projects, returning to the Rockies with him several times and continuing to paint wildflowers. In 1925, the Smithsonian published some 400 of her illustrations, accompanied by brief descriptions, in a five- volume work entitled North American Wild Flowers. In Washington, Mary became a close friend of First Lady Lou Henry Hoover and raised money to erect the Florida Avenue Meeting House, so that the first Quaker President and his wife would have a proper place to worship. From 1927 to 1932, Mary Vaux Walcott served on the federal Board of Indian Commissioners and, driven by her chauffeur, traveled extensively throughout the American West, diligently visiting reservations. When she was 75, she made her first trip abroad to Japan to visit lifelong friend and fellow Philadelphia Quaker, Mary Elkington Nitobe, who had married Japanese diplomat Inazo Nitobe. She was elected president of the Society of Woman Geographers in 1933. In 1935, the Smithsonian published Illustrations of North American Pitcher-Plants, which included 15 paintings by Walcott. Following the death of her husband in 1927, Walcott established the Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal in his honor. It is awarded for scientific work on pre-Cambrian and Cambrian life and history. Walcott died in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. In her own words On field photography: \\"A camera is a very delightful adjunct, for it is pleasant to have some tangible results to show, on your return home. A Kodak, if no larger instrument can be managed, yields most satisfactory results, although the better records from a larger-sized camera are an increased delight, when one has the patience and skill to obtain them. For changing plates in camp, an improvised tepee can be made of the blankets, and, if this is done after sundown, is quite satisfactory.\\" -Mary M. Vaux, writing in \\"Camping in the Canadian Rockies\\" in the Canadian Alpine Journal On measuring glaciers: \\"\\"The glaciers must be measured, and I shall hope to use the camera seriously, and get all I can. Last summer's work was such a disappointment in photographic results.\\" -Mary Vaux Walcott, Letters to Charles Walcott, April 1, 1912.

He was well known for his role on Sesamstraat, the Dutch co-production of Sesame Street. On this show, his character's name was Meneer Aart (Mr. Aart) and in this persona he authored a book called (Mr. Aart: Life and work of the man who does not want to be named a friend to children). Staartjes used to present the annual arrival of Sinterklaas in the Netherlands.  Early life  Aart Staartjes was born in Nieuwendam, a neighbourhood of Amsterdam-Noord. He had an older brother, and a younger sister. They lived in a house on the Nieuwendammerdijk. His father, his grandfather, and an uncle of his worked in a carpentry shop located behind the house. Staartjes started his primary education at the age of eight. After that, he went to the mulo in Amsterdam, followed by the Kweekschool, a teachers' college. He dropped out of the Kweekschool in 1958, and went to the theatre school instead. He graduated in 1961.  Career  After graduation from the Toneelschool, Staartjes performed with various companies including the Nieuw Rotterdams Toneel en Studio. Staartjes made his debut in 1961 in Meneer Topaze, based on a play written by Marcel Pagnol in the 1930s. He performed in a number of TV shows, and in 1967 starts the show Woord voor Woord for the Interkerkelijke Omroep Nederland, in which he does bible readings. He is the voice of Rocus, de vrije vogel (the free bird), for the children's show Fabeltjeskrant. A key moment in Staartjes' career came in 1972, when broadcaster VARA asked him to develop a children's show. De Stratemakeropzeeshow, created with actors-singers Wieteke van Dort and Joost Prinsen, and the writers' collective of Willem Wilmink, Karel Eykman, and Hans Dorrestijn), is a program firmly grounded on a children's perspective, sometimes controversially so, and runs until 1974. The show didn't eschew using colloquial language; \\"Poop and Pee Minuet\\", for instance, was criticized in the tabloid De Telegraaf. This show and its successor were hailed as groundbreaking in offering the point of view of children and in popularizing poetry for children to a wide audience, in a country which was until then quite conservative but had recently seen a wave of children's books that tackled real-life issues, including divorce, sexual violence, drug use. After the show ended in 1974, he performed in and co-directed De film van ome Willem, starring Edwin Rutten, a show that ran until 1989. With van Dort and Prinsen, with whom he made the Stratemakeropzeeshow, he creates J.J. de Bom voorheen De Kindervriend, in 1979. He plays the role of Hein Gatje, a postman who delivers letters in which children write of their problems and predicaments, which are then tackled in the show. The three teamed up again with writers Wilmink, Eykman, and Dorrestijn and while the show was very popular, the VARA pulled it after 32 episodes. In 1984, Aart Staartjes started to play the role of Mr. Aart in Sesamstraat, the Dutch co-production of Sesame Street. Mr. Aart is a rather grumpy elderly man who always has something to complain about, especially about the animal characters Pino, Tommie and Ieniemienie. This character was added because critics felt Sesamstraat was too saccharine. After the death in 1999 of actor-singer Lex Goudsmit, who played the resident \\"grandfather\\" character on the show, Mr. Aart took that over. He played Mr. Aart until 2018, when the NOS decided to stop making the show and show only re-runs. Staartjes also starred in Het Klokhuis, a show started in 1988 and made for children who had outgrown Sesamstraat; his character was Professor Doctor Fetze Alsvanouds, a distracted professor from the University of Harderwijk (a real university, which was closed in 1811). Staartjes developed the show with Ben Klokman. He also welcomed Sinterklaas at his annual arrival in the Netherlands, for almost 20 years until 2001. By this time he had cut down on acting, though he still performed occasionally ‚Äîin 2002 in the TV drama Mevrouw de minister, and in 2006 as circus director Willy Waltz in the series Waltz.  Personal life and death  Staartjes was 22 years old when his first child was born. He divorced his first wife sixteen years later. He later married a woman named Hanna. On 10 January 2020, Staartjes was involved in a collision between a car and his quadricycle in Leeuwarden. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition and died two days later. He was 81 years old.

The system demonstrated scaling laws that suggested it would not be useful in the commercial power role, and since the 1980s it has been used primarily as a fusion teaching system, and as a source of neutrons and X-rays. The original concept was developed in 1954 by N.V. Filippov, who noticed the effect while working on early pinch machines in the USSR.Petrov DP, NV Filippov, TI Filippova, VA Khrabrov \\"Powerful pulsed gas discharge in the cells with conducting walls.\\" In the Sun. Plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear reactions. Ed. Academy of Sciences of the USSR, 1958, —Ç. 4, —Å. 170-181. A major research program on DPF was carried out in the USSR through the late 1950s, and continues to this day. A different version of the same basic concept was independently discovered in the US by J.W. Mather in the early 1960s. This version saw some development in the 1970s, and variations continue to be developed. The basic design derives from the z-pinch concept. Both the DPF and pinch use large electrical currents run through a gas to cause it to ionize into a plasma and then pinch down on itself to increase the density and temperature of the plasma. The DPF differs largely in form; most devices use two concentric cylinders and form the pinch at the end of the central cylinder. In contrast, z-pinch systems generally use a single cylinder, sometimes a torus, and pinch the plasma into the center. The plasma focus is similar to the high-intensity plasma gun device (HIPGD) (or just plasma gun), which ejects plasma in the form of a plasmoid, without pinching it. A comprehensive review of the dense plasma focus and its diverse applications has been made by Krishnan in 2012. Pinch concept Pinch-based devices are the earliest systems to be seriously developed for fusion research, starting with very small machines built in London in 1948. These normally took one of two forms; linear pinch machines are straight tubes with electrodes at both ends to apply the current into the plasma, whereas toroidal pinch machines are donut-shaped machines with large magnets wrapped around them that supply the current via magnetic induction. In both types of machines, a large burst of current is applied to a dilute gas inside the tube. This current initially ionizes the gas into a plasma. Once the ionization is complete, which occurs in microseconds, the plasma begins to conduct a current. Due to the Lorentz force, this current creates a magnetic field that causes the plasma to \\"pinch\\" itself down into a filament, similar to a lightning bolt. This process increases the density of the plasma very rapidly, causing its temperature to increase. Early devices quickly demonstrated a problem with the stability of this process. As the current began to flow in the plasma, magnetic effects known as the \\"sausage\\" and \\"kink\\" appeared that caused the plasma to become unstable and eventually hit the sides of the container. When this occurred, the hot plasma would cause atoms of the metal or glass to spall off and enter the fuel, rapidly cooling the plasma. Unless the plasma could be made stable, this loss process would make fusion impossible. In the mid-1950s, two possible solutions appeared. In the fast-pinch concept, a linear device would undergo the pinch so quickly that the plasma as a whole would not move, instead only the outermost layer would begin to pinch, creating a shock wave that would continue the process after the current was removed. In the stabilized pinch, new magnetic fields would be added that would mix with the current's field and create a more stable configuration. In testing, neither of these systems worked, and the pinch route to fusion was largely abandoned by the early 1960s. DPF concept During experiments on a linear pinch machine, Filippov noticed that certain arrangements of the electrodes and tube would cause the plasma to form into new shapes. This led to the DPF concept. In a typical DPF machine, there are two cylindrical electrodes. The inner one, often solid, is physically separated from the outer by an insulating disk at one end of the device. It is left open at the other end. The end result is something like a coffee mug with a half hot dog standing on its end in the middle of the mug. When current is applied, it begins to arc at the path of least resistance, at the end near the insulator disk. This causes the gas in the area to rapidly ionize, and current begins to flow through it to the outer electrode. The current creates a magnetic field that begins to push the plasma down the tube towards the open end. It reaches the end in microseconds. When it reaches the end, it continues moving for a short time, but the endpoints of the current sheet remain attached to the end of the cylinders. This causes the plasma sheet to bow out into a shape not unlike an umbrella or the cap of a mushroom. At this point further movement stops, and the continuing current instead begins to pinch the section near the central electrode. Eventually this causes the former ring-shaped area to compress down into a vertical post extending off the end of the inner electrode. In this area the density is greatly increased. The whole process proceeds at many times the speed of sound in the ambient gas. As the current sheath continues to move axially, the portion in contact with the anode slides across the face of the anode, axisymmetrically. When the imploding front of the shock wave coalesces onto the axis, a reflected shock front emanates from the axis until it meets the driving current sheath which then forms the axisymmetric boundary of the pinched, or focused, hot plasma column. The dense plasma column (akin to the Z-pinch) rapidly pinches and undergoes instabilities and breaks up. The intense electromagnetic radiation and particle bursts, collectively referred to as multi-radiation occur during the dense plasma and breakup phases. These critical phases last typically tens of nanoseconds for a small (kJ, 100 kA) focus machine to around a microsecond for a large (MJ, several MA) focus machine. The process, including axial and radial phases, may last, for the Mather DPF machine, a few microseconds (for a small focus) to 10 microseconds for a larger focus machine. A Filippov focus machine has a very short axial phase compared to a Mather focus. Applications When operated using deuterium, intense bursts of X-rays and charged particles are emitted, as are nuclear fusion byproducts including neutrons. There is ongoing research that demonstrates potential applications as a soft X-ray source for next-generation microelectronics lithography, surface micromachining, pulsed X-ray and neutron source for medical and security inspection applications and materials modification, among others. For nuclear weapons applications, dense plasma focus devices can be used as an external neutron source.U.S. Department of Defense, Militarily Critical Technologies List, Part II: Weapons of Mass Destruction Technologies (February 1998) Section 5\\\\. Nuclear Weapons Technology (PDF), Table 5.6-2, p. II-5-66. Retrieved on 8 January 2009. Other applications include simulation of nuclear explosions (for testing of the electronic equipment) and a short and intense neutron source useful for non- contact discovery or inspection of nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium). Characteristics An important characteristic of the dense plasma focus is that the energy density of the focused plasma is practically a constant over the whole range of machines, from sub-kilojoule machines to megajoule machines, when these machines are tuned for optimal operation. This means that a small table-top-sized plasma focus machine produces essentially the same plasma characteristics (temperature and density) as the largest plasma focus. Of course the larger machine will produce the larger volume of focused plasma with a corresponding longer lifetime and more radiation yield. Even the smallest plasma focus has essentially the same dynamic characteristics as larger machines, producing the same plasma characteristics and the same radiation products. This is due to the scalability of plasma phenomena. See also plasmoid, the self-contained magnetic plasma ball that may be produced by a dense plasma focus. Design parameters The fact that the plasma energy density is constant throughout the range of plasma focus devices, from big to small, is related to the value of a design parameter that needs to be kept at a certain value if the plasma focus is to operate efficiently. The critical 'speed' design parameter for neutron-producing devices is \\\\frac{I}{a\\\\sqrt{p}}, where I is the current, a is the anode radius, and p is the gas density or pressure. For example, for neutron-optimised operation in deuterium the value of this critical parameter, experimentally observed over a range of machines from kilojoules to hundreds of kilojoules, is: 9 kA/(mm¬∑Torr0.5), or 780 kA/(m¬∑Pa0.5), with a remarkably small deviation of 10% over such a large range of sizes of machines. Thus if we have a peak current of 180 kA we require an anode radius of 10 mm with a deuterium fill pressure of . The length of the anode has then to be matched to the risetime of the capacitor current in order to allow an average axial transit speed of the current sheath of just over 50 mm/Œºs. Thus a capacitor risetime of 3 Œºs requires a matched anode length of 160 mm. The above example of peak current of 180 kA rising in 3 Œºs, anode radius and length of respectively 10 and 160 mm are close to the design parameters of the UNU/ICTP PFF (United Nations University/International Centre for Theoretical Physics Plasma Fusion Facility).Lee, S and Zakaullah, M et al. and Srivastava, M P and Gholap, A V et al. and Eissa, M A and Moo, S P et al. (1988) Twelve Years of UNU/ICTP PFF- A Review . IC, 98 (231). Abdus Salam ICTP, Miramare, Trieste. Retrieved on 8 January 2009. This small table-top device was designed as a low-cost integrated experimental system for training and transfer to initiate/strengthen experimental plasma research in developing countries. It can be noted that the square of the drive parameter is a measure of the \\"plasma energy density\\". On the other hand, another proposed, so called \\"energy density parameter\\" {28E \\\\over a^3}, where E is the energy stored in the capacitor bank and a is the anode radius, for neutron-optimised operation in deuterium the value of this critical parameter, experimentally observed over a range of machines from tens of joules to hundreds of kilojoules, is in the order of {5 \\\\cdot 10^{10}} J/m3. For example, for a capacitor bank of 3kJ, the anode radius is in the order of 12mm. This parameter has a range of 3.6x10^9 to 7.6x10^11 for the machines surveyed by Soto. The wide range of this parameter is because it is a \\"storage energy density\\" which translates into plasma energy density with different efficiency depending on the widely differing performance of different machines. Thus to result in the necessary plasma energy density (which is found to be a near constant for optimized neutron production) requires widely differing initial storage density. Current research A network of ten identical DPF machines operates in eight countries around the world. This network produces research papers on topics including machine optimization & diagnostics (soft x-rays, neutrons, electron and ion beams), applications (microlithography, micromachining, materials modification and fabrication, imaging & medical, astrophysical simulation) as well as modeling & computation. The network was organized by Sing Lee in 1986 and is coordinated by the Asian African Association for Plasma Training, AAAPT. A simulation package, the Lee Model, has been developed for this network but is applicable to all plasma focus devices. The code typically produces excellent agreement between computed and measured results, and is available for downloading as a Universal Plasma Focus Laboratory Facility. The Institute for Plasma Focus Studies IPFS was founded on 25 February 2008 to promote correct and innovative use of the Lee Model code and to encourage the application of plasma focus numerical experiments. IPFS research has already extended numerically-derived neutron scaling laws to multi-megajoule experiments. (PDF) These await verification. Numerical experiments with the code have also resulted in the compilation of a global scaling law indicating that the well-known neutron saturation effect is better correlated to a scaling deterioration mechanism. This is due to the increasing dominance of the axial phase dynamic resistance as capacitor bank impedance decreases with increasing bank energy (capacitance). In principle, the resistive saturation could be overcome by operating the pulse power system at a higher voltage. The International Centre for Dense Magnetised Plasmas (ICDMP) in Warsaw Poland, operates several plasma focus machines for an international research and training programme. Among these machines is one with energy capacity of 1 MJ making it one of the largest plasma focus devices in the world. In Argentina there is an Inter-institutional Program for Plasma Focus Research since 1996, coordinated by a National Laboratory of Dense Magnetized Plasmas (www.pladema.net) in Tandil, Buenos Aires. The Program also cooperates with the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, and networks the Argentine National Energy Commission, the Scientific Council of Buenos Aires, the University of Center, the University of Mar del Plata, The University of Rosario, and the Institute of Plasma Physics of the University of Buenos Aires. The program operates six Plasma Focus Devices, developing applications, in particular ultra-short tomography and substance detection by neutron pulsed interrogation. PLADEMA also contributed during the last decade with several mathematical models of Plasma Focus. The thermodynamic model was able to develop for the first time design maps combining geometrical and operational parameters, showing that there is always an optimum gun length and charging pressure which maximize the neutron emission. Currently there is a complete finite-elements code validated against numerous experiments, which can be used confidently as a design tool for Plasma Focus. In Chile, at the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission the plasma focus experiments have been extended to sub-kilojoules devices and the scales rules have been stretched up to region less than one joule . Their studies have contributes to know that is possible to scale the plasma focus in a wide range of energies and sizes keeping the same value of ion density, magnetic field, plasma sheath velocity, Alfv√©n speed and the quantity of energy per particle. Therefore, fusion reactions are even possible to be obtained in ultraminiature devices (driven by generators of 0.1J for example), as they are in the bigger devices (driven by generators of 1MJ). However, the stability of the plasma pinch highly depends on the size and energy of the device. A rich plasma phenomenology it has been observed in the table-top plasma focus devices developed at the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission: filamentary structures, toroidal singularities, plasma bursts and plasma jets generations. In addition, possible applications are explored using these kind of small plasma devices: development of portable generator as non- radioactive sources of neutrons and x-rays for field applications, pulsed radiation applied to biological studies, plasma focus as neutron source for nuclear fusion-fission hybrid reactors, and the use of plasma focus devices as plasma accelerators for studies of materials under intense fusion-relevant pulses. In addition, Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission currently operates the facility SPEED-2, the largest Plasma Focus facility of the southern hemisphere. Since the beginning of 2009, a number of new plasma focus machines have been/are being commissioned including the INTI Plasma Focus in Malaysia, the NX3 in Singapore, the first plasma focus to be commissioned in a US university in recent times, the KSU Plasma Focus at Kansas State University which recorded its first fusion neutron emitting pinch on New Year's Eve 2009 and the IR-MPF-100 plasma focus (115kJ) in Iran. =Fusion power= Several groups proposed that fusion power based on the DPF could be economically viable, possibly even with low-neutron fuel cycles like p-B11. The feasibility of net power from p-B11 in the DPF requires that the bremsstrahlung losses be reduced by quantum mechanical effects induced by an extremely strong magnetic field \\"frozen into the plasma\\". The high magnetic field also results in a high rate of emission of cyclotron radiation, but at the densities envisioned, where the plasma frequency is larger than the cyclotron frequency, most of this power will be reabsorbed before being lost from the plasma. Another advantage claimed is the capability of direct conversion of the energy of the fusion products into electricity, with an efficiency potentially above 70%.  Lawrenceville Plasma Physics  Experiments and computer simulations to investigate the capability of DPF for fusion power are underway at Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) under the direction of Eric Lerner, who explained his \\"Focus Fusion\\" approach in a 2007 Google Tech Talk. On November 14, 2008, Lerner received funding for continued research, to test the scientific feasibility of Focus Fusion. On October 15, 2009, the DPF device \\"Focus Fusion-1\\" achieved its first pinch. On January 28, 2011, LPP published initial results including experimental shots with considerably higher fusion yields than the historical DPF trend. In March, 2012, the company announced that it had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees, beating the old record of 1.1 billion that had survived since 1978. In 2016 the company announced that it had achieved a fusion yield of 0.25 joules. In 2017 the company reduced impurities by mass by 3x and ion numbers by 10x. Fusion yield increased by 50%. Fusion yield doubled compared to other plasma focus devices with the same 60 kJ energy input. In addition, Mean ion energy increased to a record of 240 ¬± 20 keV for any confined fusion plasma. A deuterium-nitrogen mix and corona-discharge pre-ionization reduced the fusion yield standard deviation by 4x to about 15%. In 2019, the team conducted a series of experiments replacing tungsten electrodes with beryllium electrodes (termed Focus Fusion 2B). After 44 shots, the electrode formed a much thinner 10 nm oxide layer with correspondingly fewer impurities and less electrode erosion than with tungsten electrodes. Fusion yield reached 0.1 joule. Yield generally increased and impurities decreased with an increasing number of shots.

The word \\"toile\\" can refer to the fabric itself, a test garment (generally) sewn from the same material, or a type of repeated surface decoration (traditionally) printed on the same fabric. The term entered the English language around the 12th century.Oxford English Dictionary: \\"toile\\"; earliest citation from 1561. Also spelled toyl / toyle. Etymology Middle English toile, from French toile (\\"cloth\\"), from Old French teile, from Latin tela (\\"web\\"), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)teg (\\"to cover\\") (see List of Proto-Indo-European roots in Wiktionary). UsesTest garment= In Australian and British terminology, a \\"toile\\" is a version of a garment made by a fashion designer or dressmaker to test a pattern. They are usually made in cheap material, as multiple toiles may be made in the process of perfecting a design. Toiles are sometimes referred to as \\"muslins\\" in the United States, named for the cheap, unbleached cotton fabric available in different weights. =Toile de Jouy= \\"Toile de Jouy\\", sometimes abbreviated to simply \\"toile\\", is a type of decorating pattern consisting of a white or off-white background on which is a repeated pattern depicting a fairly complex scene, generally of a pastoral theme such as a couple having a picnic by a lake or an arrangement of flowers. The pattern portion consists of a single color, most often black, dark red, or blue. Greens, browns, and magenta toile patterns are less common, but not unheard of. Toile is most associated with fabrics (curtains and upholstery in particular, especially chintz), though toile wallpaper is also popular. Toile can also be used on teapots, beddings, clothing, etc. In upper-class (primarily American, but also northern European) society, toile is often seen on dresses or aprons used at such events as country-themed garden parties or tea parties. Toiles were originally produced in Ireland in the mid-18th Century and quickly became popular in Britain and France. The term \\"Toile de Jouy\\" originated in France in the late 18th century. In the French language, the phrase literally means \\"cloth from Jouy-en-Josas\\", a town in the south- west suburbs of Paris. Although it has been continuously produced since then, it experienced a marked upsurge in popularity around the year 2000. Previously only a decorating design, designers have been recently experimenting with toile-patterned apparel as well, although toile-patterned shirts were widely worn in the 1970s. Toiles were very popular during the Colonial Era in the United States and are highly associated with preservationist towns and historical areas such as Colonial Williamsburg. When Williamsburg saw a resurgence in popularity in the 1930s, so did toiles, as they did again in the 1970s in celebration of the United States Bicentennial. Many fabric and wallpaper companies, such as Timorous Beasties, have continued the trend. ReferencesFurther reading * Stanley D. Chapman and Serge Chassagne (1981).

The character first appeared on 10 August 1993. Silva portrayed her from August 1993 until November 2000. In February 2005, it was announced that Silva would be reprising her role and she returned in June 2005. Silva left the soap once again in October 2007, and in November 2010, it was announced that Silva would be returning to Emmerdale in February 2011. Silva reprised the role for a period of three months and left again in May 2011. StorylinesBackstory= Kelly is the daughter of Vic (Alun Lewis) and Anne Windsor. Kelly, for a long time, didn't know that Anne had died after catching Vic in bed with Viv Hope (Deena Payne) . Horrified, she ran outside and was hit by a car as she was too upset to look where she was going. As Kelly did not know this, she loved Viv like a mother. Kelly gained a stepbrother, Scott Windsor (Toby Cockerell), Viv's son from her first marriage, and a half-sister, Donna (Sophie Jeffery), from Vic and Viv's marriage. =1993‚Äì2000= Kelly arrives in the village in August 1993 with her father Vic, stepmother Viv, stepbrother Scott and half-sister, Donna. Kelly‚Äôs first boyfriend is local teenager, Roy Glover (Nicky Evans). They date briefly but being teenagers, soon split up. Kelly's next relationship is with her teacher, Tom Bainbridge (Jeremy Turner-Welch). When their affair is exposed, Kelly denies it but no one believes them and Tom loses his job. The couple decide to run away together but Kelly returns a few months later, telling Viv that she left Tom after finding him in bed with another pupil. Having been betrayed, she stops trusting men and behaves promiscuously. She toys with Roy‚Äôs affections, has a one-night stand with Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) and a brief fling with Will Cairns (Paul Fox). Discovering she is pregnant by Biff, Kelly tells Chris Tate (Peter Amory) that he is the father, hoping he would pay for an abortion. Due to the side-effects of his disability, he is scared about the possibility of not being able to have children and asks Kelly to keep the baby. Kelly secretly plans an abortion but miscarries after a fight with Kim Tate (Claire King) leads her to fall down a flight of stairs. She threatens to press charges but eventually accepts ¬£1,000 from Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic) as compensation. In 1998, Kelly realises that she has romantic feelings for her stepbrother, Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman). After sleeping together, Kelly returns to Roy and they get engaged. Whilst planning their wedding, Kelly continues to see Scott but refuses to leave Roy so Scott exposes their affair but Kelly denies it. After they get married, Kelly and Roy have financial problems and become cleaners. When Kelly \\"borrows\\" jewellery from a client, Miss Curtis, and stages a dinner party at her house, the police are called. Wanting to protect Kelly, Roy accepts responsibility and is imprisoned. Whilst he is away, Kelly sleeps with Scott again after meeting him at a hotel and they admit their love for each other, sending Kelly into a deep depression. After writing letters to her family and admitting to the affair on tape, Kelly attempts suicide. She is saved but loses the baby she was carrying, unsure if the father was Scott or Roy. Scott burns the letters but Kelly confesses to Roy and decides to start a new life in London, bankrolled by Chris Tate. Although she and Roy have a brief reconciliation, they are unable to make their marriage work and he leaves for Ibiza without her. Feeling rejected again, Kelly tries seducing Viv's new fianc√©, Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw), but he tells Viv and this leads to a vicious fight between Viv and Kelly, also revealing Scott and Kelly's affair. With no friends or family willing to talk to her, Kelly leaves for London, with only her younger sister, Donna (now played by Verity Rushworth), sad to see her go. =2005‚Äì2007= Kelly returns in 2005 and it is clear that she has not changed. Throwing herself back into village life, she makes enemies of Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) and Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam)- both ex-girlfriends of Scott. She causes trouble for Dawn when she flirts with Scott, gets him drunk and drags him into her bed, secretly phoning Dawn and she hears them talking. Donna catches them in bed together the next day and Kelly implies that they have slept together but admits they didn't when Donna threatens to tell Viv. When Dawn finds out that Kelly lied, she tracks her down and they fight outside the Woolpack, ending with Kelly being soaked by a hosepipe. Bored of working in the cafe, Kelly targets the rich men in the village and seduces curate, Ethan Blake, but they are caught by Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) in the church. She then seduces Jimmy King (Nick Miles) and they have a brief fling but he ends their relationship when his ex-wife Sadie (Patsy Kensit), reveals Kelly's career as a glamour model. Kelly moves on to Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) despite a thirty-one year age gap. Kelly develops feelings for Rodney and is delighted when he buys Holdgate Farm for her and his son, Paul Lambert (Mathew Bose), planning to turn it into a spa but Rodney runs out of money and the spa is abandoned. Despite promising to stand by Rodney, she turns her attentions back to Scott. When caught by Rodney and Scott's current girlfriend, Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), they split up. Kelly spends months feeling sorry for herself and takes her frustration out on her family. Claiming to be seeking revenge for Dawn's death, Kelly targets her former lover, Jimmy, despite never liking Dawn when she was alive. Kelly soon falls in love with Jimmy, admitting that she genuinely wants to be with him and does not blame him for Dawn's death, unlike Dawn's parents, Bob and Jean. Soon after, Kelly is offered a lucrative modelling contract but also discovers that she is pregnant, eventually deciding to have an abortion. Jimmy's half-sister, Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey-Beth Crossley), goes with her to the clinic and seeing her reluctance to go in, suggests she keep the baby but Kelly goes ahead as her agent insisted she choose: her baby or her career. Her abortion is not a secret for long as, discovering an abortion leaflet, Scarlett's mother, Carrie, demands answers from Scarlett. She tells Carrie about Kelly's abortion and Carrie threatens to tell Jimmy but agrees not to, on condition that she stays away from Scarlett. Kelly argues with Carrie again when she realises Carrie has feelings for Jimmy. Worried about what Carrie might do, she confronts her and they argue. Kelly loses her temper and slaps Carrie and Carrie calls the police and presses charges against Kelly for assault. The police question Kelly but she denies it and Jimmy claims Kelly acted in self- defence. She later apologizes but Carrie demands that Kelly stay away from her and Scarlett, warning her that she will tell Jimmy about her abortion if she ever crossed her again. Kelly, however, warns Carrie that if she tells Jimmy, she will tell Scarlett that Carrie is Lexi Nicholls's (Sally Oliver) mother, not her sister. At this point, only Carrie, Kelly, Lexi and Jimmy know that Carrie is Lexi's birth mother. Debbie Dingle blackmails Kelly after she kisses Debbie's relative Eli Dingle (Joe Gilgun) as she has photographs of them. In light of her deception, Kelly does not know if she can go through with marrying Jimmy and is jealous about the amount of time he is spending with Carrie, much to Carrie's delight. Initially the wedding goes well, however Debbie reveals the truth to Scarlett about Kelly kissing Eli. Jimmy forgives Kelly for her drunken kiss with Eli but jilts her at the altar when Eli tells him about the abortion. Viv disowns Kelly again and Jimmy is too angry to speak to her. Kelly steals some money. Despite Donna and Paul's efforts to reunite them, Jimmy claims that Kelly has broken his heart and he can never be with her again. Heartbroken, Kelly steals Debbie's car, a gift given to her by Eli, and leaves Emmerdale again. =2011= On 18 February 2011, Jimmy meets Kelly in Peterborough after she contacts him and asks him for money. She also suggests they reconcile but Jimmy's anger and resentment at Kelly's abortion boil over into an argument. As Jimmy is about to leave Kelly jumps into the cab of his van and refuses to leave. Jimmy tries to eject her and fearing Jimmy was going to attack her, Kelly lashes out, grabbing a torch from the dashboard and hitting him over the head, knocking him unconscious. Thinking that she has killed him, Kelly panics and flees the scene. Kelly arrives in the village on 16 March to apologize to Jimmy for attacking him. When she realises that he has amnesia and does not remember who she is or what happened to him, Kelly takes advantage of Jimmy's memory loss by telling him that she was once the love of his life. Jimmy is intrigued and later telephones Kelly and arranges to meet her, believing that she is the key to getting his memory back. Jimmy's brother Carl (Tom Lister) finds out and goes to the caf√© where she is supposed to be meeting Jimmy. Carl warns Kelly to stay away from Jimmy but she refuses and tells Carl that she would only leave if Jimmy told her too. Kelly leaves her mobile in the cafe and Carl goes to the hotel where she is staying to return it to her. Carl threatens Kelly and again repeats his demand to stay away from Jimmy but she refuses again and orders Carl to leave. Kelly returns to the village at the end of the week and visits Bob. Kelly asks Bob if she can stay with him and he agrees and she tells him that she would have somebody with her. The following week Kelly moves into Bob's house and introduces Bob and his housemate Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) to her son Elliott. Jimmy's wife Nicola (Nicola Wheeler), Rodney's daughter, whom Jimmy had married during Kelly's absence, is shocked when she sees Kelly in the village. Kelly introduces Rodney and Nicola to Elliot. Kelly then explains to Jimmy that Elliot is his son and she shows Jimmy and Carl a paternity test to prove her claims. Nicola visits Kelly and demands to know why she has returned but Kelly claims that she had returned to the village as a result of Viv's death in a fire the previous January, and that she wanted to spend time with Bob and his and Viv's twins. Jimmy begs Kelly to keep it a secret that Elliot is his son in order to not cause trouble with Nicola and she agrees to do so. Kelly goes for a drink with Rodney in The Woolpack in order for them to catch up with each other and she tells him of her life since leaving the village and Rodney works out that Elliot is Jimmy's son. Rodney then informs Nicola of his discovery and she demands to know if he had been having an affair with Kelly. When Kelly intervenes, Nicola loses her temper and attacks her and has to be pulled away. Jimmy then escorts Kelly home. Kelly then starts manipulating Jimmy and claims that they had been having an affair and that he had been going to leave Nicola for her before he lost his memory. Kelly also befriends Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw) who helps strengthen Kelly's claims by forging hotel receipts and faking a photograph of Kelly and Jimmy together in Peterborough. Kelly spends the following week trying to help Jimmy get his memories of her back and takes him to the spot where he had proposed to her four years earlier. Kelly tells Jimmy that she still loves him and wanted them to get back together but Jimmy tells her that he does not want to hurt Nicola and turn his back on their daughter Angelica. He offers to support Kelly financially in order to provide for Elliot's upbringing. Whilst in the church, Jimmy regains some of his memory when he remembers his and Kelly's wedding day. He then visits Kelly and tells her that he remembered how he had felt about her and that he knew that he wanted to be with her. Jimmy and Kelly then have sex and this helps Jimmy regain some more of his memory. Jimmy has reservations about his decision, not wanting to hurt Nicola but Kelly tells him to tell her about their relationship and get a divorce. Jimmy then moves Kelly into Mill Cottage, much to Carl's discomfort, and they resume their relationship. As Jimmy continues to regain his memory, Carl warns Kelly that he would soon remember everything about her and what she was really like. In April 2011, whilst Jimmy and Kelly are having a play fight with a cushion, Kelly hits Jimmy over the head. Jimmy has a flashback and remembers that it was Kelly who had attacked him in Peterborough. Jimmy later tells Nicola that he remembers Kelly being there when he suffered the injuries which caused his memory loss and she urges him to call the police but he refuses for Elliot's sake. Kelly moves back into Bob's house and she later confesses to Eve that she had lied about her and Jimmy having an affair and Eve advises Kelly to tell Jimmy the truth. Jimmy later visits Kelly and demands that she tell him the truth. After claiming that she would never deliberately hurt him, Kelly finally confesses that she had attacked Jimmy and caused his memory loss. She begs Jimmy for forgiveness but he leaves in shock. Kelly later confides in Bob that she is scared of Jimmy hating her. In May 2011, Kelly discovers that Jimmy is trying to win back Nicola. Kelly continues to cause problems for them by arranging for Jimmy to spend time with her and Elliot at a time when Nicola had arranged for him to see Angelica in the park. Jimmy buys Elliot some new clothes and Kelly then hugs Jimmy in gratitude. Nicola, who had just arrived at the park with Rodney and Angelica, witnesses this and storms off. Jimmy offers to buy Kelly a house and support Elliot financially. He also tells her that he does not want her back as he had remembered how their previous relationship had ended and her abortion. Kelly later arrives unexpectedly at Mill Cottage with Elliot at a time when Jimmy is looking after Angelica. When Nicola arrives to pick Angelica up, she is furious to discover Kelly there. Kelly then lies to Nicola, claiming that Jimmy had told her that he would leave Nicola and would start a new life away with her, Elliot and Angelica. Nicola is outraged and attacks Kelly again leaving her with a bloody nose. Kelly then threatens to report Nicola to the police for assault. As Nicola had been on probation at the time, this meant that she would face a possible prison sentence. In order to get Nicola out of trouble, Jimmy threatens to tell the police that Kelly had started the fight and Nicola had acted in self- defence. Jimmy also tells Kelly that he thought it would be best if she left the village. Kelly agrees and tells him that she and Elliot would be going as far away from Emmerdale as they could. Kelly gives Jimmy an ultimatum that either he left with her and Elliot or he would never see him again. Wanting Nicola back, Jimmy reluctantly bids a tearful goodbye to Elliot and resigns himself to the fact that he would never see his son again. Kelly then gets into her car and drives out of the village with Elliot. Creation Kelly as she appeared in 1993. =Casting= In 1993 series producer Nicholas Prosser introduced the Windsor family, Kelly Windsor was first introduced in August 1993, series producer Prosser cast Adele Silva for the role of Kelly. Among them were Viv (Deena Payne), Kelly's father Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis), Scott (Toby Cockerell), and Kelly‚Äôs half-sister Donna (Sophie Jeffery). =Personality= Kelly Windsor has been described wild child is a feisty young woman who is not afraid to speak her own mind. \\"I've got a quite a fierce temper and I won't be pushed around.\\" she says. [...] \\"It doesn't take much to get Kelly angry but it‚Äôs all over very quickly. She‚Äôs just a passionate person. [...].\\" Development2000 exit and 2005 return= In 2000 it was announced that Adele Silva had quit Emmerdale, her exit storyline involved Kelly trying to seduce Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw). After that Viv threw Kelly out of the family home she was then seen in a taxi heading for London. In February 2005 it was announced that Adele Silva would be returning to Emmerdale, after a five-year break to reprise her role of Kelly. Speaking of her return to Digital Spy [...] \\"I'm very excited and can't wait to start filming,\\" Adele revealed, [..] \\"It will be interesting to see what Kelly has been up to in the past years, and I'm looking forward to catching up with old friends at Emmerdale. [...]. Silva couldn‚Äôt wait to go back to the show,\\" Silva told The Sun. [...] I've done quite a lot since leaving but it was difficult at first because I was a bit typecast. \\"I look quite young and everyone thought of me as being Kelly the schoolgirl. I struggled to get away from the little girl image. I've grown up a lot, though, and I'm looking forward to going back and showing the cast and crew that I'm now a sexy woman. I'm hoping Kelly will be really badly behaved. It would be fun if she had a few flings, too. I want to really show them what I'm made of. It'll be great to catch up with the actors there too - I can't wait to see them again.\\" [...]. When the show's producers approached Silva, she said she'd only come back if they would promise not to make her character nice,\\" Silva told the Sunday Mirror Kelly is still nasty as ever Kelly‚Äôs return storyline saw her at the bedside of her half-brother Scott (Ben Freeman) who had been injured by Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell). =2007 departure= In June 2007 it was announced that Silva would be taken a 12-month break. Silva had been thinking about leaving for a while, to try out new things. Silva was also really looking forward to the future. An Emmerdale spokeswoman said: [...] \\"Adele will be taking a 12-month break at the end of the year to focus on other projects but will return to Emmerdale in 2008.‚Äù[...]. Her exit storyline saw Kelly splitting up with Jimmy King (Nick Miles) after he found out that she had their unborn child aborted, in order to sign a modelling deal. Despite a return being confirmed for 2008, Silva did not return until 2011. =2011 return= On 5 November 2010 it was announced that Adele Silva would be reprising the role of Kelly for a second time, after a three-year break at the beginning of 2011. Silva told the Daily Mail : [...] \\"I absolutely loved playing Kelly. She's going to be three years older but probably not three years wiser! Whenever Kelly is around she's always caught up in something which makes her a lot of fun. I'm really looking forward to working with the new, talented cast as well as catching up with old friends. The chance to come back was just too good an opportunity to turn down.\\"[...] It is expected that Kelly's return will come at a cost for Jimmy, now living with his wife Nicola King (Nicola Wheeler) and their daughter Angelica. Emmerdale's series producer Gavin Blyth added: [...] \\"Kelly is as manipulative and destructive as ever and there will be no going back from the damage she looks set to cause to Jimmy. The story will ensure an explosive start to 2011 for Emmerdale.[...]. Although later Silva confirmed she would be exiting Emmerdale once again to the conclusion of Jimmy's amnesia storyline. She made her final appearance on 27 May 2011. In November 2014, it was announced that Silva turned down the chance to return to Emmerdale for a guest stint. Silva decided not to return after discovering she was pregnant with her first child. Had she have returned, Kelly would be seen attending her half-sister, Donna Windsor's (Verity Rushworth) funeral.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a612022/ex- emmerdale-star-adele-silva-turned-down-soap-return-due-to- pregnancy.html#~p89Zsh7rVmfRhO ReferencesExternal links *Kelly Windsor at itv.com Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1993 Category:Female villains Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional models ","title":"Kelly Windsor"},{"id":"2745015","text":"The Rialto Square Theatre is a theater in Joliet, Illinois (U.S.). Opening in 1926, it was originally designed and operated as a vaudeville movie palace, but it now houses mainly musicals, plays, concerts, and standup comedy. It is also available for public and private functions. Designed in the Neo-Baroque style, it is considered one of \\"150 great places in Illinois\\" by the American Institute of Architects. Description Inside Rialto Square Theatre, which opened in 1926 and underwent a restoration in the 1980s, shining scagliola columns rise into a celestial dome full of intricate sculptures. A Duchess chandelier dominates the rotunda. Cream-colored marble walls line the lobby and cherubim flutter into the auditorium. The lobby's marble walls were polished by Conrad Schmitt Studios, the same company that did major restoration work at the Rialto in 1980. The black marble base on the walls of the esplanade, fashioned after the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles in France, has been polished, as has the elegant red, pink and gray scagliola above the base. C.W. and George Rapp designed the Rialto Square Theatre in 1924, and the theatre opened May 24, 1926, featuring the production \\"The Evolution of Joliet\\". The first talking picture at the Rialto was shown on October 9, 1928, with Lights of New York. In 1953 stereophonic sound was installed in the theatre. As one of the theatre's original purposes was to exhibit silent films, which typically required musical accompaniment and sound effects, a four manual, 28 rank Barton theatre organ was included in the building's design, with the pipework installed into two chambers that flank the stage. The organ's console is mounted on a movable platform that can be raised to stage level or lowered into the orchestra pit. This instrument underwent an extensive restoration and is the focal point of the organ extravaganza concert held each year in the spring. In 1972, a campaign to \\"Save the Rialto\\" was initiated and led by Miss Dorothy Mavrich. As the campaign became more organized the group became known as the Rialto Square Arts Association. Assisted by local businessman Christo Dragatsis, Miss Maverich began to garner support from City, State, and Federal Officials. In the meantime, a student campaign began at a local High School, Joliet Township High School East Campus, under the direction of ROTC Cadet Lt. Colonel Don Probst who joined with Miss Mavrich in starting preliminary work towards the restoration. Mr. Probst helped organize student volunteers to repaint dressing rooms, clean the theatre, and act as ushers for some of the initial shows before major restoration began. Among these were \\"Hasting and Hays On Love\\" featuring soap opera stars Don Hastings and Kathryn Hays, presented at the 51st Anniversary Celebration held July 30 and July 31, 1977. It was at this time that The Rialto stage featured the choirs and Swing Groups from East, Central, and West Campuses as a joint tribute to the restoration and return to live stage productions. In 1978 the Rialto complex became public property and the Joliet Metropolitan Exposition and Auditorium Authority was established to provide leadership for the impending restoration of the theatre property. The Will County Cultural Arts Association, which sponsored the \\"Hastings and Hays on Love\\" concert was headed by President Dorothy Mavrich, 1st Vice President Eugene Gaskin, 2nd Vice President Dan Curtin, Secretary Sue Curtin, and Treasurer Dorothy Gross. The Board of Directors included Hal Carlson, Jan Challander, Marge Challander, Dan Cyrtin, Sue Curtin, Eugene Gaskin, Delores Gross, Matthew Gross, Chet Kondratowicz, Andrea Magosky, Brenda Merchant, Dorothy Mavrich, Robert Myers, Sue Revels, Bro. David O.F.M., Bob Russ, Rosemarie Sandenwater, Claudette Soltis, Richard Teas, Diane Wurzinger, and Vivian Ziech. Association Affiliates were Rob Calcaterra, Paul Lockwood, and Don Probst. The Rialto was the place where Christopher Knight and Adrianne Curry held their wedding reception in the final episode of My Fair Brady. The theatre used to be home to the Rialto School of the Arts, an art, choir, and drama educational program for children. A Visual Arts Camp explored different media, tools, and techniques. Additionally, A Choir camp was offered giving kids a chance to sing and dance, with a final performance on the magnificent Rialto Square Theatre stage. Children's Theatre Workshops were also held at the Rialto by Our Town Productions, a professional theatre company based out of Downers Grove, IL.

From 1993 to 1996, Scott was played by Toby Cockerell. In 1996, Scott left the village to join the army and when he returned in 1998, Ben Freeman took over the role and played Scott until early 2007. Creation and DevelopmentCasting= In 1993 series producer Nicholas Prosser introduced Scott as part of the new Windsor family. Among them were Scott's mother, Viv Windsor (Deena Payne), Viv's husband, Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis), Vic's daughter and Scott's adoptive sister, Kelly (Adele Silva), and Scott and Kelly's half-sister, Donna Windsor (Sophie Jeffery). In 1998 producer Mervyn Watson recast the role to Ben Freeman. =Departure= In early 2007, Scott Windsor was written out due to the court case of Freeman's rape allegations. Freeman was expected to return but it had not been confirmed if he would return to the show, he had been absent since January 2007. On 16 December 2007 Digital Spy confirmed that Ben Freeman had been axed from Emmerdale. However, the ITV website claims that Freeman had simply not renewed his contract, for practical reasons. His contract was due to expire at the end of 2007. In October 2008, Freeman was cleared of rape charges, and reports surfaced that he might return to the role of Scott. However in June 2009 Freeman announced he would not be returning to the soap. Storylines Scott is the son of Viv and Reg Dawson (Niven Boyd). Reg deserted them when Scott was young and Viv married Vic Windsor, who adopted Scott. Scott has a half-sister, Donna, and a stepsister, Kelly. The family move to the village in 1993. Reg follows them to the village and takes Viv and Shirley Turner (Rachael Davies) hostage at gunpoint, accidentally killing Shirley before being shot dead by a police marksman. Scott falls in with a bad crowd who force him to steal from the post office and threaten his sisters. Vic finds out about the theft and declares that Scott is 'no son of his', and Scott leaves to join the army. Two years later Scott returns, having been discharged from the army for 'psychiatric reasons', but it is eventually revealed this was because he was having an affair with a high-ranking officer's wife. Scott and Kelly become closer and develop romantic feelings for each other. They share their first kiss on Christmas Day 1998, just as Vic is being murdered by Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) in the post office. Scott claims to be in love with Kelly and in 1999, as she prepares to marry Roy Glover (Nicky Evans), they begin sleeping together. The stress of their affair takes its toll on Kelly and after discovering she is pregnant, Kelly attempts to commit suicide, leaving letters that told the truth about what they‚Äôd done. Scott burns them but the truth is revealed by Donna who announces it in the pub and Kelly leaves for London soon afterwards. With Kelly gone, Scott tries to resume a normal life and begins dating newcomer Chloe Atkinson (Amy Nuttall). They move in together and, when their housemate Jason Kirk leaves, they are joined by builder Syd Woolfe (Nathan Gladwell). One night, Scott drives Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) home and, in the grip of schizophrenia, they have a one night stand. This results in Zoe having baby Jean (Megan Pearson), whose paternity remains a mystery for months as Zoe cannot remember how she got pregnant. Scott does not tell anyone that he is the father and is horrified when Chloe becomes Jean's nanny. He tells Zoe that he is Jean's father when she is seriously injured in hospital and they are horrified to learn that Jean was injured because Chloe hadn't strapped Jean into her baby seat properly before sleeping with Syd. Zoe's brother Chris (Peter Amory) furiously evicts them from Pear tree Cottage and assumes that Scott raped Zoe as she is a lesbian. When the police decide not to press charges, Chris launches a hate campaign against Scott, burning down the garage and having him beaten up before paying a stripper, Yolanda Howie (Charlotte Faber-Scott), to sleep with Scott and accuse him of rape. When Zoe discovers what Chris has done, she pays Yolanda to drop the charges if Scott signs away his rights to baby Jean. Scott also dumps Chloe, unable to forgive her for cheating on him with Syd. When Chris commits suicide, Scott is delighted and is one of the few people who believes his wife, Charity's (Emma Atkins), story that Chris has framed her. With Chris gone, Scott and Zoe get closer and begin raising Jean together. With Scott now working at Home Farm, Zoe begins relying on him more and more and in her loneliness, vulnerability, and her feelings that Jean should have a mother and father to help raise her, ends up kissing him. Although they try to have a romantic relationship, Zoe is obviously not attracted to Scott and ends it. Scott becomes closer to his new stepsister Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam) who leaves her husband, stroke victim Terry (Billy Hartman), for Scott. When convicted rapist Frank Bernard Hartbourne (Rob Parry), Pearl Ladderbanks's (Meg Johnson) son arrives in the village, Scott, due to a misunderstanding involving Donna, attacks Frank, and beats him up badly. Facing an assault charge, Scott forces Dawn to lie for him - only to get his comeuppance a few days later when she retracts her statement. Scott later receives a twelve month suspended sentence. Scott and Dawn reconcile after a short split but Scott is not in love with her and when he learns that Zoe is planning to emigrate and take Jean with her, Scott reacts badly. He is delighted when Zoe asks him to go with them and be there for Jean, and thinks nothing of leaving Dawn but Zoe soon realises that Scott and Viv are plotting to stop them leaving. In revenge, she plots to make Scott think she is in love with him and he believes her, even proposing marriage but she refuses, claiming she would 'rather stick needles in her eyes'. Scott, enraged, attacks Zoe and she stabs him with a syringe full of Ketamine in self-defence and stabs him a second time while he is unconscious. Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) catches Zoe about to complete injecting Scott again and stops her but Scott is left fighting for his life. He makes a full recovery and is determined to get revenge, relishing the chance to take her to court for attempted murder. However, his bullying of Paddy, the only witness, causes the case to collapse and Zoe is acquitted. Incensed, Scott takes Zoe, her nephew Joseph (Oliver Young) and employee Callum Rennie (Andrew Whipp) hostage at gunpoint and threatens to kill them all, including Jean. Viv arrives and tries to talk Scott round, reminding him of what happened to Reg a decade before and Vic's death. Scott relents and releases the hostages. He later attacks Paddy and accidentally hits Dawn while she and Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) try to restrain him. Scott is arrested and sentenced to four months imprisonment. Kelly is the only family member to attend court with him. Scott only serves half his sentence, due to good behaviour. After being paroled, Scott is horrified to discover Dawn has now moved on and is dating Danny Daggert (Cleveland Campbell). Scott schemes to split them up. It works briefly but Dawn does not want Scott back and insists he moves out or she will report him to the police for punching Danny. Scott is forced to back down and vows to avenge himself. After learning Dawn has been doing various odd jobs to keep afloat, Scott reports her for benefit fraud and Dawn is arrested and consequently jailed for six weeks. Everyone, including Viv, is horrified by his behaviour. Scott is then evicted and continues his crusade against Dawn. Dawn dies in a house explosion in July 2006 and Scott feels guilty for his shabby treatment of her and blames Dawn's brother, Jamie Hope (Alex Carter) for not doing more to save her. Scott begins a relationship with his teen apprentice, Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). The pair con Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) and in revenge Rodney gets them to work on a car for a friend of his but refuses to pay them. Scott and Debbie confront Rodney in the pub and an angry Scott demands their money, but Len Reynolds (Peter Martin) intervenes and the couple leave humiliated. This is Scott's last appearance. Following this, Scott leaves the village to stay with an old army friend down in London selling stolen cars, leaving the garage in Debbie's hands. On 4 January 2008, Scott phones Viv and tells her that he will not be returning and is putting Tug Ghyll up for sale.

Hamnett Kirkes Pinhey (December 11, 1784 - March 3, 1857) was a Canadian landowner and politician. Early years Pinhey was born in Devonshire, England, in 1784 to Mary Townley and William Pinhey. He was educated at Christ's Hospital in London and became a grocery and insurance merchant, a partner in Pinhey and Crosley: Merchant and Ship Insurance Brokers. Pinhey spoke fluent French and German, and was a King's messenger who also claimed to have been a secret spy of the Crown to the King of Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars. By the age of 35, Pinhey had made enough money to retire comfortably from business. Pinhey married Mary Ann Tasker on December 12, 1812. Hamnett Pinhey was now a wealthy middle class man, but thanks to the class system in place in England at the time, Pinhey was not able to gain the power or privilege he desired. Seeking greener pastures, Pinhey petitioned the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time, for lands in Upper Canada and received a land grant. Originally, Pinhey requested . He was granted 200. The Move to Upper Canada In 1820, Pinhey travelled to March Township in Upper Canada and settled at a site on the Ottawa River. He and his clerk spent the first winter in a one-room log cabin, but soon built a larger one and half story log house and stone kitchen. His wife, children and possessions followed in 1821. With the family came 55 crates with clothing, plate, furniture, books and other items to allow the family to live comfortably in Upper Canada. Horaceville and the Stone House Horaceville and the Stone House Pinhey established himself as a gentleman farmer on his land and named this location Horaceville after his eldest son. Though he began building with the log house, Pinhey had always intended to build a large stone house on top of the hill, overlooking his land. The first part of the stone house was completed in 1825, and consisted of a large Parlour for entertaining and the servants quarters on the second floor. The second part of the house was not completed until 1841, and included the Grand Entrance, the original Dining Room, the Master Bedroom and a second stone kitchen for Mrs. Pinhey. By this point Horace Pinhey had married and moved into the log house with his wife. The last part of the stone house was completed in 1848, and housed Hamnett's Library, the Drawing Room, several bedrooms for the family and Hamnett's Sanctum Sanctorum (the Holiest of Holies, a second floor indoor privy.) Though the house was built in three different stages, it was designed as a whole in a symmetrical Georgian fashion. In addition to the house, Pinhey built a grist mill, sawmill, and St. Mary's Church on the site. Although the first service in the church was held on October 7, 1827, it was not consecrated until 1834 due to a dispute about the church's location with the ruling bishop at the time. =Aristocratic values= The Pinhey family continued their British aristocratic values at Horraceville. Other former members of the British military moved into March Township, and the group has been described as \\"Ottawa‚Äôs original aristocracy.Woods, 45. Pinhey was recognized as the leader of this group, and Horaceville served as its chief community. Pinhey welcomed members of the British elite into his home, including Lord Dalhousie and Upper Canada Anglican Bishop John Strachan. Pinhey also managed a full staff at his home including footmen and a butler. Pinhey's wife insisted on being carried to their family chapel in a sedan chair.Woods, 46. Political life In 1832, Pinhey was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in a by-election in Carleton County. He lost his seat the following year due to voting irregularities in the by- election. Pinhey continued to serve in various positions in local government and, in 1847, became a member of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. Pinhey had been governor of Christ's Hospital in London and continued to provide it with financial support. Death and successors Hamnett Kirkes Pinhey died in 1857 and was buried in the graveyard at St. Mary's Church. The estate was left to his son, Horace Pinhey. Members of the Pinhey family lived in the house until 1971. The last member of the family to live in the house was Ruth Pinhey. While she was living in the house, most rooms had been closed off save the old dining room, which she used as a bedroom, and the Grand Entrance, which she used as a living room. Upon her death in 1971, Ruth Pinhey left the estate to a family member, who then sold the property to the township of March. The former site of the town of Horaceville has been preserved as the Pinhey's Point Historic Site operated by the City of Ottawa and the Pinhey's Point Foundation.

Besides being a classic example of early forest dwellers in West Africa, Kintampo is significant because there is evidence of a drastic change in food production techniques due to the transition from nomadic hunter-gather lifestyles to life in stationary settlements. This change is known as sedentism and is typical of societies who have access to, or are developing systems of agriculture. Ceramic sculptures of humans and animals indicate that the Kintampo settlements were lived at by practitioners of both pastoralism and horticulture. Another notable aspect of the Kintampo complex is the creation of art and items of personal adornment. Archaeologists have found polished stone beads, bracelets and figurines in addition to typical stone tools and structures such as hand axes, and building foundations which suggests that these people had both a complex society and were well-learned in Later Stone Age technologies.Anquandah, James (1995) The Kintampo Complex: a case study of early sedentism and food production in sub-Sahelian west Africa, pp. 255‚Äì259 in Shaw, Thurstan, Andah, Bassey W and Sinclair, Paul (1995). The Archaeology of Africa: Food, Metals and Towns. London: Routledge. When referring to topics related to Kintampo, the term complex is preferred as opposed to culture. In an archaeological research context, culture implies that every site represented in the area used the same technologies and techniques to create the same types of tools, goods, and foods, had the same beliefs and customs, and so on. In reality, the inhabitants of the region during this particular period of time did have much in common, but did differ enough from village to village that culture is not entirely accurate. Complex, or sometimes tradition on the other hand, means a group that shares many characteristics, but also acknowledges differences. The name Kintampo which is used to describe the complex comes from the Kintampo district in the Bono East region of Ghana. Settlement of West Africa A satellite image of northern Africa and the modern extent of the Sahara The Sahel, meaning shore in Arabic, is a transition zone between the harsh and inhospitable Sahara, and the savannahs and humid, fruitful forests. During the Middle Stone Age, technological advancements allowed humans originating in East Africa to adapt to new and diverse areas and allowed them to spread out and settle most of the African continent. Another motivator for the East African exodus was the expanding population that was growing exponentially. It was also during this era that humans are thought to have first traveled out of Africa; to Southwest Asia (also known as the Middle East), Asia and to Southeast Europe by traveling across the Sinai Peninsula and land bridges across the Red Sea, and to Western Europe by crossing at Gibraltar. Indeed, by the 10th millennium BC, there was substantial occupation of the upper part of Africa including large populations in what was then a region of lush forest: the Sahara. After the end of the last ice age, the geography and climate of the Sahara region began to change drastically. The northern part dried out due to the Earth tilting on its axis allowing the region to absorb more solar radiation, thus a desert was formed.Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit The area directly to the south became a humid monsoon region, receiving massive amounts of precipitation due to moisture drawn in from the oceans. By the late 5th millennium BC, the planet had tilted even more on its axis and consequently the desert had spread southward, making previously settled areas unlivable.Christopher Ehret (2002)The Civilizations of Africa. University Press of Virginia. . People began traveling further south, away from the Sahara, some settling in the fringes of the desert, an area known today as the Sahel, a unique type of landscape that forms a buffer zone between desert and savannahs and forests (by this point in time, the Sahara had expanded to approximately the same extent as is today). Other kept traveling south, finding themselves in the humid rainforests of West Africa. These are thought to be the people who founded the Kintampo way of life. There is another theory that states that instead of a mass migration from the Sahel of people who formed the Kintampo complex, it was formed by local Punpun foragers through interaction with peoples to the north. As the Punpun, who had long lived in the area, adopted the new traits, they ceased to be hunter gatherers, and adapted sedentism and horticulture. There is much speculation by Africanists as to whether or not the Kintampo tradition evolved from Punpun, but it appears that the two existed simultaneously for some time. : See also: Neolithic Subpluvial Sites wattle being created. This ancient construction material is made by weaving straw or reeds into a rigid sheet( the wattle). The next step is to cover the sheet in daub, a compound that was typically made from clays and animal dung to fortify the wattle. The result is a sturdy structure that very much resembles a wall. The peoples of Kintampo used this as their primary construction technique. Archaeologists have identified studied at least three dozen sites relating to the Kintampo complex in three different types of environments within and near Ghana. =Northern savanna= * Birimi This site was found in 1987 by Francois Kense. There is evidence of pearl millet having been cultivated. * Chukoto * Daboya At this site, pieces of charred pearl millet were found. Also found, were structural remains from housing, burnished pottery, beads made from various materials, including quartz and shell. * Lake Kpriri * Mole Game Reserve * Ntereso Found in 1952 by Oliver Davies, outlines of dwellings have been excavated since the early 1960s, and pieces of construction material such as fired clay and wooden support poles have been found. Artifacts typical of a hunting-fishing community such as harpoons and fish hooks were discovered here. Clay figurines shaped like lizards and bovids were also discovered. There is also evidence of animal husbandry being practiced. * Tamale Stone rasps were found. * Tolundipe =Central woodland savanna= Nearly all of the archaeological sites that have been detected or excavated in this region are found near the modern day city or town of Nkoranza and Techiman. * Amuowi * Banda * Bonoase Outlines of huts and stone foundations have been excavated. * Boyase Hill At this hill, which has a radius of approximately 250 meters, polished stone axes, stone arm rings and projectile points were found. Most curiously, a clay dog figurine was discovered. * Fiakwase * Kintampo First excavated in 1966, evidence of animal husbandry is found here, as well as remnants of sheep, cattle, goats, and larger mammals such as elephants and hippopotamus. * Jema * Mumute Outlines of dwellings and stone foundations have been excavated. * Nyamogo * Pumpuano * Wenchi =Southern forest= * Boyasi Outlines of dwellings and stone foundations have been excavated. Large stones of granite with major signs of wear were found at the edge of the village that were used to polish stone tools and decorations. * Buoho * Buruburo * Christian Village Located near the Atlantic coast near modern-day Accra, clay cylinders have been found at the site which are remnants of ancient dwellings. * Mampongtin * Nkobin * Nkukoa Buoho This site, located near Boyasi, seems to be a treasure trove of artifacts and features for researchers. Rasps, pottery and stone tools were found in large numbers. * Somanya * Wiwi Inhabitants The people of Kintampo lived in open-air villages composed of rectangular structures made from wattle and daub construction techniques. Some house used mud, some used clays, and many were found to have been supported by wooden poles and some had foundations of stones like granite and laterite. Rock shelters were also used as dwellings, especially to the south, near the Atlantic coast. A society can not live without a water supply, and at Kintampo there is no exception. Many settlements were situated along the White Volta river which runs all the way through Ghana, from north to south, eventually dumping into the Atlantic. Other settlements, such as the rock shelters of southwestern Ghana and southeastern C√¥te d'Ivoire were along near the Atlantic coast. They also kept domesticated dogs and goats and cattle. Food The cowpea, also known as the black-eyed pea. Pearl millet, the most common variety of millet. The fruit of the African oil palm The Kintampo site is most often studied by archaeologists who are interested in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither foraging or farming, but somewhere in between. As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to domesticate plants in Africa. Pearl millet is a crop that is well suited to hot climates, and is thought to have been first domesticated in the area. It is speculated that the people of Kintampo may have deliberately adapted it to mature faster, to allow for quicker harvest. Its charred remains have been excavated at Kintampo and was valuable to people living in West Africa because it could be stored after harvest to be used at a later date. There is evidence of trade of foods with other people throughout the region; one item of evidence is that the millet has been found with shell beads that would have been imported from the ocean. Another important staple to the people who settled at Kintampo was the oil palm. The oil palm was used at Kintampo starting at least 4000 years ago. A very useful plant in many ways, it serves as a source of drink, food, and construction material. It was allowed to flourish in the region due to its preference for a constant warm climate and high rainfall. As a food, the oil can be extracted from the mesocarp which covers the plant, and the kernel which is also edible by itself. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, which would have helped to support a growing population. It is speculated that ceramic techniques were improved so that the nut of the oil palm could be further cooked. The cowpea, incense tree, hackberry, yams, and sorghum, are also known to have been grown. Grasses were most likely not harvested as often, as the climate makes it difficult for grasses to grow. Kintampo people also kept livestock; goats, sheep, and cattle remains have been found. Other wild animals such as monitor lizards, snails, guineafowl, vervet monkey, baboon, turtles and tortoises royal and duiker antelopes, giant pouched and cane rats were hunted as game. Artifacts An example of a microlith projectile point, a very small stone tool. The shape of this one is similar to the ones that have been discovered at Kintampo sites. Numerous types of tools have been excavated at Kintampo, including polished axes crafted from calc- chlorite schist, many types and sizes of grinding stones, small, quartz microlith projectile points of various shapes and styles, and stone celts. A few harpoons have been found, but these are rare. The knapping technique they used is well understood by lithics experts. The stone core was placed on a hard level surface such as a large rock, log, or trunk, then struck from above, forcing flakes to separate from the material from underneath. This use of a makeshift anvil is typical of bipolar percussion. There is some confusion about the purpose of a number of small stone and ceramic objects that are cigar-shaped and rasp-like. They are thought to be tools for creating pottery, of which bowls and jars seem to be the most common. The jars ranged from 12‚Äì44 cm in diameter. The bowls were slightly smaller on average, ranging from 10‚Äì30 cm. Many times these pots were decorated with a comb-like or rake pattern. These were likely used not only for the storage of food and water, but also for boiling and crafting sauces. The pottery appears to have been fired in a pit, typical of early ceramic practices. In fact, the pottery of Kintampo have been widely studied, in fact it is possibly the most studied later stone age ceramics in West Africa. Pieces of a substance known as daga has been found along with the stone artifacts. Daga is chunks of ceramics that have been visibly marked by sticks or other pole-like implements. Somewhat common at Kintampo sites, these are understood to represent occupation in dwellings. The Kintampo culture is known for possibly the first occurrences of figurative art and objects of personal decoration in West Africa. Stone arm bands that would have been worn as decoration have been found at several Kintampo sites. At the sites of Boyase hill and Ntersero, clay figurines of animals like dogs, lizards and cows were found, though it is not well understood what their meaning might be. This is all very important to those who study the humanities, as the emergence of art and the depiction of life through art is of great interest to both art historians and archaeologists alike. Legacy The rockshelters of Kintampo appear to be abandoned by the second century BCE, and then in the early first millennium CE, iron metallurgy became the dominant technology of the region.Stahl, Ann Brower (1995) Intensification in the west African Late Stone Age: a view from central Ghana, pp. 261‚Äì269 in Shaw, Thurstan, Andah, Bassey W and Sinclair, Paul (1995). The Archaeology of Africa: Food, Metals and Towns. London: Routledge. The area was the home to the Bono people, who founded the Bono State in the 11th century. It was a large kingdom that used firearms traded to them by Europeans to effectively conquer neighboring territories. The Bono enslaved their enemies and prisoners of war from the north and to the Coast, and made a profit by selling them in the transatlantic slave trade.Collins, Robert O. and Burns, James M. (2007). A History of Sub-Saharan Africa. New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 138-141, Merchants from Western Sudan who were mainly into gold trading also contributed to the growth of the Bono State.

It was introduced in 1962 by Martin Davis, George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland and is a refinement of the earlier Davis‚ÄìPutnam algorithm, which is a resolution-based procedure developed by Davis and Hilary Putnam in 1960. Especially in older publications, the Davis‚ÄìLogemann‚ÄìLoveland algorithm is often referred to as the \\"Davis‚ÄìPutnam method\\" or the \\"DP algorithm\\". Other common names that maintain the distinction are DLL and DPLL. After more than 50 years the DPLL procedure still forms the basis for most efficient complete SAT solvers. It has recently been extended for automated theorem proving for fragments of first-order logic by way of the DPLL(T) algorithm.  Implementations and applications  The SAT problem is important both from theoretical and practical points of view. In complexity theory it was the first problem proved to be NP-complete, and can appear in a broad variety of applications such as model checking, automated planning and scheduling, and diagnosis in artificial intelligence. As such, it has been a hot topic in research for many years, and competitions between SAT solvers regularly take place. DPLL's modern implementations like Chaff and zChaff, GRASP or Minisat are in the first places of the competitions these last years. Another application that often involves DPLL is automated theorem proving or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), which is a SAT problem in which propositional variables are replaced with formulas of another mathematical theory. The algorithm The basic backtracking algorithm runs by choosing a literal, assigning a truth value to it, simplifying the formula and then recursively checking if the simplified formula is satisfiable; if this is the case, the original formula is satisfiable; otherwise, the same recursive check is done assuming the opposite truth value. This is known as the splitting rule, as it splits the problem into two simpler sub-problems. The simplification step essentially removes all clauses that become true under the assignment from the formula, and all literals that become false from the remaining clauses. The DPLL algorithm enhances over the backtracking algorithm by the eager use of the following rules at each step: ; Unit propagation : If a clause is a unit clause, i.e. it contains only a single unassigned literal, this clause can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make this literal true. Thus, no choice is necessary. In practice, this often leads to deterministic cascades of units, thus avoiding a large part of the naive search space. ; Pure literal elimination : If a propositional variable occurs with only one polarity in the formula, it is called pure. Pure literals can always be assigned in a way that makes all clauses containing them true. Thus, these clauses do not constrain the search anymore and can be deleted. Unsatisfiability of a given partial assignment is detected if one clause becomes empty, i.e. if all its variables have been assigned in a way that makes the corresponding literals false. Satisfiability of the formula is detected either when all variables are assigned without generating the empty clause, or, in modern implementations, if all clauses are satisfied. Unsatisfiability of the complete formula can only be detected after exhaustive search. The DPLL algorithm can be summarized in the following pseudocode, where Œ¶ is the CNF formula: Input: A set of clauses Œ¶. Output: A Truth Value. function DPLL(Œ¶) if Œ¶ is a consistent set of literals then return true; if Œ¶ contains an empty clause then return false; for every unit clause {l} in Œ¶ do Œ¶ ‚Üê unit-propagate(l, Œ¶); for every literal l that occurs pure in Œ¶ do Œ¶ ‚Üê pure-literal-assign(l, Œ¶); l ‚Üê choose- literal(Œ¶); return DPLL(Œ¶ ‚àß {l}) or DPLL(Œ¶ ‚àß {not(l)}); In this pseudocode, \`unit-propagate(l, Œ¶)\` and \`pure-literal-assign(l, Œ¶)\` are functions that return the result of applying unit propagation and the pure literal rule, respectively, to the literal \`l\` and the formula \`Œ¶\`. In other words, they replace every occurrence of \`l\` with \\"true\\" and every occurrence of \`not l\` with \\"false\\" in the formula \`Œ¶\`, and simplify the resulting formula. The \`or\` in the \`return\` statement is a short-circuiting operator. \`Œ¶ ‚àß {l}\` denotes the simplified result of substituting \\"true\\" for \`l\` in \`Œ¶\`. The algorithm terminates in one of two cases. Either the CNF formula Œ¶ is found to comprise a consistent set of literals--that is, there is no \`l\` and \`¬¨l\` for any literal \`l\` in the formula. If this is the case, the variables can be trivially satisfied by setting them to the respective polarity of the encompassing literal in the valuation. Otherwise, when the formula contains an empty clause, the clause is vacuously false because a disjunction requires at least one member that is true for the overall set to be true. In this case, the existence of such a clause implies that the formula (evaluated as a conjunction of all clauses) cannot evaluate to true and must be unsatisfiable. The pseudocode DPLL function only returns whether the final assignment satisfies the formula or not. In a real implementation, the partial satisfying assignment typically is also returned on success; this can be derived from the consistent set of literals of the first \`if\` statement of the function. The Davis‚ÄìLogemann‚ÄìLoveland algorithm depends on the choice of branching literal, which is the literal considered in the backtracking step. As a result, this is not exactly an algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms, one for each possible way of choosing the branching literal. Efficiency is strongly affected by the choice of the branching literal: there exist instances for which the running time is constant or exponential depending on the choice of the branching literals. Such choice functions are also called heuristic functions or branching heuristics. =Visualization= Davis, Logemann, Loveland (1962) had developed this algorithm. Some properties of this original algorithm are: * It is based on search. * It is the basis for almost all modern SAT solvers. * It does not use learning or non-chronological backtracking (introduced in 1996). An example with visualization of a DPLL algorithm having chronological backtracking: Image:Dpll1.pngAll clauses making a CNF formula Image:Dpll2.pngPick a variable Image:Dpll3.pngMake a decision, variable a = False (0), thus green clauses becomes True Image:Dpll4.pngAfter making several decisions, we find an implication graph that leads to a conflict. Image:Dpll5.pngNow backtrack to immediate level and by force assign opposite value to that variable Image:Dpll6.pngBut a forced decision still leads to another conflict Image:Dpll7.pngBacktrack to previous level and make a forced decision Image:Dpll8.pngMake a new decision, but it leads to a conflict Image:Dpll9.pngMake a forced decision, but again it leads to a conflict Image:Dpll10.pngBacktrack to previous level Image:Dpll11.pngContinue in this way and the final implication graph Current work In the 2010s years, work on improving the algorithm has been done on three directions: # Defining different policies for choosing the branching literals. # Defining new data structures to make the algorithm faster, especially the part on unit propagation # Defining variants of the basic backtracking algorithm. The latter direction include non-chronological backtracking (aka backjumping) and clause learning. These refinements describe a method of backtracking after reaching a conflict clause which \\"learns\\" the root causes (assignments to variables) of the conflict in order to avoid reaching the same conflict again. The resulting Conflict-Driven Clause Learning SAT solvers are the state of the art in 2014. A newer algorithm from 1990 is St√•lmarck's method. Also since 1986 (reduced ordered) binary decision diagrams have also been used for SAT solving.  Relation to other notions  Runs of DPLL-based algorithms on unsatisfiable instances correspond to tree resolution refutation proofs.

Retzsch was born in the Saxon capital Dresden. He joined the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1798 under Cajetan Toscani and J√≥zef Grassi, later working autodidactically, copying the famous pictures of the Gem√§ldegalerie, among them a copy of the Sixtinian Madonna. He was made a member of the Academy in 1817 and professor in 1824. The Cotta publishing house commissioned illustrations for Johann Wolfgang Goethe's Faust (26 plates), which made him financially independent. Goethe liked his work, and he illustrated works by other famous authors, most notably Friedrich Schiller's Lied von der Glocke (43 plates), a Shakespeare Gallery (80 plates), and B√ºrger's Ballads (15 plates). He also did oil paintings on classical subjects, and portraits. Many of his works were created in a house in the L√∂√ünitz, with a view of the Elbe Valley. As a winemaker, he was a member of the Saxon wine association from 1799 onwards. Retzsch died in Oberl√∂ssnitz/Radebeul.

Over time it expanded its role, becoming equity investors with other studios and partnering with British horror film company Hammer Film Productions on many projects. It also retained ancillary rights on new productions surrendered on earlier films, including Seven Days in May (1964) and Promise Her Anything (1965) for release by Paramount. Seven Arts also distributed feature films and TV programs for television. Warner Bros. licensed the TV rights to its post-1949 library to Seven Arts in 1960. Seven Arts made similar deals with 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures. Seven Arts also acquired theatrical reissue rights to some Fox films as well. In 1967, Seven Arts Productions acquired the controlling interest in Warner Bros. Pictures from Jack L. Warner for $32 million. The companies were merged as Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.

He originally became known on an international level for his work in the anime Macross 7 where he was the singing voice and guitar of the show's main character, Basara Nekki. Fukuyama is currently enjoying a successful career recording both solo and member of the Anison band JAM Project.  Early Years and Personal Life  Yoshiki Fukuyama was born in Tokyo and raised in Kamakura. At age 5, he began taking piano lessons. He and future bandmate, Toshiyuki Furuya, had the same piano teacher. In his early teen years, he discovered The Beatles, which led to his interest in playing guitar. In high school, Fukuyama was a member of a Queen tribute band called ‚Äú‰ªñ‚Äù (hoka), which means ‚Äúother‚Äù in Japanese. The band was reportedly so named because they were frequently listed as ‚Äúother‚Äù on concert billings. Fukuyama currently lives in Kamakura along with his wife, a daughter, and a few pets. He and his wife, Kyoko Fukuyama, generally work as a songwriting team; he composes the music while she writes most of the lyrics for his songs. Fukuyama is an accomplished musician who plays several instruments. On his solo albums, he performs all of the instruments except drums (played by Shoichiro Aso) for most of the songs.  Career  Early Gigs: 1982 to 2000 and Macross 7 = In college, Yoshiki Fukuyama, Toshiyuki ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Furuya, and various friends formed the band Doolin Dalton (later changed to Dalton Kougyou), often performing songs by The Eagles and similar bands. Fukuyama played bass and shared the lead vocal position with Furuya. Fukuyama also played guitar and sang with the comedy rock band Kirenjaku. Although he occasionally sang lead with Kirenjaku, fellow band member, Takeshi Yamaguchi, performed most of the band's lead vocals. Kirenjaku recorded one four-song EP. Fukuyama and Furuya, along with several other friends formed the band Maps. By 1988, Maps had evolved into the band Humming Bird for which Fukuyama is often remembered. Humming Bird played a blend of rock and folk with roots in the hard rock and roll of the 1960s to 1980s, such as Queen or The Beatles. Initially, Humming Bird had only two official members: Yoshiki Fukuyama on guitar and vocals and Toshiyuki Furuya on bass and vocals. The final band roster was set in 1992 with the official addition of Shoichiro Aso on drums. Humming Bird enjoyed moderate success, having released nine albums before disbanding in May 2000. Yoshiki Fukuyama was the singing voice and guitarist for the main character Basara Nekki in the anime Macross 7. Fukuyama, Chie Kajiura, Tomo Sakurai, and various studio musicians recorded several albums of songs that were used in the show. Most of the time, the work was merely credited to Fire Bomber, although Fukuyama's name does appear in the songwriting credits of several songs. Also he and his band, Humming Bird, are both listed in the ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù section of all the Fire Bomber album credits. = 2000s to Present = Fukuyama began his solo career after Humming Bird. Fukuyama teams up on occasion with Masato Ushijima to form the folk/rock duo, Wild Vox. They are mostly a live band, but they did record one album, Yasei no Kaze, that was released in April 2002. In 2003, Yoshiki Fukuyama joined the anime music supergroup, JAM Project. In 2006, Yoshiki Fukuyama released his smash hit single Makka Na Chikai (ÁúüËµ§„Å™Ë™ì„ÅÑ). The song peaked at #33 on the Oricon weekly chart and charted for 12 weeks. It is his best-selling solo single to date. In 2009, for the 15th anniversary of Macross 7, Fire Bomber released a studio album entitled Re.Fire. The album peaked at 16th on the Oricon 300 and stayed on that chart for a total of 7 weeks. In early 2011, Fukuyama announced he was recording a new studio album, and released Synapse on April 6 of that year. Following a Macross 25th anniversary concert, Fukuyama and actor Nobutoshi Kanna joined forces to perform a number of concerts together. Since the production of Macross 7, the two men had worked together portraying the character, Basara Nekki. Kanna acted and Fukuyama sang and played guitar. They had considered the name Basaras for their duo, but decided instead on Fukujin which was created by combining the first kanji of their respective surnames. From time to time, as their busy careers permit, they sing together onstage and create a series of internet radio broadcasts called Fukujin Tsuke. On November 23, 2008, Fukujin performed its first international concert in Taipei, Taiwan.

History The company was incorporated in 1945 by Sigmund Dornbusch. This company became as a public and it renamed as Kinney Service Corporation in December 1961. it merged with a funeral home company, Riverside Memorial Chapel, and then expanded into car-rental, office cleaning, and construction. =Final years, merger with National Cleaning= In 1966, the firm merged with the National Cleaning Company (this company established in 1865William V. Frankel, 68, Dies; Led Warner Communications) to form Kinney National Company, headed by Steve Ross, who had joined Riverside after marrying Carol Rosenthal, owner Edward Rosenthal's daughter.Master of the Game: Steve Ross and the Creation of Time Warner by Connie Bruck Ross pursued an aggressive expansion of the company's properties, first acquiring Ashley-Famous talent agency, then Panavision, and finally in 1969 Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, creating Dimension Pictures. LegacyWarner Communications= After a financial scandal in the parking division, the non-entertainment assets were spun off again in September 1971 as National Kinney Corporation, and, on February 10, 1972, the remaining company was renamed Warner Communications, a predecessor to today's WarnerMedia. =National Kinney= National Kinney expanded from parking and building services into real estate development by purchasing the Uris Buildings Corporation, but the timing was bad as the New York real estate market collapsed in the 1973-75 recession. The main Uris Building asset was soon lost to foreclosure. In 1979, after some protracted negotiations, National Kinney attempted to purchase The Aladdin hotel and casino in Las Vegas in a joint venture with Johnny Carson, planning to rename it after the star. However, Carson's wife Joanna gossiped about the deal, and subsequent trading in National Kinney stock led to insider trading charges against third parties by the SEC and the disgorgement of profits. In 1982, National Kinney sold its National States Electric division to an undisclosed buyer, and then agreed to sell its parking subsidiary, Kinney System Inc., to that division's chairman Daniel Katz and a group of investors. National Kinney subsequently renamed itself to Andal Corporation and sold its remaining majority interest in Kinney System parking. Andal invested in the declining Steve's Ice Cream and merged in Swensen's before selling them off and unwinding its last operating subsidiary.

The site draws its water from the Atbara River, where the Khashm el Girba Dam provides a reliable source for the irrigation project intended to convert the nomads of the area to farmers of cotton and sugar. Amongst the problems faced by the settlers have been low crop yields, insufficient water for irrigation, low revenues, shortage of fuel, machinery and spare parts, and rising production costs. The failed New Halfa Project has been largely viewed as inadequate compensation for the inundation of Wadi Halfa that occurred after the agreement with Egypt to allow construction of the Aswan Dam. The inhabitants of New Halfa have not managed to attain the same standard of living that they previously possessed in Wadi Halfa. The developmental benefits of the Aswan Dam have arguably been vested in Egypt and not Sudan, as manifested by the disappointing New Halfa Project and its impoverished inhabitants.

It has been chiefly regarded as a pornographic novel, which accounts for its massive sales in 18th-century France (as pornographic works were the most popular bestsellers of the time). Aside from that however, this novel represents a public conveyance (and arguably perversion) for some ideas of the Philosophes. Summary The narrative starts with Therese, sexually precocious in spite of herself, from solid bourgeois stock, being placed by her mother in a convent when she is 11 years old. There she eventually becomes sick because her pleasure principle is not permitted to express itself, putting her body into disorder, and bringing her close to the grave until her mother finally yanks her out of the convent at age 23. She then becomes a student of Father Dirrag, a Jesuit who secretly teaches materialism. Therese spies on Dirrag counseling her fellow student, Mlle. Eradice, and preying on her spiritual ambition in order to seduce her. Through flagellation and penetration, Dirrag gives Mlle. Eradice what she thinks is spiritual ecstasy but is actually sexual. \\"Father Dirrag\\" and \\"Mlle. Eradice\\" are named after anagrams of Catherine Cadi√®re and Jean-Baptiste Girard, who were involved in a highly publicized trial for the illicit relationship between priest and student in 1730. After that she spends time with Mme. C and the Abb√© T., and spies on them on multiple occasions, while they discuss libertine political and religious philosophy just before they engage in, and sometimes during, various acts of sex. (Abb√© T. is clearly the same character as figures in another, eponymous, coming-of-age, soft-core libertine novel published that same year or possibly one year earlier: Ecclesiastical Laurels, or Abbot T.'s Campaigns with the Triumph of the Nuns, attributed to Jacques Rochette La Morli√®re; this latter novel is one of several titles listed towards the end of Therese the Philosopher as belonging to the library owned by the count, which library he loans to Therese as part of a bet.) Therese's sexual education continues with her relationship with Mme. Bois-Laurier, an experienced prostitute, who is also a virgin much to her clients' surprise, delight and also disappointment. Many a John will try to break through her maidenhead, without success. This section of the novel constitutes an arguably hilarious variation on the whore dialogues that were common in early pornographic novels. Finally, Therese meets the unnamed Count who wants her for his mistress. She refuses him intercourse, out of her fear of death in childbirth (not unreasonable at the time) and also because she finds masturbation to be sufficiently pleasurable in and of itself. He makes a bet with her. If she can last two weeks in a room full of erotic books and paintings without masturbating, he will not demand intercourse with her. Therese loses and becomes the Count's permanent mistress. Philosophical and social concepts For all of its printed debauchery, the work has some philosophical merit in its underlying concepts. Between the more graphically adult sections of the novel, philosophical issues would be discussed amongst the characters, including materialism, hedonism and atheism. All phenomena are matter in motion, and religion is a fraud, though useful for keeping the working classes in line. The book not only draws attention to the sexual repression of women at the time of the enlightenment, but also to the exploitation of religious authority through salacious acts. Influence and adaptations *Dostoievsky referred repeatedly to the novel in his working notes for both The Idiot and The Possessed.George Steiner, Tolstoy or Dostoevsky (Penguin 1967) p. 179 *Th√©r√©se Philosophe was loosely adapted as the second segment of Walerian Borowczyk's French anthology film Immoral Tales (1973).

Normandie France. Le Tr√©port is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in Normandy, France. Geography Le Tr√©port's cliffs, at sunset A small fishing port and light industrial town situated in the Pays de Caux, some northeast of Dieppe at the junction of the D 940, the D 78 and the D 1015 roads. The mouth of the Bresle river meets the English Channel here, in between the high (110 metres) chalk cliffs and the pebbly beach. Le Tr√©port is also a sea-side resort and home to a casino. History The British World War I soldier Arthur Bullock, who was stationed in Le Tr√©port after the Armistice, was captivated by the town, nestling at the bottom of cliffs which could be ascended by 365 steps or by a cliff railway. Bullock recorded in his memoir, 'The sea floor must have been covered by multicoloured sands, for on a clear day, looking from the cliffs straight down into the sea, it seemed that one was looking at a vast abstract canvas of blues, yellows, reds and greens'. While staying there, Bullock also painted a study of a French fisher girl with a basket on her back.Bullock, A S, Gloucestershire Between the Wars: A Memoir, The History Press, 2009, pages 94-95 Population Aerial view of the town A view of the town Administration The current mayor of Le Tr√©port is Laurent Jacques of the PCF political party.

Unhappy with the Podgorica Assembly of 1918 which merged Serbia and Montenegro into what would become Yugoslavia, he became one of the leaders of the 1919 Christmas Uprising on the side of the Greens who supported the newly dethroned King Nikola of the Petroviƒá-Njego≈° dynasty and who favored a confederation of Yugoslavia that still gave Montenegro a form of independence in skirmishes against the Whites who favored King Alexander of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty and complete annexation of Montenegro into Yugoslavia. After the uprising failed, Popoviƒá emigrated to Italy, but returned in June 1919 to start guerrilla warfare. He eventually laid down arms after the death of King Nikola in 1921 and he was eventually pardoned by King Alexander after proclaiming allegiance to him. He lived out his remaining years in Yugoslavia relatively peacefully until the Second World War when he formed the Lovƒáen Brigade. For this, he was labelled a collaborator by the new Communist government and in 1947 he was killed in an ambush by agents of the OZNA. Life Born to father Todor \\"Zrno\\" Popoviƒá and mother ƒÜetna (n√©e Krivokapiƒá), he fought in the Balkan Wars and World War I in the Montenegrin army forces until being captured by Austro- Hungarian army in 1916. He was also one of the prominent heroes of the Battle of Mojkovac, where Montenegro helped the army of Serbia, its close ally, to retreat in face of the Austro-Hungarian attacks. After spending two years in the Austro-Hungarian prisoner camp, he returned to Montenegro to become the leader of the Christmas Uprising on 7 January 1919 and Saint Petar's Day Uprising in July of same year, fighting against the decision of the Podgorica Assembly to unite the Kingdom of Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia under the House of Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. Between 1919 and 1922, he was a leader of Montenegrin komite, fighters for the federalisation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1922, he emigrated to Argentina and later to Belgium in 1929. The Greens voted against the unification of the Kingdom of Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia Podgorica Assembly, while the majority Whites (Bjela≈°i) supported it. Meanwhile, only several months after his arrival to Montenegro, Krsto Popoviƒá returned to Italy, where he served in the army of Montenegrin government in exile, advancing to level of commander, and later to level of brigadier. In 1929, from Belgium he sent a letter to King Alexander, in which he asked the King to pardon him from responsibility for the civil war in Montenegro from December 1918 until King Nikola's death. In this letter, he also proclaimed his loyalty to King Aleksandar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. On 18 October 1929, in the province of Liege, Belgium, the immigration police issued him a passport under number 9121, with visa number 94 in which he identified his nationality as Serb. King Alexander subsequently pardoned him and he returned to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, receiving a pension and living in retirement until World War II broke out and Popoviƒá organized his collaboration militia called the Lovƒáen Brigade. This militia was under the control or influence of the fascist Italian occupation force, and it waged war against the Partisans and the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (Chetniks). The official symbol of the paramilitary force was a green flag with the Petroviƒá coat of arms. Popoviƒá's vision was gaining Montenegrin independence through cooperation with Fascist Italy, which led to his conflicts with both Montenegrin Partisans and Chetniks. During the war his militia split; one group joined the Partisans, and others joined the Chetniks. Popoviƒá did not join either side. He was ambushed and killed in a shootout by OZNA agents , Veljko Milatoviƒá and ≈†aro Brajoviƒá in 1947. Mugo≈°a was also killed in the shootout while Milatoviƒá and Brajoviƒá survived. Personal life In 1905, he married Marija (n√©e Radojeviƒá) with whom he had five daughters and two sons Radovan and . His son Radovan died as a member of the Yugoslav Partisans in the Battle of Neretva while his son Nikola would later become a general in the Yugoslav People's Army and a recipient of the Order of the People's Hero.

Definition Claude L√©vi- Strauss originated this term,Claude L√©vi-Strauss, \\"Introduction √† l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss\\" in Mauss, Sociologie et Anthropologie, Paris, 1950. where he identifies terms like mana (magical mystical substance of which the magic is formed), or oomph (American slang term for flavor in the figurative sense) \\"to represent an undetermined quantity of signification, in itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning\\". Daniel Chandler defines the term as \\"a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified\\". As such a \\"floating signifier\\" may \\"mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean\\". Such a floating signifier‚Äîwhich is said to possess \\"symbolic value zero\\"‚Äînecessarily results to \\"allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it\\".Jeffrey Mehlman, The \\"Floating Signifier\\": From L√©vi-Strauss to Lacan, Yale French Studies, No. 48, French Freud: Structural Studies in Psychoanalysis. (1972), pp. 10‚Äì37. In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process. Uses and examples The notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as race and gender, as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to non-linguistic signs, such as the example of the Rorschach inkblot test. Roland Barthes, while not using the term \\"floating signifier\\" explicitly, referred specifically to non- linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a \\"floating chain of signifieds.\\" For example, the American flag is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as liberty. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive or negative significance. The concept is used in some more textual forms of postmodernism, which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, Jacques Derrida speaks of the \\"freeplay\\" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an \\"indefinite referral of signifier to signified.\\" See also *Glittering generality ReferencesSources * Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Introduction to Marcel Mauss, (1987) London: Routledge, 63-64.

Background XAS data is obtained by tuning the photon energy, using a crystalline monochromator, to a range where core electrons can be excited (0.1-100 keV). The edges are, in part, named by which core electron is excited: the principal quantum numbers n = 1, 2, and 3, correspond to the K-, L-, and M-edges, respectively. For instance, excitation of a 1s electron occurs at the K-edge, while excitation of a 2s or 2p electron occurs at an L-edge (Figure 1). There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data which are then thought of as separate spectroscopic techniques (Figure 2): # The absorption threshold determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied states: # The X-ray Absorption Near- Edge Structure (XANES) introduced in 1980 and later in 1983, also called NEXAFS (Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) which are dominated by core transitions to quasi bound states (multiple scattering resonances) for photoelectrons with kinetic energy in the range from 10 to 150 eV above the chemical potential, called \\"shape resonances\\" in molecular spectra since they are due to final states of short life-time degenerate with the continuum with the Fano line-shape. In this range multi-electron excitations and many-body final states in strongly correlated systems are relevant; # In the high kinetic energy range of the photoelectron, the scattering cross-section with neighbor atoms is weak, and the absorption spectra are dominated by EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), where the scattering of the ejected photoelectron of neighboring atoms can be approximated by single scattering events. In 1985, it was shown that multiple scattering theory can be used to interpret both XANES and EXAFS; therefore, the experimental analysis focusing on both regions is now called XAFS. XAS is a type of absorption spectroscopy from a core initial state with a well defined symmetry; therefore, the quantum mechanical selection rules select the symmetry of the final states in the continuum, which are usually a mixture of multiple components. The most intense features are due to electric-dipole allowed transitions (i.e. Œî‚Ñì = ¬± 1) to unoccupied final states. For example, the most intense features of a K-edge are due to core transitions from 1s ‚Üí p-like final states, while the most intense features of the L3-edge are due to 2p ‚Üí d-like final states. XAS methodology can be broadly divided into four experimental categories that can give complementary results to each other: metal K-edge, metal L-edge, ligand K-edge, and EXAFS. The most obvious means of mapping heterogeneous samples beyond x‚Äêray absorption contrast is through elemental analysis by x‚Äêray fluorescence, akin to EDX methods in electron microscopy.  Applications  XAS is a technique used in different scientific fields including molecular and condensed matter physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, earth science, and biology. In particular, its unique sensitivity to the local structure, as compared to x-ray diffraction, have been exploited for studying: * Amorphous solids and liquid systems * Solid solutions * Doping and ion implantation materials for electronics * Local distortions of crystal lattices * Organometallic compounds * Metalloproteins * Metal clusters * Catalysis * Vibrational dynamics * Ions in solutions * Speciation of elements * Liquid water and aqueous solutions * Used to detect bone fracture * Used to determine the concentration of any liquid in any tank  See also  * X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) * X-ray emission spectroscopy  References  External links * * Category:Materials science Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Environmental chemistry Category:Synchrotron-related techniques Absorb ","title":"X-ray absorption spectroscopy"},{"id":"2745368","text":"Strategic essentialism, a major concept in postcolonial theory, was introduced in the 1980s by the Indian literary critic and theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. It refers to a political tactic in which minority groups, nationalities, or ethnic groups mobilize on the basis of shared gendered, cultural, or political identity to represent themselves. While strong differences may exist between members of these groups, and amongst themselves they engage in continuous debates, it is sometimes advantageous for them to temporarily \\"essentialize\\" themselves and to bring forward their group identity in a simplified way to achieve certain goals, such as equal rights or antiglobalization. Spivak's understanding of the term was first introduced in the context of cultural negotiations, never as an anthropological category. In her 2008 book Other Asias, Spivak disavowed the term, indicating her dissatisfaction with how the term has been deployed in nationalist enterprises to promote (non-strategic) essentialism. The concept also comes up regularly in queer theory, feminist theory, deaf studies, and specifically in the work of Luce Irigaray, who refers to it as mimesis.

History Originally named Long Lea, the village of Langley Mill was a major employer throughout the mid 1900s with many companies including The Flour Mill, Langley Mill Pottery, Aristoc & Co Ltd, G.R. Turners, and Vic Hallam Limited. Aristoc, originally on North Street, manufactured silk stockings within the village. During the Second World War, when its manufacturing included parachutes and inflatable dinghies for the war effort, it became a target for German bombers. The buildings have been replaced with housing. The now closed Victory greyhound racing track was opened on ground adjoining the New Inn on 19 April 1930. As a flapping (independent) track it was not affiliated to the sports governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club. The principal distances for greyhound racing was 330 and 500 yards; the track also held whippet races. International superbike champion Ron Haslam came from Langley Mill. He won international motorcycle titles in the 1970s and early 1980s. Geography Langley Mill is at the junction of the Erewash Canal, the Cromford Canal, and the Nottingham Canal. The village, part of the Aldercar and Langley Mill parish, is on the border of Nottinghamshire, and is conjoined to the settlements of Aldercar (to the north) and Heanor (to the south-west), with the neighbouring village of Langley in the Heanor and Loscoe parish. Across the River Erewash is the Nottinghamshire town of Eastwood. The Erewash was the Aldercar and Langley Mill boundary; this moved in 1992 to the A610, the Erewash Canal basin becoming part of Langley Mill.Local Government Boundary Commission for England Report No. 599 The A610 ¬£2.5 million Langley Mill Bypass was opened on 8 September 1983, by the leader of Derbyshire County Council. Community National chain outlets in the village include KFC, Home Bargains and McDonald's. There are two supermarkets: Asda, which includes one of the village's two petrol filling stations, and Lidl. The second petrol station, owned by a petroleum company, includes a Starbucks outlet. The village's Langley Mill railway station is on the Erewash Valley Line.

It did not have general jurisdiction, but had various jurisdictions conferred by particular statutes. It was responsible for reviewing decisions of some New South Wales government departments, for hearing discrimination complaints referred by the President of the New South Wales Anti- Discrimination Board, for hearing complaints about professional misconduct and for hearing disputes over commercial leases. It consisted of an Appeal Panel, a General Division and five specialist Divisions: Community Services Division (previously the Community Services Appeals Tribunal), Revenue Division, Equal Opportunity Division, Retail Leases Division and Legal Services Division. The Internal Appeal Panel heard appeals from the Divisions and an External Appeal Panel heard appeals from other bodies. The Tribunal was conducted in a less formal manner than a court and was presided over by either a single member or a panel of three members (depending on the Division). Access was cheaper than to a court and in some cases free of charge. As with other tribunals in New South Wales, the ADT encouraged parties to negotiate their own resolution through mediation prior to any hearing. The resolution devised by the parties could then be made official at the hearing by a member of the Tribunal. If this failed, the Tribunal could make a decision which would be legally binding upon the parties.

In those days coffee was exported to other parts of the world in roasted or baked form so that no one could grow their own and were forced to buy from the Yemenis. He brought seven beans because the number 7 is considered sacred in Islam. The coffee plants were then raised at the place that bears his name. Popular Indian lore says that on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the 16th century Baba Budan, a revered Sufi saint from Karnataka state, discovered for himself the wonders of coffee. In his eagerness to grow coffee himself at home, he smuggled seven coffee beans out of the Yemeni port of Mocha which were hidden in his beard . On his return home, he planted the beans on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hills in Chikkamagaluru district, Mysore State (present day Karnataka).

Sammy Hagar, David Lauser, and Michael Anthony also comprise the harmony-singing rock band Los Tres Gusanos, with whom Vic Johnson often performs as a guest. Hagar's most recent album, Cosmic Universal Fashion, is a solo album and not a Waboritas album; this is his first since he began using The Waboritas as a backing band and thus unusual; as on Hagar's last four studio albums he has played with The Wabos on disc and credited the album to both of them. However, the Waboritas are still the main musicians on most of the album's tracks with guest appearances similar to the Marching to Mars format.

Born in Gowran, County Kilkenny, Phelan first played competitive hurling whilst at school in Kilkenny CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut in the 1938 championship. Langton went on to play a key part for Kilkenny during a lean era for the county, and won two All-Ireland medals and seven Leinster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team for fourteen years, Langton won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he won four championship medal with √âire √ìg. Langton's career tally of 15 goals and 146 points was a record score for a Kilkenny player which stood for twenty years when it was surpassed by Eddie Keher. Throughout his career Langton made 43 championship appearances. His retirement came following Kilkenny's defeat by Wexford in the 1954 championship. Langton is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at left wing-forward on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000. Playing careerCollege= Langton first came to hurling prominence with the Kilkenny CBS in the inter-colleges series of games. In 1936 he was a key member of the college team that made history by reaching their first provincial final. A comprehensive 3‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì1 defeat of Blackrock College gave Langton a Leinster medal. =Club= Langton played his club hurling with √âire √ìg and enjoyed much success in a career that spanned three decades. His arrival on the inter-county scene marked an upturn in the fortunes of the club. After losing the county decider to Carrickshock in 1938, both sides faced off at the same stage of the championship the following year. A narrow 3‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì5 victory gave Langton his first championship medal. √âire √ìg failed to retain their championship crown in 1940, while Carrickshock defeated the team in the county showpiece in 1942. Langton lined out in his fourth championship decider in 1944, with old rivals and five-in-a-row hopefuls Carrickshock providing the opposition once again. A 7‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì4 trouncing gave Langton a second championship medal. √âire √ìg reached the final again in 1945 and were presented with the chance of making their own piece of history by retaining the title. Once again Carrickshock stood in the way, however, a 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì10 draw was the result. The subsequent replay was more conclusive, with Langton collecting a third championship medal following a 4‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì7 victory. Three-in-a-row proved beyond √âire √ìg, however, the club reached the final again in 1947. Tullaroan were the opponents, however, a 3‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì13 victory gave Langton a fourth and final championship medal. Langton's swansong for the club was in 1950, when √âire √ìg were defeated by Dicksboro in a replay of the championship decider. =Minor= Langton first played for Kilkenny as a member of the county's minor team in 1935. It was a successful year as \\"the Cats\\" reached the final of the provincial series. Laois provided the opposition on that occasion, however, they proved no match for Kilkenny. A 7‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì1 trouncing gave Langton a first Leinster medal. The subsequent All- Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions on a 4‚Äì2 to 3‚Äì3 score line. It was Langton's first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny dominated the provincial minor championship again in 1936. A 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì1 defeat of Dublin gave Langton a second Leinster medal. He later lined out in a second successive All-Ireland decider, with Cork standing in the way of Kilkenny retaining their title. In a close game Langton proved the hero by scoring the winning point in a narrow 2‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì3 victory. It was his second All-Ireland medal. =Senior=Early success Langton made his senior debut during Kilkenny's unsuccessful 1938 campaign. In 1939 Kilkenny reclaimed the provincial title. A 2‚Äì12 to 4‚Äì3 victory gave Langton his first Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Kilkenny against Cork. In one of the most iconic championship deciders of all-time, played on the day that World War II broke out, the climax of the game was played in a ferocious thunder storm. While a draw looked likely as the hour drew to a close, Paddy Phelan sent a seventy-yard free in towards the Cork goalmouth. The sliotar was gobbled up by the defence and cleared, but only as far as Jimmy Kelly who sent it straight over the bar for a one-point lead. Immediately after the puck-out the referee blew the whistle and Kilkenny were victorious on a score line of 2‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì3. The win gave Langton an All-Ireland medal in the senior grade. In spite of being in only his third year of senior hurling, Langton was appointed captain of the Kilkenny team in 1940. He secured a second successive Leinster medal that year, as Kilkenny retained their provincial crown following a 3‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì5 defeat of Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1940 brought Kilkenny and Limerick together for the last great game between the two outstanding teams of the decade. Early in the second-half Kilkenny took a four-point lead, however, once Mick Mackey was deployed at midfield he proceeded to dominate the game. Limerick hung on to win the game on a score line of 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì7. Narrow defeats Kilkenny surrendered their provincial crown to Dublin in 1942, however, both sides faced each other in the provincial decider again in 1943. A 3‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì6 victory gave Langton his third Leinster medal. On 1 August 1943 Kilkenny faced Antrim in the All- Ireland semi-final. While many expected Langton's side to brush the Ulster challenge aside, a record crowd at Corrigan Park witnessed one of the biggest shocks in the history of the championship. Danny McAllister, Kevin Armstrong and Joe Mullan got the goals as Antrim triumphed by 3‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì6. In 1945 Langton won a fourth Leinster medal as Kilkenny trounced the reigning champions Dublin by 5‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì4. Kilkenny later faced Tipperary in the All- Ireland final on 2 September 1945. Tipperary played into a strong sun in the opening half and built up a commanding lead. Kilkenny staged a comeback in the second half, however, Tipp still won the game by 5‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì6. Langton added a fifth Leinster medal to his collection in 1946 as Kilkenny had a narrow 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì12 defeat of Dublin. Old rivals Cork provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1946. While some had written off Cork's chances, they took an interval lead of four points. With ten minutes remaining Cork's lead was reduced to just two points, however, goals by Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly secured a 7‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì8 victory and a third All-Ireland final defeat for Langton. A second All-Ireland Kilkenny made it three provincial titles in succession in 1947, however, Langton missed victory over Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 7 September 1947 was a repeat of the previous year with Cork providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All-Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Joe Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and Kilkenny were the champions by 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in the championship decider, while it also resulted in Langton winning a second All-Ireland medal. After two years of decline, Kilkenny were back in 1950. A narrow 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì11 defeat of new arrivals Wexford gave Langton a sixth Leinster medal. He later lined out in his sixth All-Ireland final on 3 September 1950, with age-old rivals Tipperary providing the opposition. In a dull affair, Tipp looked to be heading for victory when Se√°n Kenny scored a goal to put the team four points ahead with just one minute left to play. Kilkenny fought back and a Jimmy Kelly goal from the puck-out reduced the deficit to just one point again. As \\"the Cats\\" were about to launch one final attack, the referee blew the whistle and Tipperary had won by 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8. Decline In 1953 Kilkenny lined out in the provincial decider once again. A narrow 1‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì5 defeat of Wexford gave Langton his seventh and final Leinster medal. Kilkenny later faced Galway in the All-Ireland semi- final, however, Galway pulled off a shock victory by 3‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì10. Langton retired from inter-county hurling following Kilkenny's defeat by Wexford in the Leinster semi-final in 1954. =Inter-provincial= Langton also had the honour of lining out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut in 1940 and was a regular on the team until 1954. His inter- provincial career coincided with a prolonged period of dominance by Munster and a breakthrough by Connacht. In 1941 Langton played in his second inter- provincial final, with Munster providing the opposition once again. A narrow 2‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4 victory gave Langton his first Railway Cup medal, while it denied the southern province a remarkable fifth successive title. After a series of defeats in the intervening period, Langton lined out in his final inter- provincial final in 1954. A 0‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì5 defeat of Munster gave him his second and final Railway Cup medal. Recognition In retirement from playing, Langton came to be regarded as one of the greatest hurlers of all-time. Thirty years after he last lined out with Kilkenny, he was doubly honoured in the GAA's centenary year in 1984. That year he was presented with the All-Time All-Star award, while he was also chosen at left wing-forward on the Hurling Team of the Century. He retained that position on the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000.

It was established in 1849 originally in Charlotte, a newly established village for recaptives. It is claimed to be the oldest girls school in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, the school has consistently outperformed its peers in terms of academic achievement, making it the most prestigious secondary school for girls in Sierra Leone. The school's Principal is currently Mrs OPhelia Morrison (n√©e Barber). School history Annie Walsh Memorial School was named after an Irish or English girl whose dream was to become a missionary to Africa. Unfortunately Annie Walsh died in a tragic accident at the age of 20. Annie Walsh's last few days are described in 'Dear Annie: A Brief Memorial' published for private circulation and undated. On 19 January 1855 she returned from a week in Bath. On 23 January she went, with her father, to a meeting of the Irish Church Missions, despite having the symptoms of a cold. On 24 and 25 January she remained in bed, apparently because of the cold. On 27 January a doctor was called. The next day, Sunday, inflammation of the lungs was apparent. Leeches were applied and again on Monday. On that Monday morning she spoke with her parents - 'that conversation had all the air of a final interview between friends that parting for longish voyage'. She died at 4.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 January 1855. Her parents provided substantial funding for the school when it was started, by the Church Missionary Society, which ultimately became the Annie Walsh Memorial School. The present location is a new location as the school quickly outgrew its original building. =Past principals= *Miss Julia Sass (1849‚Äì1869) *Mrs. Caiger (1869‚Äì1870) *Ms. Caspari, (1875-1878) *Ms. Bisset (1894-1917) *Miss Winifred Hamblet (19**-1930) *Miss Pole (1930‚Äì1954) *Miss Colebeck (1954‚Äì1961) *Mrs. Lati Hyde-Forster (1961‚Äì1975) *Mrs. Europa Wilson-Agwu (1975‚Äì1985) *Madame Gracie Williams (1985‚Äì1995) *Mrs A.

(Middle Brahmi script): 16px12px22px15px15px15px12px13px22px 18px12px16px22px SvƒÅmisya Mahak·π£atrapasya ≈öudasasya \\"Of the Lord and Great Satrap ≈öudƒÅsa\\" Sodasa (Middle Brahmi script: 22px12px17px ≈öodƒÅsa, also 22px12px17px ≈öudƒÅsa) was an Indo-Scythian Northern Satrap and ruler of Mathura during the later part of the 1st century BCE or the early part of 1st century CE. He was the son of Rajuvula, the Great Satrap of the region from Taxila to Mathura. He is mentioned in the Mathura lion capital. Rule Sodasa reigned during the 1st century CE, and also took the title of Great Satrap at one point, probably in the area of Mathura as well, but possibly under the suzerainty of the Indo-Parthian king Gondophares. At the same time the Indo-Scythian Bhadayasa ruled in the eastern Punjab. There were numerous cultural and political exchanges between the Indo-Scythians of the northwest and those of Mathura. Sodasa may have been a contemporary of the Western Kshatrapa Nahapana and the Indo-Parthian Gondophares. The Indo- Parthians may have destabilized Indo-Scythian rule in northern India, but there are no traces of Indo-Parthian presence in Mathura. Sodasa may have been displaced in Mathura by the Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises, who erected a throne in his name in Mathura, but nothing is known of these interactions. At Mathura, Sodasa is the last of the Indo-Scythians to have left coins. Later, under Kanishka, son of Vima Kadphises, the Great Satrap Kharapallana and the Satrap Vanaspara are said to have ruled in Mathura with Kanishka as suzerain, pointing to continued Indo-Scythian rule under Kushan suzerainty as least until the time of Kanishka.Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India, Ram Sharan Sharma, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1991 p.295 Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen New Age International, 1999, p.198 Foreign Influence on Ancient India, Krishna Chandra Sagar, Northern Book Centre, 1992 p.167 Source: \\"A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum.

The Mirzapur village inscription (in the vicinity of Mathura) refers to the erection of a water tank by Mulavasu and his consort Kausiki during the reign of Sodasa, assuming the title of \\"Svami (Lord) Mahakshatrapa (Great Satrap)\\".Buddhist art of MathurƒÅ , Ramesh Chandra Sharma, Agam, 1984 Page 26 The Mathura lion capital mentions the reign of his father and predecessor Rajuvula as Mahaksatrapa while Sodasa is referred to as Ksatrapa. Sodasa probably also dedicated the Mora Well Inscription, were he presents himself as the son of Rajuvula. A large stone slab, the Kankali Tila tablet of Sodasa, discovered in Kankali in the area of Mathura, bears a three-line epigraph mentioning that in the year 42 or 72 of \\"Lord Mahaksatrapa Sodasa,\\" a monument for worship was set up by a certain Amohini. A recent date for Sodasa's reign was given as 15 CE, meaning that the regnal date of the inscription would start from the Vikrama era (Bikrami calendar (starting in 57 BCE)+72=15 CE).Image Problems: The Origin and Development of the Buddha's Image in Early South Asia Robert Daniel DeCaroli, University of Washington Press, 2015 p.205 This would put the long reign of his father Rajuvula in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE, which is probable.Indian Studies, Volume 7, Ramakrishna Maitra, 1966 p.67 Another inscription of Sodasa in Mathura records the gifts of a Brahman named Gajavara of the Segrava-gotra during the time of Saudasa the Great Satrap of the lord (paramount, whose name is lost) of tanks called Kshayawada, as well as a western tank, a well, a garden, and a pillar.Report For The Year 1871-72 Volume III, Alexander Cunningham File:MathuraLionCapital.JPGThe Mathura lion capital mentions Sodasa as \\"Satrap\\", while his father Rajuvula was \\"Great Satrap\\".

Coinage Sodasa ruled in the Mathura portion of the Northern Satraps territory. Sodasa's coins have been found in Mathura only, suggesting that he only ruled over the Mathura region. They do not follow traditional Indo-Scythian coinage patterns, but rather the designs of local rulers of Mathura, and are only made of lead and copper alloy. The legends only use the Indian Brahmi script, whether Saodasa's father Rajuvula had used coins derived from the Indo-Greeks, with legends in Greek and Kharoshthi. This suggests that Sodasa had significantly integrated into the local Indian culture. Sodasa's coins usually show on the obverse a standing female and tree-like symbol, with the legend \\"Mahakatapasa putasa Khatapasa Sodasa\\", i.e., \\"Satrap Sodasa, son of the Great Satrap\\". On the reverse appears a Lakshmi with elephants pouring water over her.Catalogue Of The Coins In The Indian Museum Calcutta. Vol.1 by Smith, Vincent A. p.196 Three types of legends are known, with one coin type of Sodasa bearing the legend \\"son of Rajuvula\\": * \\"Satrap Sodasa, son of the Great Satrap\\" (Mahakhatapasa putasa khatapasa ≈õodasasa followed by a svastika) * \\"Satrap Sodasa, son of Rajuvula\\" (Svastika followed by Rajuvula putasa khatapasa ≈õodasasa)The Dynastic art of the Kushans, Rosenfield, University of California Press, 1967 p.136 * \\"Great Satrap Sodasa\\" (Mahakhatapasa ≈õodasasa) File:Sodasa.jpgCoin of Sodasa.

Sculptural styles The abundance of dedicatory inscriptions in the name of Sodasa (eight of them are known, often on sculptural works), and the fact that Sodasa is known through his coinage as well as through his relations with other Indo- Scythian rulers whose dates are known, means that Sodasa functions as a historic marker to ascertain the sculptural styles at Mathura during his rule, in the first half of the 1st century CE. The next historial marker corresponds to the reign of Kanishka under the Kushans, whose reign began circa 127 CE. The Kankali Tila tablet of Sodasa is one of those sculptural works directly inscribed in the name of Sodasa. Another one is the Katra torana fragment.Photograph visible p.396 in Photograph (front) Photograph (reverse) The sculptural styles at Mathura during the reign of Sodasa are quite distinctive, and significantly different from the style of the previous period circa 50 BCE, or the styles of the later period of the Kushan Empire in the 2nd century CE. Stylistically similar works can then be dated to the same period of the reign of Sodasa. =Early representation of the Buddha= The \\"Isapur Buddha\\" from Mathura, probably the earliest known representation of the Buddha (possibly together with Buddha statues found in Barikot in Swat), on a railing post, is dated to circa 15 CE under the reign of Sodasa. Another depiction of the Buddha from the same period apppears in the Bimaran casket. Paleography The inscriptions in the name of Sodasa are also an important marker for the paleography of the Brahmi script, the shape of the Brahmi letters having evolved in time, and also having varied depending on the regions.

He is often surnamed al-Fihri in reference to the Banu Fihri, a clan connected to the Quraysh. His descendants would be known as the  øUqbids or Fihrids.  ªUqbah is the founder of the cultural city of Kairouan in Tunisia.  ªUqbah accompanied Amr in his initial capture of cities in North Africa starting with Barca, then proceeding to Tripolitania in 644. In 670 now the emir or commander,  ªUqbah led an Arab army to North Africa, crossing the Egyptian deserts, and setting up military posts at regular intervals along his route. In a region of what is now Tunisia, he established the town now called Kairouan (meaning \\"camp\\" or \\"caravanserai\\" in Persian) about 99 miles south of present-day Tunis, which he used as a base for further operations. According to one legend, one of  ªUqbah's soldiers stumbled across a golden goblet buried in the sands. It was recognized as one that had disappeared from Mecca some years before, and when it was dug out of the sand a spring appeared, with waters said to come from the same source as those of the sacred Zamzam Well in Mecca.Places of peace and power - Kairouan, Tunisia - Sacredsites.com This story led to Kairouan becoming a place of pilgrimage and then a holy city (\\"the Mecca of the Maghreb\\") and the most important city in North Africa. In 683  ªUqbah was ambushed and killed by the Berber Christian king Kusaila after winning the Battle of Vescera. He died beside his hated rival, Abu al-Muhajir Dinar. His armies evacuated Kairouan and withdrew to Barca, though it was recaptured in 688. Al-Watiya Air Base in Libya is also known as \\"Okba ibn Nafa Air Base\\" after him. Historical accounts Great Mosque of Kairouan Most of the accounts describing Arab conquests of North Africa in general and Uqba's conquests in particular date back to at least two centuries after the conquests have happened. One of the earliest reports come from the Andalucian chronicler Ibn Idhari in his Al-Bayan al-Mughrib. In it, Ibn Idhari describes the moment when Uqba reached the Atlantic Ocean, where he allegedly said, \\"O God, if the sea had not prevented me, I would have galloped on for ever like Alexander the Great, upholding your faith and fighting the unbelievers!\\"Ibn Idhari, Al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi akhbar al-Andalus, 1 ed. G. S. Colin and E. L√©vi-Proven√ßal, 2 vols. (Leiden 1949) p. 27 Edward Gibbon, referring to Uqba ibn Nafi as Akbah, gives him the title \\"conqueror of Africa,\\" beginning his story when he \\"marched from Damascus at the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many thousand Barbarians.\\" He then marched into North Africa. Gibbon continues: \\"It would be difficult, nor is it necessary, to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah.\\" On the North African coast, \\"the well-known titles of Bugia, and Tangier define the more certain limits of the Saracen victories.\\" Gibbon then tells the story of Akbah's conquest of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana: Although much scholarship on the life and conquests of ibn Nafi are available, most have not been translated from their original Arabic into English or French.

In many cases for film or television, actual stations are used for the purpose of filming. Fictional London Underground stations Aldwych in London * Belgravia ‚Äì 1960 film Piccadilly Third Stop. * Blackwall ‚Äì featured in the TV drama series London's Burning. * Bloomsbury ‚Äì 1934 film Bulldog Jack. *:The film features a chase/fight scene in a disused Bloomsbury station on the Central line, connected to the British Museum by a secret tunnel. A map is seen on the wall of the train in the climax scene, involving a race through the tunnels on a runway tube train. The map lists the stations between Ealing Broadway and Liverpool Street from top to bottom, and includes \\"Bloomsbury\\", between the now-closed British Museum and Chancery Lane, in place of Holborn, as well as a fictional High Holborn station located in- between Chancery Lane and Post Office (now St Paul's). In an absence of continuity, the map later changes to another, where the order is reversed, with Liverpool Street at the top and, \\"Western Avenue\\" is at the bottom. This different map includes a number of fictional stations in place of the real station names. It now reads: Liverpool Street, Bank, Post Office (now St Paul's), Holborn, Bloomsbury, New Oxford Street, Langham (presumably a reference to Langham Place near Oxford Circus), Cavendish Street, Cumberland (presumably a reference to the Cumberland Gate of Hyde Park), Gloucester Gate, Campden Hill, Kensington Park, Holland Road, White City (which was yet to be built in 1935), North Perivale, East Perivale, and Western Avenue, where the chase terminates. The station names at the end of this fictional version of the Central line reflect the locations of some of the stations that would later form the extension of the Central line towards West Ruislip. Bloomsbury was the initial name considered for British Museum station but was dropped before the station opened. * Camden Road ‚Äì Appeared in the film The Gentle Gunman; footage later reused in the 1969 ITV television programme Strange Report. * Charnham ‚Äì TV soap Family Affairs. * Crouch End ‚Äì 2004 film Shaun of the Dead featured a deleted scene (included on the DVD). *:The title character (played by Simon Pegg) attempted to catch a tube to work from the station only to find it closed. A special 'Crouch End' tube station sign was made for the film scene and, according to Pegg's DVD commentary, is now mounted in his own bedroom. Under an abandoned part of the Underground's 1930s Northern Heights plan the real life Crouch End main line station would have transferred to the Northern line. The station closed in 1954 without the transfer taking place (see also: List of former and unopened London Underground stations). * Duchess Street ‚Äì featured in the 1932 Jack Hulbert film Love on Wheels. * Ginners Park - station used as a shelter in an air raid in the 1942 film Unpublished Story starring Richard Greene and Valerie Hobson. * Haggerston ‚Äì Appeared as an abandoned, sub-surface station in The New Statesman episode, \\"Waste Not Want Not\\". *:It should not be confused with the real Haggerston railway station in East London. This station is on an elevated section of the London Overground; it re-opened in 2010, but was disused when the programme was made. * Hanover Street ‚Äì 1979 film Hanover Street, starring Harrison Ford. Walt Disney Studios, Disneyland Resort Paris * Hayne Street ‚Äì Mock-up found in the Disneyland Paris Disney Studios \\"Studio Tram Tour\\" inspired by the film Reign of Fire (2002); the film did not include a completed/named station. * Hickory Road ‚Äì in Hickory Dickory Dock, Agatha Christie novel. *:Hickory Dickory Dock, one of Agatha Christie's detective stories featuring Hercule Poirot, is set in Hickory Road in London. A version of the story was made by Carnival Films for London Weekend Television's \\"Poirot\\" series. First broadcast in February 1995, the start of the programme sees the main characters alighting from an Underground train and exiting from Hickory Road station. The climax of the programme also involves a chase around the fictional station. * High Street - 1954 film The Good Die Young with Laurence Harvey. Locations in Barbican/Farringdon area. * Hobbs End ‚Äì 1958‚Äì59 BBC serial Quatermass and the Pit and the 1967 film version. *:Featured a tube station called Hobbs End. The station is located at the end of the non-existent 'Hobbs Lane'. One shot shows a new street nameplate reading \\"Hobbs Lane\\", and indicating it as being in the W10 postal district. Next to it a much older nameplate reading \\"Hob's Lane\\". Hob is an old name for the Devil. The name Hobbs End has more recently been used by London Underground as one of the stations on The Model Railway training simulator at the West Ashfield Underground station training facility.IanVisits: London Underground‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret‚Äù tube station \\"Oh, and I slightly squealed when I noticed one of the stations is called Hobbs End.

In the film, Columbus goes to a tube station and asks for a train to America but is told he can go only as far as Catford. Part of a modified tube map is shown which shows the fictitious tube stations Lewisham, Ladywell, Edge of the World and Catford on the East London Section of the Metropolitan line south from New Cross station. There is an actual part of the mainline Mid-Kent Railway that interchanges with New Cross station, and the stations are, southwards in order: St. John's, Lewisham, Ladywell and Catford Bridge (Catford on a different line interchanges with the latter). * Marble Hill ‚Äì seen at the beginning of the 1991 Poirot: Wasps' Nest, adapted from the novel by Agatha Christie.

It is fictionally located between Westminster and St. James's Park, underneath the Houses of Parliament. In the story, the station was partially constructed but never opened, being similar to North End. The scenes were shot at Aldwych Underground station. * Sun Hill ‚Äì Long-running ITV police drama, The Bill. Station roundel prop of Union Street, in situ at Holborn tramway station * Union Street ‚Äì featured in the 2008 film The Escapist and filmed on location in Holborn tramway station. Altered versions of Harry Beck's 1941 map were produced for the film, showing the station located between Borough and Elephant & Castle, close to the position of London's real Union Street. Vauxhall Cross, the fictional Tube station featured in James Bond films * Vauxhall Cross ‚Äì 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day. *:A supposed closed station on a disused branch of the Piccadilly line (similar to Aldwych) that runs south of the river to Vauxhall Cross, in the vicinity of the MI6 building. In fact, the Piccadilly line does not cross the river at all, although Vauxhall on the Victoria line is within about 100 metres. * Walford East ‚Äì BBC TV soap Eastenders. *:The BBC soap opera EastEnders created Walford East Underground station, which replaces Bromley-by-Bow on the EastEnders tube map, to allow the locals to escape \\"up West\\" for a night out. Neither Walford nor the tube station exists ‚Äì except on the EastEnders set. Most of the platform and train shots are filmed at East Finchley. A station at Walford West has also been referenced by characters in the show. * Wells Lane ‚Äì BBC Spooks Series 5 Episode 7 *:An episode of the BBC series Spooks (broadcast 23 October 2006) featured a fictional disused Underground station called Wells Lane. * West Ashfield ‚Äì see West Ashfield Underground station. * Westbourne Oak ‚Äì the 2014 film Paddington.

Cathedral Heights is a real D.C. neighborhood, but there is no Cathedral Heights station; the closest Metro stations to the neighborhood are Tenleytown-American University station to the north and Cleveland Park station to the east. *Farragut ‚Äì The first season of Showtime's Homeland contains a scene outside of D.C.'s Farragut station, portrayed as a Metro stop on the red and orange lines. In fact, there is no Farragut Station. There is a Farragut North station, on the red line, and a Farragut West station, on the orange, blue, and silver lines. The scene was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina. *Georgetown ‚Äì In No Way Out, a chase scene is depicted as passing through a Georgetown station in the Washington Metro. There is no Georgetown station; the nearest Metro station to Georgetown is Foggy Bottom. The interior of the station depicted in the movie was in the Baltimore Metro Subway and not Washington's.

A. rubescens, found in Europe and eastern North America, and A. novinupta in western North America. Both their scientific and common names are derived from the propensity of their flesh to turn pink on bruising, or cutting. The mushroom is edible and tasty, sought for in several European countries. Readily recognizable by its pinkish color on the bottom of the stem. It is avoided by novice mushroomers as without knowledge it can be confused with deadly poisonous species. Description The European blusher has a reddish-brown convex pileus (cap), that is up to 15 cm across, and strewn with small cream-coloured warts. It is sometimes covered with an ochre- yellow flush which can be washed by the rain. The flesh of the mushroom is white, becoming pink when bruised or exposed to air. This is a key feature in differentiating it from the poisonous false blusher or panther cap (Amanita pantherina), whose flesh does not. The stipe (stem) is white with flushes of the cap colour, and grows to a height of up to 15 cm. The gills are white and free of the stem, and display red spots when damaged. The ring is striate (i.e. has ridges) on its upper side, another feature distinguishing it from Amanita pantherina. The spores are white, ovate, amyloid, and approximately 8 by 5 ¬µm in size. The flavour of the uncooked flesh is mild, but has a faint acrid aftertaste. The smell is not strong. The mushroom is often attacked by insects. = Distribution and habitat = bottom It is common throughout much of Europe and eastern North America (in the latter region there are at least three different species that fit into the name Amanita amerirubescens) growing on poor soils as well as in deciduous and coniferous woodlands, appearing from June through to November in the UK. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe. In eastern North America, Amanita rubescens is frequently parasitized by Hypomyces hyalinus. Parasitized fruiting bodies are extremely difficult to recognize unless they occur in conjunction with healthy ones, although some retain the \\"blushing\\" characteristic of the species.Michael Kuo, Hypomyces hyalinus, MushroomExpert.com, Oct. 2003. Amanita novinupta A species found in the western U.S., only recently formally described and until then frequently misidentified as A. rubescens; see MykoWeb - Fungi of California - Amanita novinupta for details. Other species Closely related species include Amanita brunneolocularis, A. orsonii, A. rubescens var. alba, and A. rubescens var. congolensis.  Uses  Both A. rubescens and A. novinupta are edible when cooked. European Amanita rubescens is known to contain a hemolytic protein in its raw state; it is unknown whether North American A. rubescens and A. novinupta are similarly toxic when eaten raw. This protein is destroyed by cooking, so it is important to cook this mushroom before eating. Amanita novinupta is highly regarded as a choice edible in the region in which it is found. However, the edibility of blusher species other than A. rubescens and A. novinupta has not been established and experimentation is not advised.

The school was opened in 1839 (as the \\"Monrovia Seminary\\"), making it one of the oldest European-style schools in Africa. It has produced many of Liberia's leaders. Alumni include Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman elected as president in an African state, and Liberian Vice President Joseph Boakai. History Melville B. Cox (1799-1833) Main Building (c.1910) The College of West Africa's main building is named in memory of Melville B. Cox, a Methodist missionary from Edenton Street United Methodist Church, who was a founder of the college. A historic stained glass window in the College's auditorium reads: \\"Though a thousand fall, let not Africa be given up\\". The Cox family was active in the Methodist Society from its beginning. In March 1821 Melville Cox was licensed to preach by the Kennebec District Conference of Maine, United States, and received his first pastoral appointment in 1822. Ill health, however, forced Cox to return to Maine in 1825. Cox moved south in November 1826 to avoid the Maine winter and hopefully recover his health. He preached on and off until 1828, when he married and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. During the next two years he was editor of The Itinerant in Baltimore. After his wife died in December 1830, Cox returned to the ministry, although his health was still fragile. By mid-1831 Cox had become interested in missions. The Methodist Episcopal Church had formed a Missionary Society in 1819, but no suitable foreign missionary had yet been found. Cox offered himself to Bishop Elijah Hedding for the South American field. Instead, Hedding asked if he would go to Liberia, a colony established on Africa's west coast by the American Colonization Society for resettlement of free American blacks and newly freed American slaves. Cox sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on November 6, 1832, arriving in Monrovia on March 8, 1833. He was the first Methodist missionary to Liberia. He envisioned establishing a mission house, a school, a seminary for young Christian converts, and churches. He purchased a house formerly the property of the Basel Missionary Society from Switzerland. He established the Methodist Church in Liberia as a branch of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the U.S. He held camp meetings, started regular worship and Sunday school, and developed mission strategies all within a few weeks of his arrival. He contracted malaria and died of the disease on July 21, 1833 after three months of decline. Such tropical diseases had a high mortality rate among new American settlers to the colony. Cox's story inspired many in the early missions movement. Before he sailed for Liberia, Cox told a friend that should he die in Africa, the friend should write his epitaph. What, asked the friend, should the epitaph say? Cox replied, \\"Let a thousand die before Africa be given up.\\" Other Methodist mission successes In 1816 the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church institutionalized the course of study for candidates to the ministry. A conference seminary was needed in Liberia to meet this mandate. The Monrovia Seminary was established for this purpose in 1839. (Its program was expanded to preparatory classes and it was later renamed as the College of West Africa in later years.) The Rev. Jabez A. Burton was commissioned as the Seminary's first principal immediately after its establishment; he served until his death in August 1842. The Rev. Alexander P. Camphor was appointed principal in 1896. At the end of his first year of administration, he began the re-organization of the seminary to include a high school. In 1897 Camphor presented his plans to the Liberian Annual conference, where he gained a majority vote for the adaptation of the Monrovia Seminary to the College of West Africa. Its charter included the following: that it be the one central and leading school of all Methodist educational institutions; providing degree-granting courses in ministerial training while also providing a high school education; that dormitory facilities be established for male and female students. For the next ten years Rev. Camphor worked to implement this new plan. His first project was construction of the school building that was named the Cox Memorial Auditorium (for Melville B. Cox, in recognition of his mission work.) In 1904, by an act of the Liberian Legislature, the college was officially recognized and confirmed as the College of West Africa. By 1925, as a result of personnel and financial difficulties, and political interference, the College was forced to close its collegiate department. It continued to function as a secondary school with the appointment of the Rev. R. L. Embree as its new president. Rev. Embree reorganized the curriculum and programs of the school to continue the college preparatory courses, as a high school. He continued the building project started by Rev. Camphor. As a result of his efforts, ground-breaking ceremonies were held on May 25, 1927. Construction was completed and the building ready for dedication on March 7, 1933. The name ‚ÄúCollege of West Africa‚Äù was retained because of its charter to serve as a degree-granting institution. It later added a curriculum and classes to grant associate degrees in Business and Finance. The school is 100% owned and operated by the Liberian Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church.

Initially noted for using two chassis rails and having the body suspended from the rails by leather straps, the term continued in use for enclosed formal carriages with two seats after the suspension system changed from leather straps to steel springs. Origin 1760s. Moscow Historical Museum The carriage was designed around 1660 or 1670 by a Piedmontese architect commissioned by the General quartermaster to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. The Elector used the carriage to travel from Berlin, Brandenburg's capital, to the French capital of Paris, where his carriage created a sensation. While heavy-duty vehicles had used double-railed frames before, passenger vehicles had normally used a single rail. The elegant but durable style was widely copied and named \\"berline\\" after the city from which the carriage had come. It was more convenient than other carriages of the time, being lighter and less likely to overturn. The berline began to supplant the less practical and less comfortable state coaches and gala coaches in the 17th century. British and American sources mention a separate hooded rear seat for a footman detached from the body in their definitions of a berlin carriage. Development In the 18th century, the steel spring became widely used in carriage suspensions, supplanting the berline's twin-strap suspension system. The term \\"berline\\" survived as a description of the formal or ceremonial body style with two bench seats facing each other in a closed carriage. Smaller carriages mainly for town use were developed from the berline by removing the rear-facing front seat and shortening the enclosure. This style became known as the \\"halbberline\\" in Germany and the \\"berline coup√©\\" (cut berline) in France. The name \\"berline coup√©\\" was later shortened to \\"coup√©\\". Automobile 1908 FN 2000 berline The berline body style initially carried over from the carriage to the automobile with the chauffeur in the open at the front and an enclosure behind with two seats facing each other. As with the coup√© and the brougham, the term evolved with the deletion of the outside driver and the movement of the controls into the enclosure, along with the turning of the front seat to face forward. The term \\"berline\\" is now the French term for the saloon or sedan.

It is primarily a residential area, with housing consisting of mainly Victorian and 1930s terraced houses. Hale End The whole of the Highams Park area was once known as Hale End, as evidenced by the name of Hale End Library, and the Halex factory. Although postcode areas are not intended to define districts, it might be said that Hale End approximates to the part of Highams Park which shares the postal district of IG8 with Woodford Green.

Jubilee is positioned off The Avenue, it is now owned by Waltham Forest Council. It is mainly used for football, with local teams and youth teams training and playing on the field and astro-turf. The ground is not open to the public. Rolls Park is slightly bigger and is open to the public. The field is used mainly for football and cricket. There is also a tennis club and a small gym at the edges of the field. There is also a bar/clubroom owned by West Essex football and cricket clubs. There is another Tennis club (Whitehalls) situated on Larkshall Road. Highams Park Lake is used for Kayaking by members of The Scout Association. There are initial plans to build a velodrome in the grounds of Highams Park School. This would be used by the school and also local sports teams, it will be many years before any building work is undertaken. \\"The Highams Park\\" and Highams Park Lake The Lake The park is known officially as \\"The Highams Park\\" but is often known locally as \\"Highams Park Field\\", \\"The Field\\", \\"The Park\\" or \\"The lake\\". Most of the park is on a hill with a gradual rise to the north end. It is frequented by dog walkers, runners and families. The park has a cafe, open 08:00 - 18:00, an under-8's playground and public notice boards. Highams Park Lake is to the west of the park, and is owned by the City of London Corporation although the rest of the park is maintained by the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The lake was formed by the landscape gardener Humphry Repton who created it by damming the River Ching. The lake, the adjoining park and the Manor House (now Woodford County High School) were owned by Highams Bensted. The lake itself is about 450m long and about 80m wide at the widest point. At the south end of the lake is a boat house built by Kenneth Robert John Ford and owned by Waltham Forest South Scouts. The north end of the lake is much narrower and shallower, and it often dries out into mud in the summer. The River Ching flows past the lake but does not actually flow into it; a small outflow at the south end of the lake flows into the river. There is a small island in the lake which is inhabited by nesting swans. Near the top of the lake are some large rocks thought to have been placed there by Humphry Repton to improve the lake's appearance. A public toilet block used to be situated on the east side of the lake although it was demolished many years ago, and only the foundations remain. Halex and Tesco The Halex factory was situated on Larkshall Road and was a major local employer from 1897‚Äì1971. The factory was established by the British Xylonite Company to produce a variety of goods mostly from plastic. The Halex company had a virtual monopoly on manufacturing table tennis balls. The factory closed in the early 1970s and has since been knocked down and replaced by new smaller factories and industrial buildings. A blue plaque on Jubilee Avenue marks the spot where the building stood; it reads \\"Plastics Historical Society. On this site, from 1897‚Äì1971, stood the Halex factory of the British Xylonite Company.\\" Some of the land in this area is now owned by supermarket chain Tesco, which was initially refused permission to build a store on the site in June 2007 by then Local Government Secretary Ruth KellyGovernment Says No to Highams Park Tesco Waltham Forest Guardian 18th June 2007 after a protracted process of planning applications dating back to early 2005.\\"Tesco No Go\\" Waltham Forest Guardian 11 February 2005 The reasons cited for the refusal involved the size of the proposed store and the building not being in keeping with local Victorian and Edwardian buildings. However, in 2009 a revised planning application was passed despite the efforts of some local residents to stop this from happening. A recent campaign seeks to honour the men of Highams Park who worked in the Halex Factory and gave their lives in both world wars. The campaigners also wish to see the return of the local war memorial to its original site.The Highams Park War Memorial Project Railway Highams Park station is on the London Overground Chingford branch which runs from London Liverpool Street to Chingford, The line is one of the Lea Valley lines. The railway line cuts through the area with a level crossing, close to the station, this being the only place actually in Highams Park where vehicles can cross the track. The level crossing itself, until 2002, was controlled by a signalman who worked in the traditional signal box next to the crossing. However, in 2002, despite local opposition, the gates began to be operated from a central office at Liverpool Street station. The signal box was marked for demolition, but due to the efforts of \\"The Highams Park Forum\\" (a group of local residents), and local Member of Parliament (and then leader of the Conservative Party) Iain Duncan Smith, the box was saved with the intention of turning it into a museum or a tea room. In 2017 the signal box was reopened as a cr√™perie called LaBoite.http://laboite.co.uk.  Buses  Highams Park is served by London Buses routes 212, 275, W16 and school route 675.

It was originally published as a set of eight volumes between 1867-1877 in London. The translations were in part overseen by Elliot, whose efforts were then extended and edited posthumously by John Dowson. The book has been reprinted several times, and is also available online. Elliot was keen to contrast what he saw as the justice and efficiency of the British rule compared to cruelty and despotism of Muslim rule. He expressed hope that it \\"will make our native subjects more sensible of the immense advantages accruing to them under the mildness and equity of our rule.\\"Temple desecration in pre-modern India Background Henry Miers Elliot was born in 1808. He was an administrator who worked for the British East India Company (EIC) and rose to the position of foreign secretary under the Governor-Generalships of Henry Hardinge and James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie. His academic capability in oriental languages, classics and mathematics enabled him to pass the open entrance examination for the EIC in 1826, foregoing the place at New College, Oxford that he had been expected to attend. Elliot's interest in studies of India was indulged as a leisure pursuit throughout his time in the country and arose out of researches made by him in attempts to develop policies relating to land and revenue. British historians of India, such as Mountstuart Elphinstone, had largely ignored the rural aristocracy and fiscal matters, which Elliot believed could usefully be investigated by resort to hitherto neglected medieval chronicles. He saw his Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammedan India , published in 1849, as a prelude to a study of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India and also a resource that would prove to be of benefit to future historians. He said that he wanted his researches to be Ill-health prevented Elliot from completing his more detailed study: he left India in search of a more amenable climate and died in 1853 at Simonstown, South Africa. John Dowson was asked by Elliot's widow, Rebecca, to complete the work of her husband. Dowson had been born in 1820 and had held various teaching posts relating to oriental languages, of which he seems likely to have mastered Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindustani. Those posts included a period as tutor at the EIC's Haileybury college, a professorship at University College, London and, from around 1859 until 1877, a professorship at the Staff College, Camberley. His efforts based on the work of Elliot resulted in the eight volumes titled The History of India, as Told by its Own Historians: the Muhammadan Period, published in London by Tr√ºbner & Co between 1867 and 1877. Around half of the material extracted from Elliot's bibliographic index were translated by Dowson himself and, according to Katherine Prior, he also left his mark by giving \\"... more of a historical emphasis than Elliot had planned.\\" Some years later, Dowson began work on a volume concerning medieval Gujarat that was also based on Elliot's papers. This was incomplete at the time of his death in 1881 and was later published in a completely different form ‚Äî as The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Local Muhammadan Dynasties: Gujarat ‚Äî under the editorship of Edward Clive Bayley. Assessments The literary work of Elliot was criticised around the time of his death. Francis H. Robinson wrote in 1853 that Elliot's evangelical trait tended to \\"criminate\\" those about whom he wrote. Dowson's academic reputation was established through his involvement in the project, although he did receive some criticism both of his competence and methods. Prior notes that, \\"Ironically, in the longer term, the apparent comprehensiveness of his work seriously retarded scholarly re-examination of the manuscripts on which it was based\\". In 1903, Stanley Lane-Poole praised the efforts of Elliot and Dowson but also cautioned about it, saying: Another Francis Robinson, writing in 2010, notes that the Elliott and Dowson work \\"... should always be read with Peter Hardy's Historians of Medieval India (Delhi, 1997) to hand.\\" Ramya Sreenivasan explains that the early and medieval historiography of India has often been approached in the form of dichotomic Hindu and Muslim categories, two strands of mutually exclusive political outlooks and cultures that have their origins in the two literary epic forms that generally, but not always, are typical of those periods. She notes that the effects of this can be seen in the works of later historians such as James Tod, another EIC administrator and gentleman-scholar, who strenuously favoured the notion of Hindu chivalry and Muslim deceitfulness while working in Rajputana. Richard Eaton believes that present-day Hindu nationalists have \\"selectively used\\" Elliot and Dowson's \\"selective translations\\" in their efforts to denigrate pre-modern Muslim rulers. He says that =Criticisms= Eaton states that Elliot saw the British rule as much superior in contrast to the Muslim rule and \\"was anything but sympathetic\\" to the Muhammadan period of Indian history. Elliot notes of far greater advantages to Indians than under Muslim rule and expressed hope that it \\"will make our native subjects more sensible of the immense advantages accruing to them under the mildness and equity of our rule.\\"Temple desecration in pre-modern India Mohammad Habib, a Marxist historian who had presented his own secular view of Indian history by challenging the historical and translation methods of European colonial historians like Elliot, criticized him for focusing \\"inordinately\\" on the political activities of Muslim rulers instead of focusing on the lives of the people and their cultural activities. He blamed it on Elliot's reliance on faulty translations and not recognising the historical value of literary and cultural sources like masnavis and maktubat (Sufi literature).Kashmir‚Äôs Contested Pasts: Narratives, Geographies, and the Historical Imagination Contents The contents are not complete translations of works.

Spasskiy was born in the town of Noginsk in the Moscow Region on August 2, 1926. In 1949 he graduated from the Engineering Department (–ø–∞—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–æ–≤–æ–π —Ñ–∞–∫—É–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ç) of Dzerzhinsky Higher Naval Engineering School, after which he briefly served as lieutenant-engineer on the cruiser Frunze. Hero of Socialist Labor In 1950 he started work as a submarine designer, first in Construction Design Bureau-143 (currently Malakhit Design Bureau). Since 1953 he has worked in Construction Design Bureau-18 (currently Rubin Design Bureau). In 1956 he became the vice Chief Engineer of Rubin; in 1968 he became the Chief Engineer; and since 1974 he has been the head of that bureau with the position title of Chief Designer (, after 1983 General Designer ). As General Designer, he was the main designer of all of Rubin's projects since 1974, which according to Rubin's website include: * strategic ballistic missile submarines: ** Delta III-class submarine (or 667BDR Kal'mar since 1974) ** Typhoon-class submarine (or Project 941 Akula built since the 1980s). ** Delta IV-class submarines (or Delfin since 1981) * Cruise missile submarines: ** Oscar I (or Project 949 Granit) class of submarines ** Oscar II (or Project 949A Antey) class of submarines * and other submarines as surface ships. Altogether, Spassky's projects have included 187 submarines (91 diesel-electric and 96 nuclear) that have been the core of the Soviet and Russian Navy. Spassky has also published scientific works on the theory of submarine design and construction. He has been a full member of the Soviet Academy of Science since 1987 (a corresponding member since 1983). He is the Chairman of the Commission on Hydrodynamics of the Russian Academy of Science. He has been awarded the Lenin Prize (1965), became a Hero of Socialist Labor (1978), USSR State Prize (1983), received two Orders of Lenin, the Order of the October Revolution and two Orders of the Red Banner of Labour. \\"Hero of Capitalist Labor\\" Since the time of the perestroika and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, state orders for new nuclear submarines have dramatically decreased. Nevertheless, Spassky continued to work on nuclear submarines, including the new fourth- generation ballistic missile Yuriy Dolgorukiy class (construction started in 1996), but he expanded his Bureau into new areas in order to provide a livelihood for his employees. One such area was the design and construction of oil platforms (together with Halliburton) that are now used for oil drilling around Sakhalin island, in the Sea of Okhotsk, and off the coast of South Korea. Sea Launch launch platform Ocean Odyssey in its home port at Long Beach, California Another important project was Sea Launch, a unique spacecraft launch service that uses a specially modified floating oil drilling platform, positioned in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, for its launch platform. Spassky was the chief constructor of the marine part of the project. Sea Launch provides an economical way to send satellites into space, almost ten times cheaper than NASA. Spassky also became a CEO of the Non-Nuclear Submarines consortium (which includes Rubin, Admiralty Shipyards, and other shipbuilding companies). The company provides non-nuclear military submarines for the Russian Navy (among them diesel-electric submarines of the Petersburg class) and for export to India, Poland and others, among them submarines of the Amur class and the Sadko class (\\"tourist submarine\\"). Two of the latter were built and are now operating on Cyprus. Spasskiy also proposed such exotic projects as a cargo submarine for year-round operations in the Arctic Ocean, and a nuclear underwater gas transfer station for trans-ocean natural gas pipelines, as well as more humble projects such as modifications of city trams. These projects provided a reasonably smooth transition for thousands of Rubin employees to the market economy as well as some help to the Saint Petersburg city and philanthropy. Spasskiy and his enterprises financed reconstruction of Nikolo-Bogoyavlensky Cathedral in Saint-Petersburg, Church of John the Baptist (Ioann Pretechi) in Old Ladoga, the monument to the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy, the celebration of the centenary of the Russian Museum, and many other projects. For his philanthropy, the Russian Orthodox Church awarded Spassky the Order of Saint Prince Daniil of Moscow. Anatoly Sobchak referred to Spassky's success in the transformation to a market economy when he called him a \\"Hero of Capitalist Labor\\". Spassky was also awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation (2006) –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ Kursk submarine Spassky was the creator of the K-141 Kursk project, the last of the Oscar II class submarines built for the Russian navy. On August 12, 2000, a dummy torpedo aboard the submarine accidentally exploded and the submarine sank. Most of the crew died during the explosion, but 28 crew men remained alive for at least six hours afterward. Unfortunately, the rescuers were hampered by the slow and secretive military and government response. It was a week before they could get to the submarine site and then bad weather further slowed the recovery. By that time, the surviving crew had perished. Spassky was a consultant in the rescue effort and some perceived that he was responsible for the ineffective actions of the military in the first days after the explosion. There were also accusations that a fault in the design of the submarine might have been responsible for difficulties in the rescue operation. Some journalists, like Elena Milashina from Novaya gazeta, asked why most of the Russian nuclear submarine mishaps in the preceding years had happened to Spassky-designed submarines. In the open letter to Novaya Gazeta, the vice-president of Rubin, Alexander Zavalishin, and the General Designer of Submarines with Cruise Missiles (like Kursk), employee of Rubin, Igor Baranov, responded to the charges/ They stated that no vessel could survive simultaneous explosions of torpedoes, like the Kursk, when each torpedo was designed to disable or destroy warships. They also noted that more than three- quarters of Russian nuclear submarines are of the Spassky design, therefore, the percentages greatly reduced the argument of faulty design and did not indicate flaws in overall submarine design or integrity. Investigators agreed that the automatic system of shutting down the submarine's nuclear reactor, developed by Spassky's designers, operated perfectly and saved the Barents Sea from a nuclear disaster. Raising the stricken submarine and transporting it to a salvage plant became another Herculean effort. More than five hundred proposals were submitted to recover the Kursk. Rubin bureau's own plans included separating the destroyed compartment of the submarine, lifting the intact section, and transporting it to the ship repair facility in Roslyakovo near Severomorsk. The project included equipment from Dutch firms Mammoet and Smit International. Within five months, the Russian government contracted Dutch firms to raise the Kursk in an extremely difficult, large-scale and emotionally strained operation coordinated by Igor Spassky. The transporting and docking were performed by another multinational project team.

Its plot follows two university students who find themselves at the centre of an investigation involving a man who goes missing on the London Underground. Plot Late one night at the Russell Square station in the London Underground, university students Patricia and her American exchange student boyfriend Alex find an unconscious man collapsed on the stairwell. Fearing the man may be diabetic, Patricia checks his wallet and finds a card that reads James Manfred, OBE. Alex and Patricia inform a police officer about Manfred, Alex and the officer return to the stairwell to Alex's surprise find that Manfred has vanished. Inspector Calhoun is assigned to look into the disappearance. Calhoun antagonistically questions Alex, who asserts the man was a drunk, and suggests he and Patricia robbed the man. While discussing the case of the missing Manfred, Calhoun's colleague tells him about the history of the London Underground, particularly the Victorian railway workers who constructed the tunnels under dire conditions, and an urban legend that a group of descendants who survived an 1892 cave-in still live below ground in an abandoned section of the tunnels. Meanwhile, one of the last surviving members of a family of these railway workers watches his female companion die; they have survived in the underground by resorting to cannibalism of the railway patrons. In an empty chamber, Manfred's body lies, mutilated. The man laments the woman's death, as he is now left in complete solitude. The man goes into a rage and brutally murders three Underground maintenance workers, taking one to his lair. Calhoun remains suspicious of Alex and Patricia, and calls Alex in for repeated interrogations. After seeing a film one night, Alex and Patricia take a train home and get off at Holborn station. While de- boarding, Patricia realizes she forgot her textbooks on the train. Alex attempts to retrieve them, but the doors close before he can exit; just as the train leaves, Patricia yells through the window that she will meet him at home. Once the train exits the platform, Patricia is attacked by the cannibal man and incapacitated. When Patricia fails to meet him at their flat, Alex seeks help from Calhoun, who is dismissive of him. Alex returns to Holborn station to search for Patricia, and enters the tunnel against the orders of a station attendant. He manages to breach an abandoned area of the Underground that had caved in, and finds remnants of the miners who worked there over a century ago. Meanwhile, Patricia awakens in the cannibal's lair. She finds him to be aphasic and unable to communicate with her. When he begins grabbing her aggressively, she hits him over the head and manages to flee, escaping into a tunnel. He finally corners her and attempts to communicate with her, but becomes frustrated and violently attacks her. Alex stumbles upon the scene and begins fighting with the cannibal, stomping him on the head. Patricia, however, begs Alex not to hurt him, and they watch as the cannibal stumbles into a passageway. Calhoun and several other detectives who have entered the Underground discover Alex and Patricia. As they search through the abandoned section of the Underground, the detectives uncover a room full of corpses laid in bunk bedsthe generations of survivors from the cave-in that occurred a century before. There they find the cannibal, bleeding profusely, and he collapses in front of them, apparently dead. The detectives return meet Alex and Patricia, who have been waiting outside the cannibal's lair, and head to the station platform. After they leave, the cannibal screams \\"Mind the doors!\\" as the credits roll. CastProduction Hugh Armstrong's role was originally to be played by Marlon Brando but Brando had to back out when his son Christian became ill with pneumonia. Christopher Lee agreed to do the film for scale because he wanted to work with Donald Pleasence. Despite this, the two never share the screen together due to their large height difference. Director Gary Sherman kept them in separate shots until Lee sits down at the end of the scene so that he wouldn't have issues fitting them both into the same frame. Release Death Line premiered in London in December 1972, and was later released in the United States under the title Raw Meat on October 3, 1973. In the United States, it was released in an edited cut to avoid an X rating. American International Pictures, the film's distributor, retitled the film for its American release, along with a marketing campaign that made it appear as though it were a zombie film. In Los Angeles, it was paired as a double bill alongside the comedy-horror film Cannibal Girls (1973). =Home media= Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) released the film on DVD in North American on August 26, 2003. On June 27, 2017, Blue Underground released the film in a Collector's Edition Blu-ray & DVD combination pack. On April 5, 2011, the film was re-released on DVD in a six-film set alongside other MGM horror titles, such as Pumpkinhead (1988), Dolls (1987), Scarecrows (1988), Sometimes They Come Back (1991), and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978). Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.22/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"a good debut, but it‚Äôs undermined by several vast improbabilities in the script and by the painfully inept performance of one of its leads, David Ladd.\\" Robin Wood of The Village Voice praised the film, writing that it \\"vies with Night of the Living Dead (1968) for the most horrible horror film ever. It is, I think, decidedly the better film: more powerfully structured, more complex, and more humanly involved. Its horrors are not gratuitous; it is an essential part of its achievement to create, in the underground world, the most terrible conditions in which human life can continue to exist and remain recognizably human. [It] is strong without being schematic; one can't talk of allegory in the strict sense, but the action consistently carries resonances beyond its literal meaning.\\" Ramsey Campbell, in a review cut from The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural, but reprinted later, calls Death Line \\"an unusually bleak and harrowing horror film...very little in the film offers the audience any relief from the plight of the Man...The violence would be intolerable if it were not for the tragic dimensions of the film, but Hugh Armstrong's performance is one of the greatest and most moving in horror films.\\"  See also  * List of London Underground-related fiction ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1972 films Category:1972 horror films Category:American films Category:American slasher films Category:British films Category:British slasher films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Films directed by Gary Sherman Category:Films set on the London Underground ","title":"Death Line"},{"id":"2745723","text":"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan is a 2005 documentary film by Martin Scorsese that traces the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on 20th-century American popular music and culture. The film focuses on the period between Dylan's arrival in New York in January 1961 and his \\"retirement\\" from touring following his motorcycle accident in July 1966. This period encapsulates Dylan's rise to fame as a folk singer and songwriter, and the controversy surrounding his move to a rock style of music. The title is taken from Dylan's 1965 single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Production and content The film was first shown on television in both the United States (as part of the American Masters series on PBS) and the United Kingdom (as part of the Arena series on BBC Two) on September 26‚Äì27, 2005. A DVD version of the film and accompanying soundtrack album (The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack) were released that same month. The project began to take shape in 1995 when Dylan's manager, Jeff Rosen, began scheduling interviews with Dylan's friends and associates. Among those interviewed were poet Allen Ginsberg and folk musician Dave Van Ronk, both of whom died before the film was completed. Dylan's old girlfriend Suze Rotolo also granted a rare interview, and she later told Rolling Stone that she was very pleased with the project's results. Dylan himself also sat for ten hours in a relaxed and open conversation with Rosen in 2000. Other interviews with those who knew him at the time include Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Liam Clancy, Maria Muldaur, Peter Yarrow and promoters like Harold Leventhal. According to Rolling Stone, an unnamed source close to the project claimed that Dylan himself had no involvement with the project apart from the interview, saying that \\"[Dylan] has no interest in this . . . Bob truly does not look back.\\" However, work on the first installment of Dylan's autobiography, Chronicles, Vol. 1, did overlap production of the project, though it is unclear how much, if any, influence Chronicles may have had on No Direction Home. Though raw material was being gathered for the project, Rosen needed someone to edit and shape it into a quality motion picture, and celebrated filmmaker Martin Scorsese was approached to direct the documentary planned from the project. Scorsese eventually agreed and came aboard in 2001. In the meantime, Dylan's offices gathered hundreds of hours of historical film footage dating from the time covered in No Direction Home. These included a scratchy recording of Dylan's high school rock band, his 1965 screen test for Andy Warhol, and newly discovered footage of the famous Manchester Free Trade Hall concert from May 17, 1966, when an angry fan called out \\"Judas!\\" just before Dylan and The Hawks performed \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\" Shot by D.A. Pennebaker, the onstage color footage was found in 2004 in a pile of water-damaged film recovered from Dylan's vault. The cover photo on the DVD package, by Barry Feinstein, shows Dylan standing in front of the Aust Ferry terminal in Gloucestershire, England, in May 1966, shortly before the opening of the Severn Bridge which replaced the ferry. Reception and awards The film received positive reviews from film critics, as review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 14 reviews. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of a possible four stars, stating that it \\"creates a portrait that is deep, sympathetic, perceptive and yet finally leaves Dylan shrouded in mystery, which is where he properly lives\\". The film received a Peabody Award in April 200665th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2006. and a Columbia-duPont Award in January 2007, and Martin Scorsese received a Grammy Award in direction for best long-form video. Legacy The documentary, describing the 1960 New York folk scene, served as an inspiration to Justin Timberlake for his part in the Coen brothers' related drama Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). Scorsese would make a second documentary on Dylan fourteen years later, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (2019), this time chronicling his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue concert tour.

He played for nine seasons (1992‚Äì2003) for five teams, including four seasons for the Atlanta Braves, and three seasons for the Toronto Blue Jays. Borb√≥n was mainly a relief pitcher. Borb√≥n's father, Pedro Borb√≥n was also a pitcher, playing for the Cincinnati Reds and three other teams from 1969 to 1980, winning the World Series twice with the Cincinnati Reds. After his parents divorced when he was 13, young Pedro Borb√≥n left home at 14 and settled in New York City with two of his mother's brothers. In the spring of his freshman year at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Borb√≥n cut class, heading for the lunch room. He was stopped by a security guard, who asked to see his student ID. The guard did a double-take when he saw the name. \\"Are you related to Pedro Borb√≥n, the pitcher?\\" he asked. The guard also happened to be a baseball coach at the school. He asked Borb√≥n if he played baseball and refused to take \\"no\\" for an answer. He took Borb√≥n outside and had him throw 20 pitches. By Borb√≥n's recollection, 18 were strikes. Borb√≥n pitched well enough to earn an athletic scholarship to Ranger Junior College outside Houston but not before parting with his uncles and living for a while in a cheap apartment in the Bronx with two high school buddies that cost them $540 a month. He worked as a messenger after school to pay his third of the rent. He had no contact with his father between the ages of 13 and 20.Adversity makes Borbon better. The Free Library. Retrieved on February 14, 2017. Borb√≥n played on the 1995 Atlanta Braves, who won the World Series that year. He pitched one important inning in the 1995 World Series. The Braves were leading two games to one over the Cleveland Indians, and were leading the fourth game going into the ninth inning. However, Braves' closer Mark Wohlers was fatigued after having pitched two and two-thirds innings the previous day. Wohlers allowed the Indians to score a run and put a runner on second in that ninth inning without recording any outs. Borb√≥n then came in to relieve Wohlers, and promptly struck out Jim Thome and Sandy Alomar Jr. while getting Kenny Lofton to fly out to right. Borb√≥n is right-handed but taught himself to throw left-handed to increase his marketability as a pitcher. Personal life Borb√≥n is the brother-in-law of major league outfielder Carlos Peguero, who is married to sister Maria Jacqueline (n√©e Borb√≥n) Peguero. Borb√≥n was one of three Atlanta Braves to appear on Saturday Night Live when he made a cameo appearance alongside teammates Gerald Williams and Mark Wohlers.

Micro-teaching was invented in 1963 at Stanford University by Dwight W. Allen, and has subsequently been used to develop educators in all forms of education. In the original process, a teacher was asked to prepare a short lesson (usually 20 minutes) for a small group of learners who may not have been his/her own students. This was then recorded on video. After the lesson, the teacher, teaching colleagues, a master teacher and the students together viewed the videotape and commented on what they saw happening, referencing the teacher's teaching objectives. Watching the video and getting comments from colleagues and students provide teachers with an often intense \\"under the microscope\\" view of their teaching. A review of the evidence for micro-teaching, undertaken by John Hattie as part of his Visible Learning project, found it was the 6th most effective method for improving student outcomes. Introductions Microteaching is a technique aiming to prepare teacher candidates to the real classroom setting (Brent & Thomson, 1996). Microteaching can also defined as a teaching technique especially used in teachers‚Äô pre-service education to train them systematically by allowing them to experiment main teacher behaviors. By the help of this technique, teacher candidates can experiment and learn each of the teaching skills by breaking them into smaller parts and without encountering chaotic environment of the crowded classes. While instilling teaching skills in students during microteaching, reciprocal negotiation of the students actively presenting and watching about the performances can make great contribution to the acquisition of the skills (Ta≈üdemir, 2006). Wilkinson (1996), emphasizes that teacher candidates can experience real teaching and teaching rules with the help of this method. This method offers teachers opportunities for discovering and reflecting on both their own and others‚Äô teaching styles and enables them to learn about new teaching techniques (Wahba, 1999). Pre-service teacher can benefit to a great extent from microteaching applications. Firstly, they reveal teaching facts; and roles of the teacher (Amobi, 2005; Hawkey, 1995; Kpanja, 2001; Wilkinson, 1996); help pre-service teachers to see the importance of planning and taking decisions (Gess-Newsome & Lederman, 1990); enable them to develop and improve their teaching skills (Benton-Kupper, 2001). Microteaching technique is an application in which video recordings have been made possible as a result of developing technology. Audio and visual technology is an effective and reflective tool in preparing pre-service teachers to the profession of teaching. Video recordings provide pre-service teachers with the chance of evaluating themselves by engaging them in more experiences and configurations (Jensen et al., 1994). Sherin (2000) indicates that video recordings affect the perspectives of teachers in education process. Cunningham & Benedetto (2002) emphasize that video tools support the reflective learning, and Spurgeon & Bowen (2002) stress that by the help of these tools, the problems that may occur in education process can be observed and defined. Farris (1991) states that this method increases the confidence and raises the awareness of personal skills. Sel√ßuk (2001) indicates that video recordings can not only be used for demonstrating model teacher behaviours but can also be used for the analysis of microteaching. Using video recording method in microteaching applications contributes to the professional development of pre-service teachers by identifying strengths and weaknesses and improves their competencies (Tok, 2007). Techniques Since its inception in 1963, micro-teaching has become an established teacher-training procedure in many universities and school districts. This training procedure is geared towards simplification of the complexities of the regular teaching- learning process. Class size, time, task, and content are scaled down to provide optimal training environments. The supervisor demonstrates the skill to be practiced. This may be live demonstration, or a video presentation of the skill. Then, the group members select a topic and prepare a lesson of five to ten minutes. The teacher trainee then has the opportunity to practice and evaluate his use of the skills. Practice takes the form of a ten-minute micro- teaching session in which five to ten pupils are involved. In more recent years, the easy availability of recording equipment and the use of social media for dissemination have made micro-teaching more accessible. Feedback Feedback in micro-teaching is critical for teacher-trainee improvement. It is the information that a student receives concerning their attempts to imitate certain patterns of teaching. The built-in feedback mechanism in micro- teaching acquaints the trainee with the success of their performance and enables them to evaluate and to improve teaching.

Maryland Defense Forces and Maryland Army National Guard participate in a multi-agency disaster exercise at Towson University.The Maryland State Guard was reactivated in 1939 in response to World War II. It was then deactivated in 1947. As of 1983, the Maryland State Guard was reactivated and renamed the Maryland Defense Force. In 1994, the Maryland Defense Force's missions were expanded to search and rescue, armory staffing, and disaster relief. As of September 11, 2001, the Maryland Defense Force was tasked with its current mission, which is to provide support to the Maryland Military Department as needed. In August 2005, members of the 10th Medical Regiment, including civilian medical professionals who were sworn into the MDDF on the tarmac of Martin State Airport, departed for Louisiana in two C130 cargo planes operated by the Maryland Air National Guard to provide medical treatment to approximately 6,300 hurricane victims over eighteen days as an operation called Operation Lifeline. In 2006, members of the 10th Medical Regiment, despite not being subject to deployment outside the state of Maryland, voluntarily deployed with the 175th Medical Group of the Maryland Air National Guard to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a part of a training exercise where the 10th Medical Regiment assisted in providing medical aid to the local populace. In September 2007, the MDDF participated with the National Guard for Exercise Vigilant Guard, a major homeland security/terrorist response exercise held in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC. In June 2012, the MDDF provided food and water to residents of Baltimore during the heat emergency. During the 2015 Baltimore protests, members of the Maryland Defense Force, including members of the 10th Medical Brigade as well as logistical support personnel and military chaplains, deployed alongside the Maryland Army National Guard in support of their mission. Legal protection The Code of Maryland guarantees that members of the Maryland Defense Force who are called to active duty or training are entitled to a leave of absence, and full reemployment rights after their deployment ends. This is only for Maryland State employees. Members of MDDF are also covered by Maryland workers compensation where actively deployed by the Maryland Governor. Units The Maryland Defense Force Band plays at the State Defense Force conference in October 2015. =Maryland Defense Force Band= The Maryland Defense Force Band provides back up support for the 229th Army Band of the Maryland Army National Guard. The MDDF band plays in military ceremonies, concerts, and receptions organized by the Maryland Military Department. The band includes wind, brass, and percussion instruments. =Cavalry Troop A= Cavalry Troop A, the ceremonial cavalry unit of the Maryland Military Department, was established January 8, 2004. The troop acts in a ceremonial and public relations role as a recruiting aid for both the MDDF and the Maryland National Guard. Training for Troop A includes mounted cavalry drill, equitation or skill-at-arms on horseback or dismounted drill and ceremony and basic military customs and courtesies. =Chaplain Corps= The MDDF Chaplain Corps includes ordained ministers, staff assistants, and chaplain assistants who provide spiritual support for members of the MDDF, the Maryland National Guard, their families, and in times of emergency, civilians. The Chaplain Corps can be called upon to perform religious rites or sacraments when deployed. Chaplains are required be ordained ministers of their faith, in good standing with their church, and must meet secondary education requirements. On top of certification requirements, chaplains must have passed MDDF Basic Training and courses in MDDF-specific Chaplain duties. =Cyber Defense Unit= The MDDF Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) was created in 2010 to supplement the cyber teams of the Maryland National Guard. Its mission statement includes providing support to the Maryland Military Department, improving the security stance of the State of Maryland agencies and being prepared to respond with the Maryland Military Department in case of a cyber emergency. In order to complete this mission, the MDDF Cyber Security Unit regularly trains with the Maryland Army & Air National Guard. In addition, they participate in numerous joint training exercises with members of the Maryland Air National Guard, Maryland Army National Guard and various state agencies. The MDDF CDU consists of four sections: Headquarters, Hunt Operations, Incident Response and Recovery, Vulnerability Assessment =121st Engineer Regiment= The 121st Engineer Regiment acts as a rapid relief engineering unit intended to deploy after an emergency to aid the Maryland Military Department in civil relief efforts. Since 2009, the 121st Engineer Regiment has conducted all of the inspections of state military facilities across Maryland for the Maryland Army National Guard. Maryland Emergency Engineering Response Team (MEERT) The Maryland Emergency Engineering Response Team is a unit of graduate engineers, most of whom are licensed professional Maryland engineers, organized to work closely with both the Maryland Army National Guard and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA). =Finance Corps= The Finance Corps of the MDDF is composed of licensed financial consultants, advisers, and civilian energy managers. The mission of the Finance Corps is to provide the following: *Emergency Financial & Administrative surge capacity support to military and civil authorities during field training exercises and emergency missions. *Financial analysis, accounting, management, and forecasting for MDDF assets *Practical financial briefs to Maryland National Guardsmen and their families at group program events ‚Äì Yellow Ribbon, Soldier Readiness, Recruit Sustainment, and Retirement *Energy analysis, accounting, management, and forecasting with the Installation Status Report (ISR), a decision support tool for garrison commanders and military facility managers. =Judge Advocate Corps= The Judge Advocate Corps (JAC) of the MDDF is composed of licensed attorneys. =10th Medical Regiment= A Maryland National Guardsman and a Maryland State Guardsman teach nursing students proper evacuation procedures at Towson University. The 10th Medical Regiment is the medical arm of the MDDF and is registered with the Office of the Surgeon General as a Medical Reserve Corps unit. The mission of the regiment is to provide emergency surge capacity support to civil authorities during an emergency. Unlike other MDDF guardsmen, members of the 10th Medical Regiment are allowed to serve in backup status and attend only an annual muster one day per year. In August 2005, on a purely voluntary basis as state guardsmen cannot be ordered to deploy outside the state of Maryland, members of the 10th Medical Regiment provided medical service to approximately 6,300 Hurricane Katrina victims over an eighteen-day period as a part of Operation Lifeline. Included in those deployed were civilian medical professionals who, despite a willingness to volunteer in providing medical care for hurricane victims, had no means of deployment into the emergency zone as civilians. These medical volunteers were inducted into the MDDF on the tarmac of Martin State Airport. As members of the MDDF, these volunteers received military transport, worker's compensation eligibility, and liability protection under Maryland law. Over 100 of those sworn in with the purpose of taking part in Operation Lifeline elected to remain members of the MDDF following deployment. Operation Lifeline, with only 250 MDDF volunteers lasted for 18 days and aided 6,300 patients. In 2006, volunteers from the 10th Medical Regiment deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina alongside the 175th Medical Group of the Air National Guard to provide medical care for locals as a part of a training mission. =Pioneer Detachment= The Pioneer Detachment, which is based at Anne Arundel Community College, is a student-run detachment whose members are assigned cyber-security, medical, engineering, and force protection responsibilities. =Troop Command= The MDDF Troop Command assigns members and units of the MDDF to work in tandem with the Maryland Army National Guard, Maryland Air National Guard, and Maryland Emergency Management Agency.

It currently consists of (former member of Hate Forest and Dark Ages), Thurios (former member of Astrofaes), Krechet, and Vlad. All four also belonged to Blood of Kingu until it was disbanded. Their lyrics and artistic themes embrace Slavic mythology and Ukrainian nationalism. The band is associated with far-right politics, but rejects any explicit connection to a political ideology. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (Oleksandr Oles, Oleh Olzhych, Maik Yohansen etc.) and especially Taras Shevchenko. Drudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums. From their conception until 2009, Drudkh did not have any official website, but in May 2009, Season of Mist launched an official Myspace, operated by the label rather than the band. History Drudkh have released eleven albums, two EPs, four splits, and two compilations of material from the band's early splits and EPs. Their early releases were released on CD through the English extreme metal record label Supernal Music, with the exception of the EP (which was a vinyl release), and, again with the exception of the EP, on vinyl through two Finnish black metal labels, Northern Heritage and Faustian Distribution. More recent release have been through Season of Mist, which has also issued remastered versions of the band's earlier albums as digipaks. The band's first album, Forgotten Legends, was released on August 18, 2003. The album establishes the band's trademark epic sound; its three tracks and one outro span nearly forty minutes, with the longest track, \\"False Dawn\\", nearing the sixteen-minute mark. Terrorizer included Forgotten Legends in its Top 40 Black Metal albums list. Autumn Aurora followed on November 28, 2004. While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating synthesizers and other such keyboard instruments. Autumn Aurora has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later Blood in Our Wells. This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by Chronicles of Chaos web-zine. After Autumn Aurora, Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy. The Swan Road (–õ–µ–±–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏–π —à–ª—è—Ö), released on March 14, 2005, marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work The Haidamakas (1841) by Taras Shevchenko, narrating about the Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising of 1768. Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non- Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced nationalistic leaning, a move continued on the next album. On March 23, 2006, Drudkh released Blood in Our Wells (–ö—Ä–æ–≤ —É –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –∫—Ä–∏–Ω–∏—Ü—è—Ö), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth- century Ukrainian poets (including Oleksandr Oles and Lina Kostenko) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to Stepan Bandera, leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Musically, the album adds progressive rock influences and an increased use of traditional heavy metal soloing into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. Because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film Mamay (2003), the album has greater use of cinematic elements than its predecessors. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the Terrorizer Top 40 year list, placing at number 35. After the release of Blood in Our Wells, Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined. On October 19, 2006, Drudkh released Songs of Grief and Solitude (–ü—ñ—Å–Ω—ñ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–±–æ—Ç–∏ —ñ —Å–∞–º—ñ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \\"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\\" is based on a riff from \\"Solitude\\" on Blood in Our Wells, and \\"Archaic Dance\\" is based on a riff from \\"Glare of 1768\\" on The Swan Road). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticizing the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound. On April 16, 2007, Supernal Music released Drudkh's Anti-Urban, a 45-RPM 10 inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers. Season of Mist later re- released it as a mini CD in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of Microcosmos, and it was also included on the band's collection Eastern Frontier in Flames. The band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled Estrangement (–íi–¥—á—É–∂–µ–Ωi—Å—Ç—å), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition. The album, which had the working title River of Tears, had been rumored to have a \\"Burzumic\\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on Blood in Our Wells. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since The Swan Road. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ' about Bandera's life and assassination. In Autumn 2008, the band signed with the French label Season of Mist. On June 22 (July 14 in United States), 2009, the seventh Drudkh album Microcosmos was released through the label Underground Activists, published by Season of Mist. The standard CD version is a digipak; a limited edition box set also contained an MCD re-release of Anti-Urban. The lyrics are once again taken from Ukrainian poets, like Ivan Franko, Oleh Olzhych or Bohdan Rubchak. The outro is sampled from Assassination. The album was praised by critics, ranking eleventh in Terrorizers Top 40 Albums of 2009 and third in Haunting the Chapel's (Stereogum's metal section) Top 30 Metal Albums of 2009. In November 2009, Season of Mist began re-releasing Drudkh's whole catalogue, starting with remastered reissues of Forgotten Legends and Autumn Aurora, and finishing with new editions of Songs of Grief and Solitude and Estrangement in June 2010. Drudkh's eighth full-length album, Handful of Stars (–ü—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä—â–∞ –∑—ñ—Ä–æ–∫), was released on September 21, 2010, via Season of Mist. Critics and fans noticed the changes in style and sound: it was much clearer than previous efforts and bore influence from post-rock. The record received mixed reviews as a result, though it appeared in Haunting the Chapel Top 50 Albums of 2010 at 8 position. Again, for lyrics was used the poetry of Ukrainian authors, such as Oleksa Stefanovych and Svyatoslav Gordynskyj. The release of new Drudkh full-length was supported with Slavonic Chronicles mini album, which consisted two covers of Master's Hammer and Sacrilegium. It was released as a CD only with deluxe edition of Handful of Stars and also as 10\\" LP including download card to get the digital version of the record. As opposed to Handful of Stars, Slavonic Chronicles was much more stylistically similar to their older works like Blood in Our Wells. The post-rock direction, that was present at Handful of Stars, has been developed in new project titled Old Silver Key by Drudkh members with French musician Neige of Alcest on vocals. This supergroup signed to Season of Mist and released debut record titled Tales of Wanderings on September 16 (September 27 in North America), 2011. Drudkh's album Eternal Turn of the Wheel, recorded in summer 2011, was released on February 24 (March 13 in North America), 2012, through Season of Mist. Drudkh's tenth album, A Furrow Cut Short, was released on April 20, 2015. Controversy Drudkh have been accused of being a National Socialist black metal (NSBM) band. The band has denied links to fascism or any other political ideology. However, Hate Forest, Saenko's previous band, was more explicitly involved in the NSBM scene, and Drudkh's music has repeatedly referenced the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a Ukrainian nationalist formation from World War II that committed ethnic cleansing. Drudkh's fourth album Blood in Our Wells was dedicated to Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist and divisive figure of Ukrainian history.Yaroslav Hrytsak. (2005). Historical Memory and Regional Identity. In Galicia: A Multicultured Land. Christopher Hann and Paul Robert Magocsi (Eds.) Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 185‚Äì209 Furthermore, the sixth and final track of the album is titled \\"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\\", named after the entity founded by the Bandera faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The response to the criticism is that Stepan Bandera was a staunch opponent of the alliance with the Germans and the reason for the split of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (unlike Andriy Melnyk, who saw the only opportunity in the alliance with Germany to defeat the Communists), Stepan Bandera was a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp, and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army led active battle with the Nazis.Spector, Holocaust, 279; Mykhailo V.

For many years he was director of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights based in Haiti's capital, Port-au- Prince, and a leader of the National Congress of Democratic Movements, a moderate socialist political party also known as KONAKOM. He was Minister of Culture during Jean-Bertrand Aristide's first term as President of Haiti. In 1993 The New York Times called him \\"Haiti's leading human rights campaigner\\". In 1996 the paper called him \\"one of the country's leading intellectuals\\". In 2004 the St. Petersburg Times called him \\"Haiti's most respected human rights activist\\". Early life and career Bajeux was born in Port-au-Prince on 17 September 1931. He completed secondary school at Coll√®ge Saint-Martial in Port-au-Prince, run by the Holy Ghost/Spiritan Fathers. After this he studied philosophy and theology under the Holy Ghost Fathers/Spiritan Fathers in France. During his time in France, the University of Bordeaux awarded him a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. He received a Ph.D. in Romance languages and culture from Princeton University in 1977 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"Antilia retrouvee: La po√©sie noire antillaise a travers l'oeuvre de Claude McKay, Luis Pales Matos, Aim√© C√©saire.\\" He began his career as a Roman Catholic priest, as a member of the Holy Ghost Fathers, or Spiritan Fathers, though he later left the priesthood. In 1956 Bajeux moved to Cameroon, where he taught philosophy and served as editor-in-chief of a pro- independence magazine. Cameroon became independent in 1960. In 1961 Bajeux returned to Port-au-Prince and began teaching philosophy at Coll√®ge Saint- Martial. He also edited the journal Rond-Point and headed the Children's Library. First exile In 1964 Haiti's dictator Papa Doc Duvalier expelled the Holy Ghost/Spiritan Fathers order from the country. Bajeux asked his fellow priests to sign a letter of protest. His bishop reported him to the government, and Duvalier expelled Bajeux. He settled in Santo Domingo, the capital city of the Dominican Republic, where he began ministering to other Haitian exiles. Later that year, Duvalier's Tonton Macoutes militia kidnapped Bajeux's mother, his two sisters, and two of his brothers from their home in the middle of the night. They all later died in the Fort Dimanche prison, which The Miami Herald described as \\"the regime's most infamous hellhole\\". Following his time in Santo Domingo, Bajeux traveled to Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, where he spent one year editing a collection of documents about the history of Latin America. In 1967 he became a professor of comparative literature and Caribbean literature at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan, a position he held until 1992. During his years in San Juan he taught literature and religion at the university and gained prominence writing about Haiti. In 1977 he earned a PhD in Romance languages and literatures from Princeton University, where he was Assistant Master of Princeton Inn College, later known as Forbes College. His dissertation concerned black Caribbean poetry. Bajeux's wife Sylvie is a 1979 graduate alumna of Princeton and also a relative of some of the 13 Jeune Haiti rebels. During his years in exile, Bajeux remained active struggling for human rights in Haiti. The World Council of Churches helped him found the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights in Santo Domingo in 1979. He was an early supporter of Leslie Manigat's efforts to oust the Duvalier regime but came to believe Manigat was too interested in acquiring power. He also joined a group based in the Dominican Republic planning guerrilla attacks against the Duvalier regime. Political activity in Haiti Bajeux returned to Haiti in early 1986, becoming one of the first exiles to return days after Duvalier's son Baby Doc fled the country. On his arrival he was arrested, then released, and then briefly arrested again. He recounted to The New Yorker that he had to reclaim his family's house from Macoutes who said Duvalier's lieutenant Madame Max Adolphe had given it to them. In July of that year he brought the ECHR to Port-au-Prince. He also began his affiliation with KONAKOM, a moderate socialist political party, eventually rising to become a central figure in the party by 1989. The years following the ouster of Duvalier were tumultuous. Bajeux spent them active in politics. He participated in the debate surrounding the adoption of the Constitution of Haiti in 1987. He organized demonstrations against military rule by Henri Namphy and against the return to Haiti of Williams R√©gala and Roger Lafontant, former interior ministers under Duvalier. Bajeux became a supporter of Aristide's pro-democracy movement as did many other Holy Ghost/Spiritan Fathers who worked to elect another priest, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Aristide was elected in 1990 but forced into exile in a military coup the following year. At first Bajeux remained in Haiti, continuing his human rights advocacy and publishing the first bilingual (French and Creole) edition of his country's Constitution. However, in October 1993, armed men attacked his home, beat his domestic workers, and shot another man. Bajeux was not home at the time. He blamed the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Ha√Øti (FRAPH), a death squad backed by the army that targeted Aristide supporters. Following this incident, Bajeux fled Haiti with his wife. Aristide was returned to power in October 1994 in the United States-led Operation Uphold Democracy. Later that year Bajeux was appointed culture minister under Aristide. In this office he promoted the \\"Haitianization\\" of the national culture at the expense of French elements, a course he had advocated as early as 1986. However, he later turned against Aristide, as did his other Holy Ghost/Spiritan fathers joining an opposition movement calling for him to leave the country during his second term as president. In 1997 Bajeux published a collection of poems, and in 1999 he published a bilingual (French and Creole) anthology of Creole literature. In his later years he also remained active politically. His friend Michael Deibert recalled him marching in demonstrations in his old age despite physical danger. In 2002 he received the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic. In 2009 President Ren√© Pr√©val appointed him to a presidential commission to consider amending the constitution. Bajeux died 5 August 2011 at his home Port-au-Prince. He was 79 and the cause was lung cancer. Statements about relations with the United States Bajeux was outspoken about relations with the United States. In 1981, while in exile in San Juan, he criticized President Ronald Reagan's order that the U.S. Coast Guard repel ships suspected of carrying illegal immigrants from Haiti. After returning to Haiti in 1986 he opposed the Reagan administration's plan to industrialize Haiti's heavily agrarian economy. As violence was breaking out again in 1989 he advocated for the U.S. military to crack down on the marauding Macoutes. In 1992 he described President George H. W. Bush's plan to return all Haitian refugees in the U.S. to Haiti as \\"beyond all the laws of humanity\\".Quoted in During Bill Clinton's presidential transition following his election in 1992, Bajeux praised Clinton's efforts to aide Aristide's return, and in 1996 he accused Republicans of using problems in Haiti to embarrass Clinton, who was then running for reelection.

At the , it has a population of 8,579 and is sited on the Illawarra Highway, which connects to Wollongong and the Illawarra coast via Macquarie Pass. Moss Vale has several heritage buildings. In the centre of the main street is Leighton Gardens. Moss Vale is believed to have fertile soil and good precipitation. Agricultural rural holdings in the area specialise in dairy herds, mainly Holstein Frisian, and there are an assortment of beef studs and sheep properties. The town has a commercial district and a golf course. The Wingecarribee Shire Chambers are located here. Moss Vale has a NSW Rural Fire Service brigade which is located at 49 Berrima Road, Moss Vale. Moss Vale has undergone recent (2019) gentrification. It has become a hub for independent and creative business, including design stores, cafes and bars. History Leighton Gardens The Moss Vale area was once occupied by the Gundangara people, though they had disappeared by the 1870s, partly due to the loss of their hunting land to European settlers. Governor Hunter sent a party led by ex-convict John Wilson to investigate the area in 1798. Various others explored the area up to 1815, including John Warby, George Caley, Hamilton Hume and John Oxley. Hume, Charles Throsby and Joseph Wild explored the area west of Sutton Forest in 1817 and in 1818, together with James Meehan, they explored the area between Moss Vale and Jervis Bay. Governor Macquarie granted Throsby , known as Throsby Park, at Bong Bong, on the northeastern outskirts of Moss Vale and put him in charge of building the Old Argyle Road from Sydney to Goulburn in 1819. This road was replaced in the 1830s by a more direct road via Berrima surveyed by Thomas Mitchell and most of the population of Bong Bong moved to Berrima. The heritage-listed property of Throsby Park house was built about 1834, six years after Throsby's suicide. The area, which was considered to be part of Sutton Forest, remained rural until the coming of the railway. Subdivision part of Throsby Park for the town of Moss Vale, named after Jemmy Moss, a herdsman at Throsby Park, commenced in 1864, in anticipation of the opening of Sutton Forest railway station in 1867 at the intersection with Old Argyle Road. Governor Belmore rented Throsby Park from 1870 to 1872 to what is commonly believed to escape the summer heat of Sydney. The railway and the Robertson Land Acts encouraged denser settlement by selectors in the Southern Highlands and led to the growth of Moss Vale as a town. In 1877 Sutton Forest railway station was renamed Moss Vale.  Heritage listings  Moss Vale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Church Road: Throsby Park * Main Southern railway: Moss Vale railway station * Main Southern railway 146.037: Argyle Street railway bridge * Oldbury Road: Oldbury Farm Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 8,579 people in Moss Vale. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.6% of the population. * 78.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 4.4%, New Zealand 1.7% and China 1.5%. * 87.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 1.3%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 25.8%, Anglican 24.9% and Catholic 22.1%. Industry Moss Vale holds a large part of the Southern Highlands Industry ‚Äì as well as being a minor centre for agriculture, many light and medium industries are found in and around Moss Vale, including a James Hardie plant, a Harper Collins book distribution centre, and other manufacturing industries. Despite Moss Vale's prowess as an industrial centre, nearby Bowral is the commercial heart of the Southern Highlands. Transport Moss Vale station is the primary southern terminus of the Southern Highlands railway line. The line provides regular services from Moss Vale to southern Sydney, where a change of trains is generally required to access the city centre. Limited services continue south of Moss Vale to Goulburn. The station also has two Sydney to Melbourne services and two Melbourne to Sydney services a day.

He first appears in Darker Image #1 (March 1993) was created by Jim Lee and Brandon Choi. Fictional character biography Michael Cray was born to US Navy Admiral Phillip James Cray and Elizabeth Cray. He has a brother named Alexander. Michael Cray's daughter is Rachel Goldman, aka Sublime, a member of DV8. After his parents were slain by terrorists, he joins the US military to avenge their deaths. He became a Navy SEAL prior to being transferred to International Operation's newly formed Team 7. Like all members of that group, he was a highly experienced Special Forces operative. The team had been sent on a mission (or so they believed) when in reality they were sent to be exposed to the Gen Factor by Miles Craven (head of I.O.). Unlike the other surviving members of Team 7 (not everyone survived the exposure to the gen factor treatment), Michael's powers did not manifest until many years later. Despite the lack of power, he would fight for his teammates, such as taking a Naval officer hostage when the other powered members of Team 7 were literally being nuked as a test (they got through). When the majority of Team 7 went underground (with their families), Cray continues to serve I.O. (as did Lynch, Dane & Backlash). Miles Craven assigns Cray to the Special Operations Group. He did many wetwork and blackbag assignments for them. Michael Cray left I.O. when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He wanted to atone himself for all the innocent men and women he killed during his missions. He got his chance when he became involved with the Order of the Cross. Their adversary, the Black Angel, awoke a demonic entity bent on killing a young boy with miraculous abilities. It turned out that Cray's cancer was, in fact, a result of the Gen-Factor, giving him regenerative abilities. It would also give him the ability to manifest psionic shields to protect himself, but he could not control it and was not even aware it existed. Cray defeated the Black Angel with the help of Sister Mary, a former police officer turned nun, Gabrielle D'Angelo, his ex-wife who had become a vessel for the archangel Gabriel, and several of his Team 7 colleagues. After the death of the Black Angel, the young child restored the damage he had done by rewriting reality, but in the new reality, Gabrielle had died during their honeymoon. Michael spends time working for Rayna Masters, who ran a bodyguard agency called 'Executive Protection Services'. Cray then is involved in the Brothers In Arms incident as Craven goes after all the surviving members of Team 7. Cray also deals with alien forces (Daemonites) who are pursuing keys to an ancient warship. On a Team 7 mission long ago, Cray had actually found one of the keys sticking up out of the mud and took it as a 'souvenir'. Deathblow dies during the Fire From Heaven event, sacrificing himself in order to kill Damocles, the villain from that crossover.Deathblow #29 After the events of Captain Atom: Armageddon and the Worldstorm, Deathblow was revived and began starring in his own series, Deathblow Volume 2, written by Brian Azzarello with art by Carlos D'Anda. During World's End, Deathblow is part of Stormwatch: Post Human Division leading missions on a post-apocalyptic Earth. It's also revealed that, despite being known as \\"powerless\\" in the Worldstorm continuity, his healing factor has evolved to a staggering level: because of his healing factor, he can't die because his body keeps regenerating himself even after receiving wounds deep enough to shut down his biological functions. Jackson King suggested he could even regenerate \\"from a scrap of DNA.\\" Genevieve Cray In the three-issue mini-series, Deathblow Byblows (1999‚Äì2000), written by Alan Moore with art by Jim Baikie, it is revealed that I.O. created several variant clones of each Team 7 member, using the DNA collected from them without their knowledge. In the event of a Team 7 member's death, his clones are released in a simulated environment with the intention that only one survives to act as the member's replacement. However, the series is concerned with Deathblow's clones only. The clones were: *Genevieve Cray ‚Äî a bald female and the series' protagonist *Klaus Cray ‚Äî a cyborg *John-Joe and Joe-John Cray ‚Äî two child clones *Michael Cray, Jr. ‚Äî apparently a true clone *Damon Cray ‚Äî a teenage clone *Caleb Cray ‚Äî half-man, half-baboon *Judgment Cray ‚Äî a clone with an extra Y chromosone *Gemma Cray ‚Äî an expert poisoner *Cynthia Cray ‚Äî a telepath and precognitive All were killed by Judgment except for Genevieve, who killed Judgment and escaped from the laboratory where they were created, and Klaus Cray, who was captured by Genevieve and later killed by John-Joe and Joe-John Cray. Gemma, Cynthia, and Michael Cray, Jr., are never shown alive due to being killed by Judgment Cray before the protagonists discovered them. Genevieve later joined up with Sublime, Michael Cray's daughter, and a few of her DV8 teammates. DC's The New 52 Deathblow appears for the first time in the DC reboot in Grifter's new series, making a team with Cheshire,Grifter #9 (July 2012) but later was betrayed by her revealing she was an undercover agent for Helspont. Captured in Helspont's spaceship, he managed to escape and team up with Grifter to stop his plans.Grifter #12 (October 2012) Deathblow also appears in Teen Titans #23.2, \\"Deathstroke\\". He is first seen competing for an assassination with Deathstroke. The two men engage in combat, but Cray is overpowered and knocked down while Deathstroke finishes the job. He is later seen in Deathstroke's flashback, where Cray has Wilson's back in a battlefield while Wilson sets off a bomb. However, the detonation site turns out to be a children's hospital, which led to Wilson's resignation from the army.Teen Titans #23.2 Deathstroke (September 2013) The Wild Storm Michael Cray is an IO operative for Miles Craven, who finds himself manifesting new abilities while learning of an inoperable brain tumor. Craven promises medical leave and support, but they argue over his failed assassination of Jacob Marlowe and his list of future targets. Cray declares himself a free agent near the end of the series, daring Craven to kill him, which he does.

It was founded in 1876 by five Sisters of Mercy as a boarding school for girls. In 1959, it became coeducational and ended boarding school operations in 1963. The Sisters served in an administrative capacity until 2002, when the first lay head of school was selected by the school's Board of Trustees. Mount de Sales is governed by its trustees and continues to be sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah. History Early history = In 1871 during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, a group of five Sisters of Mercy from Columbus, Georgia, began a small school known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart Jesus on the corner of Fourth and Walnut streets in Macon.https://www.mountdesales.net/about/our-history/ In 1876, the mother house of the Sisters relocated from Columbus to Macon. With help from others, the Sisters purchased the former home of Georgia Governor George W. Town for use at the corner of Orange and Columbus streets on Beall's Hill in downtown Macon. On February 28, 1876, the new school was chartered under the name of Mount de Sales in honor of Saint Francis de Sales. When the first graduation exercises were held in 1882, it had expanded to comprise three divisions: primary, preparatory and senior. It educated mostly girls in grades 1-12, housing boarding students from around the southeastern United States and Latin America.http://www.mountdesales.net/misc/advancement/deSalesSheet_Fall2015.pdf Governor George Towns c. 1880s, the original building and site of Mount de Sales Academy. =Modernization and expansion= Sheridan Hall In 1936, Mount de Sales discontinued its primary school, but continued as a girls' secondary school for boarding and day students until 1959, when the first boys were admitted as day students.https://www.mountdesales.net/about/our-history/ The girls' boarding school closed in 1963 and the school continued as a coeducation day school. The first coeducational graduating class included 16 boys among 46 total graduates in 1963. The fall of 1963 marked the racial integration of Mount de Sales as a result of a diocesan edict, making it the first school in Middle Georgia to desegregate.http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/Vol_65__1964.pdf David J.

The district is a part of the Agra division. History It was named after Firoz Shah Mansab Dar in 1566 during the reign of Mughal Emperor akbar. Tradition holds that while passing through the town on a pilgrimage to Gaya, Raja Todar Mal was attacked by robbers and his possessions stolen. At his request, Akbar sent his Mansabdar Dar Firoz Shah to assist and he landed somewhere near Sukhmalpur ullu. Firoz Shah's tomb and the ruins of Katra Pathanan his residence now known as Mushtaq Manzil provide evidence for the story. The 1596 gazetteer of Agra and Mathura records that Firozabad was upgraded to a Pargana then given to Nabab Sadulla as a jagir during the reign of Shah jahan (r. 1627-1658). Mr. Peter, a businessman, connected with the East India Company visited the town on 9 August 1632 and found it in good condition. Etawah, Budaun, Mainpuri and Firozabad were all first class mansabdars of the emperor Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713-1719). The estate of the Labhowa Jhala Rajas also worked together with the mughal sultanate to capture many regions in the United Provinces, and by 1680 the Rajas of Labhowa had much of Firozabad district under their control. Bajirao Peshwa looted Firozabad and Etmadpur in 1737 in the regime of Mohammad Shah. Jat tribesmen from Mahawan attacked Faujdar Hakim Kajim at Firozabad where they killed him on 9 May 1739, then went on to rule Firozabad for 30 years. Gajuddin, Hidayat Vaksh (son of Alamgir II), his nephew and Mirza Baba his son in law, came to Firozabad. Mirza Nabab Khan stayed here till 1782. At the end of 18th century Firozabad was ruled by Himmat Bahadur Gusain with the cooperation of the Raja of Labhowa. The French Army Chief Marathas D. Wayan established an ordnance factory in Firozabad in November 1794, an event that Thomas Traving mentions in his book Travels in India. Marathas appointed his subadar Lakwadads here who built a fort near the old tehsil. General Lek and General Vellajally attacked Firozabad in 1802. At the beginning of the British regime Firozabad was in the Etawah district and later attached to the Aligarh district. When Sadabad district was created in 1832, Firozabad was made a part of it then later in 1833 the town came under the aegis of Agra district. In 1847 the lakh business flourished in Firozabad. In 1857, the freedom‚Äìfighting Chauhans of Mainpuri, the Jamidar of Chandwar and the local Malahs all took active parts in the Indian Rebellion. Noted Urdu poet Munir Shikohabadi was sentenced to Kala pani by the ruling East India Company. People from this city took part in the Khilafat Movement, the Quit India Movement and the Dandi March with some participants jailed. Mahatma Gandhi visited Firozabad 1929 followed by Semant Gandhi in 1935, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1937 and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1940. The Firozabad district was established on February 2, 1989 by an executive order passed by the Government of Uttar Pradesh.

It is widespread in regions south of the Sahara and also occurs in Madagascar. Taxonomy and evolution The yellow-billed stork is closely related to 3 other species in the genus Mycteria: the American woodstork (Mycteria americana), the milky stork (Mycteria cinerea) and the painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala). It is classified as belonging to one clade with these 3 other speciesPetersKahl, Ibis because they all display remarkable homologies in behavior and morphology. In one analytical study of feeding and courtship behaviours of the wood-stork family, M.P. Kahl attributed the same general ethology to all members of the genus Mycteria, with few species-specific variations. These four species are collectively referred to as the wood-storks, which should not be confused with one alternative common name (wood-stork) for the yellow-billed stork. Before it was established that the yellow-billed stork was closely related to the American woodstork, the former was classified as belonging to the genus Ibis, together with the milky stork and painted stork.Hancock, et al. However, the yellow-billed stork has actually long been recognised as a true storkGarrod, On the form...Garrod, On the disposition... and along with the other 3 related stork species, it should not strictly be called an ibis. Description It is a medium-sized stork standing tall. The body is white with a short black tail that is glossed green and purple when freshly moulted. The bill is deep yellow, slightly decurved at the end and has a rounder cross-section than in other stork species outside the Mycteria. Feathers extend onto the head and neck just behind the eyes, with the face and forehead being covered by deep red skin. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but the male is larger and has a slightly longer heavier bill. Males and females weigh approximately and respectively.Sinclair, et al. Colouration becomes more vivid during the breeding season. In the breeding season, the plumage is coloured pink on the upperwings and back; the ordinarily brown legs also turn bright pink; the bill becomes a deeper yellow and the face becomes a deeper red. Juveniles are greyish-brown with a dull, partially bare, orange face and a dull yellowish bill. The legs and feet are brown and feathers all over the body are blackish- brown. At fledging, salmon-pink colouration in the underwings begins to develop and after about one year, the plumage is greyish-white. Flight feathers on the tail and wing also become black. Later, the pink colouration typical of adult plumage begins to appear. These storks walk with a high- stepped stalking gait on the ground of shallow water and their approximate walking rate has been recorded as 70 steps per minute. They fly with alternating flaps and glides, with the speed of their flaps averaging 177‚Äì205 beats per minute. They usually flap only for short journeys and often fly in a soaring and gliding motion over several kilometres for locomotion between breeding colonies or roosts and feeding sites. By soaring on thermals and gliding by turns, they can cover large distances without wasting much energy. On descending from high altitudes, this stork has been observed to dive deeply at high speeds and flip over and over from side to side, hence showing impressive aerobatics. It even appears to enjoy these aerial stunts. This species is generally non-vocal, but utters hissing falsetto screams during social displays in the breeding season. These storks also engage in bill clattering and an audible ‚Äúwoofing‚Äù wing beat at breeding colonies Nestlings make a loud continual monotonous braying call to beg parental adults for food. Distribution and habitat The yellow-billed stork occurs primarily in Eastern Africa,Kasoma and Pomeroy but is widely distributed in areas extending from Senegal and Somalia down to South Africa and in some regions of western Madagascar.Rand During one observation of a mixed species bird colony on the Tana River in Kenya, it was found to be the commonest species there, with 2000 individuals being counted at once. It does not generally migrate far, at least not out of its breeding range; but usually makes short migratory movements which are influenced by rainfall. It makes local movements in Kenya and has also been found to migrate from North to South Sudan with the rainy season. It may also migrate regularly to and from South Africa. However, little is actually known about this bird's general migratory movements. Due to apparent observed variation in migratory patterns throughout Africa, the yellow-billed stork has been termed a facultative nomad. It may migrate simply to avoid areas where water or rainfall conditions are too high or too low for feeding on prey. Some populations migrate considerable distances between feeding or breeding sites; usually by using thermals to soar and glide. Other local populations have been found to be sedentary and remain in their respective habitats all year round. Its preferred habitats include wetlands, shallow lakes and mudflats, usually 10‚Äì40 cm deep but it usually avoids heavily forested regions in central Africa. It also avoids flooded regions and deep expansive bodies of water because feeding conditions there are unsuitable for their typical grope and stir feeding techniques. This species breeds especially in Kenya and Tanzania. Although it is known to breed in Uganda, breeding sites have not been recorded there. It has been found to breed also in Malakol in Sudan and often inside walled cities in West Africa from Gambia down to northern Nigeria.Bannerman Still other breeding sites include Zululand in South AfricaClancey and northern Botswana,Fraser but are rarer below northern Botswana and Zimbabwe where sites are well-watered. Although there is no direct evidence of current breeding in Madagascar, young birds unable to fly have been observed near Lake Kinkony during October.Langrand Behaviour and ecologyFood and feeding= Their diet comprises mainly small, freshwater fish of about 60-100mm length and maximally 150g,Bell-Cross which they swallow whole. They also feed on crustaceans, worms, aquatic insects, frogs and occasionally small mammals and birds. This species appears to rely mainly on sense of touch to detect and capture prey, rather than by vision. They feed patiently by walking through the water with partially open bills and probe the water for prey. Contact of the bill with a prey item is followed by a rapid snap-bill reflex, whereby the bird snaps shut its mandibles, raises its head and swallows the prey whole. The speed of this reflex in the closely related American woodstork (Mycteria americana) has been recorded as 25 millisecondsKahl and Peacock and although the corresponding reflex in the yellow-billed stork has not been quantitatively measured, the yellow-billed stork's feeding mechanism appears to be at least qualitatively identical to that of the American woodstork. In addition to the snap-bill reflex, the yellow-billed stork also uses a systematic foot stirring technique to sound out evasive prey. It prods and churns up the bottom of the water as part of a ‚Äúherding mechanism‚Äù to force prey out of the bottom vegetation and into the bird's bill. The bird does this several times with one foot before bringing it forwards and repeating with the other foot. Although they are normally active predators, they have also been observed to scavenge fish regurgitated by cormorants. The yellow-billed stork has been observed to follow moving crocodiles or hippopotami through the water and feed behind them, appearing to take advantage of organisms churned up by their quarry.Pooley Feeding lasts for only a short time before the bird obtains its requirements and proceeds to rest again. Parents feed their young by regurgitating fish onto the nest floor, whereupon it is picked up and consumed by the nestlings. The young eat voraciously and an individual nestling increases its body weight from 50 grams to 600 grams during the first ten days of its life. Hence, this species has earned the German colloquial common name ‚ÄúNimmersatt‚Äù; meaning ‚Äúnever full‚Äù. =Breeding behaviour= Breeding is seasonal and appears to be stimulated by the peak of long heavy rainfallBrown and Britton and resultant flooding of shallow marshes, usually near Lake Victoria. This flooding is linked to an increase in prey fish availability; and reproduction is therefore synchronised with this peak in food availability. In such observations near Kisumu, M.P. Kahl's explanation for this trend was that in the dry season, most prey fish are forced to leave the dried-up, deoxygenated marshes that cannot support them and retreat to the deep waters of Lake Victoria where the storks cannot reach them.Kahl, Journal of East African Natural History Society and National Museum However, fish move back up the streams on the onset of rain and spread out over the marshes to breed, where they become accessible to the storks. By nesting at this time and providing that the rains do not end pre-maturely, the storks are guaranteed a plentiful food supply for their young. The yellow- billed stork may also begin nesting and breeding at the end of long rains. This occurs especially on flat extensive marshlands as water levels gradually decrease and concentrate fish sufficiently for the storks to feed on. However, unseasonal rainfall has also been reported to induce off-season breeding in northern BotswanaTree and western and eastern Kenya. Rainfall may cause local flooding and hence ideal feeding conditions. This stork appears to breed simply when rainfall and local flooding are optimal and hence seems to be flexible in its temporal breeding pattern, which varies with rainfall pattern throughout the African continent. As with all stork species, male yellow- billed storks select and occupy potential nest sites in trees, whereupon females attempt to approach the males. The yellow-billed stork has an extensive repertoire of courtship behaviours near and at the nest that may lead to pair formation and copulation. Generally, these courtship behaviours are also assumed to be common to all Mycteria species and show remarkable homology within the genus Mycteria. After the male has initially established at the nesting-site and the female begins to approach, he displays behaviours that advertise himself to her. One of these is the Display Preening, whereby the male pretends to strip down each of his extended wings with the bill several times each side and the bill does not effectively close around the feathers. Another observed display among males is the Swaying-Twig Grasping. Here, the male stands on the potential nesting-site and bends over to gently grasp and release underlying twigs at regular intervals. This is sometimes accompanied by side-to-side oscillations of the neck and head and he continues to pick at twigs in between such movements. Reciprocally, approaching females display their own distinct behaviours. One such behaviour is the Balancing Posture, whereby she walks with a horizontal body axis and extended wings toward the male occupying the nesting-site. Later, when the female continues to approach or already stands near an established male, she may also engage in Gaping. Here, the bill is gaped open slightly with the neck inclined upward at about 45o . and often occurs in conjunction with the Balancing-Posture. This behaviour ordinarily continues if the male accepts the female and has allowed her to enter the nest, but the female usually closes her wings by this time. The male may also continue his Display-Preening when standing next to the female in the nest During copulation, the male steps onto the female's back from the side, hooks his feet over her shoulders, holds out his wings for balance and finally bends his legs to lower himself for cloacal contact, as happens in most birds. In turn, the female holds out her wings almost horizontally. The process is accompanied by bill clattering from the male as he regularly opens and closes his mandibles and vigorously shakes his head to beat his bill against the female's. In turn, the female keeps her bill horizontal with the male's or inclined downward at approximately 45 degrees. Average copulation time in this species has been calculated as 15.7 seconds. The male and female build the nest together either in high trees on dry land away from predators, or in small trees over water. Nest building takes up to 10 days. The nest may be 80‚Äì100 cm in diameter and 20‚Äì30 cm thick. The female typically lays 2-4 eggs (usually 3) on alternate dayshttp://whozoo.org/Intro2002/ShannonList/SAL_YellowBilledStork.htm and average clutch size has been recorded as 2.5. The male and female share duties to incubate the eggs, which takes up to 30 days. As in many other stork species,Sch√ºzKahl, Ecological Monographs hatching is asynchronous (usually at 1- to 2-day intervals), so that the young in the brood differ considerably in body size at any one time. During food shortage, the smaller young are at risk of being outcompeted for food by their larger nest-mates. Both parents share duties of guarding and feeding the young until the latter are about 21 days old. Thereafter, both parents forage to attend to the young's intense food demands. Alongside parental feeding by regurgitation of fish, parents have also been observed to regurgitate water into the open bills of their nestlings,Stronach especially on hot days. This may aid the typical thermoregulatory strategy of the young (common to all stork species) to excrete dilute urine down their legs in response to hot weather. Water regurgitated over the young serves as a water supplement in addition to fluid in their food, so that they have sufficient water to continue urinating down their legs to avoid hyperventilation. Additionally, parents sometimes help keep the young cool by shading them with their open wings. The nestlings usually fledge after 50‚Äì55 days of hatching and fly away from the nest. However, after leaving the nest for the first time, the offspring often return there to be fed by their parents and roost with them for another 1‚Äì3 weeks. It is also thought that individuals are not fully adult until 3 years old and despite lack of data, new adults are thought to not breed until much later than this. Fledglings have also been observed to not differ considerably in their foraging and feeding strategies from adults. In one investigation, four adult, hand-reared yellow-billed storks kept in captivity showed typical grope-feeding and foot stirring shortly after they were introduced to bodies of water. Hence, this suggests that such feeding techniques in this species are innate. These birds breed colonially, often alongside other species;Brown, et al. but the yellow-billed stork is sometimes the only occupant species of a nesting site. A subset of up to 20 individuals may nest close together in any one part of a colony; with several males occupying potential nest sites all in the same place. If many of these males do not acquire mates, the whole group moves on with the unpaired females to another tree. These ‚Äúbachelor parties‚Äù are a noticeable feature of colonies of this species and usually consist of 12 or more males and at least as many females. As many as 50 nests have been counted all at once in a single breeding area. =Other behaviours= Despite their gregariousness during breeding, most individuals generally ignore each other outside nesting-sites; although some hostile encounters may occur. Some of these encounters involve one individual showing an unambiguous attack or escape response if there is a large difference in social status between the two individuals. However, if two individuals are equally matched, they slowly approach each other and show a ritualised display called the Forward Threat. Here, one individual holds its body forward horizontally and retracts the neck so that it touches the crown, with the tail cocked at 45 degrees and all feathers erect. It approaches the opponent and points its bill at it, sometimes gaping. If the opponent does not capitulate, the attacker may grab at it with its bill and the two may briefly spar with their bills until one retreats in an erect stance with compressed plumage. Hostility can also arise between opposite sexes when a female approaches a male on a potential nest site. Both sexes may display a similar aforementioned Forward Threat, but clatter their bills after grabbing with them at the other stork and extend their wings to maintain balance. Another hostile behaviour between sexes is the Snap Display, whereby they snap horizontally with their bills while standing upright. This may occur during and immediately after pair formation, but subsides later in the breeding cycle as the male and female become familiar with each other and it eventually disappears. Nestlings show remarkable behavioural transformations at 3 weeks of age. During the constant parental attendance before this time, the young show little fear or aggression in response to intruders (such as a human observer), but are found to merely crouch low and quietly in the nest. After this time, when both parents go foraging and leave the young in the nest, a nestling shows strong fear in response to an intruder. It either attempts to climb out of the nest to escape or acts aggressively toward the intruder. Threats and survival As well as being abundant and widespread, the yellow-billed stork also appears tolerant of short-term natural habitat changes. However, in East Africa, it is known to be at risk from poaching and habitat reduction despite abundance and population stability and is listed under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA). Nevertheless, the overall population is not currently considered to be threatened with serious decline, especially since breeding success is relatively high. In East Africa where it is most abundant, broods of 1-3 per nest have been recorded. Alongside human activities, natural enemies include cheetahs, leopards and lions, which all sometimes prey on this species.http://www.desertusa.com/animals/stork.html Eggs may be also at risk of predation by African fish eagles.Parsons At one colony in Kisumu, Kenya, approximately 61% of eggs counted between all nests hatched and 38% were predated by fish eagles. The success rate of fledglings was only 0.33 young per nest. However, increased egg predation by fish eagles has been reported to be linked to decline in fish stocks in the Winam Gulf. In culture or relationships to humans The yellow-billed stork has appeared on postage stamps in several African countries.http://www.bird- stamps.org/cspecies/2200300.htm Status This species is evaluated as Least Concern for several reasons. First, population trend appears to be decreasinghttp://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3826 but this decrease is not believed to rapidly approach thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion. Its range is also very large and does not approach threshold for Vulnerable under range size criterion. Finally, although there have been no official population size estimates, the population is known to be very large and so does not approach thresholds for Vulnerable under population size criterion.

Established in 1916 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education, the school currently caters for approximately 920 students from Year 7 to Year 12. For first year entry, students must sit the Selective High Schools Test and are offered admission into the school based on academic merit.  History  Entrance to the school, in April 2007 In June 1913 it was decided that Kogarah would be a suitable site for a new high school. On 31 October 1914, the land occupied by the cottage ‚ÄòHarrow Villa‚Äô was purchased from its owner. This cottage with portable buildings added became the temporary St George Girls High School. St George Girls High School officially opened in February 1916 with 143 students and nine teachers.  Annual events  Important annual events on the St George calendar include: * Swimming and Athletics Carnivals * The Walkathon * SRC Week * Drama Night, showcasing the talents of Drama students * Senior Drama Night, showcasing talents of Year 12 Drama * 'Inspired' Night, a textiles and design fashion parade * The Summer Music Festival in conjunction with the Multicultural Food Festival * Gala Music Festival * SRC School Dance (with Sydney Technical High School) * The \\"Listen\\" concerts, which include the Stage Band, Orchestra and Concert Band * The \\"Sing\\" concerts, which comprise the Vocal Ensemble and the Singing Tutorial girls  Organisations  The School has four school organisations which provide support to the school: * P & C Association - St George Girls High School Parents & Citizen' Association takes an active interest in the welfare and education of students. When possible, they have a guest speaker. * St Georgians - The St Georgians is the association for ex-students of the school to meet regularly. * Prefects - At St George Girls High School, there are 15 School Prefects, of them are two Vice Captains and one School Captain. These students are nominated and voted by their fellow Year 12 peers and lead in the planning events for their cohort and the wider school community. * Student Representative Council (SRC) - St George Girls High School has an active Student Representative Council (SRC). Students from each year elect representatives from their class to represent them at SRC meetings. The SRC consists of four Year 11 students selected by the students of the school. In the past, the SRC has participated in charities such as Daffodil Day, Jeans for Genes day and Pink Ribbon day as well as fundraising activities such as the Walkathon, Gelato Days and Mufti Days. Money raised from school fundraising activities is used for improvements within the school. Recent SRC projects include planting of trees for shade, purchasing teaching resources in the school and providing additional seating arrangements around the school quadrangles. Associated schools Although St George Girls High School is an all-girls school, Sydney Technical High School is often referred to as their male counterpart. Being the 'Brother School' of St George Girls High School, Sydney Technical High School often engages in joint SRC fundraising activities. Examples of these include SRC school dances, the St George vs. Sydney Tech netball game during SRC week, as well as P&C; meetings.

Taxonomy and systematics The milky stork was formerly placed in the genus Ibis, with the binomial name Ibis cinereus, but is now included in the Mycteria due to large similarities in appearance and behaviour to the three other storks in this genus (the wood stork, yellow-billed stork and painted stork). Phylogenetic studies based on DNA hybridization and cytochrome oxidase b have demonstrated that the milky stork shares a clade with other Mycteria, and forms a sister pair of species with the painted stork. DescriptionAdult= This medium stork stands 91‚Äì97 cm tall, making it slightly smaller than the closely related painted stork.Hancock JA, Kushlan JA, Kahl, MP. (1992). Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World. Academic Press. The adult plumage is completely white except for black flight feathers of the wing and tail, which also have a greenish gloss. Wing length measures 435‚Äì500 mmDelacour J, Jabouille P. (1931).Les oiseaux de I‚ÄôIndochine Francaise, 1‚Äì4. Paris: Exposition Coloniale Internationale.Kuroda N. (1936). Birds of the Island of Java. Tokyo. and the tail measures 145‚Äì170 mm. The extensive white portion of the plumage is completely suffused with a pale creamy yellow during the breeding season, hence the term ‚Äúmilky‚Äù. This creamy tint is absent from the plumage during breeding.Elliot A. (1992). \\"Family Ciconiidae (storks)\\", pp. 436‚Äì465 in del Hoyo J, Elliot A, Sargatal J. (eds.) Handbook of the birds of the world. Vol. I. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. The wing coverts and back feathers are paler and have an almost white terminal band. The bare facial skin is greyish or dark maroon; with black, irregular blotches. During breeding, the bare facial skin is deep wine red with black markings on the lores by the bill base and gular region, with a ring of brighter red skin around the eye. Soon after courtship, the facial skin fades to paler orange-red. Breeding birds also show a narrow pinkish band of bare skin along the underside of the wing. The downcurved bill is dull pinkish yellow and sometimes tipped white. The culmen length measures 194 ‚Äì 275mm.Robinson HC, Chasen FN. (1936). The Birds of the Malay Peninsula, Vol. 3. HF and G Witherby, London. The legs are a dull red-flesh colour, with the tarsi measuring 188 ‚Äì 225mm. It has long thick toes that probably serve to increase surface area of its feet and therefore reduce pressure from standing and walking on the soft mud of its foraging area, so that the bird does not sink considerably when foraging and feeding. During courtship, the bill turns deep yellow, with a greyish tan on the basal third; and the legs become deep magenta. The sexes are similar, but the average male is slightly larger with a longer, thinner bill. The adult is readily recognisable in the field by its white head feathers, yellow-orange bill and pink legs. It is distinguished from other waders such as egrets and lesser adjutants by its extensively white body plumage and black wing coverts.Iqbal M. 2008. Survey and conservation of milky stork Mycteria cincerea in Sumatra Indonesia. Final report to Rufford Small Grant. However, the milky stork resembles and may therefore be confused with the partly sympatric Asian Openbill and various white egret species. Nevertheless, the egrets are smaller and completely white, and the Asian Openbill is also smaller and distinguished from the milky stork by the grey bill. In the northern part of its range around Vietnam, milky storks occasionally occur in sympatry with the closely related and morphologically similar painted storks. However, the painted stork is distinguished from the milky stork in adult plumage by the former's black and white breast band and wing coverts, pink inner secondaries, more restricted bare head skin, and generally brighter soft part colouration. Like other storks, the milky stork usually soars on thermals to travel between areas. Flocks of up to a dozen birds can be seen soaring on thermals at great heights between 10:00 and 14:00. At breeding colonies and feeding grounds, flight is contagious in that take-off by one bird is quickly followed by others. Average flapping rate has been estimated at 205 beats per minute. =Juvenile = At hatching, the chicks are covered with white down. Contour feathers begin to appear by 10‚Äì14 days, and the chicks become fully feathered with full plumage after 4‚Äì6 weeks. This plumage is typically pale greyish brown with a white lower back, rump and tail coverts; some white downy feathers remaining under the wings and underside of the body; black wing and tail feathers with a white and dark brown wing lining; distinct feathering on the greyish brown head, and dull yellow bare parts. After about 10 weeks when juveniles have fledged, loss of head feathers begins; and the dark, bare areas on the forehead and sides of the head around the eyes become visible. These dark bare areas are sometimes interspersed with dull orange spots. Nestlings also have a dark brownish grey bill and skin around the bill and eye. By the age of three months, the previously feathered head is now completely bald and the dull bill has become warm yellow with a greenish yellow tip. Both features are characteristic of adults. Milky stork juveniles appear almost identical to painted stork juveniles, but are said to be distinguishable from painted stork juveniles by their paler underwing lining contrasting with the completely black flight feathers, whereas this underwing lining is completely black in painted storks. =Other features= The milky stork is usually silent during non-breeding. At nests, individuals utter a falsetto ‚Äúfizz‚Äù call during the Up-Down display. The young utter a froglike croak when begging for food. Especially in captivity in National Zoo of Malaysia, Singapore Zoo and Dusit Zoo, milky storks and painted interbred to produce hybrid offspring.Li D, Wei Z, Yatim SH, Howes J, Ilias R. (2006). Status overview and recommendations for the conservation of milky stork Mycteria cinerea in Malaysia. Final report of the 2004/2006 milky stork surveys in the Matang Mangrove Forest, Perak, Malaysia. These hybrids apparently vary in appearance through different combinations of milky stork and painted stork phenotypes in varying proportions. Because these hybrid juveniles are not readily distinguishable from pure-bred juveniles based on morphology, molecular methods have been used to detect possible hybrids. Compared to the parent painted stork, the adult hybrid has a pink rather than orange bill and head. Adult hybrids may also have some small black spots on the white wing and a subtle pink tinge on the feathers. Across all ages in this species, the iris is dark brown; and the legs are pinkish, but appear white due to a covering of the birds‚Äô excreta. Distribution and habitat The milky stork's range is restricted to Southeast Asia, where it is widely but patchily distributed. It occurs in Sumatra (its global stronghold), Java, Sulawesi, eastern Malaysia, Cambodia, southern Vietnam (where it probably largely recolonised after the war of 1963‚Äì75), Bali, Sumbawa, Lombok and Buton. It historically occurred in southern Thailand,Byers O, Brouwer K, Coulter M, Seal US. (1995). Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Conservation Assignment Management Plan: Working Document. IUCN/SSC Conservation Breeding Specialist Group: Apple Valley, MN. but is now very likely extinct here.Treesucon U, Round PD. (1990). Report on threatened birds in Thailand. Tiger Paper 7: 1‚Äì9. One perfect adult male milky stork specimen from Setul in Peninsula Thailand taken from 1935 was later found among collections of the Zoological Reference Collection at the National University of Singapore, suggesting that the species was formerly resident here. The discovered specimen was the first, and probably also the last milky stork to be reported from Thailand, although this stork probably still occasionally visits Thailand as a vagrant. It is also vagrant elsewhere to countries such as Bali and Sumbawa, and is resident on Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi (all within Indonesia). The milky stork was first reported on Sulawesi when a group of five apparently resident individuals was sighted there in 1977. The island of Madura may also support an important population after 170 individuals were sighted there in 1996. The milky stork previously ranged more widely throughout Southeast Asia. For example, it was formerly widely distributed along the coasts of the Malaysian Peninsula, but is now restricted to Matang Mangrove Forest in Perak. The milky stork is predominantly a lowland coastal species throughout its range; where it inhabits mangrove, freshwater and peat swamps, and estuaries. The only proven breeding records however are reported from mangroves bordering the feeding grounds.Danielsen F, Skov H. (1986). Observations of waterbirds along the coast of South-east Sumatra. Copenhagen, Denmark. Mimeographed. It forages on tidal mudflats, in shallow saline or freshwater pools, freshwater marshes, fishponds, rice fields; and on backswamps along river floodplains up to 15 km from the coast. The milky stork's breeding habitat requirements are extensive and undisturbed mangrove (and probably also riverine or dryland) forest with tall, outstanding trees behind it; and shallow pools within the forest for juveniles to forage in.Allport GA, Wilson S-A. (1984). Results of a census of the milky stork Mycteria cinerea in West Java: report of the Indonesian Waterbird Survey Expedition, July‚ÄìOctober 1984. Cambridge, UK: International Council for Bird Preservation (Study Report 14), University of East Anglia. The tall trees are also used for resting, and there should be sufficient individual limbs from which to take off. With a lack of such suitable trees, manmade alternatives such as cart wheels mounted on poles have been proposed. In Peninsula Malaysia, the milky stork is more exclusively marine than the congeneric painted stork. However, the two species‚Äô ranges are said to overlap in the marshy plains of Cambodia, where they probably use the same habitats. Migration and other movements The milky stork probably undertakes short seasonal migration outside the breeding season, but little is known of the timing and path of such movements. Local migrations by milky storks (and several other wader species) may be caused by onset of drought in the dry season. In Cambodia however, it disperses during the wet season from Tonle Sap lake probably to the coast. Milky storks are reported migrating from Sumatra to Java, and across the Sunda Straits, in September and October. Although these apparent migrations are not extensively mapped, milky stork flocks are reported to range over 200 km in a day. Adults breeding on the Javan island of Pulau Rambut have also been noted to commute daily on and off the island to feed at the fishponds and rice fields on the Javan mainland. The breeding colony on Pulau Rambut may also be irregularly visited by varying numbers of migrants throughout the year. Behaviour and ecologyBreeding= left Breeding typically occurs after the rains during the dry season that can last from April to November. The onset of breeding can vary in timing throughout the species‚Äô range, but usually lasts for three months and probably coincides with maximum fish stocks and density following fish reproduction in the rainy season. In South Sumatra for example, the milky stork can breed June‚ÄìSeptember, and has been observed in breeding plumage in May, or as early as February. Breeding is probably slightly earlier in Java given that eggs have been found in nests here as early as March, with one report of a clutch fledging in July (Hoogerwerf, 1936). Breeding in Java is however probably commonest July‚ÄìAugust. At Tonle Sap in Cambodia, egg-laying can begin in January and February where the dry season begins even earlier.Parr JW, K Eames, JC Sun Hean, Chamnan Hong, Som Han, Vi La Pich and Kim Hout Seng. (1996). Biological and socio-economic aspects of waterbird exploitation and natural resource utilization at Prek Toal, Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia. Bangkok: IUCN. In Malaysia, eggs have been found in nests exclusively in August. The milky stork breeds colonially in mangrove swamps, with breeding colonies ranging in size from 10‚Äì20 to a few hundred nests. In Java, breeding colonies of 75‚Äì100 nests have been estimated to cover 4.5 ha, with 5‚Äì8 nests per tree within colonies having been recorded. The height of the nest above the ground notably varies. Nests are commonly built in tall Avicennia marina and other Avicennia tree species in Java, and Rhizosphora apiculata trees in Sumatra, in both cases usually 6‚Äì14 m above ground, but sometimes in the very tops of trees. Nests on Pulau Rambut are built in tops of outstanding mangrove trees 30 m high. Similar nesting characteristics were observed on the island of Pulau Dua when the species still bred there. In Indonesia, some milky storks nest close to the ground in dense shrubs of Acrostichum mangrove ferns 2-6m above the ground. Milky storks also commonly nest in dead or dying mangrove trees. Further, some colonies in South Sumatra have been located far inland at brackish lakes or freshwater swamps in Alstonia trees reaching up to 60 m high. The nests are sturdy, bulky structures measuring about 50 cm in diameter and predominantly comprising medium live sticks of Avicenna species on which many leaves are still attached. These nests resemble those of the grey heron and the white ibis but are slightly more robust and comprise thicker twigs. However, other nests found have been small and flimsy structures that resemble those of doves. When collecting nesting material, milky storks break off live branches from trees by grasping the branch with their bill and flying upwards a short distance, which appears to be a difficult task and sometimes unsuccessful. If the stork does not manage the free the branch, it moves on to another one. Nest building continues even with young in the nest. Clutch sizes range from 1‚Äì4 eggs, but 2‚Äì3 eggs are typical. Egg dimensions measure 59.0‚Äì74.5 mm in length and 43.0‚Äì48.0 mm in width, are relatively small compared to the adult body size, and resemble those of Leptoptilos javanicus, but are slightly paler. The incubation period is estimated at 27‚Äì30 days. Several days can elapse between the hatching of the first and last egg, so that the oldest and youngest chicks differ considerably in size. The clutch is alternately brooded by the male and female. When parents exchange nest duties, the returning parent and brooding parent greet each other with loud, rapid bill clattering, accompanied by deep head bowing and neck stretching. In response to disturbances at the nest, the brooding bird gives an arching display that typically resembles that in other Mycteria species. Courtship consists of repeated bowing and bill-raising from both partners, who stand opposite each other and perform this display in a mirror action. Many displays at the nest resemble those of other Mycteria species. The male at the nest advertises to the arriving female using display preening, whereupon the female responds with a balancing posture and gaping. An up-down greeting display from both partners follows the arrival of one partner at the nest, and the male adopts a flying-around display upon female arrival. Both partners at the nest retract the skin of their head to expose two or three times as much bare skin as between displays when the skin hangs loosely. In South Sumatra, it is found to breed alongside lesser adjutants, black-headed ibis and various heron species. In Cambodia, milky storks have been reported breeding alongside painted storks, lesser adjutants and spot-billed pelicans in flooded forest around Tonle Sap during the early dry season in January and February. Colonies here are situated in mangrove backswamps 1‚Äì4 km from the coast in dense Archostichum ferns or dead trees. Breeding in Malaysia is probably at best scarce and unsuccessful. Several adult storks were observed in breeding plumage at Kuala Gula in July 1984, and about 20 nests were reported there in 1989 together with an increasing adult population. Before these observations, signs of breeding in this species had not been recorded since 1935. However, no juveniles have been seen in Malaysia since 1983, and the apparent lack of breeding success has probably been due to high predation pressure. Breeding no longer occurs on the Javan Island of Pulau Dua. Since the mid-1970s, this island has been connected with the Javan mainland through rapid coastal accretion; whereupon easy human access led to large-scale deforestation for firewood harvest. Breeding ceased due to removal of suitable nesting habitat of tall trees. However, individuals have still been seen on the island in courtship and there have been suggestions that the breeding status could be restored here through rigorous conservation measures. Some breeding still occurs on Pulau Rambut; a few breeding pairs were observed here at Jakarta Bay in 2014. Young captive milky storks can become sexually mature from three months of age, but breeders at this age appear precocious and inexperienced; so that actual breeding age is probably slightly older. In its natural habitat, young storks begin to leave their natal breeding grounds at 3‚Äì4 months of age. Especially in captivity, the milky stork is further found to occasionally breed with the painted stork. One hybrid of a male lesser adjutant and female milky stork was also hatched at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore. =Food and feeding= The milky stork's diet is diverse. In Malaysia, the core of the diet appears to comprise mudskippers of Periophthalmus and Gobiidae 10‚Äì23 cm long; although catfish Arius spp. may be a main dietary component in South Sumatra. Other prey recorded from South Sumatra include milkfish, giant mudskipper (Periophthalmodon schlosseri), mullet species of Moolgards and Chelon, eel catfish Plotosus canius, fourfinger threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum and Chinese silver pomfret Pampus chinesis. Snakes and frogs are reportedly also taken for food, especially to feed to young. Parents feed nestlings large fishes, eels and mudskippers up to 20 cm long. In Sumatra, the elongate mudskipper Pseudapocryptes elongates was the most common prey found in nests Other prey found in nests include the Indian prawn and one clupeid fish species Thryssa dussumieri. The young eat voraciously; small young up to two weeks old can be fed by the parent bird up to four times in two hours, but older young less often. Because feeding begins before all young have hatched, the youngest (and smallest) chicks are competitively disadvantaged and commonly die of starvation, especially since the parent bird does not appear to distribute food equally among the brood. At high temperatures, adults sometimes bring water to the nest and drool it from their bills over the nestlings for cooling and drinking. Milky storks also appear to exploit commercial shrimp as food. Active shrimp ponds usually last for three months before drying, whereupon remaining shrimp are exposed on the bottom as water level recedes, and milky stork and other waders come to feed on the remaining shrimps. Such a feeding advantage could become increasingly available as land-based aquaculture expands in Kuala Gula. In Java, they are also reported to feed at fishponds, especially after the dry season when waters have receded to uncover mud expanses suitable for their feeding.Allport GA, Wilson S-A. (1984). Results of a census of the milky stork Mycteria cinerea in West Java: report of the Indonesian Waterbird Survey Expedition, July‚ÄìOctober 1984. Cambridge, UK: International Council for Bird Preservation (Study Report 14), University of East Anglia These manmade environments may however disfavour breeding. The milky stork's daily food intake has been estimated at 630 g wet weight, which may be able to be met within two hours at maximum foraging intensity. Various feeding mechanisms have been noted in this stork. However, as in other Mycteria, the milky stork locates and captures prey predominantly by sense of touch, usually by bill groping or direct bill probing. Because food location is primarily tactile, foraging is most efficient at high prey concentrations. The groping method consists of walking slowly through shallow water with the partially open bill submerged about three quarters in the water. The stork rapidly shuts its mandibles when a prey item touches the groping till, raises its head and quickly swallows the item whole after some tossing. After swallowing a large fish, the stork may rest for up to one minute before resuming foraging. Alternatively, the bird may stand passively at the water's edge with its half-open bill steadily submerged in the water where waves are present, so that water flows through the bird's mandibles. The milky stork also sometimes draws its bill through the water in an arc side-to-side when standing or walking, until the bill touches a prey item. Another common tactile feeding method in this stork is direct probing of its bill around deep holes in the mud. With partially open mandibles, the bird inserts and partially withdraws its bill from the mud for 5‚Äì32 seconds per hole. The bill is often inserted into the mud three quarters up the bill length, but sometimes along the full or up to the eyes. Other foraging methods observed in this stork are prey herding mechanisms typical of other Mycteria species. One of these is foot stirring, whereby the stork stands on one leg and disturbs the river bed with the foot of the opposite leg; which may drive aquatic prey from places inaccessible to the storks. Milky storks also forage in flocks at high prey density, whereby they cooperatively flush fish in shallow water to divert them to their half-open bills; as has been observed in Java. Milky storks also often feed in aggregations alongside other wading bird species such as lesser adjutant and egrets. This stork occasionally detects aquatic prey by direct visual searching. During and after the local rainy season, which lasts from November to March, individuals apparently forage in great numbers in the inundated rice fields; and lower numbers of individuals observed at the coast may reflect the more favourable feeding conditions further inland. Sightings have been regularly reported along the Batang Hari River 50 km from the coast. During breeding, juveniles commonly forage near the breeding colony in shallow mangrove pools with high fish density. =Other behavior= During high tide, individuals often roost in mangrove trees or in remnant trees on rice fields. Roosting also occurs in crowns of tall mangrove trees and on the ground on intertidal mudflats and marshes. Between foraging activities, individuals have been observed standing in shaded spots or in the sun adopting a wings drooped position. Common comfort movements in the milky stork include allopreening between breeding partners and head shaking. Individuals perched near incubating partners also carrying out head rubbing, whereby the stork oils the bare head skin on its preen gland and then rubs its head on its plumage. Threats and survival The global milky stork population has been declining substantially, especially from the late 1980s, and has been largely attributable to habitat destruction and disturbance through mangrove deforestation for human activities such as fish farming, tidal rice cultivation, timber exploitation, and in Indonesia, human resettlement. Deforestation has led to a lack of suitable mature trees for the species to nest in and thereby affected breeding success. Breeding colonies have also declined through increased illegal international trade in this bird from the mid-1980s and, especially in South Sumatra, poaching of eggs and juveniles for human consumption. Juveniles in particular have been sold to and purchased by zoos in Singapore, Kula Lampur, Brunei, and several European zoos. The milky stork is said to be generally vulnerable to human disturbance, which may also explain the marked widespread decline of this species. Although fishponds and shrimp farms, for example, can provide additional feeding grounds and therefore allow feeding opportunism for this species, presence of these manmade structures can disturb nearby breeding and therefore affect the population in the long term. The milky stork was essentially eliminated from Vietnam through widespread destruction of mangrove swamps during the Southeast Asian War in 1963‚Äì75. Subsequent large-scale reforestation may however have led to some recolonization; although the species has also suffered long-term effects of herbicide application in Southern Vietnam in later years. This stork has various natural predators. In South Sumatra, monitor lizards, especially Varanus salvator, have been reported to predate milky stork eggs and juveniles. Crocodiles Crocodilus porosus also sometimes eat young milky storks. In Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia, brahminy kites, water monitor lizards and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus are potential (nest) predators and probably contribute to low survival here. In captivity in Malaysia, the milky stork may also be potentially threatened by the crab- eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), which is a potential predator of stork eggs and chicks, and whose range has gradually expanded here. This monkey could swim across to nest sites surrounded by water, as they have done for captive grey herons. On Pulau Rambut, potential predators include reticulated python, cat snakes (especially Boiga dendrophila and Brahminy kite. White bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster and monitor lizard are also reported to predate chicks here.Imanudin A, Mardiastuti A. (2003). Ekologi bangau bluwok Mycteria cinerea di Suaka Margasatwa Pulau Rambut, Jakarta. Fakultas Kehutanan IPB/Disney Wildlife Conservation/Wildlife Trust. Another potential threat to the milky stork is contamination of its natural habitat with elevated concentrations of ions of metals such as copper, zinc and lead. Sources of this observed contamination include use of agrochemicals in Kuala Gula, corrosion and runoff from jetties and boats coated with these metals, and aquaculture development. On Pulau Rambut, breeding colonies might also be threatened by increasing sea pollution. Population recovery for this species has relied largely on captive breeding. In 1987, the first captive breeding and reintroduction project for the milky stork was initiated in Zoo Negara in Malaysia (a country where the wild milky stork population declined by over 90% from the 1980s to 2005) from a small young group of five males and five females received from Singapore Zoo and Johor Zoo. From these 10 individuals, the captive population increased to over 100 individuals by 2005. Therefore, with the decline in the wild milky stork population in Malaysia since the 1980s, the captive, free-flying population has steadily risen. The first successful milky stork reintroduction was carried out in Kuala Selangor Nature Park in 1998 with the release of 10 captive-bred individuals here. Matang Mangrove Forest in Malaysia has been a popular candidate reintroduction site because this area is considered a suitable milky stork habitat in terms of shelter, breeding and feeding grounds; and there are apparently minimal threats from predators and parasites. The area is also protected and systematically managed, and raw materials are sustainably harvested here. However, captive individuals released into their natural habitat face new potential threats such as susceptibility to disease, lack of ability to hunt for food and defend territory, and lack of ability to effectively detect and evade potential predators. These released individuals may also harbour disease and parasites that could harm wild populations. Particularly for captive individuals, there is the risk of a loss of genetic integrity through hybridization with painted storks in captivity or in the wild in the northern parts of the milky stork range where it may co-occur with the painted stork. Where successful, conservation of this species in the wild has relied on maintaining an integrated network of wetland preserves, as has been done in reforestation and protection schemes in Vietnam that may have led to some recolonization by the species. Raising public awareness for this species and its threatened status has also been identified as an indispensable action for successful conservation. In culture and relationship to humans The milky stork is well known among Indonesian locals and is readily distinguished by them in the field from other waders; although it has at least historically been commonly (and sometimes illegally) harvested for meat and eggs. Like many other wading bird species, the milky stork is also sometimes considered a minor pest in the aquaculture industry by feeding on commercial fish and shrimps.Kushlan JA, Hafner H. (2000). Heron Conservation. San Diego, California: Academic Press. This stork is however officially protected in Malaysia and Indonesia and has been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1987. This stork has occasionally appeared in zoos such as Vienna Zoo and Washington Park Zoo, with the latter having held the longest living milky stork specimen, which lived for 12 years, 4 months and 18 days (1937‚Äì1950). Many juvenile zoo specimens have been misidentified as young painted storks on purchase, and later proved to be milky storks. The only zoos which are recorded as having bred the species are Zoo Negara (where the stork bred in captivity for the first time in 1987), San Diego Zoo and Singapore Zoo. Captive breeding and reintroduction programmes for this stork have been widely supported by government and non-government agencies such as Perhilitan,the Malaysian Nature Society and the Malaysian Zoological Society. A milky stork in flight features on the logo of Sembilang National Park. It has also commonly appeared on calendars and posters in public awareness campaigns in Sumatra. Status In 2008, the global population was fewer than 2200 individuals, which is a reduction from approximately 5000 in the 1980s. In Malaysia, population counts decreased steadily from over 100 individuals in 1984 to less than 10 by 2005 (by over 90%), so that the population here faces local extinction. Of the current world population estimate, there are probably about 1600 individuals in Sumatra, less than 500 on Java, and less than 100 on the southeast Asian mainland. The Cambodian population is very small, numbering 100‚Äì150 individuals; and although it may be relatively stable, rapid declines are expected if serious threats persist. Due to the substantial population declines across its range, the milky stork's population status was elevated to Endangered from Vulnerable in 2013 by the IUCN.

Mainpuri town is the district headquarters. It consists of six tehsils, namely Mainpuri, Bhongaon, Karhal, Kishni, kurawali and Ghiror. Mainpuri forms part of ancient legendary region of Lord Krishna's land called Braj. It is bounded on the North by Etah District, on the East by District Farrukkhabad and Kannauj, on the South by District Etawah and on West by the District Firozabad and Etah. It lies between north latitude 260 53‚Ä≤ to 270 31‚Ä≤ and east longitude 780 27‚Ä≤ to 790 26‚Ä≤. According to the 2011 census Mainpuri district has a population of 1,847,194. The district has a population density of 670 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,700/sq mi). Mainpuri has a sex ratio of 876 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 78.26%.  History  Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj, and after the fall of that famous state it was divided into a number of petty principalities, of which Rapri and Bhongaon were the chief. In 1194 Rapri was made the seat of a Muslim governor. Mainpuri fell to the Mughal's on Baber‚Äôs invasion in 1526, and, although temporarily wrested from them by the short- lived Afghan dynasty of Shere Shah, was again occupied by them on the reinstatement of Humayun after the victory of Panipat. Like the rest of the lower Doab, Mainpuri passed, towards the end of the 18th century, into the power of the Mahrattas, and finally became a portion of the province of Oudh. When this part of the country was ceded to the British, in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of the extensive district of Etawah, which was in 1856 reduced by the formation of Etah and Mainpuri into separate collectorates. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in.1857 the regiment stationed at Mainpuri revolted and attacked the town, which was successfully defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week, until the arrival of the Jhansi mutineers made it necessary to abandon the district. Kak Nadi, Senghar Nadi, Sehar Nadi these are some old rivers which dried out.  Culture and heritage  The ethnic city, Mainpuri, was ruled by the Mughals, Marathas, Afghans and Nawabs in various time periods. Among them, the Mughal and Nawabs influenced the culture of the city vastly. The music, dance, architecture, arts and crafts flourished under their rule.

Geography  The district generally presents the appearance of an extensive level plain broken only by the sand ridges on the western border, the rolling sand hills and undulations of the Kali and Isan rivers, and the ravines along the Yamuna to the south-west. The Kali Nadi forms the boundary of this plain on the north and north-east and the Yamuna encloses it on the south-west. Both these rivers flow towards the south-east, and between them. The general slope of the country from north-west to south-east.Taking the district from north to south. Generally speaking the soils of the district are typical of those found elsewhere in the Indo-Gangtic plain, and are classified on two principles according as the distinctions recognised are natural or artificial. Both are well understood and commonly employed by the cultivator. Of the natural divisions Bhur is the name of the soil containing a large proportion of sand, while Matyar is the name of that containing a large proportion of clay, and between these two exterms is a loamy soil called Domat having clay and sand more evenly divided as its name implies. A lighter soil than Domat is known as Pilia, coming between Domal and Bhur.The barren soil known as Usher found at the heads and partly down the courses of the smaller rivers such as Ahnaiya and Puraha, the Sengar and Arind and the numerous minor esteems, and appears to be a clay deposit too compact to permit of cultivation in places too impregnated with Reh and other deleterious minerals substances to permit growth of even grass. Waste Land : The barren land consists for the most part of usar plains. Forests : Total area covered in the district is 2154 hectare. A considerable area of the barren land is covered with dark jungle. A great deal of waste land covered with the coarse grass known locally as ganra (gandhar) or sinkh . The ganra is used for thatching and for making ropes and mats. The babul grows in large clumps on the user plains and is, indeed, the only tree which flourishes on them. Its cultivation has for some time past been encouraged by the increase of moisture due to the canals and the great demand for wood both for fuel and carpentry. Its timber is hard and close- grained and is much used for building purposes, fuel and charcoal.  Water Bodies  Kali Nadi = The Kali Nadi forms the north-eastern boundary of the district separating it from Etah and Farukkhabad. It is a narrow stream, but perennial, and even during the spring and summar month is only fordable at certain places there is a bridge of 545 feet spans on the Farukkhabad road. = Isan = Next to the Kali comes the Isan, which is here a considerable stream, fordable only in a few places in the rains. But during the reminder of the year the volume of running water is small, and in years of unusual drought there is no apparent stream, but the pools that remains are fed by the springs. During the first part of its course and to within four miles of its junction with Kali Nadi about three miles north-west of Mainpuri, it runs through a loam and usar country, has a comparatively shallow bed, and often overflows the neighbouring lands in time of flood. = The Arind or Rind = The Arind (or Rind as it is called further down its course ) is a very insignificant stream in this district , which it enters to the north of pargana Mustafabad , between the Etawah and Kanpur branches of the Ganges Canal , and treverses is an exceedingly sinuous course from the extreme north- west to the extreme south-east corner. A straight line from its point of entry to its point of exit is almost the longest which could be drawn on the district map. It present a striking contrast to the Kali and Isan. = Lakes = Mainpuri abounds in swamps and marshes, particularly in its central portion but few of them are of sufficient size or permanence to deserve the name of lake . Mention will only be made here of the more considerable ones, and for the others reference should be made to the accounts of parganas. In all 36,870 acres are recorded in the revenue record as under water. Even the largest, as they are seldom supplied from springs. There is also a long narrow lake of considerable size to the south-west of Mainpuri city, between it and the Kanpur branch of the Ganges canal, which drains by two cuts towards the Isan. = Drainage = The general slope of the country, is from north-west south east, and this is the direction in which the rivers run and which is therefore followed in the main by the drainage. There are however, numerous inequalities of surface caused by the greater or less elevation of the river beds and by the sand bridges, and the general disposition of the drainage differs some what indifferent portions of the district. In the center tract, which lies highest, the main drainage arteries are the Isan and the Arind. Pargana Karhal has been seriously affected by the canal. The Kali and Isan and their catchment basics all belong to the Ganges system, and all the other rivers to that of the yamuna.

The historic town of Mathura is the district headquarters. It also is famous for the town of Vrindavan, one of the most sacred places in Vaishnavism. The District is part of Agra division. Mathura is bounded on the northeast by Aligarh District, on the southeast by Hathras District, on the south by Agra District, and on the west by Rajasthan and northwest by Haryana state. Mathura district is an important pilgrimage centre of Hindus. Many towns in the district Mathura have a very low population of people who consume alcohol and non-vegetarian food. Historical background Kusuma Sarovar bathing ghat, in the Goverdhan area Vishnu with ayudhapurushas, Mathura, India Mathura has an ancient history. According to the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic, the Ramayana. In the epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura. In the 6th century BCE Mathura became the capital of the Surasena mahajanapada. The city was later ruled by the Maurya empire (4th to 2nd centuries BC) and the Shunga dynasty (2nd century BC). It may have come under the control of Indo-Greeks some time between 180 BCE and 100 BC. It then reverted to local rule before being conquered by the Indo-Scythians during the 1st century BC. Mathuran art and culture reached its zenith under the Kushan dynasty which had Mathura as one of their capitals, the other being Purushapura (Peshawar). The dynasty had kings with the names of Kujula Kadphises, Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva I. Megasthenes, writing in the early 3rd century BC, mentions Mathura as a great city under the name ŒúŒ≠Œ∏ŒøœÅŒ± (M√©thora).Megasthenes, fragment 23 \\"The Surasenians, an Indian tribe, with two great cities, Methora and Clisobora; the navigable river Iomanes flows through their territory\\" quoted in Arrian Indica 8.5. Also \\"The river Jomanes (Yamuna) flows through the Palibothri into the Ganges between the towns Methora and Carisobora.\\" in FRAGM. LVI. Plin. Hist. Nat. VI. 21. 8-23. 11. The Indo- Scythians (aka Sakas or Shakas) conquered the area of Mathura over Indian kings around 60 BCE. The findings of ancient stone inscriptions in Maghera, a town from Mathura, provide historical artifacts giving more details on this era of Mathura. The opening of the 3 line text of these inscriptions are in Brahmi script and were translated as: \\"In the 116th year of the Greek kings...\\" The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the \\"Northern Satraps\\", as opposed to the \\"Western Satraps\\" ruling in Gujarat and Malwa. After Rajuvula, several successors are known to have ruled as vassals to the Kushans, such as the \\"Great Satrap\\" Kharapallana and the \\"Satrap\\" Vanaspara, who are known from an inscription discovered in Sarnath, and dated to the 3rd year of Kanishka (c 130 AD), in which they were paying allegiance to the Kushans.A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc.... Rapson, p. ciii. Mathura served as one of the Kushan Empire's two capitals from the first to the third centuries. Fa Xian mentions the city, as a centre of Buddhism about AD 400; while his successor Xuanzang, who visited the city in 634 AD, which he mentions as Mot'ulo, and said that it contained twenty Buddhist monasteries and five Brahmanical temples. Later, he went east to Thanesar, Jalandhar in the eastern Punjab, before climbing up to visit predominantly Theravada monasteries in the Kulu valley and turning southward again to Bairat and then Mathura, on the Yamuna river. The city was sacked and many of its temples destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018 and again by Sikandar Lodhi, who ruled the Sultanate of Delhi from 1489 to 1517.Sultan Sikandar Lodi The Muntakhabu-'r≈´kh by Al-BadƒÅoni (16th-century historian), Packard Humanities Institute.Lodi Kings: Chart The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 2, p. 369.. Sikander Lodhi earned the epithet of 'But Shikan', the 'Destroyer of Hindu deities'. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, built the city's Jami Masjid (Friday mosque). The noteworthy fact is that the exact place of birth of Lord Krishna, according to historians, is in the place of worship of the Hindus, though the mosque was built near the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The bigger Krishna shrine, better known as Dwarkadeesh temple is a few metres away from what is believed to be the actual birthplace of Krishna, was built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh, Treasurer of Gwalior.

The Model 360 was designated by the company as the UH-12 (\\"UH\\" for United Helicopters),Donald, David. The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1998. which was first flown in 1948. The OH-23 trainer was jokingly nicknamed the \\"Hiller Killer\\" by United States Army Aviation student pilots who had to fly it.  Development  In 1947, United Helicopters (later renamed Hiller Aircraft) developed the prototype Model 360X helicopter. A year later, on 14 October 1948 the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) issued a production certificate for the Model 360. United Helicopters began producing the Model 360 as the UH-12. In 1949, the UH-12 became the first helicopter to make a transcontinental flight from California to New York. When Hiller upgraded the engine and the rotor blades, the company designated the new model as the UH-12A. It was the UH-12A that would be adopted by both the French and United States militaries, as well as being used by civil commercial operators in several countries.  Operational history  The H-23 Raven performed as a utility, observation, and MedEvac helicopter during the Korean War. Model numbers ranged A through D, F and G. The H-23A had a sloping front windshield. The H-23B was used as a primary helicopter trainer. Beginning with the UH-23C, all later models featured the \\"Goldfish bowl\\" canopy similar to the Bell 47. The Raven used Hiller's \\"Rotor-Matic\\" cyclic control system, with two small servo rotor paddles offset 90 degrees to the main rotor blades. The paddles were attached to the control column, so that movement of the column would cause the pitch of the servo paddles to change, loading the main rotor blade so that the desired cyclic changes to the rotor occurred.Bridgman 1953, pp. 240‚Äì241. The OH-23 had a top speed of 97 mph (84 knots). The Raven had a two-bladed main rotor, a metal two-bladed tail rotor. Both the OH-23B and the OH-23C were powered by one Franklin O-335-5D engine. The OH-23D was a purely military version with a 0-435-23C engine and a more reliable transmission. Most OH-23Ds were replaced by the OH-23G, the most common version of the Raven, with a more powerful Lycoming O-540-9A six-cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled 305 hp engine. The OH-23G could seat three. The MEDEVAC version carried two external skid-mounted litters or pods. The Raven saw service as a scout during the early part of the Vietnam War before being replaced by the Hughes OH-6A Cayuse in early 1968. A Raven piloted by Hugh Thompson, Jr. played a crucial role in curtailing the My Lai Massacre. When a Raven of the 59th Aviation Company strayed north of the Korean DMZ in August 1969 it was shot down and the crew were kept prisoner until released on December 2. The Raven could be armed with twin M37C .30-caliber machine guns on the XM1 armament subsystem or twin M60C 7.62 mm machine guns on the M2 armament subsystem. The XM76 sighting system was used for aiming the guns.

Life and work Shillingford Bridge, circa 1911, Tate Gallery. Rich was born between Scaynes Hill and Lindfield in Sussex. His study of art began at the age of eight, as a self-taught student inspired by the examples of Turner, Old Crome, and Constable at the National Gallery. His professional art career began as a heraldic painter from 1870-90\\\\. He studied briefly at the Westminster School of Art. But it was his six years of drawing from classical casts and from nature at the Slade School of Art, starting in 1890, which led him to his love of landscape and watercolour. He studied first under Alphonse Legros and subsequently under Professor Fred Brown. He was a member of the New English Art Club from 1898. Rich was influenced by the watercolour techniques of Thomas Girtin, John Sell Cotman and Peter De Wint, especially their use of the rich blooms produced by applying a full wash and allowing it to dry undisturbed. But whilst he referred to the earlier school of watercolourists his works are all his own and were created as much as reaction to French Impressionism but with a peculiarly English slant. As Rich and a number of his contemporaries pointed out (including Roger Fry and Lawrence Binyon) it was arguably the English watercolour tradition of painting quickly En plein air that had inspired much of the Impressionism's original spontaneity and it was an area where the English artistic tradition could claim to have been innovative. Rich was an advocate of a natural approach to painting, trying to capture the emotions which a subject provoked, rather than accurately reproducing a scene. He had little feeling towards what he termed \\"exhibition pieces\\", which he viewed as being overworked. He was critical towards even some of the greatest masters who he believed were often guilty of marring their work by polishing over the traces of their original responses to a scene. He also disliked \\"pretty pictures\\", a term which he used to refer to the quaint works produced by some of his contemporaries and used this term as a thinly veiled criticism of the work of Helen Allingham. Rich's first public exhibitions were at his studio in Croydon in 1896, followed by showings at the New English Art Club, the Piccadilly Egyptian Hall, the Alpine Club, Goupil's London Salon, the Carfax Gallery, the Leicester Galleries and Walker's Galleries. He worked on the Selecting Jury of the NEAC from 1904, and was elected to the Council of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in 1913. His work was included in the 1914 Venice Biennale. He taught and travelled with groups of students, always encouraging them to draw and paint directly from nature rather than copying from classic paintings (contrary to other schools of teaching which emphasized the work of the masters). He eschewed studio work and easels, preferring to work with stretched paper on a board held flat on his knees, seated in a camp chair. His book Watercolour Painting (1918) was published as part of the popular New Art Library and remained in print for nearly 50 years as a standard work on the subject. Rich died in Tewkesbury in 1921. After his death, Walker's Galleries held a retrospective in 1923 and Manchester City Art Gallery a memorial exhibition in 1928. A scholarship in his name was established at the Slade School in 1934 and this is still awarded annually.

Her teaching grew out of the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church in Kongo, and caused her to upbraid the Catholic priests for not believing as she did. Dona Beatriz believed the teachings of St. Anthony and used this claim to attempt to restore the ideal of Kongo as a unified Christian Kingdom. Kimpa Vita is seen as an antislavery figure and is known as a prefigure to modern African democracy movements. While the role of Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita is widely overlooked, the years of her movement are some of the best documented in Kongo's history. Early life Beatriz Kimpa Vita, also referred to as Beatrice of Congo, was born near Mount Kibangu in the Kingdom of Kongo, now a part of modern Angola around 1684. She was born into a family of the Kongo nobility, probably of the class called Mwana Kongo, and was baptized. Some modern scholars believe that she was connected to King Ant√≥nio I (1661‚Äì65), who died at the battle of Mbwila (Ulanga) in 1665, because his Kikongo name Vita a Nkanga connects with her name. Drawing by Bernardo da Gallo At the time of her birth, Kongo was torn by civil war. These wars had started shortly after the death of Ant√≥nio I and had resulted in the abandonment of the ancient capital of S√£o Salvador (present day Mbanza Kongo) in 1678 and the division of the country by rival pretenders to the throne. Another drawing According to her testimony, given at an inquest on her life, Kimpa Vita had visions by God Kongo and was considered to be a prophetess to the Kongolese, declaring that Jesus, Yissa‚ÄôYah Kongo, came from the Kongo kingdom. She forbade her people to let the Portuguese in because the were going to enslave them. She kept proclaiming the message until the Portuguese Catholics martyred her by burning her at the stakes, alive, for preaching the truth. And as she had claimed, the Portuguese Catholics finally started killing, murdering, raping and enslaving the Kongolese, breaking up families, sending them away to the Americas. Call to mission Beatriz went to live among colonists sent out by King Pedro IV, one of several rival rulers of Kongo, to reoccupy the ancient and now abandoned capital of S√£o Salvador. There was a great deal of religious fervor among these colonists who were tired of the endless civil wars in the country, and many had become followers of an old prophet, Appolonia Mafuta. During an illness in 1704 she claimed to have received visions of God. She began to preach, and Appolonia Mafuta supported her, claiming that she was the real voice of God. She proclaimed that Jesus was a Kongo and that there will be slavery if they trusted the Portuguese. While in this state, she learned that Kongo must reunite under a new king, for the civil wars that had plagued Kongo since the battle of Mbwila in 1665 had angered Christ. She was ordered to unite the Congo under one king. She destroyed \\"idols\\", the various Kongo Nkisi or charms inhabited by spiritual entities, as well as Catholic paraphernalia. When she took her message to King Pedro IV, he considered it, but refused to hear her. She then went to visit his rival Jo√£o II at Mbula (near the Congo River close to modern Matadi), who also refused to hear her. However, in short time she was able to gather a significant number of followers and became a factor in the struggle of power. Her movement recognized the papal primate but was hostile against the European missionaries in Congo. Three months after, Kimpa Vita led her followers to the abandoned capital of Sao Salvador where they would call to the people in the countryside and rapidly repopulate the city. This was recognized by the Italian Priest Bernardo de Gallo, who claimed Kimpa Vita to be possessed by the devil, to be an incredible act and led her to be adored and acclaimed as the restorer of Kongo. While she was in S√£o Salvador, which she and her followers occupied in 1705, she built a special residence for herself in the ruined cathedral, and also called the formerly ruined and abandoned capital to be reoccupied by thousands of mostly peasant followers. However, she soon won noble converts as well, including Pedro Constantinho da Silva Kibenga, the commander of one of Pedro IV's armies sent to reoccupy the city. Since he chose his devotion to Beatriz as an opportunity to rebel, Pedro IV, to decide to destroy her, all the more as his own wife, Hipolita, had become an Antonian convert. Upon her return to Sao Salvador, she was captured by catholics and taken to the mountaintop court of Pedro IV. Here she was accused of heresy and burned at the stake in July 1706. She was seen by many as a Prophetess to the Kongolese People. Beatriz sent out missionaries of her movement, to other provinces. They were not successful in the coastal province of Soyo, where the Prince expelled them, but they were much more successful in the dissident southern part of Soyo and Mbamba Lovata, whichlay south of Soyo. There they won converts, especially among partisans of the old queen Suzana de N√≥brega. Manuel Makasa, one of these partisans also became an Antonian and moved to S√£o Salvador. Religious tenets Virgin Mary in copper alloy produced within the Kongo Kingdom during the 18th century. Much of her teaching is known from the Salve Antoniana, a prayer she adapted from the Catholic prayer Salve Regina (Hail Holy Queen) into an anthem of the movement. Among other things, the Salve Antoniana taught that God was only concerned with believers' intentions, not with sacraments or good works, and that Saint Anthony was the greatest one - in fact, a \\"second God.\\" In addition, she taught that the principal characters in Christianity, including Jesus, Mary and Saint Francis, were all born in Kongo and were in fact Kongolese. Execution and its aftermath Kimpa Vita was captured near her hometown and burned at the temporary capital of Evululu as a heretic in 1706 by forces loyal to Pedro IV. She was tried under Kongo law as a witch and a heretic, with the consent and counsel of the Capuchin friars Bernardo da Gallo and Lorenzo da Lucca. The Anthonian prophetic movement outlasted her death. Her followers continued to believe that she was still alive, and it was only when Pedro IV's forces took S√£o Salvador in 1709 that the political force of her movement was broken, and most of her former noble adherents renounced their beliefs and rejoined the Catholic church. Some hint of the strength of her teaching may be glimpsed by the fact that eighteenth century Kongo religious art often shows Jesus as an African, and that Saint Anthony, known as \\"Toni Malau\\" was very prominent. More recently, some see present day Kimbanguism, Matswanism and Tokoism as its successors. Traditions circulating in Mbanza Kongo (formerly S√£o Salvador) in 2002 also place great significance in the role of Beatriz' mother as an inspiration for the prophet Simon Kimbangu and also as playing a role in its continuation, and in fact, her mother was present in the aftermath of her death.

Crozier was born at Stanhope in County Durham on 1 August 1879, the youngest son of Rev. Richard Crozier, a Methodist minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Hallimond. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in Classics (1900). After leaving Oxford he spent a year as a schoolmaster in Knaresborough, before abandoning teaching for journalism, joining first The Times and then the Manchester Guardian in 1903. He made an impression with his critical analysis of the case for tariff reform, and quickly came to the attention of the Guardian's then editor, C. P. Scott, who, recognising Crozier's potential, made him his right- hand man at the paper in charge of news gathering. In 1912 Crozier was made news editor and in 1918 military critic. He also later served as foreign editor. Under Scott, Crozier reorganized the Guardian's foreign news service, increased the use of photographs and maps, encouraged new features and introduced the daily crossword in 1929. He also developed a deep commitment to Zionism and became \\"the leading advocate in the daily press of a Jewish national home.\\" (Morris) Crozier was made a member of the Manchester Guardian's board and was appointed editor in April 1932 after the death of Edward Taylor Scott. Crozier's appointment was in part intended to guarantee editorial continuity, and he maintained a close control over the paper, frequently contributing leading articles and editorials. Foreign news had always been Crozier's chief interest and his editorship coincided with the establishment of the National Socialist regime in Germany and the Second World War. Working closely with his friend and sometime German correspondent, F. A. Voigt, Crozier \\"considered it no less than his duty personally and persistently to expose the Nazis\\" (Morris) and he pursued this policy with a crusading zeal until the very end. In the late 1930s his health became increasingly frail and he suffered from a perforated ulcer in 1936. In June 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.The Liberal Magazine, 1936 In 1943 he was diagnosed with the heart condition which proved ultimately to be fatal. Crozier died at his Manchester home on 16 April 1944, aged 64.

Pitcairn House was not, as is sometimes reported, built by the Picts, a people whose culture disappeared from Scotland around the 10th century. The name Pitcairn does, however, have roots in the Pictish language, combining the common prefix pit, meaning a portion of land or farm, with the Gaelic cairn. The noble family named for the area - the (de) Pitcairnes, recorded as far back as Henry de Pitcairn in 1426 - built the house around 1650. The family produced several eminent figures, chief among them Archibald Pitcairne (1652-1713), physician, religious playwright, and occasional correspondent of Isaac Newton, who owned the house in the early 1700s.Reid, 2004, pp. 6‚Äì41. By 1793, statistical accounts of the region describe the house as a ruin. The ruins are approximately , with the east gable rising to . The rest of the building has collapsed to the foundations. It is thought that the building was up to three storeys high. The site was excavated by archaeologists in 1980, and subsequently designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument. A number of finds are now in the Kirkcaldy Museum. A steading and cottages were once associated with the house, although these were demolished when the housing estate was built.

The film is constructed from four continuous 93-minute takes that were filmed simultaneously by four cameras; the screen is divided into quarters, and the four shots are shown simultaneously. The film depicts several groups of people in Los Angeles as they interact and conflict while preparing for the shooting of a movie in a production office. The dialogue was largely improvised, and the sound mix of the film is designed so that the most significant of the four sequences on screen dominates the soundtrack at any given moment.  Plot  The film takes place in and around a film production company office, and involves several interweaving plot threads which include a young actress named Rose (Salma Hayek) who tries to score a screen test from her secret boyfriend Alex Green (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), a noted but disillusioned director. Meanwhile, Rose's tryst with him is discovered by her girlfriend Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn), an insanely jealous businesswoman who plants a microphone in Rose's purse and spends most of the time in the back of her limousine parked outside the office building listening in on Rose's conversations. Elsewhere, Alex's wife Emma (Saffron Burrows) is seen with a therapist (Glenne Headly) debating about asking him for a divorce. In the meantime, numerous film industry types (played by Xander Berkeley, Golden Brooks, Holly Hunter and Kyle MacLachlan), pitch ideas for the next big hit film.

Production  The movie was shot with four hand-held digital cameras, in one take, on the sixteenth performance. Largely improvised, Figgis provided the actors with blank, four-staff music manuscript paper, with each octave representing a camera view at that particular moment in time, up to the 93 minutes of camera capacity. The actors themselves personally kept track of the activities occurring in other camera points of view that were relative to their performance. Rehearsals were single-take performances, filmed over fifteen days. Filmed in the mornings, with the actors fully involved, the footage was reviewed and discussed in the afternoons. Four separate monitors replayed each camera point of view simultaneously. The first rehearsal recording was included as a bonus feature on the film's 2000 DVD release.

This statement first applied the phrase \\"modern day slavery\\" to the traffic of women. It was in Vienna as well where the slogan \\"women's rights are human rights\\" gained international prominence; Rosca had brought it from the Philippine women's movement and helped launch it internationally. Rosca was press secretary of the Hague International Women's Tribunal on Japan's World War II Military Sex Slavery which convicted Japan's wartime era leadership for creating and using the Comfort Women. Rosca is particularly concerned with the origins of women's oppression and the interface between class, race and gender exploitation, so that women can move toward greater theory building and practice of a comprehensive genuine women's liberation. She often speaks on such issues as sex tourism, trafficking, the mail-order bride industry, and violence against women, and the labor export component of globalization under imperialism.

It is situated in the south-eastern part of the state with headquarters in Maunath Bhanjan. The district is surrounded by Ghazipur district on the south, Ballia district in the east, Azamgarh district in the west, and by Gorakhpur and Deoria districts on the north.  History  From historical and archaeological point of views, Mau is one of the oldest place in the region. Ancient cultural and archaeological remains have been found at multiple places in the area giving enough evidence of long history of human habitat in the area. The known archaeological history of Mau is about 1500 years old, when the entire area was covered under thick dense forest. The Nats who used to live along Tamsa river, are considered to be the oldest inhabitants and the ruler of the area. As per the records on official webpage of the district, in 1028 A.D. King Syed Shalar Masood Ghazi came with a huge army to conquer the area but he went back to Afghanistan, leaving few of his people in the area. A sufi saint Baba Malik Tahir and his brother Malik Qasim were part of the remaining group. There are places like Malik Tahir Pura and Qasim Pura in the name of these two saints in Mau city. The tomb of Malik Tahir is also present in Malik Tahir Pura and locally known as Mazaar Malik Tahir Baba.https://mau.nic.in/about-district/history/ Around 1540‚Äì1545, Sher Shah Suri, the emperor who defeated Humayun, during his reign visited Kolhuvavan (Madhuban) to meet the great Sufi saint Syed Ahmad Wadva. Mahvani, one of the daughters of Sher Shah had settled permanently near the dargah of Syed Wadva. The area also finds place in the historical book of Ziyaudeen Barni with a description that the great Mughal emperor Akbar passed through Mau on his way to Allahabad. At that time, labourer and artisans originally belonging to Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey, who had come with Mughal army settled here permanently. These artisans integrated into the society over a period of time but they kept their art alive and despite a gradual demise of the handloom industry in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the saree industry of Mau still remains the last bastion of handicraft in the area otherwise an industrially thriving region till the end of last century. It is also believed that one of Akbar's daughters, Jahan Aara had also settled in that area where she built a mosque. The original structure of the mosque is not surviving anymore but place is known as Shahi Qatra and there is a Shahi Mosque in that locality reminding of its past glory.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/Sufi-saints-abode-now- dons-den/articleshow/11830609.cms During the Indian freedom struggle, the people of Mau had given full support to the movement, and Mahatma Gandhi had also made a visit to Doharighat region of the district in 1939.

The iMac-inspired Compaq iPAQ was primarily designed to be a portable desktop computer that could be used as a simple internet capable computer. Hardware iPaq Desktop FrontiPaq Desktop Legacy Rear The iPAQ had very few limitations on upgradability; hard drives, RAM, CPU and 'Multi-Bay' drives can be readily interchanged, although the iPAQ did not contain sockets for expansion cards. It featured an interchangeable 'Multi-Bay' slot that could accept a 3.5 inch LS SuperDisk drive (the only way to read a floppy disk - standard Multi-Bay floppy drives do not work), optical drives, or a secondary hard disk device. The slot was the same as those found on many Compaq Armada and many other HP/Compaq laptop computer systems. By a method of convection for cooling, these computers were commonly found in office environments due to their low noise (dB) output. The iPAQ ran on either an Intel Pentium III processor or on an Intel Celeron processor; ranging from 500 MHz to 1 GHz processor in a PGA370 socket. The internal RAM was upgradable to 512 MB of 100 MHz 168pin SDR SDRAM. Due to the RAM limit of the Intel 815 series chipset, the BIOS in the iPAQ prevents the system from booting if there is more than 512 MB installed, instructing the user to decrease the amount of RAM in the system to no more than 512 MB. The first version came in two different models, \\"Legacy free\\" which had no parallel, serial, or PS/2 ports and instead 3 additional USB ports on the back; and the traditional one which included the parallel, serial, and PS/2 ports but only had USB ports on the front. The second version had different styling and had a backpack which added the \\"legacy\\" ports. iPAQ Desktops were typically sold with Windows 98 or Windows 2000 already installed. They are easily upgraded to Windows XP and can also technically run Windows Vista and Windows 7 despite the low RAM limit. In the case of Windows 7, the only way to utilize the onboard video chip is to install the Intel815 Windows XP Drivers. Internet appliance For a short time, around the year 2000, Compaq released a few models of an iPAQ that functioned as internet appliances. They did not have a CD-ROM drive and offered very few ports to connect to for very basic use. There were two variants of the flat-panel iPAQs, a common Windows CE based version in a white case, and the less common blue version known as the 'Clipper'. The Windows CE version was sometimes called the 'MSN Messenger version' and worked exclusively with the Microsoft Network over a dial-up connection using the Windows CE version of Internet Explorer. The Clipper appeared to be designed more for commercial environments and used a compact operating system based on BeOS called BeIA. The built-in \\"Wagner\\" web browser application was a customized version of the Opera browser. The Clipper also included a standard 10baseT Ethernet port, and shipped with the ability for the end-user to access the command line in order to tailor the device to use a company logo on the start-up screen. It also included a Minitel client for use where Minitel was available (mainly Canada and France).

Currently, the ANC includes a range of genres, including emerging genres such as email, tweets, and web data that are not included in earlier corpora such as the British National Corpus. It is annotated for part of speech and lemma, shallow parse, and named entities. The ANC is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium. A fifteen million word subset of the corpus, called the Open American National Corpus (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the ANC Website. The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of ISO/TC 37 SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool (ANC2Go), the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including CoNLL IOB format, the XML format conformant to the XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES) (usable with the British National Corpus's XAIRA search engine), a UIMA-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software. Plugins to import the annotations into General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) are also available. The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different part of speech annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), shallow parse annotations, and annotations for several types of named entities. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on- line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full- text linguistic annotation. ANC annotations are automatically produced and unvalidated. A 500,000 word subset called the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) is annotated for approximately 20 different kinds of linguistic annotations, all of which have been hand-validated or manually produced. These include Penn Treebank syntactic annotation, WordNet sense annotation, FrameNet semantic frame annotations, among others. Like the OANC, MASC is freely available for any use, and can be downloaded from the ANC site or from the Linguistic Data Consortium. It is also distributed in part-of-speech tagged form with the Natural Language Toolkit. The ANC and its sub-corpora differ from similar corpora primarily in the range of linguistic annotations provided and the inclusion of modern genres that do not appear in resources like the British National Corpus. Also, because the initial target use of the corpora was the development of statistical language models, the full data and all annotations are available, thus differing from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) which is available only selectively through a web browser. Continued growth of the OANC and MASC relies on contributions of data and annotations from the computational linguistics and corpus linguistics communities.

CUCA is not affiliated with the nationwide youth branch of the Conservative Party, the Young Conservatives, but is a fully independent Association distinct from other Conservative youth organisations. CUCA is not only the centre of right-leaning thought in Cambridge, but also a social hub for like-minded students. The Association puts on a range of events for its members each term, notably its ‚ÄòPort & Policy‚Äô debates, as well as addresses from a number of high-profile speakers. History The earliest incarnation of the Cambridge University Conservative Association was established in 1882, but lasted only a few months before dissolving.The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post (Bristol, England), Monday, 15 May 1882; Issue 10608 By 1884, it was necessary for Cambridge Conservatives to launch a new group ‚Äì the Cambridge University Carlton Club.Daily News (London, England), Thursday, 8 May 1884; Issue 11878 This served primarily as a dining society, and existed for the next twenty years. However, shortly after the Conservative government's landslide defeat in the 1906 general election, the Cambridge University Carlton Club dissolved, just as its predecessor had. There was no Conservative student organisation in Cambridge for the remainder of the Edwardian period, and the First World War saw party political activity suspended. The present-day Cambridge University Conservative Association was founded in 1921, with its inaugural annual dinner held on 24 January of that year.The Times, Tuesday, 25 January 1921; page 10; Issue 42627; col B In 1928, the annual St. John's College magazine The Eagle defined \\"a Cambridge Conservative [association member as] the proud possessor of a certain tie, obtained by signifying with a subscription his refusal or his inability to think out any social question.\\"T.E.B. Howarth, Cambridge Between Two Wars (Collins, London, 1978) p.152 CUCA alumni had considerable influence on British politics in the 1980s and 1990s, with the rise to prominence of the 'Cambridge Mafia' including cabinet ministers Leon Brittan, Kenneth Clarke, Norman Fowler, John Gummer, Michael Howard, and Norman Lamont, who had dominated CUCA and the Cambridge Union in the early 1960s. Considerable overlap between the officeholders of the two societies continues to the present day, while various present-day Cabinet officials and Members of Parliament are CUCA alumni. Activities CUCA is principally a political events association, holding regular speaker meetings, social events and debates. In recent years, CUCA has attempted to play a larger part in Cambridge University-wide politics. Members of CUCA have stood for election as Presidents of the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) in recent years, whilst CUCA itself has lobbied CUSU Council directly. The Association remains disaffiliated from the national Conservative Party, and has instead pitched itself as a bastion of philosophical conservatism for members of Cambridge University. CUCA has long-maintained a pricing structure of ¬£10 for life membership, and ¬£5 for annual membership. = Debates = The Association's premier debating event is 'Port and Policy', which is held around three times a term. In its current format, three motions are presented. Typically the final motion is tongue-in-cheek or less serious: the divine right of kings is a recurring topic, as is the health of Western Civilisation. After speeches for and against the motion, the floor is invited to participate. For many years Port and Policy had been a roundtable discussion, with the adversarial format only introduced in 2016, but this change has already driven attendance to, on occasion, over 100. = Social Events = Much of CUCA's calendar is focused on social events, which have included Cava & Chocolate, Port & Cheese and Garden Parties amongst many others. A termly highlight is the Chairman's Dinner, which marks the handing over of the leadership of the Association from one Chairman to another. = Speaker Events = CUCA holds regular speaker events with both Conservative politicians and right-wing thinkers. Speakers that have addressed the Association in recent terms have included Jacob Rees- Mogg, John Major, Norman Tebbit and Dominic Grieve. CUCA has a well- established history of attracting a high calibre of speakers, often including Cabinet ministers, think-tank experts and former Prime Ministers. = Publication of 'Freshers' Guides' = CUCA has twice published a 'Freshers' Guide', an introductory magazine distributed to first-years designed to give instruction and advice on Cambridge student life. The Association has argued that many unavoidable aspects of student life at Cambridge (formal dinners, navigating a multitude of student societies, language) are ignored by bodies such as CUSU and College JCRs for fear of being seen to perpetuate elitism. CUCA has argued that this approach itself perpetuates elitism, and instead aims to celebrate the 'quirks and curiosities' of Cambridge by the production and dissemination of accessible advice. The Guide returned in 2016, published as 'The Cambridge Directory'. Edited by Nicholas Taylor and Jack Drury, it offered advice on shopping, formalwear, restaurants, culture and etiquette. Within a week of publication, the 'Directory' had not only picked up press attention, but had been downloaded over 6000 times. The editors observed that Freshers had approached them praising the content of the Directory for \\"providing answers to questions they'd have felt awkward asking.\\" = Lobbying CUSU & Remembrance = In 2017, a member of CUCA stood for election to the Presidency of CUSU: his membership of CUCA featured heavily in the election reporting. In 2018, another member of CUCA stood for election to the same post. His membership of CUCA also featured heavily in the election reporting. Both individuals insisted throughout their campaigns that membership of CUCA was incidental to the post for which they stood. In October 2018, members of CUCA took a motion to CUSU Council proposing that CUSU do more to recognise the war dead. The motion was rejected. This decision by CUSU Council resulted in a significant press fallout. The then Chairman of CUCA, Timur Coskun, appeared on several national news outlets to discuss the issue of remembrance. = Campaigning = CUCA has a relaxed approach to formal campaigning for the nationwide Conservative party, it does have a dedicated Campaign's Officer as a permanent position on the Executive Committee. As part of the run-up to the 2015 General Election, CUCA hosted the Conservative candidate for the Cambridge Constituency, Chamali Fernando, at a Port & Cheese event. Many members were reportedly so underwhelmed they instead campaigned for Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat candidate. = Committee Make-up = Following recent reforms, CUCA is run by an executive of nine members: the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Junior Treasurer, Campaigns Officer, Communications Officer, Speakers Officer, Speakers Officer-Elect, Secretary and Social Events Officer. Following constitutional changes passed in Lent 2009, the Vice-Chairman automatically becomes Chairman in the term following their Vice-Chairmanship. CUCA members may also join the committee by applying to become co-opted members, whereby they sit on the committee without an official remit. Notable events1938: Pro-Appeasement= In 1938, CUCA hosted Sir Samuel Hoare as he gave a vigorous defence of Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Hitler at Munich, calling it \\"a great achievement\\" and \\"the height of exaltation\\".The Times, Friday, 25 November 1938; pg. 9; Issue 48161; col A =1956: Support for the Suez Invasion= In reporting and listing widespread student protests across Britain against the invasion of Suez in 1956, The Times noted that, instead, the \\"Cambridge University Conservative Association sent telegrams of support to the Prime Minister (Sir Anthony Eden) and Foreign Secretary (Selwyn Lloyd).\\" The Times, Saturday, 3 November 1956; pg. 4; Issue 53679; col E =1960-1: Visits by Sir Oswald Mosley= In 1961, the future Conservative leader Michael Howard resigned from the Committee in protest at the decision of Kenneth Clarke, the then Chairman, to invite Sir Oswald Mosley to address the Association for the second year running. (The previous year's speech by Mosley had been marred by a heckler throwing jelly at him.)The Times, Monday, 25 April 1960; pg. 7; Issue 54754; col C =1965‚Äì1998: Allegations of Electoral Malpractice= The society has, in the past, occasionally hit the headlines of both national and local papers over electoral disputes: In 1965,The Times reported that CUCA's Secretary was forced to resign after a four and a half-hour meeting deemed some of his election methods to have been forbidden.The Times, Friday, 3 December 1965; pg. 6; Issue 56495; col F In 1985, The Times again reported that eight committee members of CUCA had \\"resigned after allegations of electoral irregularities\\", with one committee member having a tape recording which he claimed proved the allegations.The Times, Monday, 4 February 1985; pg. 2; Issue 62053; col H In early 1998, Varsity published a story alleging that \\"weeks of bitter in-fighting culminated in allegations of election-rigging and a move to censure the society's most senior members\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20000929184030/http://www.varsity.cam.ac.uk/VarsityOnline/Online2/Content/News/Stories/190299_cuca.html Varsity, 19 February 1999 However, Varsity conceded that the subsequent motions of censure themselves had no reasons formally attached to them by their proposers and that some signatories were unaware of why they were supporting them. However, Varsity articles on CUCA elections have themselves come under fire in the past: following an Easter 2000 article, \\"Conservatives in Corruption Crisis\\", which accused the then-Chairman of 'vote- buying',https://www.varsity.cam.ac.uk/802567B80049EF7D/Pages/552000_ConservativeCorruptionControversy.html the paper was forced to print a front-page \\"Rectification\\" and apology, after threats of legal action.'Rectification', Varsity, Issue 523, 12 May 2000, page 1 =1969: Alleged Elitism= In January 2010, gay former Conservative MP and gay rights campaigner Matthew Parris admitted that on arriving at Cambridge in 1969 he had joined the Liberals, remarking that \\"I couldn't bring myself to join the CU Conservative Association because they were such braying, cravat- wearing, port-gargling, social-networking prats.\\"Parris, Matthew (14 January 2010). \\"Invicta what a terrible choice of poem\\". The Times (London). This prompted a letter to The Times signed by CUCA's Registrar who quipped that \\"at any one meeting of CU Conservative Association, only one person should ever wear a cravat to avoid ostentation.\\"\\"Association rules\\". The Times (London). 18 January 2010. Parris had previously described CUCA in his 2002 autobiography as \\"a dreadful shower, strutting careerists of distinctly mixed calibre, forever infighting, networking and elbowing their way through a scene which appeared more social than political.\\"Matthew Parris, Chance Witness: An Outsider's Life in Politics (Viking, London, 2002) p.112 =1985-6: Visits by Enoch Powell= A visit by Enoch Powell in March 1985 provoked resignations on CUCA's committee,The Times, Monday, 11 March 1985; pg. 2; Issue 62081; col F and when Powell returned in December 1986, he was heckled by non-Conservative students.Patrick Cosgrave, The Lives of Enoch Powell (Bodley Head, London, 1989), page 13 CUCA had also come under criticism for Powell's 1985 appearance in the New Statesman, which argued that Powell's extreme views were indicative of CUCA's alleged authoritarianism, and the paper asserting the (short-lived) \\"Cambridge University Monday Club form part of an unholy alliance with elements of the Left and the now-discredited Cambridge University Conservative Association, who are united in their fervent, even violent opposition to libertarians. Perhaps it is this bizarre grouping which deserves investigation.\\"The New Statesman, Volume 109, page 25 (1985) =2012: BBC 'Wonderland' Documentary= On 9 August 2012, the BBC broadcast the documentary Young, Bright and on the Right as part of its Wonderland series.BBC programmes: Wonderland ‚Äì Young, Bright and on the Right The episode followed two student political activists from deprived backgrounds, one of whom was former CUCA Committee member Chris Monk. The documentary attracted much press attention in the days following the broadcast, particularly at Monk's remark \\"The whole point of the [Cambridge University] Conservative Association is it gives you a chance to pretend to be a member of the upper classes for an afternoon\\".\\"How easy is it to become a Tory MP without private education?\\", BBC News website, 9 August 2012\\"Monk Debunked in Tory Style\\", The Tab, 11 August 2012Harry Cole and Joe Armitage, \\"Young, Right and Part of the Fight\\", The Commentator, 9 August 2012 CUCA responded with a statement on its website, stressing its \\"disappointment that a documentary has aired which misrepresents Cambridge University Conservative Association...Contrary to the suggestions of the programme, CUCA is unfalteringly open to all.\\".\\"Response to Wonderland\\", CUCA website, 11 August 2012 = 2016: Save the Class Lists = It was widely speculated after the victory of 'Save the Class Lists' in the Class Lists referendum that CUCA political machinery had been deployed by the campaign. = 2017: Burning Money in Front of the Homeless = On 2 February 2017, the Communications Officer on CUCA's Executive Committee was filmed on Snapchat attempting to set fire to a ¬£20 note in front of a homeless person. The video showed the student dressed in white tie whilst trying to set the banknote alight, before the camera panned to the homeless person. The incident was reported to have taken place on Bridge Street, Cambridge. The event was reported to be reminiscent of the rumoured initiation process for Oxford's infamous Bullingdon Club, where students are said to have to burn a ¬£50 note in front of a homeless person. CUCA issued a statement about the incident saying they wished to \\"disassociate [them]selves from the individual and his behaviour\\". CUCA maintained throughout the following media storm that the Communications Officer had not been at a CUCA event, and they had no explanation for his being in white tie. Before the story broke, a meeting was held between CUCA officials and the Communications Officer: as part of their first response, CUCA announced that the Communications Officer had resigned both his post and membership of the Association in that meeting. In the event's aftermath, the then Chairman of CUCA, Jim Matheson, wrote that he was \\"convinced that CUCA [had] something positive and healthy to offer the fabric of the University.\\" = 2018: James Delingpole at Chairman's Dinner = In Lent 2018, it was widely reported that attendees at Chairman's Dinner had walked out during the address from James Delingpole after he made a number of unpalatable jokes. Delingpole is reported to have advised attendees to raise enough money to pay for their children's private education, and joked about the sex abuse perpetuated by Jimmy Savile. Delingpole subsequently defended himself in The Spectator, while CUCA released a statement stating that they did not support the viewpoints that Delingpole stated. =General Press Comments on CUCA= In 1980, Private Eye condemned Timothy Eggar, a Conservative MP and former CUCA Chairman, as \\"one of those unpleasant political operators that Cambridge University Conservative Association alone knows how to breed.\\"Private Eye, No. 472, 18 January 1980, p.5 (1980) In November 1998, it was claimed in Varsity that outgoing Chairmen of CUCA were awarded a pair of silver cufflinks, with one CUCA committee member quipping that \\"several of the last Chairmen only served their terms of office so that they could get the cufflinks.\\"Varsity, 19 November 1998, p.9 Notable AlumniPeers= * John Biffen, PC, DL, MP, CUCA Chairman (Lent 1953) * Norman Blackwell, CUCA Chairman (Easter 1973) * Nick Bourne, AM, CUCA Treasurer * Leon Brittan, PC, QC, DL, MP, CUCA Chairman (Lent 1960) * Rab Butler, MP, CUCA Member * Hon.

Plot In 2021 off East Timor, a US-led multinational taskforce commanded by Admiral Phillip Kolhammer prepares to liberate the Indonesian islands from an Islamic government calling itself the Caliphate, which is slaughtering the Chinese nationals living there. In the book's backstory, the Chinese government was planning to send a task force but was warned by the US government not to do so. The flagship of the task force is the aircraft carrier USS Hillary Clinton, named after \\"the most uncompromising wartime president in the history of the United States\\". The task force is made up mainly of US and British units alongside French, Australian, Japanese, and Free Indonesians, along with a few other units like Spetsnaz from Russia and Kommando Spezialkr√§fte from Germany. Alongside the navy task force is JRV Nagoya, a scientific ship that is experimenting with wormholes; the navy ship protecting it is ordered to join the task force. A new ship from the Royal New Zealand Navy is sent as escort, but prior to its arrival, Nagoyas project director, Manning Pope, decides to make a trial run. The task force is constantly watched by a Caliphate spy on the mainland. In 1942, Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance and Lt. Commander Daniel Black are on the bridge of , on their way to face the Japanese sent to invade Midway. A growing commotion outside the bridge prompts them to investigate, only to find a large group of what are, to them, unknown and strangely designed ships. They spot a ship with the Japanese ensign and assume it is the Japanese fleet sent against Midway and they order their own ships to open fire. The multinational task force Combat Intelligence, referred to as CI, takes defensive action; the 21st-century fleet nearly wipes out the US fleet, including and . During the battle, Kolhammer and the rest of the multinational task force commanders learn that not all ships of the task force came through and those that did, did not all end up in the same place. HJIMS Ry≈´j≈ç encounters the Free Indonesian ship KRI Sutanto and boards it. The Indonesians are taken captive, the Japanese learn of the force sent against them at Midway, and the rest of the Japanese navy is warned and ordered back home. After the battle between the 1942 US naval force and the 21st-century multinational task force, an unsteady peace starts after they both reach Pearl Harbor. However, murders, rapes, and riots happen as the 21st-century people try to mix with the locals. Kolhammer is flown to California to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Albert Einstein. As time goes by with no sight of JRV Nagoya, more and more 21st-century personnel start to realize they are stuck in 1942. Captain Karen Halabi and HMS Trident, a Trident-class trimaran stealth destroyer, is ordered back to the Home Island for evaluation and possible transfer of Trident. However, prior the ship's and her departure, they take part in a prisoner of war rescue in Singapore and Luzon. The rescue is carried out by both 21st-century and 1942 personnel. Through the Japanese, Hitler learns about the results of the invasion of the Soviet Union and sends Ribbentrop to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union.

The province has a legislative assembly composed of 120 proportionally elected members, and a government composed of a president and cabinet ministers. The current political status of Vojvodina is regulated by the Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina from 2008. Autonomy The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina was established in October 1944 and its political status was regulated on September 1, 1945, as an autonomous entity within Serbia, although it had several political predecessors such as Serbian Vojvodina (1848‚Äì1849), Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar (1849‚Äì1860), Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja (1918-1919), and Danube Banovina (1929‚Äì1941). In 1945, the amount of its autonomy was limited. Vojvodina's name was changed on April 7, 1963 to the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Under the 1974 constitution Vojvodina obtained extensive autonomy, and became one of the subjects of the Yugoslav federation. On July 5, 1989 this extensive autonomy was largely revoked by Milo≈°eviƒá's regime and the amount of autonomy of Vojvodina became nominal and greatly limited. On March 28, 1990 the name of the province was reverted to Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. After the Bulldozer Revolution on October 5, 2000, and change of the regime in the country, the amount of autonomy of Vojvodina was increased and was regulated by the Omnibus law from 2002. The new constitution of Serbia from 2006 did not change the status of Vojvodina regulated in 2002, although it further defined the provincial budget. On October 18, 2008 the Assembly of Vojvodina adopted the Statute of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The Executive Council was renamed Government of Vojvodina consisting of the president, four vice-presidents and members. =Omnibus law= Omnibus law () was a law adopted in 2002 that regulated the autonomous status of Vojvodina within Serbia.Omnibus law (In Serbian) The law affirmed the jurisdiction of provincial administration over culture, education, language policy, media, health, sanitary survey, health assurance, pension and invalid assurance, social protection, juristical family protection, social care of the children, soldier and invalid protection, protection of civil invalids of war, ecology, urbanism, construction industry, residential section, employment, economy, mining and energetics, agriculture, stock reserves, tourism, sports, and other sections. History of the autonomist movement The movement for autonomy of Vojvodina was always led by local Serbs, who were largest ethnic group in the region. The roots of the autonomist movement date to 1691, when the Habsburg Emperor recognized the right of the Serbs to have one separate autonomous voivodship within the Habsburg Monarchy. The autonomy, however, was not realised at that time, and in 1790 (almost 100 years after the promise of the emperor), the Serbs organized their national assembly in Timi»ôoara (today in Romania), where they asked for autonomy. These demands were, however, rejected by the Austrians. Svetozar Miletiƒá (1826-1901), political leader of Serbs in Vojvodina In 1848, as a response to the policy of the revolutionary Hungarian government, the Serbs, in accordance with the right given in 1691, proclaimed the creation of an autonomous region named the Serbian Vojvodina. This time, the autonomy was recognized by the Habsburg emperor, and in November 1849, a separate Habsburg province named the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was created as a political successor of the Serbian Vojvodina. However, since the policy of the Habsburgs towards the Hungarians had changed, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished in 1860, and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. As a response to the abolition of the voivodship, the Serbs in 1861 organized national assembly known as the \\"Blagove≈°tenski Sabor\\", where they asked for reestablishment of the voivodship. The constitution of the voivodship was also adopted on the assembly. The rulers of the Monarchy, however, did not accepted these demands of the Serbs. Instead, the autonomy was in 1867 given to the Hungarians, and the Serbs found themselves in the Hungarian part of the Monarchy. The political struggle for the autonomy of Vojvodina, however, was continued by the Serb deputies in the parliament of the Kingdom of Hungary, until the end of the Monarchy in 1918. Blagove≈°tenski assembly in Sremski Karlovci, 1861 A new opportunity for the autonomy of Vojvodina arisen in 1918, after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. On November 25, 1918, the Great people's assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs from Vojvodina decided to join this region to the Kingdom of Serbia, as well as to form a new autonomous government of Vojvodina known as the People's administration for Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja. Although, the government in Belgrade accepted the decision that Vojvodina join to Serbia, it did not recognize the People's administration. The People's administration was active until March 11, 1919, when it held its last session. Since autonomy was not realised, and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a centralised country, the new autonomist movement emanated, again led by local Serbs. The Danube Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia formed in 1929, did not have a large degree of autonomy, thus the autonomist movement was also active after the creation of this province. The idea of an autonomous Vojvodina was also accepted by the communist party, and after occupation of Vojvodina by the Axis Powers in 1941, the communist party and its partisan resistance movement started a struggle against the occupation. The aim of this struggle, as it was presented by the communist party, was a future autonomous Vojvodina in which all ethnic groups would be equal. The Serbs, who were the main victims of the Axis regimes, as well as other peoples of Vojvodina, participated in this struggle, and after the end of the war, the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina was established. After much of the autonomy of Vojvodina was revoked by Milo≈°eviƒá's regime in 1989, the new movement for autonomy of the province emanated, supported by both the local Serbs, and the ethnic minorities. The view of the autonomist movement is that the revoking of the autonomy in 1989 had destroyed the economy of Vojvodina, thus for the improvement of the economy, Vojvodina need more autonomy. Unlike the political movement of Kosovar Albanians, the autonomist movement in Vojvodina never aimed for separation from Serbia, but only a significant level of autonomy for Vojvodina within Serbia. On January 28, 2013 as an answer to the proposal of the Third Serbia political organization from Novi Sad to abolish the autonomy of Vojvodinahttp://trecasrbija.rs/http://www.rtv.rs/sr_ci/vojvodina/novi- sad/treca-srbija:-ds-brinula-o-kulturi-kao-o-lanjskom-snegu_367019.html the Vojvodina's Party presented a message \\"the Republic of Vojvodina\\" in Novi Sad.http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2013&mm;=01‚ÖÜ=28&nav;_category=11&nav;_id=681363 However, both political organizations are lacking any wider support among population of Vojvodina.

Life Dorothy Napangardi was the daughter of Indigenous Australians Jeannie Lewis Napururrla and Paddy Lewis Japanangka, born in the early 1950s in a location referred to as Mina Mina, near Lake Mackay in the Tanami Desert. Napangardi (in Warlpiri) or 'Napangati' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Dorothy' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. She grew up in the settlement town of Yuendumu, and spent most of her life in Alice Springs, where she began painting in 1987. She had little formal schooling, but was instructed in the historic Dreaming of her people. 'Dreaming' is an imprecise English translation of the Warlpiri word 'Jukurrpa', which describes the origins and journeys of ancestral beings in the land, and identifies the sacred places where the spirits reside. The Jukurrpa theme, generally, is one of the inseparability of the self from the environment and usually includes travelling across the land. These are notions than can also be found in Napangardi's art, with its profusion of intersecting lines suggesting spiritual meaning and evocative depth. In the words of a Warlpiri speaker quoted in a catalogue of Napangardi‚Äôs work: \\"To me, Dorothy‚Äôs work is like Yapa (people) running through and across their country, moving across their pathways when they go travelling.\\" Napangardi was killed in a car accident on 1 June 2013. ArtBackground= The contemporary Indigenous Australian art movement began in the western desert in 1971, when Indigenous men at Papunya took up painting, led by elders such as Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, and assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. This initiative, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, many women in the communities wished to participate, and in the 1990s many began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. In this context, in Alice Springs, Dorothy Napangardi began to learn alongside Polly Watson Napangardi, Margaret Lewis and Eunice Napangardi. =Career= Lake Mackay in central Australia, where Dorothy Napangardi was born.In 2001 Napangardi won first prize in the 18th National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award for her work Salt on Mina Mina, after winning lesser prizes in the same festival in 1991 and 1999. She had many exhibitions in Australia and overseas. In 2002, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney hosted an exhibition (Dancing up country) of Napangardi's work. Discussing the artist's work, expert Christine Nicholls wrote that \\"Dorothy Napangardi‚Äôs success as an artist lies in her ability to evoke a strong sense of movement on her canvases, an effect she achieves because of her remarkable spatial sense and compositional ability... [Her work] can be appreciated on multiple levels\\", though indigenous commentators tend to see painting as \\"a stage for human activity, rather than seeing the geometric aspects of the work.\\" At the time of the exhibition, fellow artist Kathleen Petyarre thought there were parallels between Napangardi's approach to her work and that of Emily Kngwarreye. Internationally, US-based Crown Point Press published a series of her prints and exhibited her paintings and prints in its gallery in San Francisco. The Hosfelt Gallery in San Francisco exhibited her paintings in a solo exhibition in 2005. She was included in a range of group shows, including in 2001 at the Sammlung Essl Museum in Vienna, Austria. Napangardi‚Äôs work is found in many museums around the world, including the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide, Queensland Museum, Brisbane, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, the Linden Museum, Stuttgart, Germany, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. She lived and worked in Alice Springs.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media. History The current WMMQ-FM, currently at 94.9 FM, began broadcasting in 1963, as WCER-FM (92.7) in Charlotte, Michigan. The original WVIC 730 (now sports formatted WVFN) with an MOR format and 94.9 FM were a competing station in Lansing, Michigan. In the early '70s WVIC switched to top 40 and \\"owned\\" the college crowd, and became one of the top-rated stations in Lansing, besides the Long Enduring MSU Rock Radio Station, WILS also found huge ratings success with the College Audience...the first #1 fm station in the country, helped by the high FM set penetration The manager and part owner was Bob Sherman who also did sports. Morning man and music director was Bruce Buchanan who was fired for leaving a radio station softball team game at 11 pm to get some sleep for the following morning show. He went on to debut WHNN Bay city/Saginaw in 1974 that also was number one. Another alumnus was Kevin McCarthy who went to Dallas and was inducted into the Texas hall of fame. All of the jocks had 3-hour shifts but were required to do high school hops, throughout mid Michigan, for no more than $50. WVIC dropped out of the simulcast and became sports-talk WVFN in June 1992. WVIC-FM's period as Lansing's top CHR station came to an end on March 1, 1995, when the station became \\"Wild Country 94-9 The Cat\\" in an attempt to take on longtime country music station and market leader WITL-FM. \\"The Cat\\" lasted only a few months before the station was acquired by the owners of WITL-FM. Under new ownership by Liggett Communications, WVIC-FM decided to take on longtime album rocker WJXQ with an active rock format as \\"Buzz 95.\\" The WJXQ morning show team of Tim (Barron) and Deb (Hart) moved to 94.9 in 1996, and the station adjusted its format to a more mainstream rock approach. On September 1, 1979, WMMQ was born through the separation of the WCER AM and FM signals. WMMQ assumed the FM component. The station started at the Charlotte, MI location in a new building addition, with its transmitter and tower located on Otto Road north of Charlotte. This Tiny 5,000 Watt Radio Station was literally in the middle of a corn field! A microwave link connected the two buildings. A fully automated cart system was originally used for music and commercials (spots). There were no actual DJs on the FM station initially. by August 1983, Lansing's only true Power Progressive AOR Rock Radio Station 101 -WILS F.M. had been sold to a Wisconsin Insurance Company \\"Sentry Group\\" which effectively ended Lansing's Main Rock Music Station (a general reflection upon this moment from the public's viewpoint was memorably a loss and did not receive a favorable reaction from both businesses who advertised on WILS, or the hometown base of listeners it had worked so hard to attract for so long). Departures of several long time broadcasters, both D.J.s and news personnel: from legendary Keith Cummings in the newsroom, to Burton and Ballard on Mornings, Clyde Shoe on Afternoon Drive, on AM side of WILS names Like Hal Fish (who assumed position at 94 WIBM Jackson) were notably absent after the format changed from AOR to Doris Day at midnight upon the New Year Eve of 1984. The station's phone lines were flooded for hours as station personnel answered angry listeners in shock and disbelief. it was WMMQ ( Americas First \\"classic\\" Rock Radio Station) that Captured this Audience who eagerly embraced its true rock and roll origins and its ability to attract an even younger age demographic of both males and females in Lansing. Many personalities appeared during this time: Tim Seigrist's \\"the Early Morning Rock And Roll Travesty\\" then, the \\"Catman\\", Scott Rashad /Bullion resumed duties of Hosting \\"morning Travesty\\" after creating the \\"Afterhours Rock and Roll Overnites After Leaving Cin-Lan Entertainment in 1988. Station owner Robert T. Ottaway hired Rashad/ Bullion twice in station history and was rehired by Goodrich Broadcasting briefly (as then WVIC switched format to the BUZZ94.9) this makes the \\"Catman\\" the single D.J.to ever be hired and then, fired, and to be re-hired again by the same station in Lansing Radio History! notably, in 1990, Rashad/Bullion Was asked to submit his resignation to Ottaway after Rashad/Bullion was arrested by Lansing Police in an arranged \\"buy\\" marijuana transaction. After serving a brief 74 days in Jail for \\"attempting to purchase a large sum of a controlled substance\\", (a clear violation of public health and safety) He was again re-hired By WMMQ F.M.After station owner Ottaway attracted several brief/short-lasting D.J.s to do Morning Drive. Names like stand-up comedian Dobie Maxwell and the also memorable personality, legendary Jazz McKay were brought in to assist with music programming and on-air duties/ After creating and keeping a dedicated well-deserved following and a positive growth ratings history achieved against much larger wattage stations, (as WMMQ initially was only 5,000 watts); its closest format competitor was in Jackson Broadcasting Against WMMQ with 50,000 Watts!) The management sought direction while the owners sought a buyer after ratings took a series of dives after stations loss of an identity (The WILS 101-FM Audience that once claimed it as their own, had grown dissatisfied by the repetitious \\"almost to the hour everyday\\" of same predictable artists and the few songs D.J.s were allowed to Play outside of Format Boundaries calling itself \\"classic \\" unfortunately but ever so true with Corporate Management decisions instead of direct public/employees input led to the demise. On June 1, 1997, WVIC 94.9 FM and WMMQ 92.7 FM switched programming and call signs (though the new WVIC did not continue to air the mainstream rock format from 94.9; instead, it would go dark). WMMQ's Classic rock format moved to the higher-powered signal at 94.9 after being sold to movie theater chain owner Robert Goodrich of Grand Rapids (who developed and owned WVIC originally). The former morning show on WMMQ consisted of Rich Michaels, formerly of sister station WJIM-FM 97.5 (arriving to that station after its format change from Oldies to CHR on September 15, 2005). Joining Michaels is Deb Hart. Ironically, Rich Michaels was also the morning show host on 94.9 during the heyday of the original WVIC in the 1980s and early 1990s. Michaels was suspended from on-air activities on Wednesday, August 14, 2008 for on-air comments about a building project in Lansing. In 2010, Rich Michaels was let go. =Other call sign and frequency uses= The original 92.7 Charlotte-based WMMQ signal (now WLMI) moved to 92.9 in late October 2006 and is now licensed to the community of Grand Ledge. WLMI is owned by Midwest Communications. The legendary WVIC call sign remained in the hands of Midwest and was used for a time on what is now WQTX and WWDK. TodayProgramming= A long-standing fixture on WMMQ, dating back to its earliest days in 1985 on 92.7, is the \\"All-Request Saturday Night\\". The show's origins are traced back to then AOR formatted 101 WILS-FM. It was hosted for 25+ years by Larry \\"Allen\\" Estlack until his passing in December 2013. Estlack, who went by Larry \\"Allen\\" on the air, was the engineer for WILS and later WMMQ. The show, now hosted by Wally Londo, runs from 7:00 pm to midnight and usually has a featured artist or theme each week, and consists of a playlist entirely supplied by listener phone and e-mail requests. WMMQ continues to be consistently rated in Lansing's top 10 ‚Äì and was ranked in the top three in local adult 25‚Äì54 market ratings in the fall of 2006. WMMQ currently streams its programming 24/7 using the Windows Media format through a link on its website listed below. =Ownership= In 2000, Liggett Communications sold WMMQ, WVFN, WITL, WJIM- FM, WJIM, and WFMK to Citadel Broadcasting. In 2011, Citadel was absorbed into Cumulus Media. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus Media stations, including WMMQ, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. =Technical= WMMQ broadcasts with an Effective Radiated Power of 50,000 watts from a site near Holt, Michigan in Ingham County. The transmitter site is located off of Gunn Road and is shared by WMMQ and WVFN. This was the original transmitter site utilized when both stations operated under the WVIC call sign. The WVIC studio was located on Mount Hope Road between Aurelius and Harrison Roads. Three short towers are aligned on the site which are used for the daytime directional antenna pattern of 730 AM WVFN. In the center of the array is a 500-foot tower used for 94.9 FM. This tower also doubles as WVFN's omni- directional nighttime array.

The word is Persian (ÿ™ÿßŸÅÿ™Ÿá) in origin and means \\"twisted woven\\". It is considered to be a \\"high-end\\" fabric, suitable for use in ball gowns, wedding dresses, and in interior decoration for curtains or wallcoverings. It is also widely used in the manufacture of corsets and corsetry: it yields a more starched-like type of cloth that holds its shape better than many other fabrics. An extremely thin, crisp type of taffeta is called paper taffeta. There are two distinct types of silk taffeta: yarn-dyed and piece-dyed. Piece-dyed taffeta is often used in linings and is quite soft. Yarn-dyed taffeta is much stiffer and is often used in evening dresses. Shot silk taffeta was one of the most highly sought forms of Byzantine silk, and may have been the fabric known as purpura.Dodwell, C.R.; Anglo-Saxon Art, A New Perspective, pp. 145-150, 1982, Manchester UP, (US edn. Cornell, 1985) Production Modern taffeta was first woven in Italy and France and until the 1950s in Japan. Warp-printed taffeta or chin√©, mainly made in France from the eighteenth century onwards, is sometimes called \\"pompadour taffeta\\" after Madame de Pompadour. Today most raw silk taffeta is produced in India and Pakistan. There, even in the modern period, handlooms were long widely used, but since the 1990s it has been produced on mechanical looms in the Bangalore area. From the 1970s until the 1990s, the Jiangsu province of China produced fine silk taffetas: these were less flexible than those from Indian mills, however, which continue to dominate production. Other countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East also produce silk taffeta, but these products are not yet equal in quality or competitiveness to those from India. The most deluxe taffetas, however, are still woven in France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Historical and current uses Taffeta has seen use for purposes other than clothing fabric, including the following: * On November 4, 1782, taffeta was used by Joseph Montgolfier of France to construct a small, cube-shaped balloon. This was the beginning of many experiments using taffeta balloons by the Montgolfier brothers, and led to the first known human flight in a lighter-than-air craft. * Synthetic fibre forms of taffeta have been used to simulate the structure of blood vessels. * Tabby cats were so-named in the 1600s due to visual resemblance to a tabby, a type of striped silk taffeta. * It was associated with prostitution during the English Renaissance.David Scott Kastan (ed.). William Shakespeare. King Henry IV, Part 1. Arden Shakespeare Third Series. London: Thompson Learning, 2002, 150. Examples include the references in William Shakespeare's plays: \\"As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk,\\" says the Clown in All's Well That Ends Well, Prince Hal's reference to Sir John Falstaff's \\"fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta\\" in Henry IV, Part 1, Boyet's dismissal of \\"Beauties no richer than rich taffeta\\" in Love's Labour's Lost, and Feste's insult in Twelfth Night, or What You Will, \\"The tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal.\\" *Marceline is a related fabric References https://garmentmerchendising.com/what-is-a-taffeta-fabric/ *Dictionary of Textiles, Louis Harmuth.

The parish is in the North Downs, east of Maidstone and includes the settlements of Marley, Pollhill and Fairbourne. History Harrietsham is noted in the Domesday Book. In mediaeval times the manor of Harrietsham passed through a succession of families, including the Adam family of Essex.The Will of Richard Adames, 16 February, 1523, Kent Archaeological Society The manor subsequently passed from Stephen Adam to his sister Eve, wife of John Levett of Hollington, East Sussex. On Levett's death, his widow remarried Laurence Ashburnham, Gent., of Broomham, Sussex, ancestor of the Ashburnham baronets, bringing the manor of Harrietsham into the Ashburnham family.Harrietsham, Kent, The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent, Volume 5, Edward Hasted, 1798, British History Online The village contains a number of listed buildings, the most important of which architecturally are The Old House in East Street and the Saxon Church of St John the Baptist, which are both listed Grade I. The village also includes a church dedicated to St Peter, a Roman Catholic church and several nonconformist churches. The Olympic Torch of London 2012 travelled through Harrietsham. Geography The village is bypassed by the A20 road between Maidstone and Ashford, although at one time all traffic passed through it. Harrietsham railway station serves the village. Both the M20 motorway and High Speed 1 pass through the parish.

It is a smallish round thick wooden (usually lignum vitae) disc with one or more holes through it, perpendicular to the plane of the disc. Single and triple-hole deadeyes are most commonly seen. The three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep's skull. buntline on Prince William 's fore-topgallant. Single deadeyes (or bull's eyes) are used to guide and control a line and, particularly in older vessels, to change its direction. More modern systems would use a block for this purpose but in traditional rigs with many lines to deal with, designed when blocks were relatively expensive to make, a deadeye provided an acceptable compromise. When blocks came into common use for adjusting running rigging, deadeyes continued to be used for tensioning standing rigging. Triple deadeyes and lanyards used to tension the shrouds on the Lowestoft trawler Excelsior. Triple deadeyes are used in pairs; a line called a lanyard is run back and forth between them, through the holes, so that they function again much as a block and tackle would. This provides a mechanical advantage, pulling harder on whatever the deadeyes are attached to. Pairs of deadeyes are placed in the shrouds (the lines that hold up the mast), where they are used to create greater tension in the shrouds. To set up the lanyards used with dead-eyes, a suitable grease such as tallow is first applied to the holes. After reeving the lanyard through the deadeyes, the end is hooked to a handy purchase in the rig above, such as the throat halyard. By hauling on the halyard the lanyard in the deadeyes is drawn up taut. A small wooden wedge is knocked into the last hole, to prevent the lanyard sliding back, and the end is unhooked from the purchase and made up on the shroud above the upper deadeye. The wedge can then be removed ready for the next shroud. As an alternative the tackle on the lanyard can be made fast to the shroud well above the upper deadeye so that it compresses the deadeyes. The last part of the lanyard can then be seized to an adjacent part between the deadeyes. When this is finished the tackle is cast off and the lanyard made off. In recent decades, as steel wire became the prevalent material for sailboat rigging, deadeyes and lanyards gave way to metal turnbuckles for tensioning the wires. More recently, however, with the advent of high-strength and low-stretch synthetic fibres, some sailboats are using synthetic rope for standing rigging, and deadeyes and lanyards are coming back into use as tensioning devices.. Modern deadeyes, also known as chainplate distributors can be made of titanium or aluminum, manufactured by vendors such as Colligo Marine.

Common items to be julienned are carrots for carrots julienne, celery for c√©l√©ris remoulade, or potatoes for Julienne Fries. Trimming the ends of the vegetable and the edges to make four straight sides makes it easier to produce a uniform cut. Trimmings can be used for stocks, soups, purees, etc. The measurement for julienne is 12 mm √ó 12 mm √ó 45 cm (0.040.08 in √ó 0.040.08 in √ó 1.62 in). Julienne usually applies to vegetables prepared in this way but it can also be applied to the preparation of meat or fish, especially in stir fry techniques. Once julienned, turning the subject 90 degrees and dicing finely will produce brunoise (3 mm √ó 3 mm √ó 3 mm). The first known use of the term in print is in Fran√ßois Massialot's Le Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois (1722 edition). The origin of the term is uncertain, but may derive from the proper name Jules or Julien. A potage julienne is composed of carrots, beets, leeks, celery, lettuce, sorrel, and chervil cut in strips a half-ligne in thickness and about eight or ten lignes in length. The onions are cut in half and sliced thinly to give curved sections, the lettuce and sorrel minced, in what a modern recipe would term en chiffonade. The root vegetables are briefly sauteed, then all are simmered in stock and the julienne is ladled out over a slice of bread.

It formed following pressure on the Labour government from some MƒÅori Members of Parliament (MPs) and MƒÅori organisations throughout the country which wanted to see a full MƒÅori unit raised for service overseas. The MƒÅori Battalion followed in the footsteps of the MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion that had served (1915-1919) during the First World War (1914-1918) with success. MƒÅori wanted the formation of a distinct military unit in order to raise their profile, and to serve alongside their PƒÅkehƒÅ compatriots as subjects of the British Empire. It also offered MƒÅori the opportunity to prove themselves and potentially secure autonomy.. Raised in 1940 as part of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division as an extra battalion that moved between the division's three infantry brigades. The battalion fought during the Greek, North African and Italian campaigns, earning a formidable reputation as a fighting force which both Allied and German commanders have acknowledged. It became the most-decorated New Zealand battalion during the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force before being disbanded in January 1946. HistoryFormation= The 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion had its origins before the start of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata started to discuss proposals for the formation of a military unit made up of MƒÅori volunteers. similar to the MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War.. This proposal was furthered by two MƒÅori MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, and from this support within the MƒÅori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for MƒÅori to participate as citizens of the British Empire. According to historian Claudia Orange, the act of raising the battalion was seen as offering the chance to \\"prove the worth of Maoridom...and even secure the long-term goal of Maori autonomy\\". At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would be raised in addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.. Nevertheless, it was decided that the battalion's key positions, including its officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent.. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable MƒÅori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, it was decided that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer‚Äîlater promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940‚Äîand that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-MƒÅori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.. Almost immediately effort was focused upon selecting and identifying the officers and NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for among units that had already formed as part of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits.. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion.. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.. On 26 January 1940 the battalion came together for the first time, marking its official raising at the Palmerston North Show Grounds.. Upon formation it was decided that the battalion would be organised upon tribal lines.. The unit consisted of a headquarters company and four rifle companies, designated 'A' through 'D': 'A' Company (Kamupene ƒÅ ‚Äì NgƒÅ Kiri Kapia ‚Äì the Gumdiggers) was recruited from the Northland to Auckland ; 'B' Company (Kamupene B ‚Äì NgƒÅ Ruku Kapa ‚Äì Penny Divers) from Rotorua, the Bay of Plenty and Thames‚ÄìCoromandel; 'C' Company (Kamupene C ‚Äì NgƒÅ kaupoi ‚Äì The Cowboys) from the East Coast from Gisborne to East Cape and 'D' Company (NgƒÅti Walkabout) from Waikato, Maniapoto, Hawkes Bay, Wellington and the South Island, as well as some Pacific Islands and the Chatham and Stewart Islands. February saw the issuing of equipment and the commencement of training; punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi.. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the battalion's training, as the unit was short of men who were able to serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers most personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, candidates for these roles had to be trained from scratch.. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion was declared on active service.. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940.. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks. =United Kingdom= Sailing upon the Aquitania via Fremantle and Cape Town, the battalion arrived at Gourock, Scotland, after six weeks at sea.. Initially they had been destined to join the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East, but due to concerns about a possible invasion of the United Kingdom by the German Wehrmacht, the decision was made to divert the division's second echelon, a brigade-sized force that included the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion, to Britain to help bolster the island's defences.. In late June or early July 1940 the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion was attached to a mixed brigade under Brigadier Harold Barrowclough. During this time they manned defences in the south of England and undertook further training.. The battalion suffered from a lack of equipment, largely due to the priority given to re-equip British units following the losses suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in France, and consequently training was largely focused upon anti-gas procedures and route marching.. On 6 July they were inspected by King George VI and he was said to have been impressed by the \\"smartness of the close order and arms drill of the MƒÅori Battalion\\" and \\"by the fine physique, keenness and determined demeanour\\" of the men.. alt=Two Maori men wearing military uniforms smile at the camera, surrounded by other soldiers in front of a building Shortly afterwards the Mixed Brigade began quick deployment and defensive manoeuvres in earnest, as fears of invasion grew.. In between exercises, further training was undertaken and the battalion also worked to improve fixed defences throughout July, August and into September. These exercises varied in size from company to battalion-level, and involved differing scenarios and enemy forces.. In September, a divisional review was undertaken and amidst massive German air raids upon London, the New Zealanders were declared to be ready for front-line service in the event of a German landing.. Warning orders for deployment to Egypt were cancelled and the New Zealanders were placed under command of XII Corps, taking up defensive positions in the Folkestone‚ÄìDover region. In October, the MƒÅori Battalion was attached to \\"Milforce\\", under Dittmer's command, along with a squadron of tanks, a squadron of cavalry and a medium machine gun company.. The following month, with an invasion now considered unlikely, the battalion returned to Aldershot for the winter, remaining there for two months.. During this time limited training was undertaken, although upon invitation the battalion fielded a rugby team against a Welsh side at Langley Park, losing 12‚Äì3.. Later in the month, the battalion received the order to begin preparing for redeployment to Egypt and an advance party was dispatched in mid-December. On 7 January 1941 the rest of the battalion left for the Middle East, embarking from Liverpool on the Athlone Castle.. =Middle East= After sailing via Freetown, Cape Town and Durban, the Athlone Castle sailed up the east coast of Africa and entered the Suez Canal, arriving at Tewfik harbour on 3 March 1941.. In the afternoon the battalion entrained and two days later they arrived in the desert, where they were met by motor transport which carried them to camp Garawi, about from Cairo.. At this point they were met by about 300 reinforcements which were used to replace men who had been laid down with influenza and to bring the battalion up to a higher establishment. Shortly afterwards they were moved to Alexandria, where they embarked on the Cameronia, bound for Greece.. =Greece= On 6 April the German invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia began.. In order to help defend Greece, a composite force of three divisions of Australian, British and New Zealand troops were to be deployed, and were grouped together under the title of 'W' Force. However, by the time the invasion began only two of the three divisions had arrived, and the New Zealanders were consequently spread thin, holding a position to the north of Katerini, where they were tasked to defend the strategic Olympus Pass to the south. During this time, the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion was attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, which was later grouped with other Australian and New Zealand units to form the Anzac Corps. Vastly outnumbered, within two days the situation for the Allies was not good as the Germans had broken through the defences along the Bulgarian border and the Yugoslav resistance had collapsed.. As the situation worsened, orders came down from brigade headquarters that the passes would be held \\"to the last man and last round\\".. alt=A map depicting the movement of defensive lines throughout a battle On 9 April, the fall of Salonika precipitated the order for the battalion to withdraw from their positions at Katerini south to Olympus.. As events unfolded elsewhere, the battalion remained in position, digging in and constructing defences until 12 April when they were ordered to withdraw behind the Mavroneri Gorge and reposition themselves on the western aspect. At this time the 5th Infantry Brigade's orders were changed from a holding action to a delay and withdrawal.. It was in the Petra Pass, alongside the 22nd Battalion, that the 28th Battalion fought its first engagement of the war. In preparation for the coming attack, the MƒÅori built their position, running out barbed and concertina wire and digging in while German bombers droned overhead. During the night they carried out patrols along the Mavroneri riverbed, but no contact was made. The following morning, the divisional cavalry, which had been carrying out a rearguard action, conducted a withdrawal through the battalion's position, making the MƒÅori Battalion the most forward Allied unit. As German forces were halted at Platamon by the 21st Battalion, thrusts towards Larisa once again put the battalion's position in doubt and they were again ordered to withdraw. Meanwhile, the Anzac Corps decided to make its last stand south at Thermopylae.. In the end the MƒÅori remained in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back.. With isolated platoons still in contact with the Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging.. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00 am.. After meeting motor transport, the battalion moved back to Ay Dhimitrios, which they began to prepare to defend in order to help seal off the exit of the Olympus pass. The withdrawal continued, though, and on 19 April the MƒÅori Battalion was called upon to conduct a delaying action as the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade pulled back through Larisa towards Lamia, south.. Along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion. Upon arrival at Thermopylae the battalion had had just enough time to dig in before receiving the order that they were to move their position in order to make way for the 6th Infantry Brigade. They completed this move by 21 April, taking up the same positions that Leonidas and his army had defended against Xerxes in 480 BC, according to legend.. Here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence, on 22 April, in Athens, the decision was made that the units of the British Commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from the country.. Over the course of the next two days, the battalion withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went.. In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00 pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00 am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.. =Crete= After being evacuated from Greece, the MƒÅori Battalion embarked upon the landing ship, infantry and was taken to Crete where they formed part of the island's hastily formed garrison. The 5th Infantry Brigade was allocated to the area surrounding the airfield and the battalion was positioned on the north coast at Platanias, on the brigade's right flank... On 20 May 1941, the Germans launched the opening stages of their campaign with large-scale glider and parachute drops of troops from Maleme to Canea.. The landings were focused around the airfield and no troops landed in the area being held by the MƒÅori, nevertheless, a small force of glider troops were found to be occupying a house on the beach about from them. A platoon was dispatched to attack them and after a brief fire-fight in which two New Zealanders were wounded and eight Germans were killed, the 10 remaining men in the house surrendered.. alt=A map depicting the various places where the Germans landed troops on the island of Crete The main German attack was focused upon the 22nd Battalion which was defending the airfield. Hard pressed, late in the day the 22nd requested reinforcements and the 5th Infantry Brigade commander, Brigadier J. Hargest, sent one company from the 23rd and one from the 28th.. The task was given to 'B' Company and, as the company commander only knew the direct route, they had a night approach march of over to cover. During the march they came in contact with a platoon-sized force of Germans which briefly held up the company before reinforcements could arrive.. The German force surrendered, but in doing so one of their number threw a grenade at the New Zealanders, wounding two men. In response the MƒÅori fixed bayonets and carried out the first bayonet charge by a New Zealand force during the war, killing 24. A short while later they killed another eight in a separate engagement.. Continuing on towards the 22nd Battalion, they bumped into a number of small pockets of Germans before eventually linking up with the 22nd Battalion's headquarters where they were told to return to their own lines as the decision had been made to withdraw from the airfield.. Eleven hours later the company reported back to the 28th Battalion's lines.. Over the course of the next ten days the battalion was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2/7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the MƒÅori accounting for 100.. However, it soon became clear that the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia. The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.. On 30 May the final order was received, although due to shipping losses it was not possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind.. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later.. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded.. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.. =North Africa= Members of the 28th Battalion performing a alt=Maori men kneeling, performing the hakaAfter their escape from Crete, the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion was evacuated to Egypt where they were re-issued with summer uniforms and began to receive reinforcements. In June they carried out a ceremonial parade for King George VI and the Queen, and the commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, Lieutenant General Bernard Freyberg.. Throughout July, the battalion undertook desert familiarisation training and sports parades before moving to Kabrit where they concentrated with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade for a three-week combined operations exercise.. Later, in August, they moved to a position west of El Alamein, known as the \\"Kaponga Box\\" where throughout September and into October they undertook the unfamiliar task of road construction.. In October, the brigade received orders to link up with the rest of the division in preparation for their commitment to the battle along the frontier.. On 11 November 1941, the 5th Infantry Brigade concentrated near Mersa Matruh. Three days later the division had assembled and began the advance into Libya.. Their first task was to capture the seaside town of Sollum, which was taken on 23 November from its Italian garrison with only a few casualties. Follow-up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Dittmer, and two company commanders. Two hundred and forty-seven Italian prisoners were taken... Following this, the 5th Infantry Brigade was placed under the command of the 4th Indian Division and the 28th Battalion took up positions near Bardia.. Three days later the battalion attacked a column of tanks and motorised infantry before ambushing a column at Menastir on 3 December. Later, notable actions were undertaken at Gazala and at Sidi Magreb where over 1,000 Italians prisoners were captured. Following this, the battalion was deployed to Syria before returning to Egypt in June 1942. Now officially under the command of a MƒÅori for the first time‚ÄîLieutenant Colonel Eruera Love having taken over from Dyer in May‚Äîthe MƒÅori took part in the 2nd New Zealand Division's breakout from Minqar Qaim, undertaking a successful bayonet charge.. At this time, the battalion's skills with the bayonet earned them a reputation as \\"scalp hunters\\" among German commanders, including Rommel. In September and October the battalion took part in important actions as part of the offensive in the Munassib Depression and at Miteiriya Ridge during the Second Battle of El Alamein. On 2 November the battalion supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle. Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942.. Nevertheless, the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943, at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap, where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German panzer grenadier battalion. It was during this action that Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross.. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bennett, also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack.. Two weeks later, on the night 19/20 April 1943, the battalion took part in the 5th Infantry Brigade's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna. The village was situated atop a steep slope, and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines, which wounded a number of men, including the commanding officer. Nevertheless, two sections under the command of Sergeant Haane te Rauawa Manahi, managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on the pinnacle in the early dawn. Following heavy shellfire and hand-to-hand combat with the Italian defenders, the MƒÅori were forced off the pinnacle twice; each time, though, Manahi led his small force in a counterattack. In the afternoon, Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions, encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender. For these actions, Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross, but the nomination was not approved and he received a Distinguished Conduct Medal instead. =Italy= The battalion returned to Egypt with the 5th Infantry Brigade in late-May and underwent a period of refit and retraining, during which the bulk of the original unit was given three months leave and returned to New Zealand.. Following the evacuation to hospital of Lieutenant Colonel Kingi Keiha, there were no suitable senior MƒÅori officers available and he was replaced as commanding officer by Lieutenant Colonel Monty Fairbrother on 11 September... Having taken no part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July ‚Äì August, the 2nd New Zealand Division was committed to battle again in late 1943 as part of Eighth Army during the Italian Campaign. The MƒÅori Battalion subsequently arrived in Italy on 22 October, landing at Taranto.. 5th Infantry Brigade undertook a period of training in close-country tactics, remaining in camp at Taranto until 18 November when it was ordered to move north to join the Eighth Army.. The 2nd New Zealand Division had moved into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would take part in the advance across the Sangro planned for the end of the month. The brigade subsequently occupied positions around Atessa, with the MƒÅori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander‚Äîcommander of the 15th Army Group‚Äîhad planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap.. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The MƒÅori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.. alt=Soldiers march along a road past a stone building that has been damaged During New Zealand Division took part in the Moro River Campaign. By this time the attacking battalions had exploited forward towards the Winter Line and the MƒÅori Battalion moved forward by truck on 1 December, crossing the Sangro. Heavy congestion on the road delayed the battalion's movements, and although scheduled to assault towards Elici, they arrived to find the 23rd Battalion and the Division Cavalry had already completed the task. The MƒÅori were again ordered into reserve, occupying positions east of Castelfrentano.. Meanwhile, on 3 December, the 6th Infantry Brigade assaulted Orsogna, and was involved in heavy fighting there, first capturing and then losing it following a counter- attack by German armour. A subsequent attack against Orsogna was planned by the New Zealanders utilising both the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades. The attack was scheduled for 7 December, with both brigades to advance on a one battalion front. The MƒÅori Battalion would lead the assault in the 5th Infantry Brigade section, up the Pascuccio spur to cut the Orsogna‚ÄìOrtona road east of the 6th Infantry Brigade's objective. Fairbrother planned to assault with two companies forward, one in depth and one in reserve, with support from armour and anti-tank guns. This could not be provided though, as difficult terrain prevented tracked vehicles from moving across the Moro and up on to Pascuccio.. The attack on Orsogna began at 3:30 pm, following a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil.. Although initially some progress was made, the Germans managed to hold Orsogna throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the MƒÅori were withdrawn from the line on the night of 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.. The New Zealanders were subsequently transferred to the Fifth Army for its advance up the west coast of Italy towards Rome.. Leaving behind the bitter cold on the other side of the peninsula, the battalion undertook a period of training and reorganisation near Sant' Angelo d'Alife.. At this time Fairbrother was replaced by another pƒÅkehƒÅ officer, Major Russell Young, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led the battalion until July 1944. As part of the Fifth Army's advance up the Liri valley, the MƒÅori Battalion's next major engagement came in early 1944 when they took part in the fighting around Monte Cassino. The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic Benedictine monastery. Throughout January the Allies continued their advance, but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled.. On the night of 17/18 February 1944, as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines, the MƒÅori were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino.. They met very stiff resistance, and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders. Lacking armoured support, which had failed to arrive, they fought through the morning and into the afternoon, but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw... The two assaulting companies, 'A' and 'B', suffered over 60 per cent casualties, losing 128 men killed or wounded. In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino, however, it was not until May that the position was eventually captured, by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line, and transferred back to the Eighth Army.. Due to these losses, the battalion did not return to the front until July 1944. It subsequently took part in the Allied advance towards Florence and is believed to have been first to reach the city on 4 August. During this time Major Arapeta Awatere led the battalion as its acting commanding officer after Young was hospitalised with jaundice,. although he returned in late August and subsequently led them through the fighting around Rimini in September.. In November, Awatere took over command substantively, and in December the battalion launched an attack around Faenza, for which its commanding officer later received a Distinguished Service Order.. The winter snow set in after this and, as Allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere, offensive action died down.. Thus, throughout January, February and into March the battalion undertook defensive duties, before being withdrawn from the line in mid-March.. In April 1945 the battalion returned to the front line to take part in the final stages of the war. On 1 April the battalion entered the line near Granarolo along with the rest of the 5th Infantry Brigade and for the next month they were involved in five main battles along the Senio, Santerno, Sillaro, Gaiana and Idice rivers as the Allies pursued the Germans back towards Trieste.. It was in Trieste that the MƒÅori Battalion's war came to an end. Their involvement in the final stages of the fighting in Italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded,. while losses for the entire Italian campaign were 230 men killed, and 887 wounded. =Disbandment= On 2 May 1945 news was received that all German forces west of the Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, on the night of 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over.. Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.. Following this the routine of the battalion became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand.. The war with Japan continued however, and at the time it was believed that the MƒÅori would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare. Throughout July the battalion undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene.. On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan's unconditional surrender, ending plans for the battalion to take part in further combat in the Pacific. In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.. The last batch of long service men had departed shortly after the battalion's arrival at Lake Trasimene, and so after this it was decided that the battalion would return to New Zealand as a formed unit. As such their return was to be delayed and so they found winter quarters in Florence.. At this time it was decided that men from the battalion would be included within the New Zealand contribution to the occupation of Japan. In this vein, a 270-strong contingent from the battalion was sent to Japan under the designation of 'D' Squadron, 2nd Divisional Cavalry Battalion, under the command of Major J.S Baker.. Finally, on 6 December the battalion entrained at Florence and embarked on the troopship at Taranto on Boxing Day. Passing through the Suez Canal, they sailed via Fremantle, arriving in Wellington on 23 January 1946, where they were met by the acting Prime Minister, Walter Nash, at Aotea Quay for an official MƒÅori welcome home ceremony. Afterwards the men were sent back to their homes and the battalion was disbanded.. Throughout the course of the war, 3,600 men served in the battalion. Of these, 649 were killed or died of wounds while another 1,712 were wounded. Another 29 died as a result of service following discharge, while two were killed by accident during training in New Zealand. The MƒÅori Battalion's service against the Germans in North Africa earned them a distinguished reputation. Such was the respect that Allied commanders had for the MƒÅori Battalion that they were frequently used as a spearhead unit. Bernard Freyberg, the General Officer Commanding of the 2NZEF, commented, \\"No infantry had a more distinguished record, or saw more fighting, or, alas, had such heavy casualties, as the Maori Battalion.\\" The battalion's reputation was also acknowledged by their opponents. Some sources state that the Afrika Korps commander, Erwin Rommel remarked,\\"Give me the Maori Battalion and I will conquer the world\\".. Other sources attribute this comment to Rommel's former chief of staff, General Siegfried Westphal, who met with the former MƒÅori Battalion chaplain, Reverend Canon Wiremu T. Huata, during an Afrika Korps reunion dinner in Mainz, Germany, in 1972. Decorations In total, the MƒÅori Battalion received more individual bravery decorations than any other New Zealand battalion. One member of the battalion, Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu, was awarded the Victoria Cross during the war, while another member, Sergeant Haane Manahi, was also recommended for the award. During the fighting around Takrouna in 1943, Manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of Italian positions; the following day he set out to capture Italian outposts. Four generals, including Harold Alexander, Bernard Freyberg, Howard Kippenberger and Bernard Law Montgomery had recommended that Manahi receive the Victoria Cross but this recommendation was downgraded in London to the Distinguished Conduct Medal.Cody 1956, p. 502. In 2000, iwi Te Arawa lodged a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal for Haane Manahi to have his award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal upgraded to a Victoria Cross. In December 2005 the Waitangi Tribunal released their findings supporting the claim, but in October 2006 the New Zealand Minister of Defence announced that the award could not be made as King George VI had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made. Instead, it was decided that Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth, a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented to Manahi's son by The Duke of York on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in Rotorua. Other awards to members of the 28th (MƒÅori) Battalion included: seven Distinguished Service Orders; one Member of the Order of the British Empire; 21 Military Crosses and three bars; and 13 Distinguished Conduct Medals; 51 Military Medals; one British Empire Medal and one US Silver Star..

History The Convent was established in 1906 as an Oblates of Mary Immaculate Catholic school for girls at the initiative of the German imperial administration. Bishop Koppmann informed the Director of Education that as from the beginning of the 1977 school year, the Catholic Church would open their educational institutions to all population groups. The result of this move was the Education Department's withdrawal of the subsidy to the school. The German Catholics made up for the loss of subsidy by donating R15,000 annually to the school. In 1979, CDM (Namdeb), donated R10,000 towards sports facilities which was used for new tennis courts. The school was registered with the Department of National Education in 1982. From that time a quarterly subsidy was received. In 1985, the Holy Cross High School was closed. In 2005 the school appointed Yasmin Agnew as principal. Agnew was the first lay principal in the school's history. Enrolment and activity On the staff there are 25 teachers; including Sisters. The school follows curriculum legislated by the Namibian Ministry of Education. Classes and Activities are: Mathematics, English, Afrikaans (2nd Language), German (foreign language), Physical/Natural Science, physical education, Social studies (History and Geography), Singing (gr.

During the communist era Tatra employed over 16,000 (including about 1,000 of Vietnamese nationality). It currently employs 3,700. The controlling interest of Tatra was owned by an international consortium of Vectra Group of U.K., Sam Eyde of Lansing, Michigan, KBC PE of Belgium and Ronald Adams, and nowadays, it is owned by Jaroslav Strnad, who is a Czech armorer. Other important industrial sectors include chemicals, pharmaceuticals, glass, rubber, paper and textiles. Brewing is also an important industry and some of the country's finest beers are produced in the area. Meanwhile in the past Tatra was bankrupt, at present, it is increasing its production.

The park is home to many species of flora and fauna, as well as the location of over 30 pre-Columbian archaeological sites. Since 1986, the park has not been open to tourism due to the fragile nature of both the natural and archaeological environment. Geography and climate Located in the San Mart√≠n Region of Peru between the Mara√±√≥n and Huallaga rivers, the park has an area of approximately 2,745.2 square kilometres. The park covers 70% of the Abiseo river basin. Elevations reach as high as 4,200 meters (13,780 ft) above sea level and as low as 350 m (1,150 ft). The park protects three distinct ecoregions: Ucayali moist forests at lower elevations, Peruvian Yungas at middle elevations, and Cordillera Central p√°ramo at the highest elevations. There are at least seven climate zones in the park, including montane forest, tropical alpine forest, montane rainforest, high Andean grasslands (puna), and dry forest. Rainfall ranges from 20 to per annum. The montane cloud forest, composing most of the park area, is a high-altitude rainforest with short trees, moss and lichen. This ecosystem occurs above the altitude of about 2,300 meters (7,550 ft). High humidity is constant and rain falls throughout the year, particularly at the higher elevations. The soil is acidic. Wildlife King vulture, Sarcoramphus papa The yellow-tailed woolly monkey, Oreonax flavicauda, previously thought to be extinct, is known to live in the park and appears to be endemic to the region. It was mostly due to this monkey's critically endangered status that the area gained national park status and was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in 1983. Other fauna in the park includes: * Andean guan, Penelope montagnii * Venezuelan red howler, Alouatta seniculus * White-fronted spider monkey, Ateles belzebuth (endangered) * Jaguar, Panthera onca * King vulture, Sarcoramphus papa * Three-striped night monkey, Aotus trivirgatus * Curassaw, Crax salvini * Peruvian guemal, Hippocamelus antisensis (endangered) * Mountain paca or punatuacher, Agouti tazcanowskii (endangered) * Southern pochard duck, Netta erythrophthalma * Spectacled bear, Tremarctos ornatus (endangered) * Turkey vulture, Cathartes aura * White-fronted capuchin, Cebus albifrons cuscinus * Hairy long-nosed armadillo Dasypus pilosus * Yellow-crowned amazon, Amazona ochrocephala * Russet-mantled softtail, Phacellodomus berlepschi (endangered) * Yellow-browed toucanet (endangered) There are 980 known species of plants documented in the highlands of the park, 13 of which are endemic, and 5000 species of plants in the area of the Rio Abiseo. Archaeology The most famous archaeological site in the Rio Abiseo park is Gran Pajat√©n, a ruined settlement atop a forested ridge overlooking the Montecristo River canyon. Nearby are the ruins of Los Pinchudos a series of cliff tombs discovered by Pataz villagers in the early 1970s. Gran Pajat√©n, Los Pinchudos and other archaeological remains identified in the park are usually attributed to the Chachapoyas culture. The most extensive archaeological work done in Rio Abiseo Park was led by the University of Colorado during the mid-1980s.

Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. It was issued by City Lights Books. Amazon rainforest Most of the letters date back to 1953 and chronicle Burroughs' visit to the Amazon rainforest in search of yag√© (ayahuasca), a plant with near-mythical hallucinogenic and some say telepathic qualities. Along the way, Burroughs and Ginsberg share other stories and anecdotes, including some concepts Burroughs would later use in novels such as Naked Lunch. The book ends with further correspondence written in 1960 detailing Ginsberg's experiments with yag√©. Two Burroughs pieces Beyond the letters themselves, the book is noteworthy for two short pieces by Burroughs. The anarchic \\"Roosevelt After Inauguration\\", a savage parody of American politics in which \\"a purple-assed baboon\\" is appointed to the United States Supreme Court, was omitted from the original edition of the book on the grounds it might be considered obscene; it was subsequently issued as a chapbook later in the 1960s and was later published in the small volume Roosevelt After Inauguration and Other Atrocities with two political essays. The story was restored to The Yage Letters in a later reprinting by City Lights. The second notable piece serves as the epilogue to the book. \\"I Am Dying, Meester?\\" is considered a poem by some and is an early demonstration of the \\"cut-up technique\\" espoused by Burroughs in the 1960s, shuffling together fragments of sentences and thoughts from other texts to create a surreal new narrative. Status as a novel Some sources, including City Lights Books itself, consider The Yage Letters to be a novel. According to the back cover of a 1990s edition of the book, Burroughs and Ginsberg began compiling the work in late 1953, not long after the original set of letters was written, but it was not published for nearly a decade. The Yage Letters Redux In April 2006, City Lights Books published Yage Letters Redux, a new edition of the book edited by Oliver Harris. The book has been expanded with an extensive essay on its history (written by Harris), along with previously unpublished material by Burroughs and Ginsberg. Harris established that the 1953 letters were in fact largely fabricated from notes and a prose narrative which Burroughs first wrote. Category:1963 non- fiction books Category:Books by William S.

He was described by some as an experienced businessman with the mind of child. Marx was known by numerous nicknames, including \\"Toycoon,\\" \\"the Henry Ford of the toy industry,\\" \\"the hawk of the toy industry,\\" and \\"the toy king of America.\\" Time Magazine 1955; Fortune Magazine, January 1946 Biography Born in Brooklyn, New York, to Austrian Jewish parents, Marx graduated from high school at age 15 and started his career working for Ferdinand Strauss, a manufacturer of mechanical toys. By 1916, Marx was managing Strauss' plant in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but was eventually voted out by Strauss' board of directors over a disagreement about sales practices. Marx then entered the United States Army as a private and attained the rank of sergeant before returning to civilian life in 1918. Marx's passion for the Army was reflected throughout his life. Most of Marx's military toys represented Army equipment, and Marx would later make a practice of befriending generals and naming his sons after them. Following military service, Marx then went to work selling for Newton and Thompson, a Vermont- based manufacturer of wood toys, where he redesigned their product line and increased the company's sales tenfold.Time Magazine 1955; In 1919, Marx and his brother David incorporated, founding the company that bore his name. Initially working as a middle man, Marx was soon able to purchase tooling to manufacture toys himself. When Strauss fell on hard financial times, Marx was able to buy the dies for two Strauss toys and turn them into best-sellers. By age 26, three years after founding his company, Marx was a millionaire. He was declared \\"Toy King of the World\\" in October 1937 in a London newspaper. By 1938, Marx employed 500 workers in the Dudley factory and 4000 in the American factories.Kern, Rusty (2015) \\"Marx Toy Kings\\", Volume 1. Blurb Publishing Company. By utilizing techniques of mass production and revitalizing old designs as much as possible ‚Äì Marx utilized some of his toy train tooling developed in the early 1930s until 1972 ‚Äì Marx was able to sell a broad line of inexpensive toys. All US-made toy trains would come from a plant in Girard, Pennsylvania, which produced millions of lithographed tin and plastic toy trains. By 1951, the Marx company had 12 factories worldwide. For much of the 1950s, it was the largest toy manufacturer in the world, with much of the success coming from Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog sales and the many themed playsets available. As World War II drew to a close, Marx had toured Europe and acted as a consultant on how toy manufacturing could aid reconstruction efforts. Marx used the contacts he made in this manner to forge partnerships and open factories in Europe and Japan. Marx was featured on the cover of Time magazine on December 12, 1955, with his portrait eclipsing an image of Santa Claus, while examples of his toys swirl in the background. Marx married his first wife Irene Saltzman, nicknamed Ren√©, on December 31, 1927 in Manhattan, New York.\\"New York, New York City Marriage Records, 1829-1940,\\" database, FamilySearch Rene died in April 1944 of breast cancer at age 37. Marx became very depressed at this time and suggested he might quit the business to take care of his four children. On March 30, 1947, Marx married Idella Ruth Blackadder, Louis' chief jewelry designer for his Charmore line and nearly 28 years his junior.Kern, Rusty (2015) \\"Marx Toy Kings\\", Volume 1. Blurb Publishing Company. Woodlawn Cemetery Marx's daughter, Patricia, was born in 1938. She went on to become an activist author, and the second wife of Daniel Ellsberg, assisting him in the release of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Louis Marx, a strident anti-Communist and supporter of Richard Nixon, regarded Ellsberg as a traitor afterwards.Wells, Tom (2001). Wild Man: The Life and Times of Daniel Ellsberg. Palgrave. His eldest child, Barbara Marx Hubbard (1929‚Äì2019), was a New Age futurist who was involved in helping humans make an evolutionary shift to a higher consciousness. Marx's son, Louis Marx Junior, is a venture capitalist and philanthropist who has contributed to the arts, education and medicine.Kern, Rusty (2015) \\"Marx Toy Kings\\", Volume 1. Blurb Publishing Company. One such example is the Louis Marx Center for Children and Families of New York. The industrialist retired in 1972, selling his company to Quaker Oats for $54 million.Fantle, David & Johnson, Tom (2018) \\"Hollywood Heyday\\". McFarland & Co. Inc. Publishing. Marx was 76 years old and had thought about retiring for a number of years. In the later years, Marx had less hands-on involvement in the manufacturing process. Marx ruled his toy empire from the 200 5th Avenue, New York office, with open 24-hour telephone communication. His last plant visit had been in 1950.Matzke, Eric (1989) \\"Greenberg's guide to Marx Trains\\", Volume 1. Greenberg Publishing Company Inc. Louis Marx died at the hospital in White Plains, New York, at age 85. He is interred in a private mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

It was originally published in the UK on 6 June 2005. Soon after, it appeared in Japan and America, where Shan's previous series, The Saga of Darren Shan, had sold millions. The novel is set in Ireland and is told in present tense first person through Grubbs Grady, a child whose family are all chess players. Plot Grubitsch \\"Grubbs\\" Grady, the younger child of chess-obsessed parents, grows increasingly uneasy with the recent strange, nervous behavior of his parents and sister. One night, he finds the mutilated bodies of his family and encounters Lord Loss, a gruesome human-like demon who sets his two familiars, Vein and Artery, on Grubbs. Although Grubbs manages to escape, he is deeply traumatized and is placed in a mental institute. He refuses to respond to treatment until he is visited by his father's younger brother, Dervish Grady, who tells Grubbs that he knows demons exist and convinces Grubbs to finally accept help. After Grubbs recovers, he lives with the rather eccentric Dervish in his mansion near the village of Carcery Vale. Dervish explains to Grubbs that using magic is possible as Grubbs himself used magic to flee from Lord Loss and his minions. As Grubbs begins to settle down, he meets and befriends Bill-E Spleen, another orphan who visits Dervish often to learn magic. Bill-E tells Grubbs of his belief that Dervish may actually be his father, given how close they were before then, but tells Grubbs to keep it a secret from him, which he agrees. Later, when exploring the cellar, Grubbs comes across a book on demonology, and opens to a page containing an illustration of Lord Loss, which seemingly comes to life and calls to him. Grubbs immediately closes the book and runs out of the cellar. Time passes, and later, Grubbs and Bill-E discover animal corpses being left in the nearby forest. They also notice Dervish collecting them and disposing of the remains. Fearing for Grubbs‚Äô safety, Bill-E eventually shares his theory that Dervish is a werewolf, as many Gradys were prone to lycanthropy, which manifests itself at puberty. However, Bill-E is later revealed to be the real werewolf, though he doesn't know it himself. Dervish confirms to Grubbs that the Gradys are indeed cursed, only that it has been going on for centuries. Dervish later explains that Bill-E is Grubbs' half-brother from one of his father's affairs. The only way to cure him is by winning three out of five simultaneous chess games with the powerfully magical demon master Lord Loss while another person battles his familiars. Neither one is permitted to fail. This is also revealed to be the reason his family was killed, when his sister Gret also succumbed to the family curse. Meera Flame, a friend of Dervish, who is knocked out while trying to restrain a transformed Bill-E, was supposed to help battle the demons. Dervish convinces an extremely reluctant Grubbs, who is still haunted by nightmares, to take her place. While confronting Lord Loss, Dervish is constantly distracted from his chess match as Grubbs is unable to fight off the two familiars. Dervish finally uses magic to save Grubbs, but Lord Loss sees this as breaking the rules of the game and is about to let his familiars kill Dervish, Grubbs, and Bill-E. However, Dervish is able to convince Lord Loss to let Grubbs finish the chess game, while he battles the familiars. A terrified Grubbs then makes a bad game worse. Then Grubbs realizes that Lord Loss is feeding on his despair and then decides to play with an aloof attitude. This throws Lord Loss' concentration, allowing Grubbs to win the game. Lord Loss then cures Bill-E, but someone must battle him in his realm. Grubbs offers to go, but Dervish refuses to let Grubbs fight and goes instead. Dervish leaves to the Demonata universe, leaving Grubbs behind with Bill-E. Grubbs lies to Bill-E, telling him that Dervish used a calming spell to try to cure his lycanthropy. Grubbs figures that it's better for Bill-E to believe that Dervish is his father, since his real father is dead. Fourteen months later Grubbs has been caring for Dervish in his zombie-like state, also dealing with the fear that he'll turn into a werewolf. One morning, Grubbs wakes up to find blood under his nails and hair in his teeth. Thinking that he has turned, he prepares to call the mysterious Lambs Dervish told him about, to kill him before he does any harm. As Grubbs reaches for the phone he hears someone call his name. Turning to look he sees Dervish, with his senses regained, holding a tin of paint and a woollen scarf. The book ends with Dervish saying, \\"The look on your face!\\" Reception James Delingpole, writing in The Daily Telegraph described the book as dark but moral, \\"The scene in which the boy's father, mother and sister are disemboweled and shredded by the demon Lord Loss and his vile familiars Artery and Vein, must surely be the most jaw-droppingly grisly in children's literature.\\".

It is loosely based on the true story of Korea's first serial murders in history, which took place between 1986 and 1991 in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province. Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung star as Detective Park and Detective Seo, respectively, two of the detectives trying to solve the crimes. The film was the second feature film directed by Bong, following his 2000 debut film Barking Dogs Never Bite. The screenplay was adapted by Bong and Shim Sung-bo from Kim Kwang-rim's 1996 stage play about the same subject. The film's earned critical acclaim for its cinematography, film editing, and musical score, as well as Song Kang-ho's performance, Bong's direction and screenplay were widely praised. It has been regarded by several publications as one of the finest films ever made. Plot In October 1986, two women are found raped and murdered in a ditch. Local detective Park Doo- man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed ‚Äî evidence is improperly collected, the police's investigative methods are suspect, and their forensic technology is near non-existent. Park claims he has a way of determining suspects by eye contact. He decides to first question a scarred mentally handicapped boy, Baek Kwang-ho, who resides in the town. He uses his eye contact method, thinking Baek is responsible, and has his partner Cho beat confessions out of Baek. Seo Tae-yoon, a detective from Seoul, volunteers to assist them. However he and Park's methods clash. Seo deems Baek's hands too weak and scarred to be able to commit such an elaborate crime, clearing his name. After more murders are committed, they realize that the killer waits until a rainy night and only kills women wearing red. Officer Kwon Kwi-ok realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed. At the latest crime scene, Park, Cho and Seo all arrive to investigate in different ways, but a local man there masturbates in a woman's red lingerie. Park and Cho apprehend the man, brutally beating him. Seo finds a survivor of the killer with Kwon's help. Upon learning that the killer's hands were noticeably soft, Seo clears the man, as his hands are rough. Infuriated that they lost their suspect, Park scuffles with Seo until Kwon alerts them that the song on the radio is playing. They realize it's raining but arrive too late, finding another woman murdered. Park, Seo and Cho finally decide to work together. Upon doing an autopsy of the latest victim, they discover pieces of a peach in the body. Clues lead them to a factory worker, Park Hyeon-gyu. Seo notes that his hands are soft like the survivor had described. Hyeon-gyu begins to show discomfort when Seo presents the peaches and they think they've found the killer. Cho loses control and beats Hyeon-gyu, prompting their superior to ban him from the interrogation room. Park and Seo listen to Baek's earlier confession. Seo points out that he talks as if someone else did it and they realize he knew details of the murder because he witnessed it. They go to Baek's father's restaurant, only to discover a drunken Cho there. As people watch news and ridicule police officers, he beats everyone and Baek joins the fray, swinging a wooden board at Cho's leg and accidentally piercing it with a rusty nail. Park and Seo chase Baek and question him, but he gets frightened and runs into the path of an oncoming train, where he is hit and killed. Park learns that Cho's leg will have to be amputated because the nail caused tetanus, leaving him feeling guilty. They discover semen on one of the bodies, but because of lack of technology, the sample has to be sent to the United States to confirm if suspect Hyeon-gyu is the killer. That night, a young girl is killed. At the crime scene, Seo recognizes the girl as the same schoolgirl he had befriended while investigating. Enraged, he attacks Hyeon-gyu until he is interrupted by Park bringing the results from America. The sample does not match Hyeon-gyu's DNA. Park lets Hyeon-gyu go. In the end, the crimes remain unsolved. While visiting the crime scene years later in 2003, Park Doo-man, now a businessman, learns from a little girl that the scene had recently been visited by an unknown man with a 'normal' face, someone who looked very ordinary.

Real life case While a total body count was never mentioned in the film, at least 10 similar murders were committed in the Hwaseong area between October 1986 and April 1991. This killing spree became known as the Hwaseong serial murders. Some of the details of the murders, such as the killer gagging the women with their underwear, were also taken from the case.Unsolved murders may escape prosecution , daum.net, March 2, 2006, retrieved March 11, 2006. As in the film, the investigators found bodily fluids suspected to belong to the murderer in the crime scenes, but did not have access to equipment to determine whether the DNA matched with the suspects until late in the investigations. After the ninth murder, DNA evidence was sent to Japan (unlike the film, where it was sent to America) for analysis, but the results did not correspond with the suspects.Hwang Ho-taek, DNA Evidence, donga.com, January 21, 2006, retrieved March 11, 2006. As in the film, at the time of its release, the actual murderer had not yet been caught. As the case was growing closer to reaching the statute of limitations, South Korea's leading Uri Party sought to amend the law to give the prosecutors more time to find the murderer. However, in 2006, the statute of limitations was reached for the last-known victim.Lee Sun-young, Uri seeks extension of prosecution time limits, The Korea Herald, November 23, 2005. More than 13 years later, on 18 September 2019, police announced that a man in his 50s, Lee Choon-jae, had been identified as a suspect in the killings. He was identified after DNA from the underwear of one of the victims was matched with his, and subsequent evidence linked him to four of the ten murders. At the time he was identified he was already serving a life sentence at a prison in Busan for the rape and murder of his sister-in-law. Lee initially denied any involvement in the serial murders, but on 2 October 2019, police announced that Lee had confessed to killing 14 people, including all 10 serial murders and 4 others. Two of those murders happened in Suwon, and the other two happened in Cheongju.

History  1970 Orbea city bikeOrbea was founded in 1840 by brothers Juan Manuel, Mateo, and Casimiro Orbea in Eibar, Basque Country, Spain. Originally a rifle and gun producer, Orbea exited the gun business and began designing and producing bicycles as Orbea Bicycles in 1930. Orbea began participating in the Tour de France as early as 1934, with famous Spaniard Mariano Ca√±ardo as the face of the Orbea road cycling team. In 1969, under dire financial circumstances, employees formed a co-operative and purchased Orbea from the Orbea family. The newly formed Orbea cooperative left Eibar the same year to nearby Mallabia, where their first dedicated bicycle factory was built. For the next several decades, the company would focus on producing leisure bikes for consumers in Spain and around Europe. Orbea would return to competitive road cycling in the 1980s as Gin MG-Orbea and later SEAT-Orbea, led by Spaniard cyclists Pedro Delgado, Jokin M√∫jika, and Pello Ruiz Cabestany. Participating in both Tour de France and Vuelta a Espa√±a. Orbea began manufacturing mountain bikes in 1989.

Burroughs, first published in 1970. Based upon the life (or, to be more precise, the death) of 1930s German-Jewish-American gangster Dutch Schultz, the novel uses as its springboard Schultz's surreal last words, which were delivered in the midst of high-fever delirium after being mortally shot while urinating in the men's room of a Newark bar. Phrases such as \\"French- Canadian bean soup\\" took on a different meaning for Burroughs as he invented stories to go along with some of the nonsensical statements made by Schultz in his dying hours. Structure Despite the title, very little of the screenplay deals with Schultz's cryptic words. Although Burroughs specifies that a recording of Schultz's dying words should be playing throughout the film as the soundtrack, virtually nothing which is actually depicted onscreen has anything to do with the real Schultz's dying monologue. Burroughs creates his own dying words for Schultz to actually speak, and which reflect Burrough's narrative; occasionally, these made-up snippets of speech include Schultz's actual words. Similarly, large segments of the story are told from a third-person perspective, as opposed to being told from Schultz's perspective. The screenplay is made up of a series of loosely connected vignettes in roughly chronological order. It begins from the point of view of a dying Dutch Schultz, looking up at two police detectives. He has a brief flashback to his own shooting; from there, the movie makes a transition to Schultz's memories of childhood, with the remainder of the movie a series of loosely interconnected vignettes in chronological order depicting Schultz's childhood and rise to power. Occasionally, there are brief, surrealist digressions depicting real events which occurred during Schultz's life (such as the Stock Market Crash), interspersed with equally surreal yet seemingly unrelated digressions involving Burroughs' own fictional characters. A lengthy segment is dedicated to Schultz hiring a carnival sideshow freak who can hypnotize people by speaking phrases which plant subliminal messages; Burroughs inserts this fictional character into Schultz's legal team during his income tax trials, and credits him with helping Schultz avoid prison time. Large segments are dedicated to Burroughs' own creation, \\"Albert Stern\\", a morphine addict who randomly appears at intervals throughout Schultz's life and who ultimately attempts to take credit for his murder. Despite no records existing of a contemporary of Schultz named \\"Albert Stern\\", a period mugshot appears in the book depicting \\"Stern\\"; the mugshot has since been incorrectly identified as Otto Berman. As of 2007, the identity of the boy in the mugshot has not been discerned, although Burroughs' insertion of a photo of himself into the book‚Äîostensibly depicting the police stenographer who transcribed Schultz's last word‚Äîindicates that the mugshot might be a prank on Burroughs' part, as it is the only photo in the book not to depict a readily identifiable individual. The script begins with a series of detailed, coherent explanations by Burroughs of the identities of various characters, how the film should be shot, etc. As the screenplay progresses, Burroughs' instructions becoming increasingly absurd and cryptic; at one point, Burroughs calls for Jack Diamond to appear as a motionless man in a chair who speaks without moving his lips, specifying that this should be achieved by the actor's dialogue being recorded into a cassette recorder which is then played behind the actor during filming. Throughout the script, Burroughs calls for a peep booth-style 16mm sex loop‚Äîdepicting a red haired young man having aggressive intercourse with a Spanish woman in a brass bed‚Äîto be played at seemingly random intervals. Film adaptation Although there have been occasional reports over the years of filmmakers wanting to adapt Burroughs' story for the screen, to date no one has seriously taken on the project. For a brief period, Dennis Hopper owned the rights to the film, but nothing ever came to fruition. It was filmed as a 2002 Dutch short combining live action and rotoscope animated scenes. The short only features portions of Burroughs' script, with some segments varying slightly from the source material. The film features Rutger Hauer as the voice of Schultz.

It was first named The Glenmorrison Range by John Oxley during his exploration of the area in January 1824. In 1828, the colonial botanist Charles Fraser, whilst looking at the range from the Ipswich area, noted the bearings as Sir Herbert Taylor‚Äôs Range from which the current name derived. The range is an eastern spur at the southern end of the D'Aguilar Range. The section of the range north of Enoggera Creek (sometimes called the Enoggera side of the range) includes the Keperra Bushland, Enoggera Military Area and the Ashgrove Golf Club golf course. Most of the range south of Enoggera Creek (the Mt Coot-tha side) is covered by the protected area of Mt Coot-tha Reserve (or Mt Coot-tha Forest). The two sections of the range separate at Enoggera Reservoir and circle the crater shaped suburb of The Gap like the claws of a crab, leaving a narrow entrance via Waterworks Road from the east (this being ‚Äòthe gap‚Äô from which the suburb got its name). The Enoggera side of the range is bound on the north by the upper end of the Kedron Brook catchment area which includes the tributary of Cedar Creek. Enoggera Creek and its tributaries, Ithaca Creek (formed by East Ithaca Creek and West Ithaca Creek which join near the Bardon Scenic Reserve), and Fish Creek commencing at Wittonga Park at The Gap, drain the eastern slopes between the Enoggera and Mt Coot-tha sections of the range. The Mt Coot-tha side of the range is drained on the western slopes by Gap Creek, a tributary of Moggill Creek, and Cubberla Creek which runs south into the Brisbane River. Toowong Creek starts on the eastern slope of Mt Coot-tha and travels through the Brisbane Botanic Gardens on its way to the Brisbane River. Ithaca Creek was unsuccessfully mined for gold between 1894 and the 1950s. Remnants of the mining operations can be found within Brisbane Forest Park. Peaks Mount Coot-tha (and TV towers) - as seen from The Gap Mount Coot- tha, on which there is a lookout, botanical gardens, a planetarium and television towers, is the highest peak of the Taylor Range at 287 m. Another summit just to the north of Mount Coot-tha is Constitution Hill that rises to 258 m. Enoggera Hill, seen from The Gap Further east along the range is Enoggera Hill, located within the Enoggera Army Barracks. The range becomes a series of hills through the Brisbane locality of St Johns Wood and the suburbs of Red Hill, Spring Hill to Wickham Terrace in the Brisbane central business district. Protected areas Much of the range has been protected in recreation reserves. Early attempts to purchase the land in the 1860s were not permitted by the Surveyor-General, Augustus Charles Gregory, on the basis that the heights would be needed for trigonometrical purposes and for Brisbane residents to visit on account of the views and fresh air. The public park at the summit of Mount Coot-tha was one of Brisbane's first public parks. It was officially gazetted in 1880 and two years later was visited by Prince George, who later become King George V.

It is used throughout the United Kingdom to pass the details of stranded motorists between all the major UK motoring organisations and their 400 plus vehicle recovery agents. In many cases it is also used by the vehicle recovery agent to pass the details to the attending recovery vehicle. History The very first standards meeting in 1994 (Boys with their Toys) On 30 June 1994, a group of representatives from the UK seven major motoring organisations and the Institute of Vehicle Recovery were invited a meeting at Brooklands Museum. Brooklands Museum was chosen as the venue because the meeting's chairman Andy Lambert was involved with the museum, having transported the vast majority of the exhibits there, and could therefore show people items they would not normally get to see. He clearly hoped that this would be enough incentive to get ‚Äòthe clubs‚Äô to sit-down in the same room together. It soon emerged that it was a shared dream of all those present that ‚Äòcommon standards‚Äô for all aspects of vehicle recovery could be introduced to the industry. Amongst other things, this group laid the foundations of Turbo Dispatch project. Because of the reliability of delivery needed it was decided that Mobitex should be used. In the UK there was only one provider of Mobitex, namely RAM Data, which later became a subsidiary of BT called Transcomm. This is why many users still refer to RAMing jobs. Ian Lane of Motor Trade Software (MTS) designed and wrote the protocols along with the gateway software. Much pioneering work was carried out during early 1995. In the autumn of 1995 Green Flag and Delta Rescue were the first motoring organisations to start experimenting with transmissions to the garages, with the first genuine job being sent to Southbank Garage at the end of the year. The point where most recovery operators learned about Turbo Dispatch was during the Association of Vehicle Recovery Operators' AVRO EX 1996. Despite it being Green Flag's 25th Anniversary, the motoring organisation set up a mini ‚ÄòControl Room‚Äô at the show and let people see for the first time how the system worked. By the end of that year the Automobile Association had set up a trial in London, sending jobs to selected recovery operators. Towards the end of 1997, the AA's Evan Anderson became greatly involved in promoting the concept of Turbo Dispatch within the AA. This was undoubtedly the turning point, because Evan seemed to accept that although MTS and RAM did have a monopoly, it was not an intentional one. Anyone else could develop a system, but quite simply nobody else had successfully done so. In the following year, the RAC went live and by the end of the year all the major players in the industry had adopted Turbo Dispatch. By the year 2005 it is estimated that around 92% of the 4 million ‚Äògaraged‚Äô breakdowns a year were sent to recovery operators using Turbo Dispatch. The system is clearly popular with motoring organisations, because of the saving in job dispatcher talking on the telephone to recovery operators. What surprised a lot of people was how popular it was with the operators as well, mainly for the same reasons. A busy controller does not want to take job details over the telephone, when he can have it appear on his computer screen. Because he could then use the same system to dispatch the job to his driver, it meant the whole process could be handled in seconds. Technical review The following notes describe the method of automatically transferring job details from a motoring organisation (or club's) computer into their recovery operator's computer using the Mobitex data network. Since each of the motoring organisations is likely to have its own unique computer system and working practices, it is not practical to attempt to define how automatic job transfer would be best achieved for them. Consequently, only a typical recovery operator's computer installation is defined below. Typically, the recovery operator job logging and invoicing system is based around a personal computer. This will be connected to the Mobitex data network by a Masc. radio modem (sometimes called a Mobidem) using one of the PC's RS-232 communication ports. Job transmission will entail the motoring organisation's computer using the recovery operator's unique Mobidem number to call his computer. Once a connection has been made the job details are transmitted in the data format defined in the Turbo Dispatch Format Manual, and the call terminated. A dedicated communications computer will usually be employed to constantly monitor the radio modem via the RS232 port. This will operate a program TD.EXE, running under Windows. Data received from the radio modem will be transferred to an incoming message queue on the other computer, for subsequent automatic processing by the main job taking software (a maximum of 5 seconds delay). An audible sound will also be generated by the communications computer. Immediately the job details are received by the recovery operator's communications computer, it will transmit an automatic acknowledgement to the origin of the job message and place the job details in a queue awaiting manual acceptance by the recovery operator's controller. Job Dispatch will be completed by the recovery operator's controller, either by accepting, or rejecting the job and the corresponding transaction being dispatched to the motoring organisation. The Turbo Dispatch application was initially restricted to employing the MASC protocol of the Transcomm Mobile Data Network. This protocol was adopted because it eliminates the complexity of retries which would result from employing a session based protocol on the radio modems e.g. Hayes or X.28. Control Delegates at a standards meeting 2006 at BT Transcomm's Heathrow headquarters The Turbo Dispatch Standards Group used to meet on average two or three times a year. Its brief was to \\"Maintain a common standard for message and data formats to be used in electronic data communications between host computers and/or data terminals in fixed/mobile environments\\". All major motoring organisations send representatives and all changes/additions to the standard are discussed and must be agreed by all those present at the meeting. As there is little commercial advantage to any organisation (an improvement for one will normally also benefit the others), there is usually a large amount of agreement. In 2010 BT Transcomm announced the closure of the Mobitex Network in the UK. Following a competitive tender process including Presentations with solutions from MTT, BT, Vodafone and Apex Networks, it was unanimously awarded to Apex Networks Ltd and the migration from MTT Turbo Dispatch to an Internet-based solution named Automotive Network Services (ANS) took place in 2012. Apex Networks already had a growing number of users for their new Recovery Management System (RMS) which had initially been developed for Ontime Rescue & Recovery. From 2012 the ANS Standards group now meet quarterly and the forum is attended by the vehicle recovery software providers, namely Apex Networks, MTT and Laserbyte, along with the major motoring organisations and two industry advisers (independent recovery operators that are end-users of the systems). These Meetings normally last for around 3 hours and are held at the Rhodes Arts Complex in Bishop's Stortford, or at various venues around the country provided by the Motoring Organisations (Clubs). The forum was chaired for many years by David Brinklow (Commercial Director of Apex Networks), but more recent has chaired by J.P. Dekker (of Apex Networks) A copy of the standard document is available to download from https://www.apex- networks.com/Support.aspx See also * Vehicle recovery References * Professional Recovery, December 2001, Partnership Publications * Vehicle Recovery Link, June 1997, May 1999 and July 1999, R K Solutions. * The World History of the Towing and Recovery Industry, John Hawkins, TT Publications Inc. 280 pp. * , Piers Brendon, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 1997. 432 pp. * Breakdown Doctor: The Real Life Adventures of a 1960s Road Rescue Man, Fred Henderson, Reading Room Publishing, 2005. 192 pp. External links *Official Website Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1994 Category:Packet radio Category:Road transport in the United Kingdom Category:Standards of the United Kingdom Category:Emergency road services ","title":"Turbo Dispatch"},{"id":"2746867","text":"A spinnaker pole being used to set a conventional symmetric spinnaker A spinnaker pole is a spar used in sailboats (both dinghys and yachts) to help support and control a variety of headsails, particularly the spinnaker. However, it is also used with other sails, such as genoas and jibs, when sailing downwind with no spinnaker hoisted. (Since the load on a spinnaker pole is very light on this point of sailing, sometimes a special light spinnaker pole called a whisker pole is used in these circumstances.) The spinnaker pole is rigged to run from the base of the mast, where there is a special fitting for attaching one end of the pole, out to windward over the side of the boat. There, one of the control lines of whichever sail it is to be used with is run through a fitting on the other end of the spinnaker pole. This allows for more precise control of the corner of the sail to which the line is attached. For a spinnaker, the line attached to the pole is the guy, or brace, and the corner is the tack. For other headsails, such as a jib, the line would be the sheet, attached to the clew. A special line, the topping lift, runs from the middle of the spinnaker pole up to a block on the mast, and is used to support the weight of the spinnaker pole. Another line referred to as the downhaul or foreguy runs down so that the height of the pole is under positive control at all times.

In this case, \\"the bottom of the stairs\\" refers to the architecture of the kind of or mansion to which Diderot had been invited.

An articulated robot is a robot with rotary joints (e.g. a legged robot or an industrial robot). Articulated robots can range from simple two-jointed structures to systems with 10 or more interacting joints and materials. They are powered by a variety of means, including electric motors. Some types of robots, such as robotic arms, can be articulated or non-articulated.

An articulated robot uses all the three revolute joints to access its work space. Usually the joints are arranged in a ‚Äúchain‚Äù, so that one joint supports another further in the chain. Continuous Path: A control scheme whereby the inputs or commands specify every point along a desired path of motion. The path is controlled by the coordinated motion of the manipulator joints. Degrees Of Freedom (DOF): The number of independent motions in which the end effector can move, defined by the number of axes of motion of the manipulator. Gripper: A device for grasping or holding, attached to the free end of the last manipulator link; also called the robot‚Äôs hand or end-effector. Payload: The maximum payload is the amount of weight carried by the robot manipulator at reduced speed while maintaining rated precision. Nominal payload is measured at maximum speed while maintaining rated precision. These ratings are highly dependent on the size and shape of the payload. Pick And Place Cycle: See Figure. Pick and place Cycle is the time, in seconds, to execute the following motion sequence: Move down one inch, grasp a rated payload; move up one inch; move across twelve inches; move down one inch; ungrasp; move up one inch; and return to start location. Reach: The maximum horizontal distance from the center of the robot base to the end of its wrist. Accuracy: See Figure. The difference between the point that a robot is trying to achieve and the actual resultant position. Absolute accuracy is the difference between a point instructed by the robot control system and the point actually achieved by the manipulator arm, while repeatability is the cycle-to-cycle variation of the manipulator arm when aimed at the same point. Repeatability: See Figure. The ability of a system or mechanism to repeat the same motion or achieve the same points when presented with the same control signals. The cycle-to-cycle error of a system when trying to perform a specific task Resolution: See Figure. The smallest increment of motion or distance that can be detected or controlled by the control system of a mechanism. The resolution of any joint is a function of encoder pulses per revolution and drive ratio, and dependent on the distance between the tool center point and the joint axis. Robot Program: A robot communication program for IBM and compatible personal computers. Provides terminal emulation and utility functions. This program can record all of the user memory, and some of the system memory to disk files. Maximum Speed: The compounded maximum speed of the tip of a robot moving at full extension with all joints moving simultaneously in complementary directions. This speed is the theoretical maximum and should under no circumstances be used to estimate cycle time for a particular application. A better measure of real world speed is the standard twelve inch pick and place cycle time. For critical applications, the best indicator of achievable cycle time is a physical simulation. Servo Controlled: Controlled by a driving signal which is determined by the error between the mechanism's present position and the desired output position. Via Point: A point through which the robot's tool should pass without stopping; via points are programmed in order to move beyond obstacles or to bring the arm into a lower inertia posture for part of the motion. Work Envelope: A three-dimensional shape that defines the boundaries that the robot manipulator can reach; also known as reach envelope.

It partly lies in the Shropshire parish of Oswestry Rural; the other part is in Montgomeryshire, Powys.  History  Rhydycroesau is an old Welsh village in the Welsh Marches. Archaeological research has found evidence of Roman settlements and early Anglo-Saxon settlement within 10 km of the modern village. =19th century= The former Rectory was built in 1840 from the local stone for ¬£1260, which sum included constructing the church and village school, now the village hall, into the bargain. The church is in Wales, the Rectory is in England, the only such instance in modern times. The first Rector was the Reverend Robert Williams, appointed in 1837. A native of Conwy, where his father was the Vicar, he was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (MA). He was a renowned scholar of his time, who wrote the Biography of Eminent Welshmen and the Cornish Dictionary. In 1835, whilst curate of Llangernyw, he published The History and Antiquities of the town of Aberconwy. In 1879, Reverend Williams left to become the Rector of Culmington, near Ludlow, where he died in 1881. He was described as \\"ponderous and pedantic, big and burly, waddling as he walked with three or four pupils at his heels\\". The 1861 census gives details of his household. He had two sisters, a dairymaid, a housemaid and two farm servants living in. One of his favourite sayings was that \\"a goose is a very awkward bird, being a little too much for one, but not enough for two\\". He was a dull preacher, using the same sermons over and over, reading them in a monotone. He was not much liked by his parishioners, and maintained a congregation of as many as a dozen worshippers. Two more vicars followed; the Reverend Richard Richardson-Jones from 1879 until 1908, and the Reverend William Arthur Morris until 1949. Both were rather more popular figures, and congregations regularly reached 100 or more. =20th century= In 1920 the Church in Wales was disestablished and a referendum was held in the village to decide if the Church should go to Church of England or Church in Wales. The vote was in favour of the Church of England, and so it is to this day, one of the few Church of England churches actually situated in Wales. The church continues to hold regular services. In 1951 the Rectory was sold by the church into private hands, and bought by a dentist and his family. First hand accounts indicate that the house was always cold and almost totally without carpets. Water was pumped from a well and up to five fires had to be laid and lit each morning to provide any warmth at all. The place was, at times, in a state of near collapse. It was not until 1981 that the then owners opened the Rectory's doors to the public, first as a restaurant and subsequently as a hotel. The village school is now the village hall, and has been substantially extended recently due to the high level of local activities held there.  Pantomime  Rhydycroesau Village Hall, portions built 1850 Rhydycroesau is well known locally for its pantomimes, which are hosted every year in January and February at the Village Hall with the cast made up of people from the local area. The group in 2016 has performed for over 36 years, making a new show each year. In literature Rhydycroesau is the setting for some of the key action in the medieval mystery novel Monk's Hood by Ellis Peters, the third in her series featuring Brother Cadfael, set in 1138.

Candidates for whom this might be include Jean Barrin (1640 in Rennes ‚Äì 7/9/1718 in Nantes) and Fran√ßois de Chavigny de La Bretonni√®re.Kearney (1982) pp. 47‚Äì48 Content The book is an example of the whore dialogue genre. In it, a series of dramatic conversations between two fictional nuns (Sister Agn√®s, aged 16, and Sister Ang√©lique, aged 19) are related. In these conversations, the elder more experienced woman instructs the younger about sex. The first edition of 1683 has three dialogues, increased to five in 1702 and six in 1719. In the last of these two new characters‚ÄîVirginie and Seraphique‚Äîare introduced as the interlocutors of the sixth dialogue. Synopsis Venus in the Cloister is made up of five dialogues, all of them carried out between Sister Agnes and Sister Angelica. The entire story can be considered as a ‚Äúwhore dialogue‚Äù in which the elder nun trains the younger one in matters of sex. Sister Angelica is the older and more experienced nun who had come to the convent at the age of thirteen. She has been a part of the House for almost seven years now while Sister Agnes is younger and new to the place.Toulalan (2007) The dialogue begins when Sister Agnes is caught in the act of masturbating by the older and wiser nun Sister Angelica. She is embarrassed and taken aback while Sister Angelica appears to be quite unaffected by what she has just witnessed. What follows is an attempt by Sister Angelica to seduce the younger nun. Sister Agnes is discomfited to have been caught by the older nun and so she meekly protests against Sister Angelica's sexual attempts. However Angelica knows that her seduction will remain incomplete if the younger nun's philosophical thought process remains unchanged. So she promises Agnes teachings of a new kind of religion in which there is little room for self-denial and more scope for ‚Äúinformed Judgment‚Äù. Angelica then proceeds to mentions Reverend Father Jesuit who helped open her mind to such new types of religious speculations and debate. The father talks of Religion in terms of two distinct bodies--\\"one of which is purely celestial and supernatural, the other terrestrial and corruptible, which is only the invention of Men\\". The second body is termed as Policy which tends to destroy inner peace. Angelica decides to explore the different designs of the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù in putting up such elaborate rules to be followed. The following speech on Policy given by Sister Angelica becomes essential in establishing the sex scenes that follow. What follows is a process of exploration of the sexual desires of both the nuns. While Angelica imparts her knowledge, Sister Agnes carefully acts the part of the younger nun who tries to escape seduction but fails in the attempt. Agnes submits to being in a sense of \\"Confusion\\" and she is embarrassed to let the older nun see her body. This also relates to the fact that Agnes has not completely accepted the religious and philosophical deliberations of the older nun. Gradually as she starts accepting the truth of her own body and sexuality she will finally be free from her old biases. ThemesWhore dialogue= Venus in the Cloister is considered to be a whore dialogue. This form of writing began with Pietro Aretino's Ragionamenti (1534‚Äì36) followed by such works as La Retorica delle Puttane (The Whore's Rhetoric) (1642) by Ferrante Pallavicino; L'√âcole des Filles (The School for Girls) (1655), attributed to Michel Millot and Jean L'Ange and also known as The School of Venus; The Dialogues of Luisa Sigea (c. 1660) by Nicolas Chorier (known also as A Dialogue between a Married Woman and a Maid in various editions; and as \\"Satyra sotadica\\"). Such works typically concerned the sexual education of a naive younger woman by an experienced older woman and often included elements of philosophising, satire and anti-clericalism.Kronhausen (1969) pp. 7-8Kearney (1982) pp. 34-46 In such stories, dramatic dialogues are exchanged between an older experienced woman and a younger woman. In Venus in the Cloister, acts of masturbation, flagellation, same sex sexuality, voyeurism and copulation are explored in detail. Initially the work contained three dialogues but in later editions more were added. Sadomasochism is explored and there is a deliberate attempt to describe sexual acts in graphic detail.Cleland, John (1985) Fanny Hill, or, Memoirs of a woman of pleasure (Penguin Popular Classics). London: Penguin Books The theme of female intimacy is explored in great detail in the work as Sister Agnes and Sister Angelica engage in acts of sexuality. The convent was considered to provide a repressive environment where such sexual relations between nuns were considered to be quite common. This oppressive setting of the church and subsequent lesbian relations that developed as a result was a popular theme in literature during the reforms of Protestantism and Counter-Reformation. Denis Diderot's La Religieuse is a later example of this theme.Wahl (1999) pp.1-2 =Religious repression= The author of Venus in the Cloister satirizes the constraints of convent life which expected nuns to live in a \\"cloister\\" of sexual repression and suffering and the use by the state of religious ideology as a means of control. Sex becomes the only means of protest against such rigorous controls of the state. A careful parallel is drawn between the act of sexual pleasure and protesting against repressive state control. \\"At the moment of orgasm, individuality triumphs over the collective, nature acts out against culture and freedom strikes a blow against tyranny. Gradually through the dialogues, Agnes begins to see Sister Angelica's viewpoint and embraces her doctrines, she is freed from the sense of prejudice that she starts out with at the beginning of the book. The author attempts to attack the Church and its policies by creating an erotic setting with a convent. Secret meetings, acts of voyeurism, presence of veils and observers all combine to make the narrative extremely erotic and critical of repressive practices at the same time. Publication historyFrench editions= A similar work in a similar setting with four more characters called: Les D√©lices du clo√Ætre, ou la Religieuse √©clair√©e has often been included with editions of V√©nus dans le clo√Ætre‚Äîto the considerable confusion of bibliographers and editors.Kearney (1982) pp. 48-49 Pierre Gandon illustrated an edition in 1962: V√©nus dans le clo√Ætre, ou La religieuse en chemise de l'Abb√© Du Prat (Le coffret du bibliophile.) Paris: Livre du Bibliophile, 1962. =English editions= An anonymous translation was published in London in 1683, the year of the original French edition, by the bookseller Henry Rhodes, Fleet Street.Venus in the cloister, Or The nun in her smock: In curious dialogues, addressed to the Lady Abbess of Loves Paradice; \\"by the Abbot Du Prat. Done out of French\\". London: for H. Rodes, 1683 Another translation by Robert Samber was published in London in October 1724, not without its fair share of controversy. Its publication is attributed to Edmund Curll (1675‚Äì1747), a popular and quite interesting figure of 18th century London. He was notoriously reputed for championing the cause of experimental books that focused on themes of sexuality. Even though Edmund Curll ensured that his name was not mentioned in the title page of Robert Samber‚Äôs translation, it did not prevent him from running into trouble.Rex v. Curll: Pornography and Punishment in Court and on the Page, Alexander Pettit, p. 63 Curll began to face problems right after the publication of this book and was arrested twice in 1725 and then again in 1727. He became the first person in England to be convicted on charge of obscenity under the common law. William James Thoms, Edmund Curll‚Äôs biographer, recorded the proceedings of the trial. There appears to be a confusion in understanding the chronology of the trial because Thoms claims that Venus in the Cloister was only one of the three publications for which he was sent to trial, and perhaps not the most important one either.Bradford Keyes Mudge (2000) Edmund Curll‚Äôs arrest was not just an action directed against Curll the individual but also the types of books he usually published. A report in The Whitehall Evening Post, claims that Lord Townshend was responsible for having Edmund Curll arrested in 1725 because he published \\"obscene Books and Pamphlets, tending to encourage Vice and Immorality\\". Edmund Curll had relevant arguments against Townshend's attack. Venus in the Cloister was a translation which had not attracted any legal action when it first appeared on print. Moreover, Edmund Curll argued that, Jean Barrin's work was meant to be read as a satire attacking the injustices of the Church. Even A Treatise of the Use of Flogging in Venerial Affairs had been published before its translation without any legal intervention. The argument was quite valid and in favor of Edmund Curll but his luck was short lived. While Townshend fretted over how to convict Curll, John Ker appeared on the scene. Edmund Curll had met John Ker in jail‚Äîhe was an old man with quite an adventurous history and conveniently enough for Curll, he had just finished writing his memoirs which was also quite libelous. When Curll published Memoirs of John Ker, Townshend found enough reason to send him behind bars once again, and this time with plenty of legal reason. In 1727 the King's Bench declared that selling any kind of sexually explicit literature was an act of misdemeanor. In 1728, three years after his first arrest Curll's sentence was pronounced. He had to pay, by way of fine, 25 marks each for Venus in the CloisterToulalan (2007) p.99 and A Treatise of the Use of Flogging and 20 marks for the memoirs. More significantly he was asked to stand for an hour on the pillory at Charing Cross. ‚ÄúAt the end of the hour, during which nothing more actually occurred, Curll was hoisted up on the shoulders of a couple of his strongest supporters and taken off to a nearby pub for a few pints.‚Äù This appears to be the first conviction for obscenity in the United Kingdom, and set a legal precedent for other convictions until the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

The word equilibrium implies a state of balance. Equilibrium thermodynamics, in origins, derives from analysis of the Carnot cycle. Here, typically a system, as cylinder of gas, initially in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is set out of balance via heat input from a combustion reaction. Then, through a series of steps, as the system settles into its final equilibrium state, work is extracted. In an equilibrium state the potentials, or driving forces, within the system, are in exact balance. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial state of thermodynamic equilibrium, subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate, when the constraints are changed by an externally imposed intervention, what the state of the system will be once it has reached a new equilibrium. An equilibrium state is mathematically ascertained by seeking the extrema of a thermodynamic potential function, whose nature depends on the constraints imposed on the system. For example, a chemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure will reach equilibrium at a minimum of its components' Gibbs free energy and a maximum of their entropy. Equilibrium thermodynamics differs from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, in that, with the latter, the state of the system under investigation will typically not be uniform but will vary locally in those as energy, entropy, and temperature distributions as gradients are imposed by dissipative thermodynamic fluxes. In equilibrium thermodynamics, by contrast, the state of the system will be considered uniform throughout, defined macroscopically by such quantities as temperature, pressure, or volume. Systems are studied in terms of change from one equilibrium state to another; such a change is called a thermodynamic process. Ruppeiner geometry is a type of information geometry used to study thermodynamics. It claims that thermodynamic systems can be represented by Riemannian geometry, and that statistical properties can be derived from the model. This geometrical model is based on the idea that there exist equilibrium states which can be represented by points on two-dimensional surface and the distance between these equilibrium states is related to the fluctuation between them.

After starting his career as a coal miner, he joined Huddersfield Borough Police in 1962. Claimed to be Britain's then youngest police sergeant at age 23, after passing a fast track examination he was appointed Assistant Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police in 1983. Early life Keith Hellawell was born 18 May 1942 in Kirkburton, near Huddersfield, Yorkshire, UK. He went to school at Kirkburton Secondary Modern School until the age of 15, when he left without a single exam pass, then went to Dewsbury Technical College and Barnsley College of Mining. He started work as a coal miner in 1958 but left to pursue a career in the Huddersfield Borough Police in 1962, gaining entry at the second attempt. Police career He became Britain's youngest police sergeant at the age of 23, and its youngest Inspector at 26. Rising through the ranks, including working in CID, he was appointed Assistant Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police in 1983, then Deputy Chief Constable of Humberside Police in 1985. He received the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 1990. He also completed an MSc in Social Policy from Cranfield University and an external degree in Law from the University of London. He later became Chief Constable of Cleveland police and in 1993 became Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police. He has strong views on terrorists, child murderers and police murderers, believing all should face the death penalty. He spent 36 years in the police. He was the New Labour government's drugs advisor and so- called \\"drugs czar\\" from January 1998. He resigned from his position in July 2002 over the government's reclassification of cannabis from a Class B to a Class C substance. Differences in opinion with the government over strategy towards tackling drugs were common during his tenure, during which he was paid ¬£106,057 a year. Use of all drugs increased as did drugs deaths in his four years in office. In November 2002 HarperCollins published his autobiography called The Outsider: The Autobiography of One of Britain's Most Controversial Policemen. It was serialised in the Mail on Sunday. Two former detectives, Roy Smith and Laurence Andrews, took objection to the book which claimed they had conspired to pervert the course of justice when investigating a murder in 1968 in Aspley. They sued for libel at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and won their case in 2004. Business career Since 2006 Hellawell has been chairman of Goldshield Group plc. Hellawell served as chairman of Sports Direct from 2009 to 2018. He was required to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on 25 March 2015 in relation to alleged poor employment practices at the company ‚Äì particularly around its widespread use of 'zero-hours contracts' and the dismissal by its wholly owned subsidiary, USC, of 200 warehouse staff in Scotland with only 15 minutes' notice. 50 of those staff members were subsequently awarded compensation by an Employment Tribunal. Sports Direct's founder and Executive Deputy chairman ‚Äì Mike Ashley ‚Äì was criticised by the tribunal for 'disgraceful and unlawful employment practices'. In September 2015, Hellawell faced pressure to remove him as Chairman of the company by minority shareholders. Following a profit fall during 2016 of 57%, Hellawell stated that an \\"extreme political, union and media campaign [had been] waged against this company\\". The company's share price had about halved during 2016. Hellawell resigned from his position as Sports Direct chairman in September 2018, on the day of the company's AGM. Personal life Hellawell is married and has three children and eleven grandchildren. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bradford in 1998, and an honorary degree by Leeds Metropolitan University in 1997.

It has been translated into sixteen languages and sold over a million copies in the U.S. Bibliography Her first book was Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia (see above). This book was updated in May 2014, 15 years after the original date of publication, with a Post Script by Marya Hornbacher, \\"Hornbacher, an authority in the field of eating disorders, argues that recovery is not only possible, it is necessary. But the journey is not easy or guaranteed. With a new ending to her story that adds a contemporary edge, Wasted continues to be timely and relevant.\\" Her second book is the critically praised 2005 novel, The Center of Winter, which follows a family in the aftermath of a suicide. Her third book, published in April 2008, a memoir titled Madness: A Bipolar Life, chronicles the years following Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Her fourth book, published in 2010, is the recovery handbook Sane: Mental Illness, Addiction, and the Twelve Steps written as a guide to working the Twelve Steps for people who suffer from both addiction and mental illness. Her fifth book, published in 2011, Waiting: A Nonbeliever's Higher Power, explores spirituality and what that can mean to someone recovering‚Äîfrom addiction, mental illness, or both‚Äîwho does not believe in God. Her second book, The Center of Winter, published in 2005, received excellent reviews, and her second memoir, Madness: A Bipolar Life, was published in 2008. It was met with immediate praise and hit the New York Times Bestseller list. Sane: Mental Illness, Addiction, and the 12 Steps, was published in 2010, and Waiting: A Nonbeliever's Higher Power was published in 2011. Both were finalists for the Books for Better Life Award. Also, within the past several years she has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize in both non-fiction and poetry. Hornbacher plans to have her sixth book out in early 2019. In an interview in August 2015 conducted by Adam Walhberg of Minnpost, Hornbacher reveals more about the inspiration behind her book and the book itself. She speaks about \\"the new edition of DSM 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) [which] was released and it created...an...uproar in psychiatry and brain science.\\" In this book, she is writing profiles of 12 people who suffer with mental illness to explore these philosophical issues on a more human level.  Biography  Marya Hornbacher was born in Walnut Creek, California and raised in Edina, Minnesota. She is the only child of Jay and Judy Hornbacher, professional theatre actors and directors. When Hornbacher was fourteen years old, she was accepted into the prestigious arts boarding school Interlochen. She later enrolled in the University of Minnesota and started writing for the university's student newspaper The Minnesota Daily. In the fall of 1992, she entered college at American University in Washington, D.C. She eventually obtained her degree in philosophy and poetics from the New College of California.  Personal life  Hornbacher married Julian Daniel Beard in 1996, but they divorced after the success of Wasted. The marriage, and eventual divorce, is also discussed in Madness where she attributes the nuptial failure in part to problems with drugs and alcohol, and largely to her ill-managed bipolar disorder. Hornbacher then married Jeff Miller. She has now been sober for more than seventeen years (since the summer of 2001, according to Madness). She was honored with a major award, the ASCAP Award for music journalism, for her profile of jazz great Oscar Peterson (published January 2005). She is also a two-time Fellow at Yale. She still publishes occasional journalistic pieces, as well as short fiction and poetry. As of 2014, Marya is working on several projects. She is currently working on a nonfiction book about sex and sexuality in literature. She is also completing a manuscript of poetry and a manuscript of essays and has a novel in the works. Along with her journalism and articles, she teaches in the graduate writing program at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL.

It is northwest of the city centre, beyond the location of the old Northern Gate (N√∏rreport), which, until dismantled in 1856, was near the current N√∏rreport station. Geography N√∏rrebro has an area of and a population of 71,891. It is bordered by Indre By to the southeast, √òsterbro to the northeast, Bispebjerg to the northwest and Frederiksberg Municipality to the southwest. History Before 1852, N√∏rrebro was in the countryside. When the city decided to abandon the demarcation line in 1852, which had previously kept the city within very limited geographical limits, a building boom took place in N√∏rrebro. N√∏rrebro became the home of thousands of new workers, who came to seek their fortune in the city. Culture N√∏rrebro is known for its poly-cultural society. The multiethnic main street N√∏rrebrogade runs through the area, with a multitude of shops and restaurants. One of the main points of interest in the area is historic Assistens Cemetery (Assistens Kirkeg√•rd), the final resting place of famous Danes such as S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr and H.C. Andersen. N√∏rrebro is inhabited by people from all parts of the world. In 2017, almost one out of six inhabitants had a non-Danish passport, hereof mainly a passport from a European (9.4%) or Asian (3.1%) country. The largest foreigner communities are Swedes (1.0%), Germans (0.9%), Norwegian (0.9%), Brits (0.8%) and Turks (0.7%). Riots Rioters fighting police in N√∏rrebro N√∏rrebrogade is known as the site of many riots over the years. During the 1980s, it often provided the setting for violent clashes between Danish police and militant squatters known as BZ. The battles were of a very vicious nature, often involving Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs being used by the squatters, as well as batons, tear gas and firearms used by the police. On 18 May 1993, the district was the scene of the N√∏rrebro riot following the Danish \\"yes\\"-vote to the European Union. The police were unprepared for the rioters, who threw paving stones from a nearby construction site. Subsequently, 113 shots were fired: several demonstrators were wounded, some severely. Though none of the protesters died at the time, the fight left 13 demonstrators and 92 policemen injured. The riot was the worst since World War II, but although an official investigation was initiated there is still much doubt as to why the policemen were unprepared or what exactly happened. Following the riot the Danish police upgraded their hand-carried weapons and riot gear to modern standards and began a process towards better strategic and tactical handling of crowds and riots. In late December 2006, a riot took place, regarding the fate of the squatted social centre Ungdomshuset (\\"The Youth House\\"), a rendez- vous point for the far-left. A demonstration in support of the house was blocked by the police and a fullface streetfight broke out. The demonstrators hurled stones and fireworks at the police, who in response used their armoured cars to disband the demonstrators and fired tear gas in to the crowd. The fight grew into a full-scale riot, with fires burning over night in the streets. Four police and two demonstrators were injured. On March 1, 2007, the biggest riots in recent Danish history broke out when the police moved in and evicted squatters in Ungdomshuset, which was followed by the demolition of the building. It is estimated that the eviction of Ungdomshuset and the damage done during the following riots has cost the city and the state around 100 million danish kroner (around 17 million USD). On September 1, 2007, additional rioting resulted from a protest marking six months after the demolition of Ungdomshuset.

Height 7.8 cm. Red brown terracotta. National Museum of China Niuheliang () is a Neolithic archaeological site in Liaoning Province, Northeast China, along the middle and upper reaches of the Laoha River and the Yingjin River (presently on the border of Chaoyang and Jianping County). Discovered in 1983, Niuheliang site belongs to the Hongshan culture (4700 - 2900 BC). It includes evidence of religion, such as a temple, an altar and a cairn. Description Niuheliang is a large burial site scattered over hill tops over a 50 square kilometer area. The altitude of Niuheliang ranges between 550 meters and 680 meters above sea level.Sites of Hongshan Culture: The Niuheliang Archaeological Site, the Hongshanhou Archaeological Site, and Weijiawopu Archaeological Site unesco.org Niuheliang dates to 3,500-3,000 BCE. It was a burial and sacrificial center in the late Hongshan period. No residential settlements have been discovered here so far. Temple The site features a unique temple on a loam platform, with an altar and cairn complex, covering an area of around 5 km¬≤. The altar at Niuheliang was made of stone platforms, supported by painted, clay cylinders. A north-south axis connects this temple complex with a central peak of the Zhushan mountains, otherwise known as \\"Pig Mountain\\". The subterranean ritual complex was built on a ridge and decorated with painted walls, referred to by Chinese archaeologists as the Goddess Temple, due to the discovery of a clay female head with jade inlaid eyes. Pig dragons and large, nude, clay figurines were also found at Niuheliang. Some of the figurines are up to three times the size of real-life humans; the interior of the figurines was structured from wood and straw. Six groups of cairns were discovered nearby, south and west of the temple site. The primary burial goods accompanying the graves were jade artifacts, although most of the excavated graves had already been looted. =Interpretation= According to the excavator of this site, Guo Dashun, there are in fact two varieties of animals represented in the jades. One is a boar with narrow eyes and flat snout; the other is a bear, represented by round eyes and short perky ears. He also found similar boar and bear symbolism in the vessels found at Xiaoheyan site. The bear has been widely worshipped in Northeast Asia, such as by the Ainu in northern Japan, and in Siberia. Thus, Guo Dashun sees this site in the wider Northeast Asian context. Some similarities with Xinglongwa culture (6200-5400 BC) of northeastern China have also been pointed out. Pyramidal structure One year after the temple-cairns complex was discovered nearby a pyramidal structure \\"disguised\\" as a hill known as Zhuanshanzi (), which was included during the Han dynasty (-206~220) in a section of the Great Wall. Built with earth and imported stone, its structure is more elaborate than the cairns. This site contains some of the essential elements, temples, cairns and platforms, present in later ancestor worship of the Chinese such as the Ming tombs 5000 years later.

It was originally headquartered in the former Western Maryland Railway station in Union Bridge, Maryland: it has since moved to a new facility across from the old station. The railroad has been 87.4% owned by Genesee & Wyoming since 2008, with Lehigh Cement (the largest shipper on the line) retaining a 12.6% interest. The railway currently operates from Highfield, Maryland (west) to Glyndon, Maryland (east), via a two-mile loop through Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and also from Woodsboro, Maryland (south) to Taneytown, Maryland (north). The line terminates north of propane dealer Ferrellgas near Angell Road. History Operations began in 1980 over a section of ex-Pennsylvania Railroad's Frederick Secondary line from Taneytown to Walkersville, Maryland. Starting in 1983 the ex-Western Maryland Railway line from Emory Grove to Highfield was purchased from CSXT in sections. In late 1993, the company proposed a plan to rejuvenate the section of the Frederick Secondary from Taneytown to York, Pennsylvania that had been abandoned for the past ten years. The plan would have enabled to the company to expand its markets to Pennsylvania and would have provided a connection to Conrail's rail network. The plan proved to be too costly when landowners along the proposed route of rail reconstruction demanded excessive prices and construction never began. The railroad's business grew from trains pulling 200 freight cars per year in the 1980s to 18,000 freight cars in 2006. By 2006, it owned a fleet of ten locomotives; three GP9 low hoods, and seven GP38-3, all of EMD build. Its rolling stock also included 410 freight cars owned and/or leased. In 2008, the railroad was purchased by Genesee & Wyoming, a US-based corporation that owns multiple railroad shortlines in the United States and Australia. =Passenger excursion line= Gus Novotny Associates, Inc. began a passenger excursion services, known as the EnterTRAINment Line, on the Maryland Midland Railway system in 1989. The EnterTRAINMENT Line (EL), was not part of the Maryland Midland Railway. It paid a \\"haulage fee\\" to the railway each time the EL operated a train. On board staff, such as kitchen crew, servers, bartenders, train manager, and faux conductor were EL employees. The Maryland Midland Railway provided engines and train crew for the EL excursions. The four owners of the EnterTRAINment line, Kirk Lorenz, Steve Hamilton, Don Golec, and Jerry Pilcher, purchased the EL from Gus Novotny & Associates in about 1992. (Verified by Jerry Pilcher) Prior to the purchase, the EnterTRAINment Line ran a schedule of all-you-can-eat dinner trains, diner trains with murder-mystery themes, and carnival trains for children. The new owners added specialty theme trains, such as Civil War trains, political whistle stop trains, Santa Claus tree cutting trains, wedding trains, and NYE trains. The capacity of the EnterTRAINment Line also increased with new owners, as did the frequency and dates of departures. Group tour business was solicited, and marketing efforts expanded to include AAA, tour operators, and other nationally known travel partners. Dinner and Murder Mystery trains were operated between Westminster, MD and Union Bridge, MD, and between Union Bridge, MD and Thurmont, MD. Specialty trains operated between Union Bridge, MD, and the road's interchange with CSX at Blue Ridge Summit, in Pennsylvania. A dinner train or Murder Mystery train were typically made up of: # Power car to provide electricity to the train, and storage space # # Dining cars, which consisted of old coach cars, with the coach seats removed and tables installed # # Dance car (no seats or tables), with oversized windows that opened all the way to the roof, and a live DJ # Dome car, a traditional center-dome car, formerly Union Pacific dome-diner 8008, later Auto Train 807 (went to Copper Canyon excursion service in Mexico after the EL closed)http://www.themetrains.com/auto-train- roster.htm # # \\"Kitchen Car\\", two different types were operated, at first only a former \\"Lunch Counter Car\\" with a minute kitchen was used. It was later supplemented with a full dining car, complete with full kitchen. # # Private Car. A couple of private cars were available for a premium price. Guests were offered private dining, and had the exclusive use of the car, it's bedrooms, and open platform, as well as the rest of the EnterTRAINment Line train. # # \\"Hooper Car\\". The Edward G.Hooper, leased from a passenger car preservation group, was a former Baltimore & Ohio parlor car, and had the distinction of being named for a former president of the National Railway Historical Society. It also had its own bar, and bathroom facilities. In less than two years, business on the EnterTRAINment Line quadrupled,. However, a dark cloud surfaced in the form of alleged back taxes due the State of Maryland. Because the EL was offering Murder Mystery trains, the State claimed that the EL must collect and remit to the State, the 10% Admissions and Amusement tax. The former owners had never collected this tax, and had indicated to the new owners that the \\"tax manner\\" was behind them. It wasn't. The EnterTRAINment Line's argument was that the entity was indeed a passenger railroad operating concern, and therefore not subject to local or state taxes, not under the enforcement or jurisdiction of the state, instead, under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The EnterTRAINment Line published a timetable with fares, one way, or round trip tickets were available to the general public on any train operated by the EL, and it ran over a line that was part of the ICC-defined, \\"national system\\". The new owners didn't do due diligence, and the State came after them for back A&A; taxes of approximately $300,000. Mr. Pilcher left the company in about 1994, shocked that his partners had chosen to fight the State's allegations, without advice of counsel. The case was eventually decided in favor of the State, and the EnterTRAINment line soon stopped running. Much of the equipment was leased, and returned to its lessors. Other equipment was sold to other tourist railroads, and for a short while, some remnants of a dinner train operated out of the York, PA area. This service was discontinued when EnterTRAINment went out of business in May 1995. More recently, Maryland Midland has been a freight-only line, except for occasional trips by stockholders and the Western Maryland Railway Historical Society Museum, located in an adjoining building in Union Bridge.

Born in Marseille, he moved to Martinique in 1780, and then immigrated to North Carolina just before the end American Revolutionary War. He was appointed as Attorney General of the Territory of Orleans after the Louisiana Purchase; he also helped untangle layers of French and Spanish colonial law in the territory and subsequent state of Louisiana. His legal writing and reviews of cases was important to codification of Louisiana law in the 1820s. Likely his most well-known case in his decade as Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court was that of the freedom suit of Sally Miller, in Miller v. Belmonti (1845 La). The court ruled to free Miller, a slave of obvious European descent, in part based on her appearance; the presumption was that she was \\"white\\" (European American), and the defendants had not sufficiently proved that she was enslaved. The decision was unpopular in the South and contributed to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention's abolishing the state Supreme Court in March 1846, ending Martin's career at the age of 84. The following day, the convention reinstated the court but did not reappoint Martin or his five colleagues. Early life and career Martin was born in Marseille, France, and was of Proven√ßal descent. In 1780 as a young man he went to the French colony of Martinique in the Caribbean.Celebration of the Centenary of the Supreme Court of Louisiana (March 1, 1913), in John Wymond, Henry Plauch√© Dart, eds., The Louisiana Historical Quarterly (1922), p. 114. Before the close of the American Revolutionary War, Martin immigrated to North Carolina. In New Bern, he taught French and learned English by typesetting as a printer. He set up a printing business, and printed a number of books, and the North-Carolina Gazette newspaper in North Carolina. After reading the law at an established firm, he was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1789. He published various legal books, edited Acts of the North Carolina Assembly from 1715 to 1803 (2nd ed., 1809), and translated Pothier's Trait√© des obligations. Political career Fran√ßois Martin was elected as a member of the lower house of the North Carolina General Assembly, where he served in 1806 to 1807. In 1809 he was appointed Attorney General of the Territory of Orleans (future U.S. state of Louisiana), recently acquired by the U.S. under the Louisiana Purchase. The law there was in a chaotic condition, as French law had preceded Spain's taking over the territory in 1763 and imposing their code in some respects. For instance, although the Spanish governor O'Reilly had issued a proclamation in 1769 banning Indian slavery, the protests from French slaveholders convinced him to let them retain slaves of Indian descent while the Crown reviewed the policy. By the time of the U.S. territorial annexation, the status of slaves of mixed African and Native American descent was still unsettled. The American territorial administration began to try to create laws consistent with its own tradition, and in 1808 the Digest of the Civil Laws was adopted by Orleans Territorial legislature. It was an adaptation by James Brown and Louis Moreau-Lislet of the Code of Napoleon, which repealed the Spanish fueros, partidas, recompilationes, and laws of the Indies as they conflicted with its provisions. In 1811 and 1813, Martin published reports of cases decided by the superior court of the Territory of Orleans. Attorney- general and supreme court judge In February 1813, Martin was appointed Attorney General by the elected governor of the newly established state of Louisiana, serving until 1815. In 1816 he published two volumes, one in French and one in English, of A General Digest of the Acts of Legislatures of the Late Territory of Orleans and of the State of Louisiana. For the period until 1830, he regularly wrote and published reports of the decisions of the state supreme court. Respected for his learning, Martin was appointed presiding judge of the State Supreme Court, serving a decade (1836‚Äì1846) in this position. In 1845, Martin and his court issued the final ruling in the widely publicized case of Miller v. Belmonti (1845 La), which was a freedom suit initiated by supporters of Sally Miller. She was a light-skinned slave believed by some in the German immigrant community to be Salom√© M√ºller. Known as the \\"Lost German Slave Girl\\", as a grown woman Miller was found living as a slave. M√ºller had immigrated as a young child with her family, and her father had signed an indenture agreement covering the whole family to pay their passage. A few weeks after the family left New Orleans to work, the father and son were reported to have died, but no one knew what became of the two young girls, Dorothea, six, and Salom√© four.Carol Wilson, \\"Sally Muller, the White Slave\\", Louisiana History, Vol. 40, accessed 8 March 2011 Members of the German-American community believed that Sally Miller was M√ºller. They arranged for an attorney to file a freedom suit for her against Miller's owners, challenging her slave status on the grounds that she was a native-born European. Much contradictory evidence was introduced, and the documentation and claimed identities were confusing. A lower court ruled that Miller had been sold as a legal slave, but Martin and the justices of the supreme court ruled that she was free. Their decision in Miller v. Belmonti (1845 La) included the following statement: > That on the law of slavery in the case of a person visibly appearing to be a > white man, or an Indian, the presumption is he is free, and it is necessary > for his adversity to show that he is a slave.Bailey, John (2005) [2003]. The > Lost German Slave Girl: The Extraordinary True Story of Sally Miller and Her > Fight for Freedom in Old New Orleans. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. p. > 248. It was an unpopular decision in a time and place where many slaves were mixed race and appeared to be \\"white\\". The case highlighted the prevalence of interracial relationships between white men and enslaved women that resulted in mixed-race children. In addition, the abolitionist movement was then viewed as a threat to the culture and cotton economy of the South. Martin's eyesight had begun to fail when he was seventy; after 1836 he could no longer write opinions with his own hand and would dictate them. He refused to resign from the court. As a consequence, together with his court's unpopular decision above, in March 1846 the Louisiana State Constitutional Convention abolished the Supreme Court, ending Martin's career as a jurist. When the Convention reconstituted the court the following day, it did not reappoint Martin or his fellow five justices. That year he died in New Orleans in December 1846. His holographic will in favor of his brother in France (written in 1841 and devising property worth nearly $400,000) was unsuccessfully contested by the state of Louisiana. The state argued that the will was void as a legal and physical impossibility because of Martin's blindness, or as being an attempted fraud on the state. Under the will, the state could not levy the customary 10% estate tax since the property went to Martin's heirs in France.

The film is produced by the independent production company Tightrope Pictures and was originally screened on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 25 June 2005. It was also shown in the United States on cable television station Home Box Office on the same day. Bill Nighy portrays the character of Lawrence, with Kelly Macdonald portraying Gina. Nighy and Macdonald had previously starred together in the 2003 BBC serial State of Play, which was also directed by Yates and produced by Bevan-Jones. The Girl in the Caf√©'s casting director is Fiona Weir who, at the time, was also the casting director for the Harry Potter films, the last four of which Yates directed. The film was noted at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, where it received seven nominations and won Outstanding Made for Television Movie, Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special for Curtis, and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for Macdonald. Overview The film tells the story of Lawrence (Bill Nighy), a civil servant working for the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Ken Stott), who falls in love with Gina (Kelly Macdonald), a young woman whom he meets by chance in a London caf√©. Lawrence takes Gina to a G8 summit in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, where she confronts the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Corin Redgrave) over the issue of third world debt and poverty in Africa, much to Lawrence's embarrassment and the anger of his employers. However, he realises that she is right and tries to help persuade the Chancellor and others at the summit to do something about the issues concerned. Cast * Bill Nighy as Lawrence * Ken Stott as Chancellor of the Exchequer * Kelly Macdonald as Gina * Corin Redgrave as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Production The production was conceived to tie-in both with the BBC's Africa Lives season of programming, and with the global Make Poverty History campaign, for which writer Curtis was a prominent campaigner. As such, it was also shown in South Africa on the same day as its UK and US premieres. Curtis was better-known as a writer of romantic comedy films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually (the latter of which he also directed and had featured Nighy). Although The Girl in the Caf√© does contain some of his trademark comedy elements, it is generally more serious in tone and attempts to highlight the issues of poverty and fair trade. Reception On BBC One, the programme gained an audience of 5.5 million, a 29% share of the total television audience watching over its 90-minute duration, winning its timeslot.

Although the society served only University of Cambridge students for most of its history, in 2007, membership was also opened up to students of Anglia Ruskin. In 2018, with the setting up of a student society for Labour members at Anglia Ruskin, the society reverted back to existing for Cambridge University students only. CULC's varied past has seen it go through several disaffiliations with the national Labour Party, including periods in the 1960s and 1970s when it was under the influence of the entryist Militant tendency. It is currently affiliated to the Labour Party and the Cambridge Constituency Labour Party. CULC holds regular speaker events, social events, topical discussions and takes part in year-round campaigning activity, with the local Labour Party and on issues decided by the membership. Current campaigns include pursuing a living wage for employees of both universities, tackling pay-day loans, and encouraging ethical investment by Cambridge Colleges.http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/4284 In recent years, the club has hosted a number of high-profile figures including Andrew Adonis, Angela Eagle, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Ed Miliband, David Miliband, Margaret Hodge, Ed Balls, John Prescott, Tristram Hunt, Alan Johnson, Andy Burnham, Iain McNicol, David Lammy, Hilary Benn, Axelle Lemaire and Ken Livingstone. History English Poet, Rupert Brooke, was President of the society from 1909-10. CULC has gone through several name changes. The society it began as an offshoot of was founded as the Cambridge University Fabian Society in 1905, and then changed its name in June 1915 to Cambridge University Socialist Society (which retained a separate Fabian Society within it), dedicated to \\"complete political and industrial democracy... [and] supersession of the capitalist system\\". It then changed its name to Cambridge University Labour Club in the late 1910s, before reverting to being the C.U. Socialist Society at the end of the decade. =Cambridge University Socialist Society (1915‚Äì1920)= Between 1918 and 1920 CUSS was the only society in which socialists could meet. Through study circles, investigations, speakers, and joint action with the Cambridge Labour Party, CUSS sought 'the realisation of complete political and industrial democracy' and 'the supersession of the capitalist system by a co- operative commonwealth' using common ownership if land and industry. Its key concerns were the Labour Party programme, the land question, the Russian Revolution, German socialism, syndicalism, and American socialism. It continued to debate with the local party and invited such speakers as G. D. H. Cole, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, and J. C. Squire. Most importantly, CUSS was pacifist. Affiliated to the No-Conscription Fellowship, it vehemently opposed military training in schools. But such activity was dangerous. On 7 March 1919 a meeting was broken up and three members were forced to stand on a table and sing the national anthem before being dunked in the river by a group of veterans. Maurice Dobb, the socialist economist, would experience the same treatment, and in 1922 CULC would be forced to relocate its premises due to its landlord's fear of attacks. A proposed meeting with the local party in March 1919 had to be cancelled as a crowd of hostile demonstrators occupied the Friends' Meeting House and began to sing. The result was that the University's Liberals and Conservatives refused to co- operate with their socialist counterparts throughout the 1920s. =Cambridge University Labour Club (1920‚Äì1973)= Ramsay MacDonald addressed the society in May 1925.Anon (6 May 1925). \\"TO-DAY'S ARRANGEMENTS\\" Manchester Guardian (Manchester, UK) 1920s‚Äì1940s The national rise of the Labour Party seems to have provoked undergraduates to create their own Labour Club at the end of the 1910s. This was partly motivated by 'a considerable number of the present associates, who were not satisfied with the extremism' of CUSS and by a decline in the attendance and frequency of meetings, perhaps owing to the widespread intimidation of socialists. On 14 April 1920 CULC was duly formed. As a direct result members of CUSS resolved to become a study circle within the Labour Club. To maintain its distinctive identity Maurice Dobb proposed that CUSS 'should hold meetings with speakers too \\"red\\" for the Labour Club, but, by some strange jugglery, under Labour Club auspices ‚Äì particularly financial auspices'. It certainly retained a more radical position than most CULC members, remaining committed to 'common ownership', 'workers' control', and building a 'revolutionary working-class movement'. Of all the 'red' speakers it invited, the most prominent was Leonid Krasin of the USSR, the People‚Äôs Commissar of Foreign Trade, who could not attend in 1922 owing to the Geneva Conference. Nonetheless, they were addressed by Hugh Dalton on foreign policy, Harold Laski, Dobb, and Russell. But with no meetings held at all between November 1923 and January 1925, it seems that the reasons for the formation of CULC had resonated with University socialists. Indeed, on 8 May 1925 Dobb proposed that CUSS be organised as a society which supported the Labour Research Department, or perhaps trained teachers for the Plebs League or the Labour Colleges, or worked with local minority movements: as 'a body doing definite work', it might then retain some popularity and relevance. CULC attracted a wide array of prominent speakers. Beginning in 1920 with Fred Bramley, Assistant General Secretary of the TUC, it was soon visited by the MPs J. C. Wedgwood, Margaret Bondfield, Ramsay MacDonald, and Ellen Wilkinson; and the academics Raymond Postgate, Joseph Needham, Harold Laski, Bertrand Russell, R. H. Tawney, and many others. From MacDonald‚Äôs visit in 1925, half of all profits (equating to nearly ¬£15) were sent to the strikers in Shepreth. CULC was also close to the Cambridge Labour Party, gaining the attendance of Cllr William Briggs, Hugh Dalton, Cllr Clara Rackham, and Alec Firth. More broadly, the Club organised summer schools with the University Labour Federation (ULF), ran a library, held Sunday teas, and ran research committees. Perhaps CULC was a little too assiduous in its political education and canvassing: in January 1922 it was forced to move its premises as the landlord refused to renew the club‚Äôs lease 'on the grounds that the Club did not drink enough beer'. Despite its exposed left flank CULC grew rapidly and became the largest student political society by the late 1920s. By 1924 there were around 100 paying members and in 1925 David Hardman was elected as the first ever socialist President of the Cambridge Union Society; two CULC members, A L Hutchinson and the future educationalist Lionel Elvin, would succeed him. CULC would play an important role in campaigning in the town. They participated in the campaigns for the parliamentary elections in 1922, 1923, and 1924. The last of those elections saw CULC make a special effort in the county Labour Party. But it was the selection of Hardman which truly motivated members. They began canvassing for Hardman in 1927 and organising socials with college workers and trade union gatherings for him. They were also entrusted to organise the entire campaign in Castle, a ward which covered most of the areas of the present-day Newnham and Castle wards. However, CULC would soon run into its own political difficulties. The political divisions among members were made clear as the club changed its name to Cambridge University Labour Society in 1927 and Cambridge University Labour and Socialist Club in 1928. As the national party confronted the divide created by the leadership‚Äôs response to the financial crisis in 1929, CULC 'feeling unwilling to tie itself officially to an apology for a Labour Government whose record it did not greatly admire', changed its name to Cambridge University Socialist Society and disaffiliated from the national Labour Party in 1930. But it had a home in Cambridge; its economic position was shared by most members of the local party and, crucially, Alex Wood. CULC thus continued to campaign for local Labour candidates. But its new rules allowed Communists and other socialists to join and it soon fell under the control of the former. Clement Attlee addressed the society on numerous occasions throughout the 1930s and 40s.Anon (13 November 1948). \\"MR. ATTLEE RECALLS HIS EARLY DAYS: Inspiration of Limehouse\\" Manchester Guardian (Manchester, UK) In the 1930s, the club now known as CUSC (Cambridge University Socialist Club) took the pacifist case extremely seriously, producing a pamphlet entitled \\"Conscription for Britain?\\" in 1938 which attacked the government for abandoning collective security. It was on this basis that CUSC also opposed the policy of appeasement. Their commitment to pacifism brought danger to the University's socialists: in March 1938 their rooms were raided and slogans in support of Franco were scratched on the walls of one room, while a speech by Clement Attlee to CUSC in the Corn Exchange was interrupted by fireworks. In December 1939, a new form of CULC was founded for those whose opinions sat closer to the national Labour Party than CUSC with regard to war. During the war, the ongoing activity of CULC seemed to have failed to inspire an undergraduate population whose enthusiasm for socialism was mostly lukewarm. In October 1941 CULC began a periodical entitled the Labour Club Review. One edition from November 1941 carried an editorial which praised socialism as 'a faith to fight for'. 'Successful and well-established movements always tend to lose their early fire', the editor commented. 'Now parents no longer protest when their elder sons join the Labour Party. The Party has become \\"His Majesty's Government.\\" As its numbers have grown, its belief has weakened and almost all former fervour has been lost'. It seemed that the combination of the party‚Äôs long period of opposition during the 1930s following the crippling divide of the financial crisis, combined with the need to focus on the war over and above ideological concerns, had dampened undergraduate enthusiasm for the Labour Party during the early 1940s. Although CULC organised speakers' events, dance classes, grand balls, and training classes, it seemed that in the Labour Party, 'official leadership, rigid party organisation, and the difficulties of coalition government' had 'done much to dampen enthusiasm'. Post-WWII period During the late 1940s CULC then suffered from declining public confidence in the government. One member, David Widdicombe, wrote an article entitled 'Against Ignorance' in the Labour Review in which he argued that the government was failing to explain its programme to the people. He suggested that party members and MPs should 'give the flesh of ideal to the bare bones of legislation, to show towards what type of community we are progressing' and to replace 'doctrinaire socialist economic theory' with arguments based on 'efficiency and the common good'. Practising as he preached, he proposed to set up special Sunday discussion groups open to all; they would be informal and, crucially, he was 'in favour of tea and buns'. For Widdicombe, the view that CULC was 'an instrument of research is over-emphasised and founded on the fallacy that we know something others don‚Äôt'. As it had always done, CULC took an active role in politics outside of the University. One such instance was a sympathy strike in 1946 held in Cambridge in support of lorry drivers in Smithfield. Although only five workers turned out in Cambridge, CULC members argued successfully that the press had exaggerated how much lorry drivers in Smithfield were paid. On another occasion a young Peter Shore, the future cabinet minister, led a protest against the Cambridge Conservatives as they held their gala evening with the parliamentary candidate Hamilton Kerr and R. A. \\"Rab\\" Butler. Their greatest achievement that evening was to drown out the Conservatives' chorus of the first verse of the national anthem. In the late 1960s, the Club was split among a number of factions. CULC was seen as an umbrella organisation for the Left, including within it a Socialist Society and a Marxist Society. Members of the committee, however, were usually Labour Party members. The Right of the Labour Party, which was largely associated with the Fabian Society, broke off in Easter Term 1967 and formed the Democratic Labour Club, which forbade its members to be part of any other political society. The Cambridge Democratic Labour Club was immediately recognised by the national Labour Party at Transport House, with the Labour Club no longer recognised by the national party. Accusations of electoral malpractice were traded between the two, in what CULC's Senior Treasurer Prof Bernard Williams described as \\"a disagreeable and seedy affair.\\" Also active until at least the 1960s was 'SocSoc' or the Cambridge University Socialist Society. Ultimately, the Cambridge Organisation of Labour Students (COLS) was formed in the summer of 1973 as a replacement for the faction-ridden CULC. It readopted the name Cambridge University Labour Club around 2000 and changed to its current name again in 2007 to Cambridge Universities Labour Club to reflect the opening up of membership. Constitution and organisation CULC is run by an elected executive committee. The current co-chairs are Harrison Jennings and Fiona Mitchell, of Magdalene and Christ's College respectively The club also holds Annual General Meetings and Termly General Meetings at which its members can pass policy in the form of motions (such as supporting the Living Wage Campaign), and hear reports from the executive officers. =Membership= Historically membership of the society had been open only to students of the University of Cambridge. In 2007 a constitutional amendment was made, opening up membership to students of Anglia Ruskin University also. In recognition of this fact, the name of the society was changed to Cambridge Universities [sic] Labour Club. In 2012 CULC elected its first Anglia Ruskin member to the executive committee. =Acronym= The acronym CULC had historically belonged to the Cambridge University Liberal Club, before they became the Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats in 1988, and the acronym is still shared to this day with the Cambridge University Lacrosse Club.  Criticisms  The Cambridge Universities Labour Club is independent from, but affiliated to the national Labour Party. It has caused controversy at times by making criticisms of the Cambridge University Conservative Association (CUCA) and Cambridge University for being excessively elitist and dedicated to preserving the image of antiquated class distinctions.http://cambridgeunilabour.blogspot.com/2010/02/class-matters.html CUCA has responded denying these claims, arguing that CULC has misconceived CUCA.http://www.cuca.org.uk/2009/10/09/hugh-burling-on-bbfg/ Notable former members CULC and its other various manifestations have produced a number of notable alumni.

Associated with, but distinct from, the Marshalsea Court was the Palace Court. The Marshalsea Court It was a court of record held by the Steward and Marshal of the Royal Household, to administer justice between the sovereign's domestic servants \\"that they might not be drawn into other courts and their service lost\\". It dealt with cases of trespass committed within the verge of the court, fixed at 12 miles round the sovereign's residence, if only one party was in the sovereign's service, and with debts, contracts and covenants, where both parties belonged to the royal household, in which case the inquest was composed of men from the royal household only. Its criminal jurisdiction had long fallen into disuse by the time its civil jurisdiction was belatedly abolished in 1849. Associated with the Court was the Marshalsea Prison. Originally the prison of the Court of the Marshalsea and known from about 1300, it was on a site in Mermaid Court, Southwark until relocated to a site off Borough High Street in 1811. Here it largely functioned as a debtor's prison until 1842 when its role was taken over by the Queen's Bench Prison. The Palace Court Interior of the Palace Court of the Marshalsea, 1800 In 1630 Charles I created by letters patent (renewed in 1665) a new court called the Palace Court to be held by the Steward of the Household and Knight Marshal, and the steward of the court or his deputy, and having jurisdiction to hear all kinds of personal actions between parties within twelve miles of Whitehall Palace (the jurisdiction of the Marshalsea court, the City of London, and Westminster Hall being excepted). It differed from the Marshalsea court in that it had no jurisdiction over the sovereign's household, nor were its suitors necessarily of the household. The privilege of practising before the palace court was limited to four counsel. In some cases, the counsel practicing before both the Marshalsea Court and the Palace Court overlapped, as was the case with the Lincoln's Inn barrister Levett Blackborne, grandson of Sir Richard Levett, former Lord Mayor of London.Blackborne likely owed his appointment to the Marshalsea Court to his sponsor the Duke of Rutland, to whom he was a lifelong adviser and connected by marriage. Trading on his connections and various appointments, Blackborne was a powerbroker of his day, securing land grants in British colonies in Nova Scotia and East Florida, as well as other lucrative sidelines.David Hancock, Citizens of the world: London merchants and the integration of the British Atlantic Community Blackborne served as steward of both courts, as did several other barristers.Burton Morice (Court of Wards and Liveries), An Essay Towards An History of the Ancient Jurisdiction of the Marshalsea of the King's House 9W.

Established in 1958, the school enrolled approximately 1,500 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom one percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 96 percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education in accordance with a curriculum developed by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority; and the principal is Beth Godwin. History Cabramatta High School is the local high school of Cabramatta, an urbanised suburb located in south-west Sydney. The school was established in 1958 as the suburb's first high school. Cabramatta High School is becoming increasingly popular within the region, with impressive records of academic and practical successful students, mostly achieving grade-averages higher than most other schools in the local area. Well known for its multiculturalism, Cabramatta High School consists of a very diverse range of students and staff, with majority coming from non-English speaking backgrounds, predominantly Vietnamese and Chinese. Cabramatta High School has been praised by many people in the public for its great diversity of students with the great conception of multiculturalism and peace of many different cultures in enabling an enjoyable location to learn. The school created a peace garden as a memorial to students' family history going through the war. A documentary featuring the school's garden was broadcast on ABC TV. The Australian Chamber Orchestra in late 2005 chose Cabramatta High School as the first school to be in their new education program. On 25 October 2006, the school was selected as the first school in south-west Sydney to have a Respect Acceptance Participation (RAP) Day for student representatives from secondary school and Intensive English Centres across South Western Sydney Region. The school celebrated their 50th anniversary with a banquet at the local restaurant. On 21 November 2008, the Class of 88 (86 for Year 10) celebrated their 20th year reunion at the Barclay Lounge. The event was attended by a strong turnout of former students and also a number of teachers were there to celebrate the evening. In recent years, Cabramatta High School has caught the eyes of many well-known stars, including Australian Idol's Jessica Mauboy, Australia's Got Talent's Justice Crew, singer Israel Cruz, as well as Jet Valencia, the director of Australia's Got Talent's Kookies n Kreme. A major make-over was completed at the school, with large sums of money being spent on creating a better environment for students and staff. Throughout 2013, many construction work were completed, which led to the introduction of many new classrooms, as well as a new dance studio.  Peace Day  The school's successful annual Peace Day celebrations continued to deliver warm welcomes to recipients of the Sydney Peace Prize, With the releasing of the \\"Cabramatta doves\\", the Sydney Peace Prize winners helped mark the special occasion with the rest of the school and the community.

Once such a set of values of thermodynamic variables has been specified for a system, the values of all thermodynamic properties of the system are uniquely determined. Usually, by default, a thermodynamic state is taken to be one of thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that the state is not merely the condition of the system at a specific time, but that the condition is the same, unchanging, over an indefinitely long duration of time. Thermodynamics sets up an idealized formalism that can be summarized by a system of postulates of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic states are amongst the fundamental or primitive objects or notions of the formalism, in which their existence is formally postulated, rather than being derived or constructed from other concepts.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 13.Carath√©odory, C. (1909).Marsland, R. , Brown, H.R., Valente, G. (2015). A thermodynamic system is not simply a physical system.Jaynes, E.T. (1965), p. 397. Rather, in general, infinitely many different alternative physical systems comprise a given thermodynamic system, because in general a physical system has vastly many more microscopic characteristics than are mentioned in a thermodynamic description. A thermodynamic system is a macroscopic object, the microscopic details of which are not explicitly considered in its thermodynamic description. The number of state variables required to specify the thermodynamic state depends on the system, and is not always known in advance of experiment; it is usually found from experimental evidence. Always the number is two or more; usually it is not more than some dozen. Though the number of state variables is fixed by experiment, there remains choice of which of them to use for a particular convenient description; a given thermodynamic system may be alternatively identified by several different choices of the set of state variables. The choice is usually made on the basis of the walls and surroundings that are relevant for the thermodynamic processes that are to be considered for the system. For example, if it is intended to consider heat transfer for the system, then a wall of the system should be permeable to heat, and that wall should connect the system to a body, in the surroundings, that has a definite time-invariant temperature.Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954), p. 1.Zemanksy, M.W., Dittman, R.H. (1937/1981), p. 6. For equilibrium thermodynamics, in a thermodynamic state of a system, its contents are in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with zero flows of all quantities, both internal and between system and surroundings. For Planck, the primary characteristic of a thermodynamic state of a system that consists of a single phase, in the absence of an externally imposed force field, is spatial homogeneity.Planck, M., (1923/1927), p. 3. For non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a suitable set of identifying state variables includes some macroscopic variables, for example a non-zero spatial gradient of temperature, that indicate departure from thermodynamic equilibrium. Such non-equilibrium identifying state variables indicate that some non-zero flow may be occurring within the system or between system and surroundings.Eu, B.C. (2002). State functions Besides the thermodynamic variables that originally identify a thermodynamic state of a system, the system is characterized by further quantities called state functions, which are also called state variables, thermodynamic variables, state quantities, or functions of state. They are uniquely determined by the thermodynamic state as it has been identified by the original state variables. A passage from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final thermodynamic state of a thermodynamic system is known as a thermodynamic process; usually this is transfer of matter or energy between system and surroundings. In any thermodynamic process, whatever may be the intermediate conditions during the passage, the total respective change in the value of each thermodynamic state variable depends only on the initial and final states. For an idealized continuous or quasi-static process, this means that infinitesimal incremental changes in such variables are exact differentials. Together, the incremental changes throughout the process, and the initial and final states, fully determine the idealized process. In the most commonly cited simple example, an ideal gas, the thermodynamic variables would be any three variables out of the following four: amount of substance, pressure, temperature, and volume. Thus the thermodynamic state would range over a three-dimensional state space. The remaining variable, as well as other quantities such as the internal energy and the entropy, would be expressed as state functions of these three variables. The state functions satisfy certain universal constraints, expressed in the laws of thermodynamics, and they depend on the peculiarities of the materials that compose the concrete system. Various thermodynamic diagrams have been developed to model the transitions between thermodynamic states. Equilibrium state Physical systems found in nature are practically always dynamic and complex, but in many cases, macroscopic physical systems are amenable to description based on proximity to ideal conditions. One such ideal condition is that of a stable equilibrium state. Such a state is a primitive object of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics, in which it is called a thermodynamic state. Based on many observations, thermodynamics postulates that all systems that are isolated from the external environment will evolve so as to approach unique stable equilibrium states. There are a number of different types of equilibrium, corresponding to different physical variables, and a system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium when the conditions of all the relevant types of equilibrium are simultaneously satisfied. A few different types of equilibrium are listed below. *Thermal equilibrium: When the temperature throughout a system is uniform, the system is in thermal equilibrium. *Mechanical equilibrium: If at every point within a given system there is no change in pressure with time, and there is no movement of material, the system is in mechanical equilibrium. *Phase equilibrium: This occurs when the mass for each individual phase reaches a value that does not change with time. *Chemical equilibrium: In chemical equilibrium, the chemical composition of a system has settled and does not change with time.

Also called Shyam Baba, he is a very popular supernatural power. The original Sanskrit name Barbarƒ´ka is often replaced in Rajasthan by the Hindi version, Barbarƒ´k, also spelled as Barbareek. In the Skanda Purana, Barbareeka, Baliyadev (IAST Barbarƒ´ka) was the son of Ghatotkacha and Maurvi, daughter of Daitya Moor, a Yadava king, though other references state he is a warrior from the south. Barbareeka was originally a yaksha, reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the losing side, which led him to stand witness to the battle of Mahabharata without taking part in it. In Nepali culture, Kirata King Yalamber of Nepal, is portrayed as Barbareeka while Native of Kathmandu Valley portray him as Akash Bhairav. In Rajasthan, he is worshipped as Khatushyamji, and in Gujarat, he is worshipped as Baliyadev is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the Pandavas. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by a boon given by Krishna. He is much worshipped in Rajasthan. Other names *Barbarika: Khatushyam's childhood name was Barbarika. His mother and relatives used to call him by this name before the name Shyam given by Krishna. *Sheesh Ke Daani: Literally: \\"Donor of Head\\"; As per the legend related above. *Haare Ka Sahara: Literally: \\"Support of the defeated\\"; Upon his mother's advise, Barbarika resolved to support whoever has less power and is losing. Hence he is known by this name. *Teen Baan Dhaari: Literally: \\"Bearer of three arrows\\"; Reference is to the three infallible arrows that he received as boon from God Shiva. These arrows were sufficient to destroy the whole world. The title written below these three arrows is Maam Sevyam Parajitah. *Lakha-datari: Literally: \\"The Munificent Giver\\"; One who never hesitates to give his devotees whatever they need and ask for. *Leela ke Aswaar: Literally: \\"Rider of Leela\\"; Being the name of his blue-coloured horse. Many call it Neela Ghoda or \\"blue horse.\\" *Khatu Naresh: Literally: \\"The King of Khatu\\"; One who rules Khatu and the whole universe. *Kalyug ke Avtaar: Literally: \\"The God of Kali Yuga\\"; As per Krishna he will be the God who will save good people in the era of Kali Yuga. *Shyam Pyarey: Literally: \\"The God who love all and all love to him, the spiritual relation between bhakt and bhagwan called nishkaam pyaar/prem \\" *Baliya Dev: Literally: \\" Dev with super power; newly born children are blessed in the temple located in Vasna, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. * Morechadidharak: Literally:\\"The bearer of stick made of peacock feathers\\" * Shyam Baba * Barish Ka Devta: Literally: \\"The God of rain\\"; One who controls rain according to his will. Prevalent name in Kamrunag Temple at Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. * Yalambar Barbarika (Belarsen) and his dialog with Krishna Barbarika alias Khatushyamji Baliyadev alias Shyam was a grandson of Bhima (second of the Pandava brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha was the son of Bhima and Hidimba. Even in his childhood, Barbarika was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (ashtadeva) gave him the three infallible arrows. Hence, Barbarika came to be known as \\"Bearer of Three Arrows\\". When Barbarika learnt that battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side which would be losing. He rode to the field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow. Before the Mahabharata war began, Lord Krishna asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. Bhishma answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. Dronacharya replied that it would take him 25 days. When Karna was asked, he said he would take 24 days. Arjuna told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer. Krishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he'd finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are not marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroy them. Krishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the Peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika Baliyadev accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika starts meditating, Krishna quietly plucks a leaf from the tree and hides it under his foot. When Barbarika releases his first arrow, it marks all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asks Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. Barbarika replies that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that is hidden underneath. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifts his foot and the first arrow also marks the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collects all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika is unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows can still navigate and trace his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hide them elsewhere in order to prevent them from being Barbarika's victim, he would not be successful as the arrows could trace even the hidden targets and destroy them. So, nobody would be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power. Krishna then asks the boy whom he would favour in the war. Barbarika reveals that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas have only seven Akshauhini armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considers that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wants to support them. But Krishna asks him, if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumes that his support, to the relatively weaker Pandava side, will make them victorious. But, Krishna reveals the actual consequences of his word to his mother: Krishna tells that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody will be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he will keep oscillating between two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity. Act of charity Barbarika donates his head to Krishna. Krishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phalgun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once Lord Brahma and several other Devas came to Vaikuntha and complained to Lord Vishnu that the Adharma on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu to check them. Lord Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for Lord Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt Lord Brahma very much. Lord Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the Yaksha takes birth as Barbarika and Lord Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse. Since that day Human Barbarika become the Khatu Shyam, The realizer of Lord Krishna by Barbarika given his head and God Krishna himself manifested in his heart. Bearing witness to the war Before decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle. At the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory. Barbarika replies, ‚ÄúAll I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the Draupadi who has taken her original form of Goddess Mahakali, who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice\\". Listening to this, Pandavas realized that it was Lord Narayana and Goddess Parvati (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments. After the war Barbarika‚Äôs head was joined with the his body and he left that place for narrating the whole world to maintain peace. His other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as Khatushyam Temple, located in Khatu village in Sikar District, Rajasthan. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village Lambha in Ahmedabad District, Gujarat. Observances and festivals Barbarika is worshiped as Shyam, he is not the supreme personality of godhead Sri krishna. Or any of krishna's incarnation but maybe considered as the great devotee of Krishna. And since the glories of krishna's devotee is more than krishna himself people worships khatushyam also. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of Krishna Janmaashtami, Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi, Holi and Vasant Panchami are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The Phalguna Mela detailed below is the principal annual festival. Lacs of devotees visit the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their mundan (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate aarti is performed at the temple five times a day. These are: * Mangala Aarti: performed in the early morning, when temple is open. * Shringaar Aarti: performed at the time of make-up of Baba Shyam. The idol is grandly ornamented for this aarti. * Bhog Aarti: performed at noon when bhog (Prasadam) is served to the Lord. * Sandhya Aarti: performed in the evening, at sunset. Two special hymns, the \\"Shri Shyam Aarti\\" and the \\"Shri Shyam Vinati,\\" are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the Lord's names that is chanted by devotees. Other particular observances include: Shukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi: The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of Kartika, and he donated his head (Sheesh) to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of phalgun on Tuesday. Darshan on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night- long Bhajan sessions are organised since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the Lord. Devotees organise Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs. Bathing in the Shyam Kund: This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved. It is believed that a dip in this pond cures a person from ailments and brings good health. Filled with devotional fervor, people take ritual dips in the Shyam Kund. They believe that this will relieve them of diseases and contagion. Bathing during the annual Phalguna Mela festival is deemed specially salutary. Nishan Yatra: It is believed that your wishes are granted if you offer a Nishan at the temple. A Nishan is a triangular flag of a particular size, made of cloth, which is hoisted on a bamboo stick. It is carried in one's hands while covering the route from the town of Ringas to Khatu (17 km) on (bare) foot. Nishans are offered in millions during the Phalguna Mela. Phalguna Mela: The most important festival associated with the temple is the Phalguna Mela which occurs just 8‚Äì9 days before from the festival of Holi. Barbarika's head appeared on Phalguna Shuddha Ekadashi, the 11th day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Phalguna. Therefore, the fair is held from the 9th to the 12th of that month. The fair has now been extended to nearly 12‚Äì15 days of the bright half of the Phalguna Month. Pad Yatra from Kota to Khatushyamji in 2008 On this holy occasion pilgrims all over the country come here on foot with nishaans (holy mark - flags) in their hands. People enjoy their holy journey by singing shyam bhajans and playing various musical instruments. They enjoy the journey by playing holi with gulal. Many Shyam Bhaktas supply food to pedestrians in the shade of tents. They encourage also to complete their journey with full enthusiasm. They enjoy this occasion as the marriage of Khatushyamji. People enjoy the mela by purchasing various things. On Dwadashi (= 12th day of month), Bhog is being prepared as Baba's ‚ÄìPrasadi of Kheer, Churama‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì. Special arrangements for security are made to control the crowd. Around 500,000 people visit in three days of this holy mela in this small village. To briefly see Baba Shyam's idol, a very tight security is made with the help of bamboo fence around .

He was mayor of the city of Bilbao, Biscay in the Basque Country, from 1999 until his death. In 2012, Azkuna won the World Mayor Prize, honoring the most outstanding mayors in the world, for his transformation of industrial Bilbao into a cultural centre. Azkuna died from prostate cancer on 20 March 2014 in Bilbao, Biscay. He was 71 years old. Biography Son of a metallurgical and a seamstress, I√±aki Azkuna was born in Durango in 1943. Although he knew Bilbao since his childhood, he studied at Salamanca, where he graduated in Medicine in 1966, specializing in cardiology and radiology. After receiving his doctorate cum laude from the University of Salamanca, then he moved to France to work as an assistant in the Hospital abroad Broussais, of the University of Paris, between 1971 and 1972. There he met Anabella Dominguez, a Mexican student of French philology with whom he would later marry and have a son. Since 1973, he was professor of Physical Medicine and Radiology at the University of the Basque Country and worked in the Hospital of Las Cruces (Baracaldo, Vizcaya), first as a physician assistant and from 1976 as head of the Radiology Department. In 1981, he was appointed Director of the Hospital of Cruces. The following year he was appointed Director of hospitals of the Basque Government. From 1983 to 1987 he served as Director-general of Osakidetza-Servicio Basque Health. In July 1989 he was appointed Secretary general of the Presidency of the Basque Government, performing such work for two years, and assuming the post of Advisor in the Department of health of the Basque Government in 1991. He was also elected Mayor of Bilbao as the head of the list of the coalition between the PNV and Eusko Alkartasuna (EA), thanks to the votes of the Basque Country councilors; and later formed a Pact of Government with Basque citizen initiative, party led by the former Mayor of Bilbao Jos√© Mar√≠a Gorordo, who had been expelled from the PNV. He was re-elected to the post after the municipal elections of 2003, again in coalition with EA, and 2007, already in solitary, without obtaining absolute majority in any of them; in 2003, it received support from Ezker Batua, who joined the Government team, and in 2007 the Coalition Ezker Batua-Aralar. Finally, in the municipal elections of 2011, managed to reach the first absolute majority (15 councillors on 29) in the history of the PNV in the city of Bilbao, which allowed the legislature to govern alone. In January 2013 received the Mayor World Award, given the greater City Foundation, in recognition of his work in the city of Bilbao. He died on March 20, 2014, at the age of 71 years, as a result of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in March 2003. On march 24 he was dismissed with full honours in a funeral mass celebrated in the Cathedral of Santiago in Bilbao.

The full quote spoken by Hogan is \\"I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you\\", and the actual slogan of the ad was \\"Come and say G'day\\". It has since been used, along with some variations, to make reference to Australia in popular culture. Details The advertisement pre-dated Hogan's popularity in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. Thus they were not initially seen as celebrity advertisements in the US, as he was relatively unknown in the United States (though well known in the UK through his long-running television comedy show), although the film somewhat increased the commercial's popularity. The advertisements were developed by the Australian agency Mojo in conjunction with American agency N.W. Ayer. The campaign was launched during the National Football Conference Championship Game on January 8, 1984. Before the campaign, Australia was approximately number 78 on the \\"most desired\\" vacation destination list for Americans, but became number 7 three months after the launch, and soon became number 1 or 2 on Americans' \\"dream vacation\\" list, remaining in that position for most of the next two decades. \\"Barbie\\" is Australian slang for barbecue and the phrase \\"slip a shrimp on the barbie\\" often evokes images of a fun social gathering under the sun. Australians, however, invariably use the word prawn rather than shrimp. Because the commercial was commissioned for broadcast in the United States, the change was made to limit audience confusion. The commercial was so influential that three decades later, USC Trojans football player Chris Tilbey, an Australian, reported that he was quoted the \\"shrimp on the barbie\\" line \\"Every day. Every day\\". The term was used in the opening sequence of the 1994 cult comedy Dumb and Dumber, when protagonist Lloyd Christmas (portrayed by Jim Carrey) tries to hit on an Austrian woman, mistaking her for an Australian: \\"Let's put another shrimp on the barbie\\". She then turns him down, saying \\"Let's not\\". In Mortal Kombat 11 videogame, the phrase is used by Cassie Cage to mock Kano (an Australian weapon dealer). Prawns are a popular traditional Christmas seafood in Australia. However, crustaceans such as shrimp and prawns are less common, on average, in the Australian cuisine than in the United States. In the late 1980s, annual per capita consumption of shrimp stood at 1.3 kg in the United States, second only to Japan.

Al-Farahidi was the first scholar to subject the prosody of Classical Arabic poetry to a detailed phonological analysis. The primary data he listed and categorized in meticulous detail was extremely complex to master and utilize, and later theorists have developed simpler formulations with greater coherence and general utility. He was also a pioneer in the field of cryptography, and influenced the work of Al-Kindi. Life Born in 718 in Oman, southern Arabia, to Azdi parents of modest means, al- Farahidi became a leading grammarian of Basra in Iraq.Paula Casey-Vine, Oman in History, pg. 261. London: Immel Publishing, 1995. In Basra, he studied Islamic traditions and philology under Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' with Aiy≈´b al- SakhtiyƒÅni, ‚ÄòƒÄ·π£m al-A·∏•wal, al-‚ÄòAwwƒÅm b. ·∏§awshab, etc. His teacher Ayyub persuaded him to renounce the AbƒÅ·∏çi doctrine and convert to Sunni orthodoxy; Among his pupils were Sibawayh, al-Na·∏çr b. Shumail, and al-Layth b. al- Mu·∫ìaffar b. Na·π£r. Known for his piety and frugality, he was a companion of JƒÅbir ibn Zayd, the founder of ibadism.Introduction to Early Medieval Arabic, pg. 2. It was said his parents were converts to Islam, and that his father was the first to be named \\"Ahmad\\" after the time of Prophet Muhammad.Ibn Khallikan, Deaths, pg. 497. His nickname, \\"Farahidi\\", differed from his tribal name and derived from an ancestor named Furhud (Young Lion); plural . The descendants of his tribe are the modern-day Zahran tribe residing primarily in the Al Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia.Kathy Cuddihy, An A to Z of Places and Things Saudi, pg. 6. London: Stacey International, 2001. He refused lavish gifts from rulers, or to indulge in the slander and gossip his fellow Arab and Persian rival scholars were wont, and he performed annual pilgrimage to Mecca. He lived in a small reed house in Basra and once remarked that when his door was shut, his mind did not go beyond it.Ibn Khallikan, Deaths, pg. 494. He taught linguistics,John A. Haywood, Arabic, pg. 22. and some of his students became wealthy teachers. Al-Farahidi's main income was falconry and a garden inherited from his father.Aujourd'hui L'Egypte, iss. #18-20, pg. 114. Egypt: Hay æah al- ªƒÄmmah lil-Isti ªlƒÅmƒÅt, 1992. Digitized by AbeBooks July 16, 2010. Two dates of death are cited, 786 and 791 CE.Kees Versteegh, Arabic Linguistic Tradition, pg. 7. The story goes that it was theoretical contemplation that brought about his death. On the particular day, while he was deeply absorbed in contemplation of a system of accounting to save his maidservant from being cheated by the green grocer, he wandered into a mosque and there he absent- mindedly bumped into a pillar and was fatally injured. Views Al-Farahidi's eschewing of material wealth has been noted by a number of biographers. In his old age, the son of Habib ibn al-Muhallab and reigning governor of the Muhallabids offered al-Farahidi a pension and requested that the latter tutor the former's son. Al-Farahidi declined, stating that he was wealthy though possessing no money, as true poverty lay not in a lack of money, but in the soul.Ibn Khallikan, Deaths, pg. 495. The governor reacted by rescinding the pension, an act to which al-Farahidi responded with the following lines of poetry: :\\"He, Who formed me with a mouth, engaged to give me nourishment till such a time as He takes me to Himself. Thou hast refused me a trifling sum, but that refusal will not increase thy wealth.\\" Embarrassed, the governor then responded with an offer to renew the pension and double the rate, which al- Farahidi still greeted with a lukewarm reception. Al-Farahidi's apathy about material wealth was demonstrated in his habit of quoting Akhtal's famous stanza: \\"If thou wantest treasures, thou wilt find none equal to a virtuous conduct.\\" Al-Farahidi distinguished himself via his philosophical views as well. He reasoned that a man's intelligence peaked at the age of forty ‚Äì the age when the Islamic prophet Muhammad began his call ‚Äì and began to diminish after sixty, the point at which Muhammad died. He also believed that a person was at their peak intelligence at the clearest part of dawn. In regard to the field of grammar, al-Farahidi held the realist views common among early Arab linguists yet rare among both later and modern times. Rather than holding the rules of grammar as he and his students described them to be absolute rules, al-Farahidi saw the Arabic language as the natural, instinctual speaking habits of the Bedouin; if the descriptions of scholars such as himself differed from how the Arabs of the desert naturally spoke, then the cause was a lack of knowledge on the scholar's part as the unspoken, unwritten natural speech of pure Arabs was the final determiner.Yasir Suleiman, \\"Ideology, grammar-making and standardization.\\" Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture, pgs. 13-14. Ed. Bilal Orfali. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. Al-Farahidi was distinguished, however, in his view that the Arabic alphabet included 29 letters rather than 28 and that each letter represented a fundamental characteristic of people or animals. His classification of 29 letters was due to his consideration of the combination of Lamedh and Aleph as a separate third letter from the two individual parts.Gerhard Bowering, \\"Sulami's treatise on the science of the letters.\\" Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic, pg. 349. Legacy In the Arab world al- Farahidi had become a household name by the time he died, and become almost as mythic a figure as Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali in Arabic philology. He was the first to codify the complex metres of Arabic poetry, and an outstanding genius of the Muslim world. Sibawayh and Al-Asma'i were among his students,Florentin Smarandache and Salah Osman, Neutrosophy in Arabic Philosophy, pg. 83. Ann Arbor: American Research Press, 2007. with the former having been more indebted to al-Farahidi than to any other teacher.Khalil I. Semaan, Linguistics in the Middle Ages: Phonetic Studies in Early Islam, pg. 39. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1968.Kees Versteegh, Arabic Linguistic Tradition, pg. 39. Al-Nadim, the 10th century bibliophile biographer from Basra, reports that in fact Sibawayh's \\"Kitab\\" (Book), was a collaborative work of forty-two authors, but also that the principles and subjects in the \\"Kitab\\" were based on those of al-Farahidi. He is quoted by Sibawayh 608 times, more than any other authority.M.G. Carter, Sibawayh, pg. 21. Part of the Makers of Islamic Civilization series. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004. Throughout the Kitab Sibawayh says \\"I asked him\\" or \\"he said\\", without naming the person referred to by the pronoun, however, it is clear that he refers to al-Farahidi. Both the latter and the former are historically the earliest and most significant figures in the formal recording of the Arabic language.Toufic Fahd, \\"Botany and agriculture.\\" Taken from Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Volume 3: Technology, Alchemy and Life Sciences, pg. 814. Ed. Roshdi Rasheed. London: Routledge, 1996. Al-Farahidi was also well versed in astronomy, mathematics, Islamic law, music theory and Muslim prophetic tradition.Monique Bernards, \\"Pioneers of Arabic Linguistic Studies.\\" Taken from In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture, pg. 213. Ed. Bilal Orfali. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. His prowess in the Arabic language was said to be drawn, first and foremost, from his vast knowledge of Muslim prophetic tradition as well as exegesis of the Qur'an.

Its title, \\"the source\\", reflects its author's goal to derive the etymological origins of Arabic vocabulary and lexicography. =\\"Isnad\\" (Chain of Authorities) of Kitab al-'Ayn= In his \\"Kitab al-Fihrist\\" (Catalogue) ibn Ishaq al-Nadim recounts the various names attaching to the transmission of Kitab al-'Ayn. He begins with Durustuyah's account that it was al-Kasrawi who said that al-Zaj al-Muhaddath had said that al-Khalil had explained the concept and structure of his dictionary to al-Layth b. al-Muzaffar b. Nasr b. Sayyar, had dictated edited portions to al-Layth and they had reviewed its preparation together. Al-Nadim writes that a manuscript in the possession of Da'laj had probably belonged originally to Ibn al-'Ala al-Sijistani, who according to Durustuyah had been a member of a circle of scholars who critiqued the book. In this group was Abu Talib al-Mufaddal inb Slamah, 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Karmani, Abu Bakr ibn Durayd and al-Huna'i al- Dawsi.Dodge, vol.1 pp.95-96 =Other works= In addition to his work in prosody and lexicography, al-Farahidi established the fields of  ªar≈´·∏ç ‚Äì rules- governing Arabic poetry metre ‚Äì and Arabic musicology.Salma Jayyusi, Trends and Movements in Modern Arabic Poetry, vol. 1, pg. 791.

Al-Nadim's list of al-Khalil's other works were: *Chanting; Prosody; Witnesses; (Consonant) Points and (Vowel) Signs; Death (or pronunciation or omitting) of the 'Ayn; Harmony. =Cryptography= Al-Farahidi's \\"Book of Cryptographic Messages\\", was the first book on cryptography and cryptanalysis written by a linguist.\\"Combinational analysis, numerical analysis, Diophantine analysis and number theory.\\" Taken from Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Volume 2: Mathematics and the Physical Sciences, pg. 378. Ed. Roshdi Rasheed. London: Routledge, 1996. Steven Brown, Implementing virtual private networks, pg. 344. New York: McGraw-Hill Education, 1999. The lost work contains many \\"firsts\\", including the use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels. Later Arab cryptographers explicitly resorted to al-Farahidi's phonological analysis for calculating letter frequency in their own works.\\"Combinational analysis,\\" pg. 377. His work on cryptography influenced Al-Kindi (c. 801‚Äì873), who discovered the method of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis. =Diacritic system= Al- Farahidi is also credited with the current standard for Arabic diacritics; rather than a series of indistinguishable dots, it was al-Farahidi who introduced different shapes for the vowel diacritics in Arabic, which simplified the writing system so much that it has not been changed since.Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Language, pg. 56. He also began using a small letter shin to signify the shadda mark for doubling consonants. Al-Farahidi's style for writing the Arabic alphabet was much less ambiguous than the previous system where dots had to perform various functions, and while he only intended its use for poetry it was eventually used for the Qur'an as well.Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Language, pg. 57. = Prosody = Al-Farahidi's first work was in the study of Arabic prosody, a field for which he is credited as the founder.Ibn Khallikan, Deaths of Eminent Men and History of the Sons of the Epoch, vol. 1, pg. 493.

When he returned to Basra shortly thereafter, he overheard the rhythmic beating of a blacksmith on an anvil and he immediately wrote down fifteen metres around the periphery of five circles, which were accepted as the basis of the field and still accepted as such in Arabic language prosody today. Three of the meters were not known to Pre-Islamic Arabia, suggesting that al- Farahidi may have invented them himself.James T.

Martin(us) van Marum (20 March 1750, Delft ‚Äì 26 December 1837, Haarlem) was a Dutch physician, inventor, scientist and teacher, who studied medicine and philosophy in Groningen. Van Marum introduced modern chemistry in the Netherlands after the theories of Lavoisier, and several scientific applications for general use. He became famous for his demonstrations with instruments, most notable the Large electricity machine, to show statical electricity and chemical experiments while curator for the Teylers Museum. Biography Early career = Born in Delft, Van Marum moved to Haarlem in 1776 because the Haarlemmers had more taste in the sciences than anywhere else in the Netherlands. After his arrival in Haarlem he began to practise medicine, but devoted himself mainly to lecturing on physical subjects and creating instruments to demonstrate physical theory. He must have made a big impression on Haarlem society, because he became a member of the Dutch Society of Science in the same year, but was named director and curator of their cabinet of curiosities in the next year.Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan, De geschiedenis van een verdwenen Haarlemsch museum van natuurlijke historie. Het Kabinet van Naturalien van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen 1759‚Äì1866. Haarlem, F. Bohn, 1941. Van Marum received at first no salary, but by scaring off the former cabinet concierge Nicolaus Linder, he was able to collect Linder's' annual salary of 100 guilders, and when the cabinet moved later in 1777 to new quarters in the Grote Houtstraat 51, van Marum lived there as concierge. He managed to scare off Linder by obtaining permission from the society to allow his servants to keep tips they received from cabinet visitors; a source of income that Linder had come to rely on. Then van Marum increased this salary to 300 from 100 by adding responsibilities to his list of duties, such as a summer garden in the Rozenprieel and eliminating other expenses. =Curator of two museums= Famous Oval room in the Teylers Museum painted by Wybrand Hendriks, showing Martin van Marum's \\"Electriseermachine\\". Martinus van Marum's electrostatic generator at Teylers Museum In 1779 he was entrusted with the care of the Second society left to Haarlem by Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702‚Äì1778), which led under his direction to the foundation of the Teylers Museum. The Teyler legacy was split into three societies, one for religion, one for science, and one for the arts, known as the first, second, and third societies. The caretakers had to meet in Teyler's home weekly, and each society had 5 caretakers, so all of the gentlemen involved lived in Haarlem. In 1794 van Marum became secretary as well as director of the Dutch Society of Science. Under his management, both societies were advanced to the position of the most noted in Europe. Period travelogues mention both Museums.p 188 van Marum's museum in Journal of a horticultural tour through some parts of Flanders, Holland, and the North of France, in the autumn of 1817 by Patrick Neill, on the Google Books Library Project Besides being involved with the Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, he was an ordinary member (5 December 1776) and a corresponding member (from 25 December 1776) of the Provinciaal Utrechtsch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, a member of the Bataafsch Genootschap der Proefondervindelijke wijsbegeerte from 1784, a member of the Zeeuwsch Genootschap der Wetenschappen from 27 August 1782, corresponding member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences from 1783, and a member of the Vergadering van Notabelen voor het departement Zuiderzee from 29 March 1814. In 1808 he was asked by Louis Bonaparte to be a member of the committee for the formation of the Koninklijk Instituut along with Jeronimo de Bosch, Jean Henri van Swinden, and Martinus Stuart. He became member of the institute the same year. =Merging societies, separate collections= Under his guidance the two societies slowly merged. His name is associated with the Electriseermachine, the largest electricity demonstration machine with Leiden jars built in the 18th century and at the time a crowd pleaser for the young Teylers museum. The demonstration model is still on display, as is a smaller version in the Museum Boerhaave of Leiden. Van Marum's researches (especially in connection with electricity) were remarkable for their number and variety. The Teyler's Museum kept its role as a museum of scientific research (some of the periodical subscriptions he started are still running) and is a repository of important scientific demonstration models from the period. Not only items regarding electricity, but also weather stations, industrial models, steam engines, and other examples of the budding industrial revolution were collected and lovingly displayed. The collection of the Teyler's was mostly based on scientific theory, while the collection of the Dutch Society of Science was mostly based on scientific practise. The rooms in the Grote Houtstraat were filled with stuffed animals and other \\"naturalia\\", while the summer garden was a modern continuation of Linder's old Linnaeus hortus once located behind the original city hall quarters in the Prinsenhof. Since Linder had not known any Latin, it was easier for Van Marum to entertain foreign visitors with stories of Linnaean trivia and of course, the Haarlem story of tulip mania. =Teylers Museum= In 1784, when the Teylers Museum opened its new 'Oval Room', the artist Vincent Jansz van der Vinne was hired as curator of the art collection and lived in Pieter Teyler's former residence that was called the \\"Fundatiehuis\\" as concierge and caretaker of the art collection.Van kastelein tot directeur. Teylers museum in de 20ste eeuw. Stichting Vrienden van Teylers Museum (1975‚Äì2000), He left the next year because of continuous disagreements with van Marum over art and the opening hours of the museum. Van der Vinne was an artist born into an important Haarlem artist family ‚Äì he was the great-grandson of Vincent van der Vinne. The Teyler's museum replaced him with another local artist, Wybrand Hendricks, who painted the famous oval room and many other Haarlem scenes. Hendricks is largely responsible for the Teyler's collection of Old Master prints, most notably the purchase in Rome 1790 of a print & drawing collection formerly owned by Christina of Sweden. Apparently he got along under van Marum, but when he left in 1819 at the age of 75, the Teyler's decided to discontinue the purchase of art \\"for the decline in art enthusiasts in this city\\". During the tenure of Hendriks, van Marum himself was busy giving public demonstrations of electricity in the Oval room, but was also collecting in this period (this is why he was so involved with the lifestyle of the concierge of the Fundatiehuis, since he was there every day). He concentrated on scientific publications for the Teyler library. He concentrated his efforts on three aspects: 1) Greek and Latin authors, among them the church fathers, 2) Works of natural history including travelogues, and 3) natural history periodicals, including all publications of the Royal Society of London and all publications of the Dutch Society of Science, which Teyler had been a member of, but could not be on the board of, due to religious differences with the board. The criteria for purchase was always expense. If a Society member could afford to purchase it himself it was not worth adding to the collection. Any member could suggest purchases, however, which explains why the collection is filled with richly illustrated examples of contemporary publications. The most impressive of these are the large illustrated books of travellers. To view the collection, van Marum organised gentleman evenings in Pieter Teyler's library, a tradition that still exists. Legacy Martin van Marum in 1826. This portrait was commissioned by the Teylers Museum, but van Marum hated it. He had another portrait painted by Hodges that he preferred. Though the public is allowed access during the day to the museum rooms, the private rooms of Pieter Teyler in the \\"Fundatiehuis\\" are only open one day a year, on Monument Day. Because of its rich scientific tradition, many noted scholars of Physics moved to Haarlem to work at Teyler's, including Nobel prize winners Pieter Zeeman and Hendrik Lorentz. Of van Marum's three categories, only the first was discontinued at the close of the 19th century. The collection of periodicals which has been expanded through exchange networks, contains uninterrupted series that are among the oldest in the world. The Teyler's museum created a new wing in 1996 to house a rotational display of van Marum's library collection, such as the works of John James Audubon in combination with contemporary stuffed birds of Naturalis.

However, he was disqualified because his name was not on the voter's list. In a subsequent by-election, his father, George Morrow, secured the seat. Bob ran again in 1970, winning without legal difficulty. In 1972, he won a seat on the Board of Control, a body that was elected citywide. In the following three elections, he placed first in the multi-candidate race, automatically becoming deputy mayor. When the board was abolished in 1980, Morrow temporarily left municipal politics. He unsuccessfully ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1981 provincial election in Hamilton West, losing to provincial Liberal leader Stuart Smith. In 1982, Morrow won the first of six mayoral elections, defeating incumbent William Powell. His last few victories were only challenged by minor candidates, with Morrow regularly receiving in excess of 75 per cent of the vote. After Morrow refused to proclaim Hamilton's first Gay Pride Day in 1991, the Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that Morrow had discriminated against gays and lesbians, and he was fined $5,000 and forced to issue a proclamation in 1995.Renata D'Aliesio, \\"Gay Pride and Prejudice: High spirits of rally can't cloak unease\\".

He was born in the W√ºrttemberg village of Niederstetten, the son of a cantor and court clerk.

It can be a permanent fixture. Types In architecture a stanchion is the upright iron bars in windows that pass through the eyes of the saddle bars or horizontal irons to steady the leadlight. The French call the latter traverses, the stanchions montants, and the whole arrangement armature. Stanchions frequently finish with ornamental heads forged out of the iron. Stanchions are also the metal supporting members of lighting mounted from a lower elevation. This includes the metal inclined member for mounting a streetlight to a telephone or power pole, and the dedicated metal vertical support of a self-supporting or bottom-fed streetlight. In this case, the stanchion pole may double as the raceway for the electrical feed to the lighting. In industrial installations, walkway lighting may be mounted with a stanchion that is secured to a hand-rail. Stanchion lights are typically spaced 50' along walkways, such as conveyor platforms. Stanchions (balusters or bollards) are also the upright posts inserted into the ground or floor to protect the corner of a wall. In event management a stanchion is an upright bar or post that includes retractable belts, velvet ropes, or plastic chains, sometimes in conjunction with wall- mounted barrier devices, barricades, and printed signage and often used for crowd control and engineering people flow and construction site safety. Uses Stanchion Stanchions are used for many different purposes, including crowd control and waiting lines. Many different places use stanchions, including banks, stores, hotels, museums, restaurants, concert venues, trade shows, and other events. * Portable posts used to manage lines and queues. ** Fixed posts with decorative ropes, custom printed belts, or metal wires.

Biological thermodynamics may address the question of whether the benefit associated with any particular phenotypic trait is worth the energy investment it requires. History German-British medical doctor and biochemist Hans Krebs' 1957 book Energy Transformations in Living Matter (written with Hans Kornberg) was the first major publication on the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions. In addition, the appendix contained the first-ever published thermodynamic tables, written by Kenneth Burton, to contain equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energy of formations for chemical species, able to calculate biochemical reactions that had not yet occurred. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how biological organisms can develop from disorder. Ilya Prigogine developed methods for the thermodynamic treatment of such systems. He called these systems dissipative systems, because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes that exchange energy between the system and its environment, and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. It may be said that they live in symbiosis with their environment. Energy transformations in biology are dependent primarily on photosynthesis. The total energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants from the solar radiation is about 2 x 1023 joules of energy per year. Annual energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants is about 4% of the total sunlight energy that reaches Earth. The energy transformations in biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents are exceptions; they oxidize sulfur, obtaining their energy via chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis.  The focus of thermodynamics in biology The field of biological thermodynamics is focused on principles of chemical thermodynamics in biology and biochemistry. Principles covered include the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics, Gibbs free energy, statistical thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and on hypotheses of the origin of life. Presently, biological thermodynamics concerns itself with the study of internal biochemical dynamics as: ATP hydrolysis, protein stability, DNA binding, membrane diffusion, enzyme kinetics, and other such essential energy controlled pathways. In terms of thermodynamics, the amount of energy capable of doing work during a chemical reaction is measured quantitatively by the change in the Gibbs free energy. The physical biologist Alfred Lotka attempted to unify the change in the Gibbs free energy with evolutionary theory. = Energy transformation in biological systems = The sun is the primary source of energy for living organisms. Some living organisms like plants need sunlight directly while other organisms like humans can acquire energy from the sun indirectly. There is however evidence that some bacteria can thrive in harsh environments like Antarctica as evidence by the blue-green algae beneath thick layers of ice in the lakes. No matter what the type of living species, all living organisms must capture, transduce, store, and use energy to live. The relationship between the energy of the incoming sunlight and its wavelength or frequency is given by :E = \\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda} = h u, where h is the Planck constant (6.63x10‚àí34Js) and c is the speed of light (2.998x108 m/s). Plants trap this energy from the sunlight and undergo photosynthesis, effectively converting solar energy into chemical energy. To transfer the energy once again, animals will feed on plants and use the energy of digested plant materials to create biological macromolecules. = Thermodynamic Theory of Evolution = The biological evolution may be explained through a thermodynamic theory. The four laws of thermodynamics are used to frame the biological theory behind evolution. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can not be created or destroyed. No life can create energy but must obtain it through its environment. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy can be transformed and that occurs everyday in lifeforms. As organisms take energy from their environment they can transform it into useful energy. This is the foundation of tropic dynamics. The general example is that the open system can be defined as any ecosystem that moves toward maximizing the dispersal of energy. All things strive towards maximum entropy production, which in terms of evolution, occurs in changes in DNA to increase biodiversity. Thus, diversity can be linked to the second law of thermodynamics. Diversity can also be argued to be a diffusion process that diffuses toward a dynamic equilibrium to maximize entropy. Therefore, thermodynamics can explain the direction and rate of evolution along with the direction and rate of succession. Examples First Law of Thermodynamics = The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy; though it can be changed from one form to another, energy can be neither created nor destroyed. From the first law, a principle called Hess's Law arises. Hess‚Äôs Law states that the heat absorbed or evolved in a given reaction must always be constant and independent of the manner in which the reaction takes place. Although some intermediate reactions may be endothermic and others may be exothermic, the total heat exchange is equal to the heat exchange had the process occurred directly. This principle is the basis for the calorimeter, a device used to determine the amount of heat in a chemical reaction. Since all incoming energy enters the body as food and is ultimately oxidized, the total heat production may be estimated by measuring the heat produced by the oxidation of food in a calorimeter. This heat is expressed in kilocalories, which are the common unit of food energy found on nutrition labels.Stacy, Ralph W., David T. Williams, Ralph E. Worden, and Rex O. McMorris. Essentials of Biological and Medical Physics. New York: McGraw-Hill Book, 1955. Print. = Second Law of Thermodynamics = The Second Law of Thermodynamics is concerned primarily with whether or not a given process is possible. The Second Law states that no natural process can occur unless it is accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the universe.Haynie, Donald T. Biological Thermodynamics. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. Print. Stated differently, an isolated system will always tend to disorder. Living organisms are often mistakenly believed to defy the Second Law because they are able to increase their level of organization. To correct this misinterpretation, one must refer simply to the definition of systems and boundaries. A living organism is an open system, able to exchange both matter and energy with its environment. For example, a human being takes in food, breaks it down into its components, and then uses those to build up cells, tissues, ligaments, etc. This process increases order in the body, and thus decreases entropy. However, humans also 1) conduct heat to clothing and other objects they are in contact with, 2) generate convection due to differences in body temperature and the environment, 3) radiate heat into space, 4) consume energy-containing substances (i.e., food), and 5) eliminate waste (e.g., carbon dioxide, water, and other components of breath, urine, feces, sweat, etc.). When taking all these processes into account, the total entropy of the greater system (i.e., the human and her/his environment) increases. When the human ceases to live, none of these processes (1-5) take place, and any interruption in the processes (esp. 4 or 5) will quickly lead to morbidity and/or mortality. = Gibbs Free Energy = In biological systems, in general energy and entropy change together. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to define a state function that accounts for these changes simultaneously. This state function is the Gibbs Free Energy, G. :G = H ‚àí TS where: * H is the enthalpy (SI unit: joule) * T is the temperature (SI unit: kelvin) * S is the entropy (SI unit: joule per kelvin) The change in Gibbs Free Energy can be used to determine whether a given chemical reaction can occur spontaneously. If ‚àÜG is negative, the reaction can occur spontaneously. Likewise, if ‚àÜG is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous.Bergethon, P. R. The Physical Basis of Biochemistry: The Foundations of Molecular Biophysics. New York: Springer, 1998. Print. Chemical reactions can be ‚Äúcoupled‚Äù together if they share intermediates. In this case, the overall Gibbs Free Energy change is simply the sum of the ‚àÜG values for each reaction. Therefore, an unfavorable reaction (positive ‚àÜG1) can be driven by a second, highly favorable reaction (negative ‚àÜG2 where the magnitude of ‚àÜG2 > magnitude of ‚àÜG1). For example, the reaction of glucose with fructose to form sucrose has a ‚àÜG value of +5.5 kcal/mole. Therefore, this reaction will not occur spontaneously. The breakdown of ATP to form ADP and inorganic phosphate has a ‚àÜG value of -7.3 kcal/mole. These two reactions can be coupled together, so that glucose binds with ATP to form glucose-1-phosphate and ADP. The glucose-1-phosphate is then able to bond with fructose yielding sucrose and inorganic phosphate. The ‚àÜG value of the coupled reaction is -1.8 kcal/mole, indicating that the reaction will occur spontaneously. This principle of coupling reactions to alter the change in Gibbs Free Energy is the basic principle behind all enzymatic action in biological organisms.Alberts, Bruce. Essential Cell Biology.

Hunte played 44 Test matches as an opening batsman for the West Indies.  Early life and career  Hunte was born in rural St Andrew Parish in the north of Barbados, the son of a sugar plantation worker. Hunte's family was poor; one of nine children, Hunte grew up in a one-room house. By the time Hunte was six-years-old he was playing cricket with the village boys, using an improvised bat made from palm fronds. Hunte's father was determined that Hunte would receive a good education and so Hunte was required to walk‚Äîbarefoot‚Äîeach day the three miles to Belleplaine Boys School. Hunte showed the first glimpses of his talent, making the school First XI aged 10 where he played with and against boys much bigger and older than himself. Hunte, aged 12, won a scholarship to attend Alleyne Secondary School. His talent was soon noted by the school gamesmaster, who placed him straight into the school First XI, where he played against boys aged up to 18. As an incentive the gamesmaster offered Hunte a shilling every time he made 25 runs. Hunte captained the school team in his last three years. In his final year at school Hunte was asked to play for a new club, the Belleplaine Sports and Social Club. Belleplaine played in the Northern section of the Barbados Cricket League (BCL), which provided organised cricket for poor and rural Barbadians. In 1950 Hunte made the BCL representative team for its annual match against the elite (and socially exclusive) Barbados Cricket Association team. Dropped early in his innings by Test player Denis Atkinson, Hunte went on to make 137‚Äîthe first BCL player to make a century in this annual fixture. Soon after this match Hunte was selected to make his first-class cricket debut for Barbados against Trinidad and Tobago at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. Hunte scored 63 runs in the first innings and followed this with 15 in the second. Hunte was also offered a place with the elite Empire Cricket Club in Division 1 of the Barbados Cricket Association, the home club of his sporting idol Everton Weekes. There was little first-class cricket in the West Indies at the time and Hunte's cricket career was slow to progress. He worked for a time as a school teacher at St. Simon's Mixed School, the Barbados civil service as an Accounts Clerk and later in life insurance. Hunte failed to take his opportunity against the visiting Australians in 1954‚Äì55, scoring a duck and three. It was the following season when Hunte finally showed his ability on a larger stage, scoring 151 and 95 in two matches against a touring team from England managed by E. W. Swanton. In 1956 Hunte moved to England, to study Economics and also looking for a professional contract in English league cricket. He worked at a bus plant and cotton mill in Lancashire before being picked up by Leyland Motors Cricket Club in the Northern League. The next year Hunte was contracted by Enfield Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. The relationship between Hunte and Enfield was a happy one; unlike most professionals who tended to wander, Hunte stayed at the club for six seasons. In 1959, Hunte set a club record for the most runs scored in a season. When Hunte moved to England, he had advised the selectors of the West Indies team that he was available to tour England in 1957 should he be chosen. While waiting for an invitation for the tour, Hunte considered and rejected attempting to become eligible for selection for Kent County Cricket Club in the English County Championship. When no invitation was forthcoming Hunte signed to play with Enfield. Later Hunte was told that the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had sent him a letter, which failed to reach him in Lancashire. After he signed with Enfield received a note from a WICB board member, urging him to state if he wished to be considered for selection. Hunte replied that he was, provided Enfield would agree to release him from his contract. When the squad for the tour was released, Hunte's name was missing. The West Indies soon regretted overlooking Hunte. The two batsman selected ahead of him‚ÄîNyron Asgarali and Andy Ganteaume‚Äîdid not meet with much success in the Test matches. Sir Hunte was only the second West Indian to carry his bat in a Test innings.  Playing career  Hunte did make his Test debut the following winter against Pakistan at his home ground of Kensington Oval. He hit the first two balls that he faced, from Fazal Mahmood, for fours and made 142 runs in his first innings. In the third Test of the same series he made 260, including a partnership of 446 with Garfield Sobers which was then the second- highest partnership in history and is the sixth highestTest records ‚Äì Highest partnerships for any wicket, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 13 March 2009 ‚Äî Sobers went on to make a then world-record 365 not out as the West Indies reached 790 for 3 declared. In the fourth Test of the series, Hunte made another century. He finished his debut series with 622 runs at an average of 77.75, and the West Indies won the series 3‚Äì1. After this successful start, Hunte was the West Indies' regular opening batsman for the next nine years, and vice captain of the team for eight of them. This was a successful period for the West Indies, in which they won seven of the ten series in which he played. Hunte played a major role in West Indies' series win in England in 1963. He curbed his aggressive instincts as a batsman to build a solid platform for the innings. This was rewarded with two crucial centuries. He scored 182 in the first innings of the summer as West Indies won by 10 wickets. Then in the final Test of the summer, the West Indies needed to avoid losing to win the series. They were set 253 to win in the fourth innings, at that time regarded as a difficult target, with over two days to play. But Hunte scored 108 not out as the West Indies won by eight wickets, and won the series 3‚Äì1. Hunte finished the series with a batting average of 58.87, and was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1964. Conrad Hunte's career performance graph. After the tour to England, the captain of the West Indies, Frank Worrell, retired. Hunte expected to be appointed captain in his place, and when Garfield Sobers was chosen instead, he was bitterly disappointed, and for six weeks considered resigning himself. But he chose to continue playing, and in the next series, against Australia in 1965, he scored 550 runs, although without a century: he scored six fifties in ten innings, with a highest score of 89 and an average of 61.11. This was the record for the highest series aggregate without a century until Mike Atherton scored 553 in a six-Test series against Australia in 1993. In total, Hunte played in 44 Tests between 1958 and 1967. Despite having 13 different opening partners in his Test career, he accumulated 3245 runs at an average of 45.06. He scored eight centuries, including at least one against every country he played against.  Life after cricket  Hunte was a committed Christian. The defining experience of his life was when in 1961, on the West Indies' tour of Australia, he saw the film The Crowning Experience, about the life of the black American educator Mary McLeod Bethune. This film was promoted by Moral Re-Armament (MRA), a multi-faith organisation promoting absolute moral and ethical standards of behaviour, to which Hunte committed the remainder of his life. Hunte made no secret of his beliefs. Some reports suggest that the other members of the West Indies team became tired of his constantly expressing them in the dressing room, and that this contributed to his not being awarded the captaincy in 1963. Hunte retired from cricket in 1967, although he could possibly have continued for some more years, to work full-time for MRA, promoting harmonious race relations. He wrote his autobiography, entitled Playing to Win, in 1971. After several years in Britain, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to help with the racial situation there. It was there that he met his wife Patricia, a local newscaster, with whom he had three daughters. In 1991, as apartheid was coming to an end in South Africa, Hunte rang the director of the new United Cricket Board of South Africa, Ali Bacher, and offered to help develop cricket in the black townships and promote reconciliation between the races. He worked as National Development Coach, funded by the MCC, for seven years. In 1998 Hunte was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados.

Early life Rover Thomas was born in 1926 near Gunawaggii, at Well 33 on the Canning Stock Route, in the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia. At the age of 10 Thomas and his family moved to the Kimberley where, as was usual at the time, he began work as a stockman. Later in his life Thomas lived at Turkey Creek. Rover Thomas and his Uncle Paddy Jaminji first started painting dance boards on dismembered tea chests for the Krill Krill ceremony in 1977. In the early 1980s, Rover Thomas started painting ochre on canvas and soon became a pioneer artist of what was later known as the East Kimberley School. Rover Thomas was the inspiration for many East Kimberley artists who followed including Queenie Mckenzie, Freddie Timms and Paddy Bedford Artist Thomas was awarded the John McCaughey Prize in 1990 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Thomas was one of the two Aboriginal Australians to exhibit in the Venice Biennale in 1990, alongside Trevor Nickolls. He was the subject of the important solo exhibition Roads Cross: The Paintings of Rover Thomas, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra in 1994. In 2000, Thomas's work was amongst that of eight individual and collaborative groups of Indigenous Australian artists shown in the prestigious Nicholas Hall at the Hermitage Museum in Russia. The exhibition received a positive reception from Russian critics, one of whom wrote: > This is an exhibition of contemporary art, not in the sense that it was done > recently, but in that it is cased in the mentality, technology and > philosophy of radical art of the most recent times.

Rees taught at the University of British Columbia from 1969‚Äì70 until his retirement in 2011-12, but has since continued his writing and research. His primary interest is in public policy and planning relating to global environmental trends and the ecological conditions for sustainable socioeconomic development. He is the originator of the \\"ecological footprint\\" concept and co-developer of the method. Biographical information William Rees received his PhD degree in population ecology from the University of Toronto. He founded SCARP's '\\"Environment and Resource Planning\\" concentration and from 1994 to 1999 served as director of the School. Rees' book on ecological footprint analysis, Our Ecological Footprint (co-authored with then PhD student Dr Mathis Wackernagel), was published in 1996 and is now available in English, Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, and Spanish. Much of Rees' work is in the realm of ecological economics and human ecology including behavioural and cultural barriers to sustainability. He is best known in these fields for the co- development of ecological footprint analysis with his then PhD student Mathis Wackernagel.Wackernagel, M. (1994), Ecological Footprint and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: A Tool for Planning Toward Sustainability. Ph.D. Thesis, School of Community and Regional Planning. The University of British Columbia. Vancouver, Canada. The ecological footprint is a quantitative tool that estimates humanity's ecological impact on the ecosphere in terms of appropriated ecosystem (land and water) area. This research reveals the fundamental incompatibility between continued material economic growth and ecological security, and has helped to reopen debate on human carrying capacity as a consideration in sustainable development. Academic, policy and research interests Rees is a founding member and recent past-President of the Canadian Society for Ecological Economics. He is also a Fellow at the Post Carbon Institute, a co-investigator in the \\"Global Integrity Project\\" aimed at defining the ecological and political requirements for biodiversity preservation, a founding director of the One Earth Initiative and a Director of the Real Green New Deal project. A dynamic speaker, Rees has been invited to lecture on areas of his expertise across Canada and the US, as well as in Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, the former Soviet Union, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden and the UK. Rees' academic interests are in the following subject matter fields: #Human bio-ecology and the ecological basis of civilization including the role of energy in the expansion/sustainability of the human enterprise. #Ecological economics: Biophysical realities in resource allocation and distribution #Global change and the dynamics of societal collapse. #Why high intelligence (e.g., the capacity for logical thought and reasoning from the evidence) plays so small a role in societal decision-making particularly pertaining to sustainability. University of British Columbia William E. Rees. School of Community and Regional Planning. Philosophy Rees has said that the \\"enlightenment project,\\" rooted as it is in Cartesian dualism, has resulted in a techno- industrial society that sees itself as somehow separate from the biophysical world. This dualism and its expansionary-materialist worldview are the basis of many of the \\"environmental problems\\" facing humankind. Awards and honours Most recently William Rees has received a Dean's Medal of Distinction (UBC Faculty of Applied Science 2016) and the 2015 Herman Daly Award in Ecological Economics (USSEE). In 2012 he was awarded the 2012 Blue Planet Prize (jointly with Dr Mathis Wackernagel), the 2012 Kenneth Boulding Prize in Ecological Economics (ISEE), and an honorary Doctoral Degree, Laval University. Previously he was a recipient of a 2007 Trudeau Fellowship, an annual prize awarded by the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation \\"...in recognition of outstanding achievement, innovative approaches to issues of public policy and commitment to public engagement\\", and in 2006 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC). Rees was a member of the winning team receiving the City of Barcelona 2004 Award (Multimedia Category) for the exhibition Inhabiting the World. In 2000, The Vancouver Sun recognized him as one of British Columbia's top \\"public intellectuals.\\" In 1997, UBC awarded William Rees a Senior Killam Research Prize.

He is the most powerful hero in the WildStorm universe and bears a strong resemblance to DC's Superman.  Publication history  Mr. Majestic was created by H.K. Proger and Jim Lee, first appearing in WildC.A.T.s #11, cover dated June 1994. When Jim Lee was asked why he based Mr. Majestic so much on Superman, he stated that he was tired of seeing so many comic heroes who possessed great power but were too afraid to use it. Mr. Majestic possesses powers similar to those of Superman, but his personality is entirely different. Majestros has more militant views, as he is a Kheran warlord. The difference between the two is further portrayed when Majestros finds himself stuck on Superman's Earth. The two have an interesting conversation about Majestic's no-nonsense, all-business personality and Superman's more subtle approach to things. Subjects they discuss include the fact that Majestic put superhuman villains in prison without giving them a fair trial and getting into bouts with that world's heroes, claiming he finds them dismayingly reticent. Fictional character biography Mr. Majestic, born Majestros on the planet Khera, was a Kherubim warlord. He has two children, Kenesha and Majestrate. Due to widespread infertility among Kherubim, resulting in even fertile women being able to bear only one child, fertile Kherubim deemed compatible would be made to breed, and so Majestros and the Coda warrior Lady Zannah (who would go on to become Zealot, a founding member of the Wildcats) were chosen, and Zannah become pregnant.Wildstorm Winter Special #1 (January 2005) Since Coda warriors would become priestesses if they gave birth, and Zannah wished to remain a warrior, her mother, Harmony, pretended the child, Kenesha, was stillborn, and then claimed to have become pregnant and given birth, passing Kenesha off as her own daughter, Zannah's sister. Only Zannah and Harmony were aware that Kenesha was in fact Zannah's daughter. Majestic was one of the four Kherubim lords trapped on earth during the Kherubim/Daemonite war. It is later revealed that he took his son with him on this journey (see Majestrate below). During the days of the Roman Empire, Majestic became romantically involved with a human woman named Rebecca,WildC.A.T.s #46 (February 1998) his only known relationship with a human, or with anyone since arriving on Earth, since Majestic believes that humans are a lower life form compared to the Kherubim,WildC.A.T.s #25 (December 1995) and that a relationship of any kind would weaken him in his fight against the Daemonites.WildC.A.T.s #28 (April 1996) He spent centuries fighting for justice, eventually revealing his existence to the public, becoming the only known post-human hero for a time,Team One: WildC.A.T.s #1 (July 1995) and went on to join the government-sponsored Team One.Team One: Stormwatch #1 (July 1995) While the team was fighting Lord Helspont and the Cabal, his friend, teammate and fellow Kherubim Yon Kohl (known as the adventurer John Colt), was ambushed by a group of Daemonites.Team One: WildC.A.T.s #2 (September 1995) Colt convinced Majestic to kill him and the Daemonites in order to achieve their mission objective and save New York City from a nuclear attack.WildC.A.T.s #30 (June 1996) This event caused him to seek solitude in the Arctic. At some point, Majestic created a headquarters for himself by hollowing Mount Rushmore and building a base inside it, known as the Rushmore Sanctuary.Mr. Majestic #1 (September 1999) Years after killing John Colt, Savant approached Majestic and asked him to help Zealot in her battle with Tapestry. And thus, Mr. Majestic made his return. After most of the original WildC.A.T.s were sent to Khera and presumed dead, Majestic and Savant formed a new WildC.A.T.s dedicated to performing surgical strikes on the post-human underworld.WildC.A.T.s #32 (January 1997) The team was manipulated by one of their own, Tao, into taking part in a war against post- human criminals, and Majestic appeared to kill Tao,WildC.A.T.s #34 (February 1997) although it would eventually be revealed that it was, in fact, shapeshifter Mr. White, who had been brainwashed into believing he was Tao and assuming his form. Savant and Majestic went on to leave the WildC.A.T.s, and shortly afterwards proceeded to go on an expedition in Peru, accompanied by Savant's best friend Mabel Bligh.Savant Garde #1 (March 1997) The expedition ended up leading Majestic, Savant and Mabel to meet and befriend several post- humans, including Sheba, Cybernary, Met-L and Disperse, forming the short- lived group Savant Garde. Solo series In 2003, Wildstorm published a series called Mr. Majestic. In this series, it is revealed that Majestic did not spend the majority of his time after Team One in solitude, but rather as a government agent taking on paranormal anomalies with the aid of a gifted boy named Desmond. In the issues of this comic, much is revealed about Majestic's time after the Cold War, as his adventures span from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. When he is flung into Metropolis by Daemonite technology, Majestros takes on the alias of Jim McArest (an anagram of \\"Mr. Majestic\\"), as he had suffered amnesia from the interdimensional trip. In 2005, Majestic (with the aid of Superman) returned to the WildStorm universe in an ongoing solo-series titled Majestic. In Mr. Majestic (vol. 1) issue #4, it was revealed that Majestros has a son named Majestrate whom he took along from Khera (although the mother is not mentioned). Majestrate's body did not survive the crash landing, but his mind was preserved in a crystal. Majestic obtained a substance called \\"starstuff\\" from another dimension in order to transfer his son's mind into a new artificial body. The reunion was one of the rare occasions Majestic showed any emotion. The joy that both father and son experienced would, however, be short-lived. The fact that starstuff was in another dimension caused an interdimensional imbalance, an imbalance that tried to correct itself by manifesting in Australia in a man named Freddie Noondyke. It would soon become apparent that for the imbalance to be corrected, the starstuff in Majestrate's body would have to be returned, thus ending the boy's life. Majestic would hear nothing of it at first until his son convinced him that it was the right thing to do. Majestrate flew into the dimensional maelstrom and brought the imbalance to an end. When Majestic flew down, he found the metal skeleton of the artificial body. The result of this loss led to Majestros being in a depressed mood for quite some time. Powers and abilities Majestic possesses immense strength. Majestic is capable of enduring massive damage, such as the explosion of a small nuclear reactor, without sustaining any permanent injuries. He can move many times faster than the speed of sound, and can fly. Majestic can also generate heat beams from his eyes, survive in outer space, has a genius level intellect, possesses micro vision, ice breath, accelerated healing, and invulnerability to conventional weaponry. Majestic's strength and durability vary from appearance to appearance. Majestic also appears to have some powers he uses less frequently, such as the ability to generate energy blasts from his hands that were powerful enough to match Union's own energy blast,Union vol. 2 #4 (May 1994) and telekinesis.WildC.A.T.s #17 (January 1995) Majestros is a genius, able to design and construct highly complex devices within a matter of seconds,WildC.A.T.s #50 (June 1998) analyze a situation and come up with the proper solution, and find weaknesses in enemies. Majestic is also a skilled warrior, especially in the use of bladed weapons. He's a particularly skilled swordsman, having defeated Coda warriors in swordfights.Majestic vol. 2 #9 (November 2005) Majestic did not begin life at these power levels and it is revealed in the Backlash and Wildcore series that he was altered by the alien race known as the D'rahn, who have the power to evolve beings to achieve powerful potentials. Superhumans in the WildStorm Universe are apparently categorized into named \\"classes\\". Some of the most powerful being in the Wildstorm Universe, such as Apollo and The High are considered \\"Majestic-Class superhumans\\", presumably a class based on Majestros himself. Majestic's costume includes, hidden in its shoulderpads, additional equipment that Majestic has used on occasion, including a nanoflage suit, which seems to confer some degree of invisibility; a quantum-folded combat blade, a collapsable sword made by Khera's Shaper's Guild; and a damper capsule, which suppresses all of his powers for three hours and has the side effect of masking his Kherubim aura, hiding him from sensors that are looking for such aura signatures.Majestic vol. 2 #5 (July 2005) In other mediaAnimation= Majestic appears in the Wild C.A.T.s animated series voiced by Rod Wilson. =Miscellaneous= Mister Majestic is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series. In this continuity, Kal-El of Krypton takes on the identity of Mister Majestic, rather than Superman, due to unknown minor differences in his life from the Earth-1 universe. His reality is later invaded by the Monitors, with Mister Majestic being killed early in the invasion. His Earth's Lois Lane and a handful of other survivors are all that remains of their world's population when the Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-1 are accidentally transported there. Superman tries, and fails, to repel the invasion of Majestic's world, with he and Lois escaping moments before the planet's destruction thanks to Majestic's version of Jor-El transporting them to another reality.

It is a derivative of gramicidin, produced by the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D- Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine as well as the atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.  Biosynthesis  Gramicidin S biosynthetic pathway consists of two-enzyme of nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), gramicidin S synthetase I (GrsA) and gramicidin S synthetase II (GrsB), to give a product as a cyclic decapeptide. Within the biosynthetic pathway, there are total of five modules that specifically recognize, activate, and condense the amino acids to gramicidin S. Starting module GrsA consists of three domains: Adenylation (A) domain where it incorporates the amino acid and activates it by adenylation using ATP, Thiolation (T) domain or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) in which the adenylated amino acid gets covalently attached to the 4¬¥-phosphopantetheine group and this gets loaded onto the conserved serine in the T domain, Epimerization (E) domain where it epimerizes L-amino acid to D-amino acid. Starting module GrsA loads D-Phe onto the system. Second enzyme cluster GrsB contains four modules, each containing condensation (C), adenylation (A), and thiolation (T) domains and thioesterase domain (TE) at the end. C domain forms a peptide bond between two amino acids, D-Phe and L-Pro. L-Val, L-Orn, and L-Leu are incorporated sequentially by the next three modules of GrsB. After repeating the whole module synthesis once again, TE domain cyclizes and releases the two peptides and dimerize them together to form the final product. Biosynthetic pathway of gramicidin S  History  Gramicidin S was discovered by Russian microbiologist Georgyi Frantsevitch Gause and his wife Maria Brazhnikova in 1942. Within the year Gramicidin S was being used in Soviet military hospitals to treat infection and eventually found usage at the front lines of combat by 1946. Gause was awarded the Stalin Prize for Medicine for his discovery in 1946. In 1944, Gramicidin S was sent by the Ministry of Health of the USSR to Great Britain via the International Red Cross in a collaborative effort to establish the exact structure. English chemist Richard Synge proved that the compound was an original antibiotic and a polypeptide using paper chromatography. He would later go on to receive the Nobel Prize for his work in chromatography. The crystal structure was finally established by Dorothy Hodgkin and Gerhard Schmidt; Margaret Thatcher worked for a term in 1947 with Gerhard Schmidt on the antibiotic Gramicidin S, as an undergraduate research project. The importance of Gramicidin S and antibiotic research in general was so great that Gause was not persecuted during the period of Lysenkoism in the USSR, while many of his colleagues were. Indeed, it was his need for developing new strains to mass-produce antibiotics that allowed politically sanctioned collaborations with geneticists like Joseph Rapoport and Alexander Malinovsky, who would both actively participate in the downfall of Lysenkoism.  Structure and pharmacological effect  Boc groups on the ornithine as well as methylation of select amide nitrogens to force cyclic conformation. Gramicidin S differs from other gramicidin types in that it is a cationic cyclic decapeptide and has a structure of an anti-parallel beta-sheet. Gramicidin S molecule is amphiphilic, with hydrophobic amino acids (D-Phe, Val, Leu side chains) and charged aminoacid (L-Orn). It exhibits strong antibiotic activity towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive and even several pathogenic fungi. The mode of action is not entirely agreed upon, but it is generally accepted that it is disruption of the lipid membrane and enhancement of the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Unfortunately, being hemolytic at even low concentrations, gramicidin S is only used as topical applications at present. Additionally, Gramicidin S has been employed as a spermicide and therapeutic for genital ulcers caused by sexually transmitted disease.

On his retirement, he served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1826. Early life and ecclesiastical career Beauclerk was born in London on 8 May 1773, the fourth son of Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans and his wife, the former Lady Catherine Ponsonby, daughter of William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, being admitted in 1790 aged 17, graduating M.A. 1792, D.D. 1824. Like other younger sons of the nobility, Beauclerk became a clergyman, being ordained deacon in 1795 and priest in 1797. He was Vicar of Kimpton (1797‚Äì1827), then of Redbourn and St Michael's Church, St Albans (1827‚Äì1850). However, he \\"never allowed his clerical duties to interfere materially with the claims of cricket\\" and \\"his sermons were legendary for their dullness\\".CricInfo ‚Äì Cricket's original sin. Retrieved on 25 May 2010. Cricket career Beauclerk was a right-handed batsman and a right arm slow underarm bowler who was a recognised all-rounder. He generally fielded at slip. His career spanned the 1791 to 1825 seasons. In his prime, his height was and he weighed between . He played at Cambridge University where his talent as an accurate slow bowler was spotted by the Earl of Winchilsea, who invited him to play for MCC.Birley, p.49.

Beauclerk was \\"now but 18 years of age\\". He played two first-class matches in the 1791 season but then was unavailable until the 1795 season while he completed his studies. He then became a regular and prolific player. Having started as a bowler, he developed his batting skills and became better known as a hard- hitting batsman, but remained a genuine all-rounder.

Retrieved on 26 July 2009. In 1810, Beauclerk and Thomas Howard were due to play George Osbaldeston and William Lambert in a lucrative single wicket match. Osbaldeston was taken ill just before the match and Beauclerk flatly refused to postpone it, saying: \\"Play or pay\\". Lambert had to play on his own but he was a canny professional who was well aware of Beauclerk's weakness: his uncontrollable temper. By deliberately bowling wide, Lambert caused Beauclerk to lose both his temper and his wicket with the result that Lambert won the match by 15 runs.Altham, p.56. The humiliated and vindictive Beauclerk would have his revenge on Osbaldeston and Lambert in years to come but first he used his influence at MCC to secure a change in the Laws of Cricket so that wide balls were for the first time banned in 1811.Birley, p.57. In 1817, Beauclerk played in a highly controversial match at Nottingham in which he captained an All-England team while Osbaldeston and Lambert were given men for Nottingham.Bowen, p.82. Accusations of match-fixing were made by both sides and Beauclerk was able to produce witnesses who implicated Lambert. As a result, MCC banned Lambert from ever playing again at Lord's Cricket Ground.Birley, p.61. Osbaldeston's turn came in 1818 after he too lost his temper when beaten at single wicket by George Brown of Sussex. Osbaldeston was so angry that he resigned his MCC membership. Later, he repented and asked to be reinstated but Beauclerk refused his application. Beauclerk persuaded MCC to call a meeting to ban roundarm bowling in 1822 even though he had been known to claim wagers when playing alongside the early roundarmers like John Willes. According to Lord Harris: \\"When he (Willes) played on the side of Lord Frederick his bowling was fair, when against him, the contrary\\".Birley, p.64. Beauclerk was the second president of MCC in 1826, playing for its team in minor matches while in office. Thereafter, he was a regular attendee at Lord's to watch matches and was occasionally involved in them as a patron.Birley, p.76. A \\"persistent symbol of insensitive autocracy long after his retirement\\", he was invariably accompanied by a \\"nasty, yapping dog\\" whereas the rule for everyone else was: \\"No dogs allowed\\".Birley, p.87. Style and technique Beauclerk was one of the best single wicket players of his time. His batting style was \\"rather scientific, in the more orthodox manner of the professionals\\", while his under-arm bowling was very slow, but extremely accurate and he could get the ball to rise abruptly off a length.CricInfo ‚Äì profile. Retrieved on 26 July 2009. Although his batting style was described as scientific, Beauclerk was also impulsive as \\"he sometimes lost his wicket by trying to cut straight balls\\". He was a hard-hitting batsman with fine strokeplay, \\"especially to the off\\". He improved his batsmanship by modelling himself on William Beldham, but he lacked the latter's natural flair.Birley, p.51. Beauclerk was an astute tactician and it has been recorded that he carefully studied opposing batsmen with the ability to quickly understand their strengths and weaknesses so that he could set his field accordingly. Beauclerk wore a white beaver hat when playing, the remainder of his outfit being a white shirt, nankeen breeches, a scarlet sash and white stockings.Altham, p.54. He once threw his hat down on the pitch in frustration at his inability to dismiss the obdurate batsman Tom Walker, known as \\"Old Everlasting\\". Beauclerk called Walker a \\"confounded old beast\\" but, when Walker was asked about it afterwards, he shrugged and said: \\"I don't care what he says\\".Birley, p.50. Personality Beauclerk was one of the most controversial figures in cricket history.Mallett, p.52. His approach to the game was well summarised in a verse written by a contemporary: > My Lord he comes next, and will make you all stare > With his little tricks, a long way from fair. Much that is hagiography exists about cricketers but \\"an unqualified eulogy of Beauclerk has never been seen and that is significant\\". Although he was a cleric and ostensibly against gambling, he estimated that he made up to ¬£600 a year from playing cricket, which at the time was funded mostly by gambling. But Beauclerk as a vicar was \\"completely devoid of Christian charity\\". In this vein, Rowland Bowen likened him to Talleyrand as \\"a cleric without, it would seem, the faintest interest in being a clergyman or any kind of Christian\\".Bowen, p.81. Beauclerk has been described as \\"an unmitigated scoundrel\\". Among the quotations about him is one that he was a \\"foul-mouthed, dishonest man who was one of the most hated figures in society ... he bought and sold matches as though they were lots at an auction\\". Another described him as \\"cruel, unforgiving, cantankerous and bitter\\". In an early example of gamesmanship, he is said to have occasionally suspended an expensive gold watch from the middle stump whilst batting, the inference being that his batting was sound enough, or the bowling bad enough, for it to remain unscathed.Nell Gwynn: Mistress to a King, p.378. Sadly, there is no record of how many watches he lost in this fashion. When he died in 1850, his unpopularity was such that The Times did not give him an obituary. Family and personal life Beauclerk was the fourth son and fifth child of the 5th Duke of St Albans, and thus descended from Charles II and Nell Gwyn.Altham, p.54.

Off the Rails, 2nd edition (Charleston, Booksurge, LLC, 2006, pp. 86) November 18, 1950) is a Cuban born American hard rock/heavy metal bassist. Sarzo remains best known for his work with Quiet Riot, Ozzy Osbourne, and Whitesnake, and has also played with several well known heavy metal and hard rock acts including Manic Eden, Dio, Blue √ñyster Cult, Geoff Tate's Queensr√øche and Devil City Angels. He is currently the bass player for The Guess Who.http://www.theguesswho.com/band/ Early life Sarzo was born in Havana, Cuba on November 18, 1950. He emigrated to the United States in 1961, and was raised in Florida. His brother, Robert, is also a musician. Music careerQuiet Riot= Upon arriving in Los Angeles in August 1977, Sarzo happened upon a Quiet Riot show at the Starwood after being turned away from a sold-out Van Halen show at the nearby Whisky a Go Go. He recalled the show being \\"quite ambitious for a club band\\", and after the show he bumped into vocalist Kevin DuBrow and the two formed a friendship. Struggling financially, Sarzo moved to New Jersey in the fall of 1977 to join his brother Robert in a Top-40 band called A New Taste. While in New Jersey in the summer of 1978, Sarzo received a phone call from DuBrow asking him if he'd like to fly to Los Angeles and audition for Quiet Riot. He landed in LA the next day, rehearsed with the band and was offered the job, which he accepted.Sarzo, Rudy (2017). Off the Rails (third edition). CreateSpace Publishing. Though he is pictured on the cover of the band's 1978 album Quiet Riot II, the bass parts were actually played by Kelly Garni, the man Sarzo replaced. Shortly after joining Quiet Riot, Sarzo began teaching bass guitar at Musonia music school at the request of bandmate Randy Rhoads. The pair became disillusioned by Quiet Riot's inability to land an American recording contract (their albums had been released in Japan only at that point), and Rhoads soon left the band after accepting an offer to form a new band with ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Quiet Riot played a farewell show at the Starwood on October 2, 1979, after which Rhoads left for England to write songs with Osbourne. With Quiet Riot officially disbanded, Sarzo joined a band called Private Army with drummer and longtime friend Frankie Banali. =Ozzy Osbourne= From March 1981 to September 1982, Sarzo rose to fame as the bassist of Osbourne's band, having been recruited on Rhoads' recommendation. His playing can be heard on Osbourne's Speak of the Devil and Tribute live albums. The liner notes of Osbourne's 1981 studio album Diary of a Madman list Sarzo as the bassist, though Bob Daisley actually played bass on the recordings.Diary of a Madman (album) Following Rhoads' death in a plane crash in 1982, Sarzo became disillusioned with Osbourne's heavy drinking and began questioning his future in the band without Rhoads. While still a member of Osbourne's band, Sarzo had been helping his former band Quiet Riot by recording the Randy Rhoads' tribute song \\"Thunderbird\\" for their upcoming Metal Health album as a means of coping with his grief. In stark contrast to the chaos surrounding everyday life on the road with the hard-drinking Osbourne, the experience was so positive that Sarzo ended up recording most of the Metal Health album with his former band and he made the decision to officially rejoin Quiet Riot once the Diary of a Madman tour had concluded. =Rejoining Quiet Riot= Released in March 1983, Metal Health would go on to become a multi-platinum international hit, kickstarting an era of wild commercial popularity for heavy metal in the 1980s. After Sarzo had left Osbourne's band, a serious rift developed between the two, primarily the result of Quiet Riot vocalist Kevin DuBrow's persistent criticism of Osbourne in the heavy metal press. Months later when Osbourne and Quiet Riot found themselves on the same bill at the 1983 US Festival, Osbourne flew into a drunken rage upon seeing Sarzo, punching him in the face before being hauled away by security. Sarzo later reconciled with the Osbourne camp after leaving Quiet Riot in 1985. Sarzo was a member of Quiet Riot during the peak of the band's success, and he appeared in numerous MTV videos and was voted 1983's Top Bassist by the readers of Circus magazine./index.cfm Sarzo profile on website of successful audio equipment manufacturer Peavey Sarzo remained with Quiet Riot from September 1982 to January 1985, when friction caused by vocalist DuBrow's constant slagging of rival bands in the press convinced him to leave the band. =Post-Quiet Riot= After leaving Quiet Riot, Sarzo formed M.A.R.S. with former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate Tommy Aldridge, with whom Sarzo maintained a close friendship. From April 1987 to September 1994, both Sarzo and Aldridge were members of Whitesnake before lead singer David Coverdale put the band on indefinite hiatus. In the early 1990s, Sarzo decided to put together his own band, Sun King, recruiting vocalist Keith St. John (later to join Medicine Wheel, Burning Rain and Montrose) and future Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie guitarist, John Lowery. Even though signed to Giant Records, the band was eventually dropped without releasing an album and Sarzo abandoned the project. In 1992, Sarzo had an uncredited role as a bass player for the fictional band Exorcist on the Tales from the Crypt episode \\"On A Deadman's Chest\\". Sarzo would rejoin Quiet Riot on multiple occasions, and recorded albums with them in 1999 and 2001. In February 2004, Sarzo joined Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force for the U.S. 30 city \\"Attack Tour\\". He then joined Dio later in 2004. In 2007, Sarzo joined Blue √ñyster Cult, replacing Richie Castellano as the band's bassist who became the band's guitarist/keyboard player, initially as a guest musician before officially taking the role. He remained with Blue √ñyster Cult until 2012.http://ultimateclassicrock.com/blue-oyster-cult-bassist-rudy-sarzo- announces-departure/ He also serves as a counselor for Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp.

Book In 2006, Sarzo wrote a book entitled Off the Rails, a biographical account of his time in Ozzy Osbourne's band in the early 1980s. It centers mainly on his memories of the influential young guitarist Randy Rhoads, a close friend who died in a 1982 plane crash during the Diary of a Madman American tour. Technical career Sarzo is also an avid computer digital animator. When not touring or recording, he is a 3D technical director and co- executive producer at Ocean Visual FX in Southern California. Sarzo has demonstrated computer animation software at major tradeshows, such as demonstrating Acid, Sony Vegas and DVD Architect software at the Sony Pictures booth during the 2004 Winter NAMM Show. He released the Acid for Non Linear Editors training DVD, directed by Douglas Spotted Eagle, for the VASST training series, and created the \\"Working Man's Bass\\" loop library exclusively for Sony Pictures' Acid Software. He created the concert 3D animated opening for the video wall used during a European tour by Dio.

Plot The plot concerns Michael, a professional violinist, who never forgot his love for Julia, a pianist he met as a student in Vienna. They meet again after a decade, and conduct a secret affair, though she is married and has one child. Their musical careers are affected by this affair and the knowledge that Julia is going deaf. A recurring element throughout the plot is the pair's performance of Beethoven's Piano Trio Opus 1 No.3, which they first perform in their college days. Inspiration Seth credits his then-partner, the French violinist Philippe Honor√©, as inspiring him with the idea for An Equal Music in an acrostic Onegin stanza on Honor√©'s name in the epigraph: > : Perhaps this could have stayed unstated. : Had our words turned to other > things : In the grey park, the rain abated, : Life would have quickened > other strings. : I list your gifts in this creation: : Pen, paper, ink and > inspiration, : Peace to the heart with touch or word, : Ease to the soul > with note and chord. : How did that walk, those winter hours, : Occasion > this? No lightning came; : Nor did I sense, when touched by flame, : Our > story lit with borrowed powers ‚Äì : Rather, by what our spirits burned, : > Embered in words, to us returned.. Seth together with Philippe Honor√© marketed a double CD of the music mentioned in An Equal Music, performed by Honor√©.. Reception The book was especially well received by musical fans, who noted the accuracy of Seth's descriptions of music. Paolo Isotta, one of Italy's most significant music critics, wrote in the influential newspaper Il Corriere della Sera of the Italian translation that no European writer had ever shown such a knowledge of European classical music, nor had any European novel before managed to convey the psychology, the technical abilities, even the human potentialities of those who practise music for a living.. Works referenced Several musical works figure prominently in An Equal Music. Among these are the Trout Quintet by Franz Schubert, the String Quintet in C minor by Ludwig van Beethoven, and The Lark Ascending by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Early fame Traor√© first came to prominence in the early 1960s. He had taught himself to play guitar and developed a unique style that blended American blues music, Arab music, and pentatonic structures found in West Africa's Mande cultural region. He was a superstar in Mali and a symbol of the newly independent country (see History of Mali). His songs were immensely popular and he enjoyed regular radio play. However, he made no recordings, and since there were no royalties paid to musicians, he was very poor and had to work odd jobs to make ends meet. Decline and revival In 1968, when Moussa Traor√© overthrew Malian president Modibo Ke√Øta, Boubacar Traor√©, widely seen as an artist associated with the previous regime, disappeared from the airwaves. During the 1970s Traor√©'s popularity faded, until a surprise television appearance in 1987. Soon after this \\"rediscovery,\\" Boubacar's wife died during childbirth. Grief-stricken, he moved to France and did construction work to support his six children. While there, a British record producer discovered a tape of one of Traor√©'s radio performances, and he was finally signed to a record deal. His first album, Mariama, was released in 1990. Since then, Traor√© has enjoyed international popularity, touring Europe, Africa, and North America. Boubacar figures in the book Mali Blues (Lonely Planet, Australia), by Belgian writer Lieve Joris. The book inspired Swiss film director Jacques Sarasin for the 2001 film Je chanterai pour toi (\\"I'll Sing For You\\") about Boubacar, released on DVD in 2005. Along with several blues artists, he appeared in the film Blues Road Movie (Au Coeur du Blues) by Louis Mouchet (2001). Boubacar then released Kongo Magni (Marabi, 2005), produced by Christian Mousset, director of the Festival Musiques M√©tisses d'Angoul√™me (Angoul√™me Cross-Cultural Music Festival), who would also produce his Mali Denhou (Lusafrica, 2010). Kar Kar made up for lost time with acclaimed live performances around Europe and then the United States and Canada.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1962 to 1970 for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Tartabull is well remembered by Red Sox fans for throwing out the Chicago White Sox' Ken Berry at home plate on August 27, 1967, to win a key game during the 1967 American League pennant drive. In the bottom of the ninth inning with Boston leading 4‚Äì3 with one out at Comiskey Park, in the first of two scheduled that day, the contending White Sox had the fleet Berry at third base with one out. Pinch hitter Duane Josephson lofted a fly ball to Tartabull in medium right field ‚Äî a probable sacrifice fly that would have tied the game. Tartabull was not known for a strong arm, but his throw, though high, arrived in time to beat Berry to home plate, where Red Sox catcher Elston Howard made the catch while blocking the plate, then swept a tag on Berry to end the game.retrosheet.org The Red Sox would win the AL championship by a single game on the final day of the season. The play is the subject of a novel, Tartabull's Throw, by Henry Garfield, published by Simon & Schuster in 2001. Tartabull also was known for his speed and was always a threat to steal on the basepaths. In 749 games over nine major league seasons, Tartabull posted a .261 batting average (484-for-1857) scoring 247 runs, with two home runs and 107 RBI. A good outfielder, he recorded a .986 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions, committing only 14 errors in 980 total chances. Tartabull was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba.

[...] But nothing happens without a lesson to offer, or without opening other routes into the future. *Hatred [...] is dislike and antipathy inflamed to a high degree and inspired by beliefs which stimulate a set of other emotions in the hater, chief among them fear, ignorance, jealousy, anger and disgust. But note that all these emotions, and especially the first three, are about the hater; thus hating says more about haters than what they hate. It shows weakness, for it is a crude emotion which turns fears and anxieties outward to fix them on something else. *What underlies talk of virginity is a profound and often hidden moral angst about purity and pollution--and therefore also sentiments of temptation and desire. If our religions had decided that ears or wisdom teeth were spiritually significant, we should feel the same anxieties regarding them as with the hymen; and moral concern would be devoted to them instead.

A starting pitcher, Terrell pitched from 1982 to 1992 for the New York Mets (1982‚Äì1984), Detroit Tigers (1985‚Äì1988), San Diego Padres (1989), New York Yankees (1989), Pittsburgh Pirates (1990), and the Tigers (1990‚Äì1992). Career In 1979, Terrell played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He posted a 9-4 record with a 2.20 ERA and 13 complete games. Terrell set the league record for innings pitched in a season, and was named the league's outstanding pitcher. Terrell was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2007. On April 1, 1982, the Mets traded outfielder Lee Mazzilli to the Texas Rangers for minor league pitchers Ron Darling and Terrell. On August 6, 1983, Terrell hit a two-run home run off future Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs in the third inning, then another two-run homer the very next inning. Jenkins shut down the rest of the offense, but lost the game 4-1. Later that same month, Terrell had another three hits, including a three-run home run. In five years as a hitter, Terrell logged only three home runs and ten runs batted in but all three home runs and seven of the ten RBI came in a seventeen-day span. Against the California Angels at Tiger Stadium on August 20, 1986, Terrell had a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth by a Wally Joyner double. It was the only hit he would allow in a 3-0 Tiger victory. He also surrendered the first of Mark McGwire's 583 home runs on August 25, 1986. Terrell had a career-best 17 wins during the Tigers drive to the 1987 American League East pennant. Terrell finished with a career mark of 111-124 in 321 games, with a 4.22 all-time ERA. He struck out 929 in 1,986.2 innings pitched. Although a weak hitting pitcher, posting a .120 batting average (23-for-192) with 3 home runs and 10 RBI, Terrell was an above average fielding pitcher. He recorded a .980 fielding percentage with only 10 errors in 489 total chances and started 38 double plays. Personal life Terrell was born in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and attended Morehead State University, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He had several children.

It is a church of the Anglican (Sheng Kung Hui) Province of Hong Kong and in the Diocese of Western Kowloon.History of St Andrew's Church It is the oldest English speaking Protestant church in Kowloon. While St Andrew's commenced its life as a church for the expatriate community, it is now an international church with 90% of those attending considering Hong Kong as their home. Sunday Services Sunday services are currently held at 8:30am, 9:30am, 11:30am and 5:00pm in English, and at 11:30pm in Putonghua (Mandarin). The Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) is administered at the 8:30am service every Sunday. At all other services, it is administered on the second and fourth Sundays. Check the official website for the latest information. History The idea of building an Anglican church in Kowloon was first suggested in 1897 but no progress was made until 1904, when Sir Catchick Paul Chater financed the construction. The chosen site was next to a large garden area owned by Sir Paul, covering the area between Robinson Road (now Nathan Road) and Austin Road. The church was designed by Alfred Bryer of Messrs. Leigh & Orange. Work began in November 1904 and was completed in 1906.Antiquities and Monuments Office: Brief Information on Proposed Grade 1 Items. Item #42.. The church was consecrated on 6 October 1906.2006\\\\. St Andrews Church Centenary Celebration commemorative booklet The Old Vicarage was finished in 1909. In 1913, a close relationship began with the Diocesan Girls' School, which moved to 1 Jordan Road. The war years from 1914 to 1918 were difficult for the church because many of its members came from the military bases on Kowloon and had to leave for duty elsewhere. The church was barely able to survive financially. From 1942 to 1944, the congregation of All Saints Mong Kok used St Andrew's for services as their church was used as a rice store. They were allowed back to All Saints in late 1944 and took much of the furniture from St Andrew's with them, saving it from destruction when the main church building was turned into a Shinto shrine early in 1945. The church organised its first Sunday school in 1947. The Lych Gate and steps were added in 1954 to mark the 50th anniversary of the laying of the church foundation stone. In 1978, St Andrew's Christian Centre (a 6-storey building that includes apartments, offices and a hall) was opened. St Andrew's Church planted Resurrection Church (Sai Kung) in 1983 and Shatin Church in 1990. In 1997, St Andrew's held special services on the Sunday before the handover of Hong Kong to China. The morning service ‚ÄúOur Transition and Hope‚Äù was broadcast on the BBC World Service. In the evening there was a reconciliation service with local Chinese churches. In 2006, the centenary refurbishment of the church received an Award of Merit from the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation. The church was praised for \\"a thorough conservation approach which sought to fully understand the building's significance and deterioration process before proposing solutions\\".UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation: 2006 Awards Entries for Culture Heritage Conservation: China In 2009, the church launched its ‚Äú2020Vision‚Äù which led to the construction of the \\"Life Centre\\", a new building at the foot of the hill, facing onto Nathan Road. Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2015. The Life Centre houses a large auditorium and multi-purpose rooms, with a landscaped garden above. The design won a Merit Award from the American Institute of Architects Hong Kong Chapter in 2011.2013\\\\. St Andrew‚Äôs Church Building on our Heritage brochure. Architectural Style The church was designed by the architects Leigh & Orange in the Victorian Gothic style. It is built of red brick and granite, laid on rammed earth foundations. The bricks on the external walls are exposed and pointed with a lime-based mortar. Interior walls are rendered with raised mortar joints and painted to represent the underlying brick pattern. The stained glass in the altar and baptismal windows is the original glass, dating from 1906, made by William Morris & Co of Westminster, London. More contemporary Art Nouveau style coloured glass was installed later in the West window and upper nave windows. To commemorate the church's centenary, two pictorial coloured glass windows were installed in the transepts. The church's bell tower used to have a tall spire which eventually had to be removed due to repeated structural damage from typhoons. The bells are the original carillon of 8 bronze tubular bells from Harrington's of Coventry, England, installed in 1906. Other heritage buildings in the church compound include the two-storey Old Vicarage built in 1909, the Amahs‚Äô Quarters and Verger's Cottage, built at around the same period. All three buildings are constructed in red brick with granite detailing.

Construction on the fort began during the War of 1812 and was completed in 1822.Weaver, pp. 140-141 The fort, originally named Fort Diamond after its shape, was renamed in 1823 to celebrate the Marquis de La Fayette, a hero of the American Revolution who would soon commence a grand tour of the United States.Fort Lafayette at FortWiki.com The fort was demolished in 1960 to make room for the Verrazano- Narrows Bridge; the Brooklyn-side bridge tower now occupies the fort's former foundation site.Roberts, pp. 563-564 Construction Fort Lafayette in Harper's Bazaar magazine Fort Lafayette was in the form of a square set on end, hence its first name of Fort Diamond. It held approximately 72 cannon (references vary) in three tiers, two in casemates and one in barbette mountings on the roof. The design allowed all the cannon in the southwest front to engage enemy ships entering the Narrows, with the northwest front also engaging if ships passed the fort. The fort was designed at the very end of the second system of US fortifications, and is not fully characteristic of either the second system or the third system. The fort was built of sandstone and brick. The fort was, however, vulnerable to bombardment from Brooklyn, and Fort Hamilton was built circa 1830 to prevent this.

He was arrested on 13 September 1861 by U.S. Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks on the direct orders of General George B. McClellan, enforcing the policy of President Abraham Lincoln. The basis of his arrest was for writing a critical editorial in his newspaper on Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and the fact that the Lincoln administration had declared martial law in Baltimore and imprisoned numerous persons without due process, including George William Brown, mayor of Baltimore, Congressman Henry May, the police commissioners of Baltimore, and the entire city council.

He played his entire career in Major League Baseball (1986‚Äì1996) as the second baseman for the San Francisco Giants. During the Giants' resurgence in the late 1980s, he was known as a team leader who played the game with a gritty determination. Thompson most recently served as the bench coach for the Seattle Mariners, for the 2011 through 2013 seasons.  Early life  Thompson was born in West Palm Beach, Florida. He attended Forest Hill Community High School in West Palm Beach, where he played high school baseball for the Forest Hill Falcons. Thompson received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in 1983 where he played for coach Jack Rhine's Florida Gators baseball team. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, and decided to forgo his remaining NCAA eligibility. In 1985, while playing for the Shreveport Captains in the Texas League, he posted a .261 batting average along with 9 home runs and was named to the league All-Star team.  MLB playing career  Thompson made his major league debut with the Giants on April 8, 1986, at the age of 24. In June, he became the first player in major league history to be caught stealing four times in one game (three occurred during attempted hit and run plays). Despite his rocky start, Thompson ended the season with a .271 batting average as the Giants leadoff hitter and provided steady defense. He won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and finished second to Todd Worrell in the 1986 National League Rookie of the Year Award. Thompson had to undergo surgery at the end of the season to have cartilage removed from his right knee. Thompson continued to perform well defensively in 1987, teaming up with Giants shortstop Jos√© Uribe to form one of the best double play combinations in baseball, and helped the Giants lead the major leagues with 183 double plays. The Giants clinched the National League Western Division title by six games over the Cincinnati Reds. In the 1987 National League Championship Series, Thompson played in pain with a bulging disc but still played well defensively helping the Giants set a playoff record with 10 double plays. He also hit 1 home run and had 2 runs batted in as the Giants were defeated by the St. Louis Cardinals in a seven- game series. In 1988, Thompson was hitting above .300 at mid-season to earn a spot as a reserve on the 1988 National League All-Star team. Unfortunately, he was once again plagued by an injury and had to miss the game due to a pinched nerve in his leg. Brett Butler took over as the Giants leadoff hitter and Thompson, as the new number two hitter in the batting order, struggled to make contact, striking out 111 times and ending the year with a .264 average. In 1989, Thompson's batting average dropped to .241. However, he led the National League with 11 triples and scored a career-high 91 runs while hitting ahead of Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell in the batting order. The Giants once again won the Western Division crown and faced the Chicago Cubs in the 1989 National League Championship Series. Thompson hit 2 home runs in the series including a game-winning two-run home run in Game 3 as the Giants went on to win the series in five games. Thompson was held to only one hit in the 1989 World Series against the Oakland Athletics as the Giants were swept in four straight games. Thompson's best year statistically was in 1993 when he was hitting for a .325 average at mid-season to earn his second All-Star selection; however, a leg injury would once again force him to miss the game. The Giants had a nine- game lead on August 11 but faltered in September and were caught by the Atlanta Braves, though by no fault of Thompson, who increased his offensive output late in the season including a period in August where he hit home runs in five consecutive games. With 10 games left in the season on September 24, Thompson suffered a broken cheek bone when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Trevor Hoffman of the San Diego Padres. He missed 8 games due to the injury, but with the Giants and Braves tied for first place Thompson returned to play the final game of the season. Despite his determination, playing with a bloodshot eye and wearing a clear plastic mask in the field, the Giants lost the National League West on the last day of the season. Thompson ended the season with career highs in batting average (.312), doubles (30), home runs (19) and runs batted in (65). Although Thompson was one of the best fielding second basemen in the National League, he was often overlooked in post-season awards because his playing career coincided with that of Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Ryne Sandberg. By 1993, Sandberg was past his prime and Thompson finally received recognition when he won the Gold Glove Award for fielding excellence and the Silver Slugger Award, which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position. He was rewarded by the Giants in November when he signed a three-year contract for $12 million, making him the second-highest paid second baseman in baseball after Ryne Sandberg. During spring training in 1994, Thompson received a scare when he was hit on the left ear flap of his batting helmet by pitcher Mike Harkey of the Colorado Rockies. Thompson later stated the two beanings by Hoffman and Harkey were on his mind when he batted during games.Kurkjian, Tim. \\"Missing Persons\\". www.sportsillustrated.cnn.com. June 6, 1994Harding, Thomas. \\"Giants Hunt Heads, Bag Win\\". Gazette, The (Colorado Springs). June 28, 2000. In May, he went onto the disabled list and missed almost two months of the season. He returned in late June, but played in only seven games before undergoing surgery on his right shoulder and missed the rest of the season. Thompson's injuries continued to hamper his playing time in 1995 and in September he had to undergo surgery again, this time on his left shoulder. He returned to play in 1996 but injuries continued to take their toll as he appeared in only 63 games. Thompson played his last major league game on September 22, 1996, at the age of 34. Thompson was known for the well-used baseball glove with which he played for almost his entire career. He was offended when the San Francisco Chronicle printed a story titled, \\"Thompson's Ugly, Pathetic Glove is a Gem.\\" His teammate, Rich Aurilia, who played at shortstop next to Thompson near the end of his career said, \\"I think by the time Robby was done, the glove mainly consisted of pine tar and chew spit. I don't even know how much leather was left in it. I know for a fact Robby still has that glove.\\"  Career statistics  In an eleven-year major league career Thompson played in 1,304 games, accumulating 1,187 hits in 4,612 at bats for a .257 career batting average along with 119 home runs, 458 runs batted in and a .329 on-base percentage. He led the National League in triples in 1989 with 11 and he finished his career with a .983 fielding percentage. Thompson led National League second basemen in double plays for three consecutive seasons from to . He hit for the cycle in a game on April 22, 1991. A two-time All-Star, Thompson was the recipient of one Gold Glove Award and one Silver Slugger Award. He won the Willie Mac Award in 1991, honoring his spirit and leadership. At the time of his retirement, Thompson was the all-time leader among Giants second basemen in games (1,304), at bats (4,612), runs (671), hits (1,187), doubles (238), triples (39), home runs (119), runs batted in (458), stolen bases (103), fielding percentage (.983) and double plays (873).  Coaching career  Thompson served as the Giants first base coach in 2000 and 2001. He was hired by the Cleveland Indians as a first base coach in December 2001. In 2003, he was promoted to special assistant to the Cleveland Indians' general manager before returning to the field in June 2005 as the Indians' bench coach.

At first he was very successful; he drove out the Polyperchon‚Äôs garrisons from all the cities of the peninsula, except Sicyon and Corinth, which, were held by Polyperchon himself; but having joined with Medius in an attempt to relieve Oreus, to which Cassander had laid siege, they were defeated, with the loss of several ships.

It operates passenger excursion trains along a line between Heber City and Vivian Park, which is located in Provo Canyon. The HVRX carries over 110,000 passengers a year. The railroad line is approximately long. A typical round trip ride on the train takes about 3 hours. There are a total of four passing sidings outside of the Heber yard limit. Notable landmarks seen from the train include Mount Timpanogos, Cascade Mountain, Deer Creek Dam and Reservoir, Provo River, Sundance Ski Resort, Tate Barn, and Soldier Hollow. A variety of wildlife including deer, eagles, fox, moose, turkeys, hawks, mountain lions (cougars), and beavers, have all been seen from the train as well. Equipment The Heber Valley Railroad has two 1907 Baldwin 2-8-0 Consolidation-type steam locomotives: former Union Pacific No. 618 and ex- Great Western No. 75, although they are both out of service pending completion of their 1,472 day inspections and service. Also on display is former Columbia Steel Company 0-6-0 No. 300 built by Baldwin in the 1920s. The HVRX is home to four EMD diesel-electric locomotives: Ex-Union Pacific EMD NW2 No. 1011, Ex- Union Pacific EMD NW2 No. 1043, Ex-Union Pacific EMD GP-9 No. 296, and Ex- USATC EMD MRS-1 No. 1813. As well as Ex-United States Army Transportation Corps Baldwin (rebuilt with a Caterpillar prime mover) RS-4-TC-1 number 4028. It also has a former United States Army Davenport 44-ton diesel-electric locomotive No. 1218, which is very similar to a GE 44-ton switcher. In 2018, the railroad purchased 3 GP9's which are numbers 52, 72, and 77 from New England's Pan Am Railway. With the arrival of the GP9s, the Heber Valley‚Äôs former U.S. Army MRS-1 will be retired. In 2019 the railroad purchased the National Railway Historical Society British Columbia chapter collection including a former VIA FP9ARM #6300 which is currently waiting shipment to Utah. History Denver & Rio Grande Western in 1956 The line operated by the HVRX was formerly part of a Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad branch line that connected Heber City to Provo, Utah. The branch line was completed in 1899 and operated freight and passenger service until the line's abandonment in 1967. The line was saved for tourist use and was reopened in 1970 when No. 618 and other equipment was brought up the line from Provo. The track between Provo and Vivian Park was later removed and converted into a recreational trail. During the 1970s and 1980s the railroad operated as the \\"Heber Creeper\\". In the late 1980s this railroad went out of business. Citizens in the Heber area successfully petitioned the State of Utah to help save the railroad, leading to creation of the Heber Valley Historic Railroad Authority in the early 1990s. Since this time the railroad has seen considerable growth. The railroad operates as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. During the 2002 Winter Olympics the railroad was part of the Olympic Steam Team, carrying spectators to the Soldier Hollow Olympic venue. The railroad's No. 618 and 75 steam-engines, were joined by the Nevada Northern Railway Museum's No. 93 steam-engine, in pulling eight-car trains full of passengers, to the Soldier Hollow depot where they disembarked and continued to the venue entrance on a horse-drawn sleigh. The day prior to the Opening Ceremony of the games, all three locomotives were combined into one triple-headed train, and used to transport the Olympic flame from Soldier Hollow to Heber City as part of the torch relay. Current operations The railroad's main depot is located in Heber City. Other passenger terminals are located at Soldier Hollow (near Midway, Utah) and Vivian Park. The railroad operates year-round, and features special event and evening train rides. Among its named trains are the Provo Canyon Limited, a three-hour round trip excursion to Vivian Park and the shorter Deer Creek Express to Deer Creek Reservoir. The railroad can be seen from various points along U.S. Highway 189 between Heber City and Vivian Park and the whistle can be heard throughout the valley. Locomotive No. 618 was used in the 2006 film, Outlaw Trail: The Treasure of Butch Cassidy. The locomotive, 100 years old as of July, 2007, ran from 2008-2010 in limited capacity and was then taken out of service for a 1,472-day inspection and major overhaul, as required to meet Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) safety standards. The non-profit railroad raised the $750,000 required for the project to give #618 another 30 years of service. Its restoration, including conversion from coal to oil burning, is expected to be completed in 2020. #75 has been out of service undergoing restoration since 2003.

A first baseman, he played on five teams for 15 years, from 1947 through 1961. He was known by his middle name, Earl, and his nickname was \\"The Earl of Snohomish\\", a nickname originally owned by baseball hall of famer, Earl Averill, also from Torgeson's hometown. In 1950, Torgeson led the National League (NL) with 120 runs scored and in 1957, he led the American League (AL) with a .999 fielding average as a first baseman. Early years and baseball Torgeson was born in the lumber town of Snohomish, Washington on New Year's Day of 1924. He attended Snohomish High School and he served in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. After the war, he played for Seattle in the Pacific Coast League. Major League baseball Torgeson's had a lifetime .265 batting average with 149 home runs, 740 RBI and a .989 fielding percentage. His best batting average for a full season was .290 and his highest home run total was 24. His career on-base percentage was .385 (the league average for the years he played is .339) and in , when he led the National League with 120 runs scored, his on-base percentage was .412. Most years that he played over 100 games, he was in the league's top 10 for drawing base on balls (walks). His peak years for drawing walks were and , when he drew 119 and 102 walks respectively. In 1959, he helped the White Sox win the American League Pennant. In one game in 1959, during an inning against Kansas City where the White Sox scored 11 runs on one hit, he got a pinch-hit walk. In , the only two National League regulars at first base to outpace him in home run totals were Ted Kluszewski, with 25 home runs, and Gil Hodges, with 32 home runs. Torgeson's 23 home runs that year were far ahead of the other first basemen in the league. Eddie Waitkus of league champion Philadelphia had 2; Tookie Gilbert of New York had 4; Preston Ward of Chicago had 6; Johnny Hopp of Pittsburgh had 8; and Rocky Nelson of St. Louis had only 1. Torgeson was a regular player for 9 years, and he would have been a regular in 1949 if not for a shoulder injury in May and broken thumb in August 1949 (also a broken rib when hit by a pitch in 1950). He played another five years as a role player. As a pinch hitter, as per earlier in his career, his batting eye was key to his value. Even when his hits were few, he still got on base. In , for example, playing out the string for the New York Yankees, he hit only .111 in 18 at-bats, but drew 8 walks for a .385 on-base percentage. Torgeson also deserves some mention for his base stealing. Although his highest total for a baseball season was only 20, it came during a period in baseball when almost no one stole bases, especially not first basemen. For the short period (1950‚Äì1952) that they had Sam Jethroe (who won bases stealing crowns in and ) and Torgeson, the Braves had the best base stealing tandem in baseball. In , with a combined total of 50 stolen bases, the Jethroe-Torgeson duo stole more bases than every other team in the National League, except for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Personal life and death Torgeson returned to Snohomish County and served as a county commissioner and later the director of the county Department of Enerency Management. He died of leukemia in Everett, Washington on November 8, 1990. He was 66 years old.

He began his career in with the San Francisco Giants, and also played for the Seattle Mariners, Montreal Expos, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Milwaukee Brewers. CareerSan Francisco Giants= Torres is best known for starting the last game of the 1993 season for the Giants, when he gave up three runs over 3‚Öì innings to the arch-rival Los Angeles Dodgers. The Giants, winners of 103 games that season, finished in second place behind the 104-win Atlanta Braves, at that time in the National League West division. Though he was then in his first month as a Major Leaguer, some Giants fans blamed Torres for ruining a promising season and apparently never forgave him; those fans continued to heckle him when he returned to San Francisco as an opposing player. Said Torres: \\"They come to the park and they pay my salary, so they have the right to heckle me. If that's going to make them feel better and get over what happened in 1993, OK. But it's time to move on.... I don't think I was treated fairly by some of my teammates. And I still don't think I'm being treated fairly by the fans.\\" =Mariners and Expos and first retirement= The Giants traded Torres to the Seattle Mariners in mid-1995 for Shawn Estes and Wilson Delgado. After two years with the Mariners, he was claimed off waivers by the Montreal Expos in mid-1997. After ending the season with a 9.82 ERA, Torres retired and returned to the Dominican Republic to coach for the Expos' Dominican Summer League team. =Comeback with Pirates= In , Torres decided to make a comeback, and spent the year playing in the Dominican Winter League and in South Korea. He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in January , spending most of the year with the Triple-A team in Nashville before being called up in September. He split the season between starting and relief work before being moved to the bullpen full-time in . During an April 2003 game for the Pirates, Torres hit Sammy Sosa in the head with an errant fastball that shattered his helmet. He served as the Pirates setup reliever in , before closer Mike Gonz√°lez was injured. That year, his 94 pitching appearances led the major leagues and tied the Pirates record held by Kent Tekulve. Gonz√°lez was traded to the Atlanta Braves before the start of the season, making Torres the Pirates' top choice for closer entering the 2007 season. After blowing four saves for the Pirates, he was demoted from the closer role and replaced with Matt Capps. =Milwaukee Brewers= Torres was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on December 7, 2007, for Kevin Roberts and Marino Salas. After beginning the season as a middle reliever, Torres was moved into the closer's role when √âric Gagn√© was put on the disabled list, a role Torres kept for the rest of the year. Torres struggled mightily towards the end of the season, however. On September 18, Torres blew a 4-run lead to the Chicago Cubs, giving up 4 runs with two outs and nobody on in the bottom of the 9th. He posted an ERA over 8.00 in the month of September. His season, though, was relatively solid: 28 saves in 35 chances, 51 strikeouts in 80 innings of work, an ERA of 3.41, and a record of 7-5. During his time in Milwaukee, he introduced a new strike-out pitch in which he dropped down to a side-arm delivery. During the middle of the 2008 season, Torres stated in an interview that he wasn't sure about his future in baseball, and on November 11 Torres told Brewers GM Doug Melvin that he was retiring from the game. Personal life Torres is a Jehovah's Witness. He is married to Belkis Denia Donato and has two daughters and a son; Ashley (18), Allison (16), and Jordan (12).

As the Phillies' catcher, Triandos caught Bunning's perfect game against the New York Mets on June 21, 1964, thus becoming the first catcher in Major League history to catch no hitters in both the American and National Leagues. His contract was purchased by the Houston Astros from the Philadelphia Phillies on June 14, 1965. He played in his final major league game at the age of 34 before being released by the Astros on August 20, 1965. Career statistics In a 13-year major league career, Triandos played in 1,206 games, accumulating 954 hits in 3,907 at bats for a .244 career batting average along with 167 home runs, 608 runs batted in and a .322 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage in 992 games as a catcher and, a .988 fielding percentage in 168 games as a first baseman. Triandos led American League catchers twice in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. In 1957, he threw out 66.7% of the base runners trying to steal a base, the third highest single-season ratio in Major League history.CS% Seasons at The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers Over his career, Triandos threw out 46.62% of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, ranking him 6th on the all-time list.100 Best Caught Stealing Totals at The Encyclopedia of Catchers Triandos was elected to the American League All- Star team for three consecutive years, in 1957, 1958 and 1959. His 142 home runs hit as an Oriole player ranks him 13th highest in the team's history. In 1961, the reigning American League stolen base champion, Luis Aparicio, rated Triandos just below Earl Battey as the toughest catcher on which to attempt a stolen base. Personal life Triandos's family origins are from Koroni, Messenia, Greece.Baseball Acropolis He was one of four children of Peter Triandos and Helen Mourgos, Greek immigrants to the U.S. He and wife Evelyn had three children, son Gary Triandos and daughters Lori Luna and Tracey Hook. Triandos served as a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1973 to 1975. In later years, he lived in San Jose, California. Triandos Drive in Timonium, Maryland is named in honor of the popular catcher.\\"Catching Up With Gus Triandos\\", The Toy Department (The Baltimore Sun sports blog), Tuesday, May 5, 2009 ReferencesExternal links *Gus Triandos at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Gus Triandos at Baseball Almanac *Gus Triandos at Baseball Gauge *Gus Triandos at Astros Daily * Klingaman, Mike. \\"Catching Up With Gus Triandos\\", The Toy Department (The Baltimore Sun sports blog), Tuesday, May 5, 2009 * \\"Gus Triandos Looks Back on his Catching Career\\", Baseball Digest, June 1997 Category:1930 births Category:2013 deaths Category:American League All- Stars Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Amsterdam Rugmakers players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Binghamton Triplets players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers scouts Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:New York Yankees players Category:Norfolk Tars players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Saint Mary's Gaels baseball players Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:Sportspeople from San Jose, California Category:Twin Falls Cowboys players Category:Burials at Oak Hill Memorial Park ","title":"Gus Triandos"},{"id":"2747977","text":"is a stratovolcano located in ≈åsaki, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The volcano consists of a 7 km wide caldera with several lava domes. The summit of the 461 m high Mt. Kurumigatake is one of the four lava domes located in the center of the caldera. The volcano is well known because of its relationship to the Naruko Hot Springs Villages. However, its lack of well-defined features makes it difficult to recognize for a casual observer. The Japan Metrological Agency considers Naruko to be an active volcano. The Naruko volcano was formed through two pyroclastic flows, which occurred 73,000 and 45,000 years ago. The first lava domes were formed approximately 20,000 years ago. The rocks produced by the pyroclastic flows and lava domes vary in composition, but are generally dacitic. Subsequent volcanic activity continued to create more lava domes, while also resulting in explosive eruptions that destroyed such domes. Tephra created by an explosive eruption approximately 18,000 years ago is said to be related to the formation of Katanuma lake. The lake is located in the center of the volcano, and is known as one of the most acidic lakes in Japan, with a pH around 1.6. The only known historical eruption of the volcano is recorded in the Shoku Nihon K≈çki. According to the document, \\"In 837, the Naruko volcano suddenly began to tremble for several days and finally exploded, spouting hot water which ran like a river. The people were surprised and reported this event to the imperial court, which enshrined a hot spring god.\\" This event is believed to be a relatively small phreatic eruption that resulted in the collapse of a lava dome.

He batted and threw right-handed. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Trucks posted a 177‚Äì135 win-loss record with 1,534 strikeouts and a 3.39 ERA in 2,682.2 innings pitched over a 17-year career. Trucks was a two-time All- Star and a two-time league leader in shutouts. In 1952, Trucks became the third major leaguer to throw two no-hitters in a season. After his playing career, Trucks coached for several years in the major leagues. At the time of his death in March 2013, he was one of the oldest living former major league players. Career The Detroit Tigers signed Trucks as an amateur in 1938. In his first pro season, Trucks set a minor league record with 418 strikeouts. He also threw four no-hitters in the minors. He debuted with the Tigers in the fall of 1941. Trucks missed two seasons due to military service in World War II and was discharged from the Navy less than two weeks before his start in the second game of the 1945 World Series. Because of the circumstances, the leagues waived the rule requiring players to have been on the team's roster by September 1 to qualify for post-season play. He defeated the Chicago Cubs in that game. At the time of his death, he was the last living pitcher to face the Cubs in a World Series game. The only other pitcher to win a post-season game without winning a regular season game is Chris Carpenter of the 2012 St. Louis Cardinals. In 1949, Trucks was selected for the MLB All-Star Game and he led the league in shutouts and strikeouts. In 1952, despite a 5‚Äì19 record, Trucks became just the third major league pitcher to hurl two no-hitters in one season (three others have since matched the feat). He won both no-hitters by a score of 1-0, beating the Washington Senators on May 15 and the New York Yankees on August 25. In the 1953 season, Trucks recorded a 20-10 record, 149 strikeouts and a 2.93 ERA; he finished fifth in AL MVP voting. He had been traded early that season from the St. Louis Browns to the Chicago White Sox, becoming one of a small number of pitchers traded during a 20-win season. He earned his second All-Star distinction in 1954, a year in which he led the AL in shutouts for a second time. Along with his two no-hitters in his major league career, Trucks has also thrown four one-hitters and four two-hitters. =Coaching= After retiring as a player, Trucks joined the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Pirates, winning the 1960 World Series with them against his old team, the Yankees. He continued coaching with the Pirates, then coached the Atlanta Braves and ended his MLB career with the Tigers in 1974. Personal life Trucks was the uncle of Butch Trucks, a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band.

Guns. It is their only album to feature singer Chris Van Dahl and the first to feature bass guitarist Johnny Crypt. This album continues the increase in heaviness by the band started on their previous album Vicious Circle. The band was very influenced by Pantera during this time. The band re-branded themselves \\"The L.A. Guns\\", at the time of the release of American Hardcore, adding 'the' before its name. According to Steve Riley, this was done to note the change in direction from the band's classic Phil Lewis Personnel. Also according to Riley, the band was a five- piece and bassist Kelly Nickels was still very much part of the band during the recording of American Hardcore. Nickels even received co-writing credit on eight of the 12 tracks; but quit the band once they were dropped from PolyGram. Second guitarist Johnny Crypt then switched over to bass following Nickels' departure, and the band remained a four-piece. The opening track F.N.A. was intended to sound like a disc skipping, and is rumored to be a portion of their cover song \\"Black Sabbath\\" - available on the Japanese import version of the album - simply played backwards. A hidden track can be found following an extended break at the 17 minute mark of the final track \\"I am Alive.\\" The track features an exchange between a couple of prison guards discussing the pending execution of an inmate. According to Van Dahl, he did all the voices in one straight take. Atomic Punks singer Ralph Saenz was recruited to replace Van Dahl after he was fired in 1997 to finish out the last couple months of the tour. The band, with Saenz, would still perform several of the songs from American Hardcore, including \\"Give.\\" Saenz would subsequently stay with the band to record the Wasted EP in 1998.

There is also an aggressive mood that involves omission of the negative verb ' while implying its meaning with a swear word.Eero Voutilainen. . Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus, 2008. The words often have old origins and some have Pagan roots that after Christian influence were turned from names of deities and spirits to profanity and used as such. Etymologies are a mixture of religious words and ancient Finnish words involving excretions or sexual organs or functions. Nowadays few Finns know of the origins and intended original use of the words. A book called ' (\\"The great dictionary of profanities\\") has been compiled.Jari Tammi, '. WSOY, 1993. The people in the neighbouring countries to Finland often consider Finnish swear words harsher than their own, and even use heavily mispronounced versions of them, most notably perkele. Native Finns tend to consider the harshness exaggerated, while others use it to their advantage. Finns swear more than their Nordic neighbors or Central Europeans, reaching the same level as Scots or Russians. Euphemistically, virtually any word can be used in place of profanity by for example preceding it with ' like (an interjection meaning \\"oh!\\", for example ' \\"oh shit!\\") or adding viek√∂√∂n (third person singular imperative of the verb ' \\"to take\\", for example ' \\"may the goblin take it\\"). These were more prominent in older Finnish, e.g. ' is closest to \\"corpse\\" or like ' \\"the beast\\". There are also other similar non-offensive constructs like ' (\\"tallow candles of heaven\\"). There is also an inventory of non-offensive curse words. List of Finnish profanitieshelvetti= : Helvetti translates to hell and has roughly the same meaning in the English language. It has its roots in the Swedish word helvete, with the same meaning (underworld punishment).H√§kkinen, Kaisa. Suomen kielen etymologinen sanakirja. WSOY, 2009. An often used phrase is \\"What the hell?\\", in Finnish \\"Mit√§ helvetti√§?\\". For an augmentative expression, both in a positive or negative sense, helvetin can be prefixed into an adjective, e.g. helvetin hyv√§ \\"hellishly good\\". A pejorative meaning can be achieved by using the same helvetin (\\"of hell\\") in front of a noun, e.g. helvetin bussi oli my√∂h√§ss√§ \\"the damned bus was late\\". Some words used to replace it, depending on dialect, include helkutti, helvata, hemmetti, hemskutti, himputti, helkkari and himskatti. Derivative terms: helvetillinen (\\"infernal\\"). =hitto, hiisi= : Hitto is a relatively mild swear word, but still considered an expletive. A hiisi is a scary mythical creature such as a giant, troll or devil, or its dwelling such as a sacred grove, burial site and on the other hand, hell. The word has a Germanic etymology, either from *sidon \\"side or direction\\" (in English, \\"side\\"), or *xitha \\"cave, hollow, crag\\" (Swedish: ide, \\"bear's nest\\"). Its diminutive form is \\"hittolainen\\", and the ancient pagan deity Hittavainen is related. The word is in the same category as other \\"mild\\" swear words like \\"helkkari\\" or \\"himskatti\\". Painu hiiteen means \\"go to hell\\", while hiisi viek√∂√∂n is \\"may the devil take it!\\". Hitto is usually translated Damn (it). One of the funniest forms of using hitto word could be hitto soikoon, \\"may the hitto chime\\", and may be similar to the English phrase \\"Hell's bells\\". =huora= : The word means whore, and like the English word which has the same etymology may be considered too profane for civil conversation, to be replaced by seksinmyyj√§ \\"sex worker\\" in the literal meaning. Although it can be used to call someone names, it is not used as a swear word on its own (cf. Spanish or Polish). =jumalauta= : This is a combination of two words: jumala, meaning god, and auta, meaning help (verb, imperative 2nd person). It is used in a similar fashion to Oh my God/God help (me)! In Finnish it has the same slightly frustrated emphasis. Another translation for Oh, God is Voi luoja (luoja = the creator, a synonym for God). An ad campaign for Church aid for third world countries used JumalAuta as an eyecatcher. This raised discussion for being too profane. The English expression God help me is an accurate (and literal) translation of jumalauta. However, since this lacks the undertones of profanity, a translation to goddamn it may be considered more correct. Often used replacement words are jumankauta, jumaliste or jumalavita. =kikkeli= : A word for \\"penis\\" often used by children, usually literally, considered somewhat profane. Comparable to \\"willy\\" or \\"dingaling\\". Pronounced /kikkeli/. =kusi= : Kusi, pronounced , means \\"urine\\" with a similar connotation to \\"piss\\". By itself it refers to actual urine and is considered only mildly offensive in colloquial language. The etymology is traced up to Proto-Uralic, the earliest known protolanguage of Finnish, thus having cognates in other Uralic languages, such as h√∫gy in Hungarian language. It is used by people in compound words, such as \\"kusip√§√§\\" (pisshead, common translation of \\"asshole\\"), as very offensive insults. Inoffensive synonyms are the clinical term virtsa (\\"urine\\") and the childish pissa (\\"pee\\"). The word pissa has drifted so far into everyday usage that in combined form pissapoika (pissing boy) it refers specifically to the squirter on the windshield of cars. Foreign visitors have been amused by the product \\"Superpiss\\" for windshield wiper fluid. Derivative terms: kusettaa (jotakuta) \\"to defraud, to cheat (someone)\\", similar in meaning as \\"to bullshit (someone)\\", kusettaa (in passive mood) \\"feel an urge to urinate\\" (these differ by case government: the former is always accompanied by a subject in the partitive case), kusinen \\"shitty\\" or \\"stained with piss\\" (e.g. kusinen paikka \\"up shit creek\\"), juosten kustu literally \\"pissed while running\\", meaning half-assed, hastily done, shoddy, incompetent work, and kustu muroihin \\"pissed in cereal\\", referring to a disservice, an act that hurts someone or the common benefit. = kyrp√§ = : Literally \\"cock\\" in the sense of \\"penis\\"; often considered highly offensive. The word nearly always refers to an actual penis and may be used, for example, to express frustration: Voi kyrp√§! \\"Oh fuck!\\". The widespread verb vituttaa \\"to feel angry and depressed\\" originates from its meaning \\"to want vagina\\". Therefore, classically, heterosexual women should not use vituttaa, but kyrpi√§, e.g. kyrpii \\"this makes me feel bad\\". One form of using the word is \\"kyrp√§ otsassa\\", which means that someone really pisses you off being an annoying person or total moron (or dickhead). Therefore, that annoying person is the one having \\"kyrp√§ otsassa\\". The literal meaning is \\"to have a dick on the forehead\\". = mulkku = : Has the literal meaning \\"penis\\", but may refer, like English \\"prick\\", to an unpleasant man, both as a noun and as an adjective. When referring to a man, it is nowadays sometimes combined with Swedish surname ending -qvist, to form mulqvist or mulkvisti, which is considered less harsh than mulkku. In some dialects word mulkku is pronounced with an extra /u/ sound (epenthetic vowel), i.e. mulukku. =molo= : Usually used only literally for \\"penis\\", somewhat profane. Has a derivation molop√§√§, corresponding to English \\"dickhead\\". =muna= : Literally means \\"egg\\" and may refer to a literal penis, but is not considered an insult or particularly profane. For example, there is a gay cruise named Munaristeily, which is publicly marketed as such. It also means \\"testicle\\", usually said in plural form munat \\"testicles\\". Olla munaa can mean either being courageous or just obscene, to \\"have balls\\". =paska= : Paska translates as \\"shit\\" or \\"crap\\" and has approximately the same context in English and Finnish, although it may be more profane. It has the same connotations of \\"shoddy\\" or \\"broken\\", which may even surpass the word's use in the original sense in frequency. Inoffensive synonyms are kakka (\\"poo\\"), especially with children, and the clinical uloste (\\"excrement\\"). Uloste appears to have been introduced as a high-class replacement in the 1800s, while paska is believed to have been in continuous use since at least the Proto-Finnic of 3000 BC. Doubt and disbelief are expressed with hevonpaska (\\"horse's shit\\", compare \\"bullshit\\") and paskan marjat (\\"shit's berries\\"). It can be combined with vittu as in \\"Vittu t√§t√§ paskaa\\" (\\"fuck this shit\\"). A Finnish rock musician goes by the name, and Paskahousu (\\"shitpants\\") is a card game, a relative of Shithead that's popular with children and teenagers. Derivative terms: paskiainen \\"bastard\\" (or \\"son of a bitch\\"), paskamainen \\"unfair, depressing, unpleasant, shitty\\", paskainen \\"(literally) shitty\\", paskap√§√§ \\"(literally) shithead\\". =perkele= : Perkele () devil, was originally imported from Baltic languages, supposedly transformed from the Baltic god of thunder (compare: , , Prussian: Perk≈´ns, Yotvingian: Parkuns), as an alternate name for the thunder god of Finnish paganism, Ukko, and co- opted by the Christian church. In an early translation of The Bible to Finnish, the word was stated to be a word for the devil, thus making it a sin to be uttered. However, later, in 1992 translation, the word is switched to paholainen. Perkele or Ukko was known as the rain and thundergod, similar to Thor of Norse mythology. The \\"r\\" can be rolled and lengthened, which can be transcribed by repeating it. :The word is very common in the country and likely the best known expletive abroad, and enjoys a kind of emblematic status. For instance, the Finnish black metal band Impaled Nazarene named its 1994 patriotic album Suomi Finland Perkele (using the word as a reference to Finnishness, not to the devil) and the more conventional M. A. Numminen released a 1971 album known as Perkele! Lauluja Suomesta (\\"Perkele! Songs from Finland\\"). When used to express discontent or frustration, perkele often suggests that the speaker is determined to solve the problem, even if it will be difficult. It is associated with sisu, which in turn is an iconic Finnish trait. Professor Kulonen has described perkele as being ingrained in the older generations, as opposed to kyrp√§ and vittu for the younger ones. A common and milder replacement word is perhana, and less popular variations include perkules, perskuta, ' and perkeleiss√∂n. The word has lent itself to a Swedish expression for Finnish business management practices, \\"management by perkele\\". Derivative terms: perkeleellinen \\"infernal\\", perkel√∂ity√§ \\"to escalate\\". =perse= : Perse (\\"ass\\") can be used either literally or as a semi-strong swear word. It is often found in expressions like \\"T√§m√§ on perseest√§\\" (\\"This (situation) is from the ass!\\" or \\"This sucks!\\") The similarities with the Latin phrase \\"per se\\", the Hungarian \\"persze\\" (which means \\"of course\\", comes from the aforementioned Latin and is pronounced mostly the same way), the hero Perseus and the ancient city of Persepolis are purely coincidental, although the wide use of \\"persze\\" in spoken Hungarian could sound somewhat embarrassing to Finnish visitors. Derivative terms: perseet (olalla), literally \\"to have one's arse up on one's shoulders\\", that is, \\"drunk\\". =pillu= : Pillu translates to \\"pussy\\" in the sense of female genitalia and, although it is not used as an oath, it is profane and unsuitable in all but the most familiar and informal conversation. Non-profane synonyms for the literal meaning include r√∂mps√§, tavara (lit. \\"stuff\\"), toosa (actually an oldish dialectical name with Swedish origin for a little box, container, \\"dosa\\"; it can also refer to televisions, electronics or machinery), pimppi, pimpsa, tuhero, tussu. The phrase tuhannen pillun p√§reiksi (\\"into shingles for thousand pussies\\") is similar or like the English saying \\"blown to smithereens\\", i.e. broken into thousands of pieces. It exhibits the tendency for alliteration in Finnish expressions. A pillunp√§re (\\"pussy shingle\\") is a wood shingle used as a disposable bench cover in saunas. ' (\\"give pussy\\") means that a woman agrees to sexual intercourse with a man, and ' (\\"get some pussy\\") means that a man gets permission from a woman to have intercourse with her. =piru= : Piru, meaning devil, is not always considered a swearword but sometimes used in a similar fashion to the word damn: \\"Piru viek√∂√∂n\\" (lit. \\"let (the) Devil take (it)\\"). A more proper word for devil is paholainen. The derivative word pirullinen (\\"devilish\\", \\"diabolical\\") is used as in English; piruuttaan is roughly equivalent to \\"just for kicks\\", but the literal meaning \\"out of one's devilishness\\" is a more accurate translation. =reva= : Reva is another reference to the female genitalia, akin to vittu. It is also used to refer to backside (\\"perse\\" or ass). However, it is not an actual swearword but carries a notion of vulgarity. The former chairman of Finnish Parliament, Mrs. Riitta Uosukainen used the word in her controversial autobiography Liehuva liekinvarsi, where she described herself in the sexual encounters between her and Mr. Topi Uosukainen as rintaa, reitt√§ ja rev√§√§ (\\"[I was nothing but]... breasts, thighs and quim.\\") Reva is also used occasionally in reference to buttocks and can therefore also be translated as \\"arse\\". A loose translation for ' is \\"Top class arse\\". =runkata= : Runkata (verb) is an informal and profane word that means \\"to masturbate\\". \\"Runkata\\", and the agent runkkari or runkku (\\"wanker\\", \\"jerk-off\\") are highly offensive words and rarely used outside of direct insults, most often combined with other swearwords. When used by itself, its meaning is normally more literal. =ry√∂k√§le= : Scoundrel. A curse word specific to the older generation, now considered non- offensive. =Saatana= : Saatana means quite literally Satan, but used in a similar fashion to helvetti. Often used less crude replacement words for it are saamari, samperi and saakeli. Along with \\"perkele\\", \\"vittu\\" and \\"jumalauta\\", this is one of the most classic and most used words in Finnish. Often used together with helvetti as saatanan helvetti. The derivative term saatanallinen (\\"satanic\\") is used in context as in English. Finnish group The Dudesons, in their version of Jackass: The Movie, declared Saatana and Perkele to be the most common things heard on the show, Perkele being Satan's grandfather. =skeida= : Skeida (skay-dah) is Helsinki slang for \\"shit\\". Because of its newer origin, it is considered less profane than paska, although still not exactly a nice word to say. Skeida can be used as a profane insult (t√§√§ on t√§ytt√§ skeidaa \\"this is full of shit\\") but unlike paska, it is not used as an exclamation or a curse by itself. Although the word is fairly well known in Helsinki, people from outside the capital area might not understand it. Skeida is also used to mean garbage or trash. =vittu= : Vittu () is an ancient word for the female genitalia but now has the literal meaning of \\"cunt\\". Linguistically, it is used similarily to how 'fuck' is used in English to add force to a statement or express frustration. Often considered extremely profane, its usage is nowadays not only limited to teenager slang, but is often used as an emphasis in a forceful or frustrated utterance or expression, as in mit√§ vittua? \\"what the fuck?\\". Other common phrases with vittu include voi vittu (\\"Oh fuck\\"), (ja) vitut! (\\"The fuck you say!\\" / \\"Bullshit!\\", lit. \\"(and) cunts\\"); haista vittu (\\"fuck you!\\", lit. \\"(go) smell (a) cunt\\"; painu (hevon) vittuun (\\"fuck off\\", lit. \\"go crawl up a (horse's) cunt\\"); olla naama norsun vitulla, (lit. \\"to have one's face like the elephant's cunt\\", meaning to be sour and unfriendly). : Entire sentences can be constructed using these combinations \\"Vittu, vituttaa niin vitusti\\" (Fuck this, I'm so fucking pissed off) etc. Occasionally, one hears more colorful constructions, such as Vittujen kev√§t ja kyrpien takatalvi! (paraphrased, \\"Holy fucking shit!\\" or literally \\"The spring of cunts and the cold spell of dicks!\\"). Notably, vittu is also used as an energetic mood, as in \\"vitun iso\\" (\\"fucking big\\") or \\"M√§ meen vittu sinne\\" (\\"I'm (really) fucking going there\\") or to declare a negative outcome, as in meni vituiksi (\\"(smth.) was fucked up\\"). Similar-sounding euphemistic replacements include hitto (see above), vitsi (\\"joke\\") or hitsi. Also kettu (\\"fox\\"), vattu (\\"raspberry\\") and pottu (potato) are often used as replacement words due to their rhyming with vittu. Several verbs and adjectives have also been derived from vittu: vituttaa technically means \\"to want/need some cunt\\", though the meaning of it is actually something like \\"to feel angry and depressed\\", vittuuntua \\"to get angry\\", vittumainen an adjective for \\"annoying\\". In more polite conversation these derivations can be done from the euphemism kettu: ketuttaa, kettumainen etc. The other euphemisms mentioned above cannot be used to form such derivations. Vittu is commonly combined with other profanities, as in vittusaatana and vittuperkele.

History The site now occupied by the Queen Elizabeth II Centre was previously occupied by several buildings. At the northern end of the site were the headquarters of the Stationery Office which had originally been the \\"Parliamentary Mews\\" built in 1825 by Decimus Burton and converted in 1853-5. The southern side was occupied by the Westminster Hospital built by W & H W Inwood in 1831-4 and expanded later that century and in 1924. The previous buildings became surplus to requirements in 1950 and were demolished; designs were drawn up by Thomas Tait for building a new Colonial Office on the site; however only the foundations had been built by the time progress was halted in 1952.Simon Bradley and Nikolaus Pevsner, \\"London 6: Westminster\\" (The Buildings of England), Yale University Press, 2003, p. 272-3. Design In 1958 it was decided that there would be an open space on the southern edge of the site by Broad Sanctuary, and an architectural competition for a conference hall and government offices was held in 1961. The competition was won by William Whitfield but the scheme was not executed due to the plans for redeveloping Whitehall drawn up by Leslie Martin in 1965. The site remained in limbo until a feasibility study for the conference centre was drawn up in 1975. The centre as eventually built was designed by Powell Moya & Partners and constructed by Bovis ConstructionJohn Taylor & Sons, Page 100 with work starting in 1981; it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986. Operation The Centre is owned by HM Government and its operation is conducted by an executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government. It has 32 versatile \\"empty box\\" style rooms which are suitable for a range of events. It specialises in events for between 40 and 1,300 delegates. It also has 2,000 square metres of exhibition space. The Centre is a very successful venue hosting over 400 meetings each year and returning an annual dividend to the Exchequer, thus not reliant on the taxpayer for financial support.

Watts Jr. (born May 5, 1939) is an American retired professional wrestler, promoter and former American football player. Watts garnered fame under his \\"Cowboy\\" gimmick in his wrestling career, and then as a tough, no- nonsense promoter in the Mid-South United States, which grew to become the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). In 1992, Watts was the Executive Vice President of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) but after clashes with management over a number of issues, as well as feeling pressure from Hank Aaron over a racially insensitive interview, he resigned. He was subsequently replaced by Ole Anderson. In 1995, Watts briefly worked as a booker for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In 2009, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Football career Watts played as a linebacker for his high school football team, the Putnam City Pirates. Bud Wilkinson recruited him to play for the Oklahoma Sooners, where he played as a guard during his sophomore and junior years. However, his junior year was marred by a near fatal car accident involving him and his mother, resulting in him going into a coma. When he came out, he had lost a significant amount of weight, and had to put it back on, despite the coaches at the time preferring their players to be small and quick, which Watts had struggled with before the accident. Former Sooners teammate Wahoo McDaniel (then of the Houston Oilers of the AFL), introduced him to professional wrestling for the first time, something McDaniel did in the off-season. Watts turned professional in 1961 and joined the Oilers, but did not last long there, and according to a shoot interview, he left after knocking out a coach. Through McDaniel's friendship with defensive coach Bob Griffin, Watts played for the Indianapolis Warriors of the United Football League, while also being able to wrestle for NWA Indianapolis. Watts then had a try-out with the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL), but after a discussion with general manager Jim Finks, who wanted him to quit his wrestling career, Watts left the Vikings having decided he could make more money back in Oklahoma. Professional wrestling career Watts in 1968 As a professional wrestler, he famously feuded with WWF Champion Bruno Sammartino, but was unable to win the title. In the 1960s, he wrestled in many areas, such as San Francisco, Chicago, St. Louis, and even Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). During these periods, Watts challenged for both the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and American Wrestling Association (AWA) versions of the World Title. =Booking career=Mid-South Wrestling / Universal Wrestling Federation (1979‚Äì1987) Watts is perhaps even more famous for being a pioneering promoter in the Mid-South area of the United States, with his base of operation being in the Shreveport, Louisiana area. His promotion was known as Mid-South Wrestling. He is often credited with creating the current and popular \\"episodic\\" style of TV wrestling, building solid creative storylines week-on-week, with an emphasis on solid in-ring action with dependable wrestlers like \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams, The Junkyard Dog, Ted DiBiase and Jim Duggan. He is an outspoken critic on breaking kayfabe and \\"smart\\" wrestling fans. A Watts-run promotion always had face and heel wrestlers dress in different locker rooms and to have faces and heels not meet publicly. He has also been known to revamp his booking plans in order to protect the business from such fans. After losing over half a million dollars, Watts sold the UWF to NWA Mid-Atlantic's Jim Crockett Promotions, who kept many of their stars, such as Sting. Instead of having UWF as a separate organization, Crockett sent his mid-card wrestlers to the UWF and had them quickly win their titles. Eventually, the UWF folded, and Crockett would be bought out by Ted Turner in 1988. In April 1989, after firing George Scott, WCW offered Watts the chance to book, but he declined the offer and WCW instead decided to go with a booking committee, which included Ric Flair, Kevin Sullivan, Eddie Gilbert, Jim Ross, Jim Cornette and Jim Herd. World Championship Wrestling (1992‚Äì1993) Watts became Executive Vice President of World Championship Wrestling (succeeding Kip Frey) in 1992. He took many of his old-school values with him, such as banning moves from the top rope and the babyfaces and heels separation. His tenure was not long, nor were his ideas overly embraced. According to his autobiography, Controversy Creates Ca$h, Eric Bischoff (who worked under Watts at the time) felt Watts would intimidate anyone he was talking to and was only interested in taking the WCW product back to 1970s standards, with poorly lit arenas and house shows in remote rural towns. He introduced his son, Erik Watts, to WCW around this time, who many felt was not ready for national wrestling. The circumstances of Watts' departure in 1993 are controversial. Prior to 1992, he had given an interview to a wrestling newsletter. Most notably, Watts had commented on Lester Maddox, a restaurant owner (and future Governor of Georgia) who was told he had to serve black people but instead closed down his business. Watts felt Maddox stood up for what he believed in and acted accordingly. He also made several other controversial statements pertaining to race and sexual orientation. When he was hired by WCW, Watts had explained the situation to Turner president Bill Shaw, apparently to his satisfaction. However, a year later wrestling journalist Mark Madden brought the interview to the attention of Hank Aaron, himself a vice president in the Turner organization with the Atlanta Braves, who then pushed for Watts' removal. While Madden takes credit for Watts getting fired, Watts himself disputes this account, saying he was not fired for the comments but quit his position out of frustration over \\"backstabbing\\" by Shaw and (unbeknownst to Shaw) had already resigned by the time Aaron got the newsletter. Watts was replaced by Ole Anderson. World Wrestling Federation (1995) Watts later went on to a position of booking power in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). His tenure there was short, as he stated in later interviews that he was only there on a three-month contract and had no interest in staying long-term. On April 4, 2009, Watts was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Class of 2009.Jimmie Tramel, \\"WWE Hall of Fame to induct 'Cowboy Bill'\\", Tulsa World, April 3, 2009. Personal life Watts has five children. From his first marriage, he has a son, William III (nicknamed Biff), and from his second marriage, he has three sons, Joel, Erik, Micah and a daughter, Ene. In March 2006, Watts released his autobiography The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption through ECW Press. The book chronicles his upbringing, his career as first a wrestler, then a promoter, along with events in his personal life. The book also details his becoming a born-again Christian. Watts is a Republican, and in an ROH shoot interview with Jim Cornette, filmed in 2006, he criticised Bill Clinton and the Democrats numerous times. He also said, \\"All men are equal, but some men are more talented than others, and worth more.\\" Watts served as co-host of a sports talk radio show on The Sports Animal in Tulsa, Oklahoma until late 2008. He was a longtime resident of Bixby, a Tulsa suburb.

The plan originated from the HSS which was also involved in the negotiations with the Allies. The plot ended with massive arrests and the execution of major plotters, including Lorkoviƒá and Vokiƒá. Situation in Europe On 24 August 1942, the Germans launched an attack on Stalingrad. The battle of Stalingrad ended in German defeat on 2 February 1943. After this victory, the war turned in the Soviets' favour. The Allied invasion of Sicily was launched on 9 July 1943, and not long after, Benito Mussolini was overthrown and arrested on 25 July. On the same day, Italian king Victor Emmanuel named Pietro Badoglio as Italy's new Prime Minister and on 8 September 1943, signed the unconditional capitulation of Italy. On 6 June 1944 the Allies launched the D-Day landings on the German-occupied coast of Normandy. =Coup attempts among the Axis nations= Because of defeats that Axis forces suffered from the Allies, some Axis nations tried to change sides. On 23 August 1944, as the Red Army approached Romania, Romanian King Michael staged a coup against dictator Ion Antonescu and joined the Allies. Not long after the coup in Romania, the Fatherland Front in Bulgaria overthrew the pro- German Bulgarian government on 2 September 1944. Three days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria, soon occupying the northeastern part of the country. The Bulgarian Army was ordered not to offer any resistance. Bulgaria joined the Allies on 8 September 1944. On 15 October 1944, the regent of Hungary, Mikl√≥s Horthy, announced that he had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. In response, the Germans launched Operation Panzerfaust, arrested Horthy and installed Ferenc Sz√°lasi, leader of the fascist Arrow Cross Party, as leader of Hungary. Hungary would continue to fight the Red Army on the Axis side until the end of the war. Preparations for the coup August Ko≈°utiƒá, Vice President of the HSS Ljudevit Toma≈°iƒá, Deputy Secretary of the HSS Vladko Maƒçek, the President of the Croatian Peasant Party, thought that the British would support the democratic and anti-communist Croatian state. Because of that, he thought that the Allies would eventually land on the Dalmatian coast and support his party as democratic and anti-communist. He also assumed that the Croatian Home Guard would support the HSS once the invasion of Dalmatia started. Nevertheless, Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá's Serb-dominated Chetniks had a plan directed against both Croats and Communists if the projected Allied invasion of Dalmatia were to occur. The three members of the HSS' leadership, August Ko≈°utiƒá, the Vice President; Ljudevit Toma≈°iƒá, a deputy secretary and representative who was already in contact with the Allies; and Ivanko Farolfi were assigned the task of carrying out negotiations with the British. Farolfi was the most active and was in charge of maintaining contact with Croatian army officers, party leaders and foreign intelligence services. Mladen Lorkoviƒá had a plan to disarm the German army on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), install the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) as the new government, and to call all of the Allied armies to land on the territory of the NDH. He also believed that the HSS would prevent the communists or King Peter II from coming to power. In July 1944, Vokiƒá held a meeting at which he pointed out that once the Allies invaded the Balkans, the German armed forces would have to be disarmed. The Germans were aware that Croatia could join the Allies. The Luftwaffe's attach√© in Zagreb on 11 August reported that the Croatian military was becoming increasingly uncooperative towards the Germans. He also noted their request for more arms and ammunition from the German military. Lorkoviƒá established contact with the Croatian Peasant Party representatives in Croatia, Ivanko Farolfi, Ljudevit Toma≈°iƒá and August Ko≈°utiƒá. Their notion of an Allied invasion of Dalmatia failed to materialize, as Allies had no intention of landing in Dalmatia. Even so, Winston Churchill was sympathetic to the idea of an Allied invasion of the Croatian coast, so he initiated a discussion with Josip Broz Tito about a possible invasion of the Istrian peninsula in August 1944. The representatives of the HSS and Croatian Home Guard offered only promises, while the Yugoslav Partisans were involved in the war, and at the Teheran Conference, the Partisans gained the status of an Allied force. The British did not wanted to risk cooperation with the Partisans, and their involvement in Yugoslavia was already complicated as they dealt with both the Royal Yugoslav government-in-exile and the Communists; the involvement of the Croatian Home Guard and the HSS would complicate the situation even further. The Croatian negotiators with the Allies were Tomo Janƒçikoviƒá, Zenon Adamiƒá and Ivan Babiƒá. The British always had a separate meeting with them. The HSS thought that their emissaries were successful in securing the Dalmatian invasion plan. The appointment of Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá as the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in exile and General Ivan Toma≈°eviƒá's offer to put his army under Allied command once the invasion began, encouraged the plotters even more. Finally, the Romanian coup and the advance of the Soviet troops led them to believe that the Allies would soon invade Dalmatia. End of the plot and arrests Ante Paveliƒá, Poglavnik of the Independent State of Croatia, thought that the Germans would win the war with the \\"horrible weapons\\". He called a meeting of his cabinet to his villa, which was guarded by armed men. A meeting took place on 30 August 1944, and Paveliƒá accused both Lorkoviƒá and Vokiƒá of involvement in the plot and treason. Vice President of the Government, D≈æafer Kulenoviƒá, and many others defended them, but to no avail. Lorkoviƒá and Vokiƒá were arrested, along with 60 others. Lorkoviƒá requested that Paveliƒá not do harm the members of the HSS, \\"as promised\\", while Vokiƒá defended them in front of Paveliƒá, asserting that they did everything he ordered them to do. Some of those who were arrested were soon released, while Lorkoviƒá and Vokiƒá were tried, imprisoned, and later executed.

The successor to Bodhidharma. BiographySources= As with most of the early Ch√°n patriarchs, very little firm data is available about his life. The earliest extant biography of the Ch√°n patriarchs is the Biographies of Eminent Monks (519) () and its sequel, Further Biographies of Eminent Monks () (645) by Tao-hsuan (?-667).Yampolsky, p 5 The following biography is the traditional Chan biography as handed down throughout the centuries, including the Denkoroku by Zen Master Keizan Jokin (1268‚Äì1325). =Life= The Hsu kao-seng chuan says that Huike was born in Hu-lao (Sishui, modern Xingyang, Henan) and his secular name was Sh√©nguƒÅng (Á•ûÂÖâ, Wade‚ÄìGiles: Shen-kuang; Japanese: Shinko). A scholar in both Buddhist scriptures and classical Chinese texts, including Taoism, Huike was considered enlightened but criticised for not having a teacher. He met his teacher Bodhidharma at the Shaolin Monastery in 528 when he was about forty years old and studied with Bodhidharma for six years (some sources say four years, five years, or nine years). Huike went to Yedu (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Yeh- tu) (modern Henan) about 534 McRae p22 and, except for a period of political turmoil and Buddhist persecution in 574, lived in the area of Yedu and Wei (modern Hebei) for the rest of his life. It was during the time of upheaval that Huike sought refuge in the mountains near the Yangtze River and met Sengcan who was to become his successor and the Third Chinese Patriarch of Chan. In 579, Huike returned to Yedu and expounded the dharma, drawing large numbers to listen to his teachings and arousing the hostility of other Buddhist teachers, one of whom, Tao-heng, paid money to have Huike killed but Huike converted the would-be assassin. (ibid) The Wudeng Huiyan (Compendium of Five Lamps) compiled by Dachuan Lingyin Puji (1179‚Äì1253) claims that Huike lived to the age of one hundred seven.Ferguson p 23 He was buried about forty kilometres east northeast of Anyang City in Hebei Province.Ferguson, p 492 n 17 Later, the Tang Dynasty emperor De Zong gave Huike the honorific name Dazu (\\"Great Ancestor\\") Some traditions have it that Huike was executed after complaints about his teachings by influential Buddhist priests.Shambhala, p 94 One story says that blood did not flow from his decapitated body, but rather, a white milky substance flowed through his neck. Bodhidharma legends Huike figures in several Bodhidharma-legends. =Cutting off his arm= Legend has it that Bodhidharma initially refused to teach Huike. Huike stood in the snow outside Bodhidharma's cave all night, until the snow reached his waist. In the morning Bodhidharma asked him why he was there. Huike replied that he wanted a teacher to \\"open the gate of the elixir of universal compassion to liberate all beings\\". Bodhidharma refused, saying, \\"how can you hope for true religion with little virtue, little wisdom, a shallow heart, and an arrogant mind? It would just be a waste of effort.\\" Cleary, p 126 Huike Offering His Arm to Bodhidharma (1496) by Sessh≈´ Finally, to prove his resolve, Huike cut off his left arm and presented it to the First Patriarch as a token of his sincerity. Bodhidharma then accepted him as a student, and changed his name from Shenguang to Huike, which means \\"Wisdom and Capacity\\". =Pacifying the mind= Huike said to Bodhidharma, \\"My mind is anxious. Please pacify it.\\" Bodhidharma replied, \\"Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it.\\" Huike said, \\"Although I've sought it, I cannot find it.\\" \\"There,\\" Bodhidharma replied, \\"I have pacified your mind.\\" Ferguson, p 20 =Awakening= According to the Denkoroku, when Huike and Bodhidharma were climbing up Few Houses Peak, Bodhidharma asked, \\"Where are we going?\\" Huike replied, \\"Please go right ahead---that's it.\\" Bodhidharma retorted, \\"If you go right ahead, you cannot move a step.\\" Upon hearing these words, Huike was enlightened. =Transmission=Skin, flesh, bone, marrow Legend has it that Bodhidharma wished to return to India and called together his disciples and the following exchange took place; Bodhidharma passed on the symbolic robe and bowl of dharma succession to Huike and, some texts claim, a copy of the Lankavatara Sutra.Faure, pp. 187-198 Bodhidharma then either returned to India or died. TeachingsDhyana= There is little doubt that Huike practiced and promoted meditation (as opposed to sutra commentary) as the method to reach understanding of true Buddhism. Tao-hsuan referred to Huike (and others) as dhyana masters (Wade‚ÄìGiles: ch'an- shih; Japanese: zenji), highlighting the importance of meditation practice in these early years of Chan development. However, what form Huike and Bodhidharma's meditation took (which Tao-hsuan labelled ju shih an-hsin wei pi-kuan (\\"wall gazing\\" or \\"wall contemplation\\") is unclear. =Sudden awakening= One of the most important characteristics of the early Ch√°n of Bodhidharma and Huike was the sudden approach to enlightenment rather than the Indian yogic meditation which advocated concentration and gradual self- perfection.McRae p 115 Huike wrote: :Originally deluded, one calls the mani- pearl a potsherd :Suddenly one is awakened---and it is [recognized] as a pearl :Ignorance and wisdom are identical, not different.McRae p 106 =Lankavatara Sutra= There is some evidence that both Huike and Bodhidharma based their teachings on the Lankavatara Sutra, although this cannot be firmly established by modern scholars. Tao-hsuan listed Huike and his circle of disciples as masters of meditation, and the Lankavatara Sutra, in his Further Biographies of Eminent Monks () This sutra urges ‚Äòself-enlightenment', the \\"forgetting of words and thoughts\\".Dumoulin p 95 =Two Entrances= One text that was circulating at the time of Huike was the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Erh-ju ssu-hsing lun; Pinyin: Erru sixing lun). This text was the purported teachings of Bodhidharma with a preface by T'an Lin (fl. 525-543) The two entrances refers to the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice. * The entrance of principle is that one must have faith in the truth of the teachings and that everyone possesses the same \\"true nature\\" which is covered up by \\"false senses\\". * The entrance of practice refers to the four practices of the title: be undisturbed by suffering, accept one's circumstances and be unmoved by good or bad fortune, be without attachment or desire and, finally, govern one's actions based on understanding the emptiness or non-substantiality of all things. =Buddha-nature= Attached to the text are some letters, one of which may have been written to Huike and Huike's brief reply. The Bodhidharma text and Huike's letter indicate that the earliest teachings of what was to become Chan emphasized that Buddha Nature was within, and each person must realize this individually through meditation rather than studying the sutras, ceremonies, doing good deeds or worshiping the Buddhas. Meditation should be free of any dualism or attached goal and realization occurs suddenly.

Life history One generation of this beetle is produced a year. Adults feed before winter and spend most of their overwintering time in protected areas such as wind rows, crop stubble, and tree bark crevices. Adults mate once the temperature warms to above 9‚Äì10 degrees Celsius (or 44.6 degrees F) and females have a relatively long laying period (about 45‚Äì60 days), when they deposit eggs on the undersides of leaves. The larvae hatch in 7‚Äì15 days, and start the most damaging eating of the entire lifecycle. These larvae mature in 12‚Äì20 days. Larvae are the greatest threat to crops, as they eat the superficial layer of leaves, hindering the leaves' photosynthetic potential. According to Kon, Zabik, Webster, and Leavitt, a chemical factor attracts the beetles to leaves, and that chemical factor is directly related to hydrophobicity. Pupation occurs in soil, with the adults emerging in 20‚Äì25 days, ready to start the cycle again. Eggs are cylindrical and round, about 0.9 mm long and 0.4 mm wide. Eggs are often laid along the midvein on the undersides of leaves. They are bright yellow at first and darken over time, and are partially black when the larvae emerge. The larva appears white or yellow, is hump-backed, and has a black head and six small legs. It has a defense mechanism in which it smears excrement on its body to mask its vibrant color and deter predators. This gives it a shiny black appearance, as opposed to yellow or white. Adults, on average, are about 5 mm long and have dark-blue wing covers and red legs. Their thoraces range in color from red to orange to reddish brown. The biggest distinction between male and female O. melanopus is the difference in shape of the first abdominal segment. The male's segment is more narrowly rounded and flat or concave, and it is more broadly rounded and convex in the female. Pupas are rarely seen in fields, as they are dormant at that time. Pupae are about 5 mm in length and are yellow, also darkening with time. Habitat O. melanopus is native to Europe and Asia, but it has become much more common in the world. In North America, it was first spotted in Berrien County, Michigan, in 1962. Since then, it has spread through the Midwest to the East Coast, and is making its way westward. Significant populations are found in Virginia, North Carolina, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, and Missouri and Iowa. Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity drastically affect the O. melanopus population for that year. A cold spring favors the host plant, whereas a warm spring favors the leaf beetle. An increase in the general temperature of the planet may allow O. melanopus to spread into Canada. More recent surveys have shown that O. melanopus has indeed arrived in Canada; in 2006, it was present in 11.1% of fields, and in 2009, in 33.3% of fields in southern Alberta. Locally, adults spread to the exterior of fields during their overwinter. Larvae tend to stay on the outside of crop fields, but are also found in the center. Local populations are never homogenously distributed, hotspots and empty places occur in each field. Food O. melanopus consumes nearly all cereal crops, but has a strong affinity for oats, barley, and rye, and its favorite host is wheat. Alternatives are corn, sorghum, and sudangrass for adults, and wild oats, quackgrass, timothy, canary grass, reed canary grass, annual and perennial ryegrass, foxtail, orchard grass, wild rye, smooth brome, and fescues for the whole lifespan. The physical symptoms of the plant caused by them are thin, long lines where the upper epidermis of the leaf has been eaten. Since the beetle is migratory when it eats, it is not consistent within a field. In Michigan, entire fields are rarely affected and the situation is most likely the same in the Midwest. A field of plants looks weathered and old, but is never completely destroyed. Damage is usually no more than 40% total. When a herbivore consumes a plant, it releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Because VOCs are a chemical signal that attract some predators, the female O. melanopus is repelled by the chemicals for her own and the safety of her progeny. Males are deterred, but do not change eating habits. To determine the eating habits of O. melanopus, scientists conducted an experiment using different media. They took agar gel infused with pea and barley extracts, and noted the resulting reaction. When used alone, both pea extract, which is not a desired food for the beetle, and barley extract, which is an alternate source, produced a weakening or halting of consumption. A combination of both, however, incited a small feeding response. Most likely, a secondary compound in barley incites an eating response, perhaps when a lack of desired food is present. ControlBiological solutions= Scientists have had success in labs with a few types of nematode, Steinernema feltiae B30, S. carpocapsae C101, and Hetero-rhabditis bacteriophora D54. Nematodes attack the adults that overwinter in the soil, preventing them from reproducing in the spring. S. carpocapsae C101 was found to be the most effective, and even proved to be an effective alternative to pesticides. Each of the nematodes, however, was sensitive to temperature, implying that some strains would work better than others due to the temperature. Since the spread of O. melanopus is so great, a consistently important factor to consider is the temperature when selecting which strain is the most effective for the desired location. Also, the hormone secreted by the males attracts the beetles into a trap, where they can be removed from the site. For the adult individuals, which feed on leaves, a few options exist to control populations. The first is Hyalomyodes triangulifer, a tachinid fly that parasitizes adults of O. melanopus. Another biological control consists of larval parasites; Diaparsis carnifer, Lemophagus curtis, and Tetrastichus julis are wasps that do this D. carnifer and L. curtis both consume the O. melanopus larvae, and T. julis lays eggs inside of the body of the O. melanopus larvae. Specifically, T. julis does not seem to pose too much risk to the crops themselves, but is extremely effective at dispatching large populations, around 90%. With all parasitic wasps in general, some experiments are proving that spraying a sugar solution on the fields encourages predators of O. melanopus to grow fast and hearty, so they can better kill off the population in the field. Anaphes flavipes is an egg parasitoid that lays its eggs inside of the O. melanopus egg, killing it in the process. Effectiveness is around 90%. It is a good control agent because it is hearty and its lifecycle is synchronous with that of O. melanopus, the disadvantage being that it is not host-specific, and can cause other unforeseen deaths in other bugs, disrupting the balance of the ecosystem.>. The Coccinellidae ladybug beetles are known to eat the eggs and larvae of O. melanopus, and are effective in some locations. =Other solutions= Even without human intervention, O. melanopus has experienced a decline in the United States due to general weather conditions such as drought or excessive rainfall. In the early days of outbreak in the United States, California experimented with quarantine as the first option. Any material suspected to contain O. melanopus was not allowed into California. O. melanopus populations traveling in hay can be suppressed by compressing the hay into bales. Genetically modified plants are still another option for control. Meissle et al. found that mortality of O. melanopus on Cry3Bb1 transgenic maize was double that of the wild type. Many transgenic plants seek to change the physical properties of the plant, making adhering eggs a difficult task. In Europe, where the species is native, scientists have experimented with several pesticides. In one experiment, four pesticides belonging to two groups (organophosphates and pyrethroids) were tested to see their effects on the beetles' numbers. These were tested at several concentrations and mixtures. The chemical Vantex was superior, but the other pesticides were averaging 80% efficiency and were not to be counted out. With many pesticides, farmers must be cautious not to spray too early, because the eggs will not be affected much, and pesticide use may actually increase the numbers of O. melanopus because predators are killed. The optimum time to begin spraying is when about 50% of the eggs have hatched. An alternative is spraying when the adults are laying their eggs, which is also shown to be effective.

The health system includes 51 hospitals, more than 800 non-acute facilities and numerous other health, supportive housing and educational services in the states of the United States West Coast (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California) and Montana, New Mexico, and Texas. Providence Health & Services was founded by the Sisters of Providence in 1859. History Providence Health System was established by the Sisters of Providence, a community of Roman Catholic sisters founded in Montreal, Quebec by Mother √âmilie Gamelin in 1843. In 1856, Mother Joseph and four sisters came to Vancouver, Washington (then Washington Territory) to serve the native people and settlers. In 1859, the Sisters incorporated their work, creating the network of health care services known as Providence Health & Services. In 1891, they founded St. Elizabeth Hospital, the Pacific Northwest's first permanent hospital (now PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center). The sisters later established several schools and hospitals in Washington, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, British Columbia, and California. Providence Health System was managed by the Sisters of Providence until 1979 when a secular president was appointed. In 2003, Health Management Associates purchased the Providence Health System properties in Central Washington including Providence Yakima Medical Center (formerly St. Elizabeth) and Toppenish Hospital. In 2012, Providence acquired Swedish Health Services in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Swedish Medical Center was hired by Providence Health & Services when Providence affiliated with Swedish in 2012. In April 2013, Dr. Hochman became the president and CEO of Providence. In 2014, Providence entered in an affiliation with Pacific Medical Centers (PacMed). PacMed joined Swedish as part of Providence's Western HealthConnect division. The Providence Medical Group operates more than 250 clinics in neighborhoods throughout Alaska, California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Providence Medical Group is part of Providence Health & Services. Providence Medical Group employs more than 1,600 physicians offering expertise in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, dermatology and other specialties. Providence Health & Services provides outpatient services, transitional care, home and hospice care, substance abuse programs, mental health treatment, prevention and wellness programs, long-term care, and assisted living and housing. Providence Health Plan provides or administers health coverage to more than 375,000 members nationwide. =Sponsorship= In 2014, Providence signed a sponsorship deal with the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer, naming Timbers' stadium Providence Park. =Environmental initiatives= The company has a program in place designed to reduce the amount of food scraps that it sends to landfills. The program focuses on more accurate food purchasing and preparation practices, composting food scraps and donating edible food to nonprofits. Providence requires the chefs throughout its system to use centrally developed recipes and portion sizes that are designed to reduce waste and improve the nutritional value of the food served. In 2016, the company said, its program helped divert 204 tons of food waste from the landfill.  Controversies  In 2018, Providence paid its chief executive, Rod Hochman, more than $10 million. In 2020, Providence Health System had a nearly $12 billion cash reserve and obtained $509 million in government funds earmarked to prevent health care providers from going under during the coronavirus pandemic. The normal annual yield for the reserve fund nets approximately $1 billion in profits per year.

It is adjacent to the A69, about east of Brampton. It is on the opposite side of the River Irthing to, and just within sight of, Lanercost Priory. It was the seat of the Barons Dacre and is now that of their cognatic descendants, the Earls of Carlisle. It is a Grade I listed building. History The castle is thought to have late 13th-century origins, in the form of a square keep and bailey. It was first mentioned in 1323, and in 1335, a licence to crenellate was granted to Ralph Dacre. Thomas Dacre (1467‚Äì1525), who commanded the reserve of the English army at the Battle of Flodden and was known as \\"the Builder Dacre\\", built the castle's gateway and placed over it his coat of arms with the Dacre family motto below: Fort en Loialte (Norman- French: \\"Strong in Loyalty\\"). There were further additions in 1602 for his successor, Lord William Howard. It is likely that the 18th-century walled garden lies within the boundaries of the original moat. Howard purchased back the Dacre family estate from King James and took up residence with his children and grandchildren at Naworth Castle. He restored the castle, improved the estate and established order in that part of the country. He had a large family of children, of whom Philip, his heir, was the grandfather of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, and his younger son Francis was the ancestor of the Howards of Corby. William Morris, the artist and socialist, stayed at the castle in August 1874. In a letter to Aglaia Coronio, he writes \\"...all is very pleasant. Ned & I pass our mornings in a most delightful room in one of the towers that has not been touched since William Howard of Queen Elizabeth's time lived there: the whole place is certainly the most poetical in England.\\"P. Henderson, ed., The Letters of William Morris to His Family and Friends (London: Longmans, 1950) From 1939 to 1940, Naworth was occupied by Rossall School from Fleetwood in Lancashire, which had been evacuated from its own buildings by various government departments. It is currently occupied by the Hon. Philip Howard, younger brother and heir presumptive of the 13th Earl of Carlisle. =1844 fire= On Saturday, 18 May 1844, the castle caught fire, possibly as a result of the ignition of some soot in the flue of the Porter's Lodge. The structure's lack of internal walls allowed the fire to spread rapidly, and it remained unchecked until it reached the northern wing. Although some property was saved, by the time two fire engines had arrived by train from Carlisle, most of the roof had collapsed and the fire had spread to nearly every room on the three sides of the quadrangle. Water had to be passed in buckets from a rivulet at the foot of a steep hill on the north side of the castle. \\"Belted Will's Tower\\" was saved, while the fire continued until around one o'clock on Sunday morning, when it was brought under control. Subsequent restoration was undertaken by the architect Anthony Salvin.

As of the end of 2011 CFAS had sent 30,000 computer systems to five main CFAS programme countries: Zambia (11,500), Zimbabwe (7,500), Malawi (5,500), Tanzania (900), and Zanzibar (800); and smaller quantities (4000 in total) have also been donated to partner NGO's in Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Gambia, Egypt, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Niger, Ethiopia and Liberia. More than 1500 schools have computer labs set up through the scheme. Every state and mission secondary school in Zambia has been provided with at least 10 computers through the scheme. The computers are donated free to the schools and two teachers from each recipient school are trained to teach IT as a subject. The programmes in the CFAS scheme recipient countries are administered by local administering NGOs (Computers for Zambian Schools, Computers for Malawian Schools, Computers for Zimbabwean Schools, Computers for Tanzanian Schools and Computers for Zanzibar Schools, respectively.) The organisation is listed by the umbrella resource Digital Dividend.Digital Dividend website The computers are recycled from redundant hardware donated by businesses and other organisations in the UK. Currently, nothing less than a Pentium IV specification is used. CFAS works in close collaboration with IT Schools Africa and the computers are refurbished by ITSA using volunteers who make sure that the computers are checked, parts are replaced if necessary and hard drives are wiped to UK Ministry of Defence standards. The majority of the computers are refurbished by prisoners in a range of prisons throughout England as part of rehabilitation training. Once in Africa, through agreement with Microsoft, Windows operating system and Office is installed. When donated computers reach the end of their life or are found to be unserviceable, the local CFAS administering NGO collects them from the schools and they are shipped to a recycling plant in Johannesburg run by DESCO. DESCO has a zero land fill policy and all materials are recycled. It is the long-term aim of CFAS to enable every state secondary pupil in the recipient countries to have access to computer lessons and to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.

History The girder bridge adjacent to Longton railway station Aynsley Pottery Longton ('long village') was a market town in the parish of Stoke in the county of Staffordshire. The town still has a market housed in an attractively renovated market hall. Coal miners in the Hanley and Longton area ignited the 1842 general strike and associated Pottery Riots. In March 1865, Longton and Lane End were incorporated as the Borough of Longton. On 1 April 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on- Trent. In 1925 the area was granted city status. One legacy of Longton's administrative independence from 1865 to 1910 is Longton Town Hall, a prominent landmark in the town centre. In 1986 Longton Town Hall faced demolition by Stoke-on-Trent City Council amid considerable local protest. Work on stripping the interior had already begun before an injunction was brought and the building saved. Together with Rochdale, then in Lancashire, Longton was host to the first Workers Educational Association tutorial classes. R.H. Tawney, known as \\"the patron saint of adult education\\",Elsey, B. (1987) ‚ÄòR. H. Tawney ‚Äì Patron saint of adult education‚Äô, in P. Jarvis (ed.) \\"Twentieth Century Thinkers in Adult Education\\", Beckenham: Croom Helm taught the classes for three years starting in January 1908. For a time, until he moved to Manchester in 1909, Tawney was working as part-time economics lecturer at Glasgow University. To fulfil his teaching commitments to the WEA, he travelled first to Longton for the evening class every Friday, before travelling north to Rochdale for the Saturday afternoon class. Arnold Bennett referred to Longton as Longshaw in his novels centred on the Potteries towns. Industry The district has a long history as a base for the pottery industry, such as Paragon China and Aynsley, and several major manufacturers still have a presence, along with Gladstone Pottery Museum. Roslyn Works, which adjoins the latter, is now home to several small-scale manufacturers of ceramics. Transport In 1997 the one-way system was finally bypassed when a new section of the A50 was opened, running past the town in a cutting. The one way system remains, but is no longer the main route into the main town centre of Hanley. Longton is served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 7 August 1848. A new bus interchange was opened adjacent to it in 2003 on the site of a former Co-op supermarket. The A50 near to its cutting. The prominent building is Longton's library. Education Secondary schools in the area include St Thomas More Catholic Academy and Stoke Studio College. Retail A new shopping precinct, the Bennett Precinct, opened in 1962. It is now named Longton Exchange. In 2003 a large Tesco Extra superstore was built.. Since then, other major retailers such as Argos, Next, Pizza Hut, Matalan, Wilko and B & M have opened new premises. Then, building firm St. Modwen's, opened an ¬£8 million retail complex in April 2012. The stores there include McDonald's, Pets at Home, Smyths and Currys.

He went on to play Quincey Morris in the 1970 Franco opus Count Dracula alongside Christopher Lee, Herbert Lom, Soledad Miranda and Klaus Kinski, before appearing in many of Franco's softcore films, most famously Female Vampire (1973) with Lina Romay. During this period, Taylor also co-starred with Spanish horror star Paul Naschy in Dr. Jekyll vs. The Werewolf (1971) and The Mummy's Revenge (1975) and worked for director Amando de Ossorio on three occasions, on The Ghost Galleon (1974), Night of the Sorcerers (1974) and The Sea Serpent (1985). He appeared in Le√≥n Klimovsky's The Vampires Night Orgy (1972) and the Italian giallo film Red Rings of Fear (1978). Juan Piquer Sim√≥n directed him in two films, a Jules Verne adventure film called Where Time Began (1978) and the gory cult film Pieces (1982). Jos√© Ram√≥n Larraz directed him in two other Spanish slasher films, Rest in Pieces (1987) and Edge of the Axe (1988). Over the years, Taylor has played supporting roles in international co-productions such as Robert Siodmak's Custer of the West (1966), John Milius' Conan the Barbarian (1982), Richard Lester's The Return of the Musketeers (1989), Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate (1999), Andr√© T√©chin√©'s Far (2001) and Milo≈° Forman's Goya's Ghosts (2006) while continuing to work in low-budget film and television in Spain.

They were shot to death in their Bellevue, Idaho home by their 16-year-old daughter Sarah Marie Johnson. Perpetrator Sarah Marie Johnson was born January 24, 1987. She grew up in the Idaho city of Bellevue, and attended Wood River High School in Hailey. History On September 2, 2003, Alan Scott Johnson and Diane Johnson were shot to death in their Bellevue, Idaho, home. Alan was shot twice in the chest, while Diane was shot in the head. Their daughter, Sarah Johnson, was found guilty of their murder. Sarah was 16 years old at the time. Her apparent motive was her parents' prohibiting her from dating 19-year-old Bruno Santos. At approximately 6:20 am on September 2, 2003, Johnson took the murder weapon, a .264-caliber Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle from the guest house. The tenant of the house had left for Boise, Idaho, and had not planned on returning for a week or so. She then walked into her parents' bedroom and shot her sleeping mother in the head, whereupon she walked into the bathroom and shot her father in the chest, right above the heart, while he was showering. DNA evidence was presented at trial from a discarded bathrobe and a latex glove that police found in the garbage can in front of the house. It contained the DNA of both victims and Sarah. Along with the robe and latex glove was a leather glove that had gunshot residue on it. In Johnson's bedroom investigators located the other leather glove that belonged to the pair. Johnson was found guilty of the murders of her parents by an Ada County, Idaho, jury on March 16, 2005. She was sentenced to two concurrent life without parole terms plus fifteen years for a firearm enhancement. The Idaho Supreme Court upheld her conviction. In 2012, Johnson's lawyer filed petition for a new trial, charging that she had ineffective legal counsel in the murder trial. They also cited the absence of any blood spatter on Johnson and the fact that fingerprints on the murder weapon matched those of a renter who was living in the family's guesthouse. In October 2014, the request was denied. Johnson is currently imprisoned in the Pocatello Women's Correctional Center.https://www.idoc.idaho.gov/content/prisons/offender_search/detail/77613 Media The case has been featured in a number of films, television shows and other works: =Film & Television= * Solved (Investigation Discovery) * Suburban Secrets (TruTV) * Murder (Spike TV) * Snapped (Oxygen) * Deadly Women * Primetime: Crime (ABC) - edited into an episode of Investigation Discovery's 20/20 on ID in 2014 * Forensic Files (TruTV) * Too Young to Kill: 15 Shocking Crimes (E!) * Killer Women (Netflix) =Other= * Small Town Murder Ep. 67 (podcast) See also *Parricide References Category:2003 in Idaho Category:2003 murders in the United States Category:American murder victims Category:Bellevue, Idaho Category:Deaths by firearm in Idaho Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Murder committed by minors Category:Parricides Category:People murdered in Idaho Category:Violence in Idaho ","title":"Murder of Diane and Alan Scott Johnson"},{"id":"2748115","text":"Vicious Circle is the fourth album by L.A.

History SAPO was created on 4 September 1995 by the Computer Science Centre of the University of Aveiro. The name was derived from the acronym of the service, S.A.P.O. (Servidor de Apontadores Portugueses Online). This acronym corresponds to the Portuguese word for toad. In 1997 SAPO was converted in a business and the company Navegante was created. Later, in September 1998, Saber & Lazer - Inform√°tica e Comunica√ß√£o S.A. bought SAPO from Navegante. With Saber & Lazer, SAPO launched new services; free e-mail, a virtual shopping and some new features for the search engine. Still in that year, due to increasing traffic SAPO and Telepac signed an agreement, with 'Telepac' becoming their new internet service provider. In September 1999, PT Multim√©dia acquired 74.9% of Saber e Lazer. And in March 2000, SAPO was assigned to PTM.com, with the objective of joining all internet projects under only one company. After some improvements in infrastructures and accesses, finally in June 2002 the ADSL access service was launched, starting the era of new contents for the portal.

He published most of his books as Frank Kingdon-Ward and this hyphenated form of his name stuck, becoming the surname of his wives and two daughters. It also became a nom-de-plume for his sister Winifred Mary Ward by default. Biography Rhododendron wardii var. puralbum, a naturally occurring white- flowered variety of the yellow-flowered species named for Frank Kingdon-Ward Siroi lily, Lilium macklinii Son of Harry Marshall Ward and Selina Mary Ward, n√©e Kingdon; he went on around 25 expeditions over a period of nearly fifty years, exploring Tibet, North Western China, Myanmar and Assam (now part of North Eastern India).Based on his 25 published books. Some expeditions blurred into each other, hence the ambiguity about the exact number of expeditions. In Myanmar he met and conducted some research into forestry and plants in the country with native botanist Chit Ko Ko. Among his collections were the first viable seed of Meconopsis betonicifolia (Himalayan blue poppy, first discovered by P√©re Delavay),Land of the Blue Poppy Primula florindae (giant cowslip, named after his first wife Florinda, n√©e Norman-Thompson)His published works, as listed above and Rhododendron wardii, a yellow flowered species. A species of lizard, Calotes kingdonwardi, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Kingdon-Ward\\", p. 141). He is also commemorated in Ward's trogon, Harpactes wardi. He survived many accidents on his expeditions including being impaled on a bamboo spike, falling off a cliff (stopped by a tree growing from the cliff), lost for two days with no food, tent crushed by a tree in a storm, and he was close to the epicentre of an earthquake (registering 9.6 on the Richter magnitude scale) on 15 August 1950 during an expedition in Assam. In addition to his professional activities as a botanist, in the 1930s Kingdon- Ward also served as a spy for the British India Office. In 1935, Kingdon-Ward was arrested by Tibetans after he crossed the Sela pass into the Tawang tract ( now Tawang District of Arunachal Pradesh, India) despite being refused permission to do so by the Tibetan authorities who were then administering Tawang. Tibetans protested this violation of their border to the British mission then visiting Lhasa. Kingdon-Ward was quickly released, but this incident led the British to investigate the status of the border, and it was discovered that the entire Tawang tract had been ceded to British India by Tibet by the Simla Convention negotiated by Sir Henry McMahon with the Tibetans in 1914. In 1923 he moved to Hatton Gore, a big house on the east side of Hatton Road, Hatton, London; the site of the house is now under the east end of London Heathrow Airport. He built there a big rockery looking like a bend in a river ravine in the Himalayas.page 52, Sherwood, Philip. (2009) Heathrow: 2000 Years of History. Stroud: The History Press. He sold the house due to a loss that he made running a plant nursery business. He was married twice, first to Florinda Norman-Thompson on 11 April 1923; later, to Jean Macklin, on 12 November 1947,Frank Kingdon-Ward, Last of the Great Plant Hunters, Charles Lyte (1989) to whom he remained married until his death. Florinda Kingdon-Ward had a brief political career which included standing as a Liberal Party candidate for Parliament at the 1950 UK General Election in Lewes. Even towards the end of his career he was still active, his greatest \\"swansong\\" plant was probably Lilium mackliniae, found jointly with his second wife after whom it is named. At age 68 he climbed to over 1,730‚Äì2,590 metres (5,680‚Äì8,500 ft) above sea level in the Ukhrul district of Manipur, India (near the boundary of Myanmar to the east) and was still discovering new species of plants on his last expedition in 1956, including Roscoea australis, the most southerly representative of its genus. Frank Kingdon-Ward died on 8 April 1958 aged 72. He had suffered a stroke and went into a coma from which he never recovered. He was buried in the churchyard at Grantchester.

Consisting of three larger islands (Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas) plus fifty smaller islets and cays, it covers approximately . Like many of its Caribbean neighbors, its history includes native Amerindian cultures, European exploration followed by subsequent colonization and exploitation, and the enslavement of Africans.Paris Permenterand John Bigley. \\"US Virgin Islands.\\" in Romantic Escapes in the Caribbean (Hunter Publishing, 2001), p. 342+. online The United States Virgin Islands are located in the Lesser Antilles of the Eastern Caribbean (between the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea), the United States Virgin Islands are actually approximately 50 islands and cays (pronounced \\"keys\\"), the largest of which are St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John, respectively.Allman-Baldwin, L.

It also includes migrants from the U.S. Virgin Islands to the U.S. mainland. American citizenship was conferred in 1927, so anyone who moves inside U.S. territory is not considered an immigrant and does not need a passport.Ockerstrom, Lolly. \\"Virgin Islander Americans.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America, edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 4, Gale, 2014), pp. 513-522. online The population of the United States Virgin Islands forms a complex society with multiple diverse ethnic groups: Virgin Islanders, Eastern Caribbean Islanders, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans (Dominican Republic), French, Americans (locally known as \\"continentals\\"), Arabs and Asians. At least one writer feels the ethnic cultural practices and institutions that remain, migration, and the influence of the mainland United States have made the society more pluralistic than given it any common Virgin Islands identity.Roopnarine, Lomarsh. Social Identity in the Modern Virgin Islands. College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, University of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Early inhabitants of the Virgin Islands included the Ciboney, Arawaks, and Island Caribs. The first documented Europeans to visit the islands arrived with Christopher Columbus. The islands were occupied by several nations over the next century, including Britain, the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark.Isaac Dookhan, A History of the Virgin Islands of the U.S. (2nd ed. Kingston, Jamaica: Canoe Press, 1994). In 1733, the Danish West India Company purchased Saint Croix from France and brought together Saint Thomas, Saint Croix, and Saint John as the Danish West Indies. Danish trading posts were set up on the islands, trading in sugar, slaves and other goods. Sugar cane cultivation was a major economic activity for many years, with slaves used as one of the labor sources. However, following increasing humanitarian awareness, laws against slavery and a slave rebellion in 1848, the governor Peter von Scholten officially freed the last slaves the same year. The islands were purchased from the Danish by the United States in 1917 under the Treaty of the Danish West Indies. The goal was to protect access to the Panama Canal in wartime. Early history Reef Bay Trail petroglyphs in the Virgin Islands National Park. =The Guanahatabey= Although not much is known about the Guanahatabey people who inhabited the islands during the Stone Age, archaeological evidence seems to indicate that they were hunter-gatherers. They made tools of stone and flint but left few other artifacts behind. =The Arawaks= Experts at canoe building and seamanship, the Arawaks migrated from the Amazon River Valley and Orinoco regions of Venezuela and Brazil, settling on the islands near coasts and rivers. These peaceful people excelled at fishing and farming. They grew cotton, tobacco, maize, yuca, and guava as well as a variety of other fruits and vegetables. The Arawaks developed intricate social and cultural lives. For recreation, they held organized sporting events. They also valued artistic endeavors, such as cave painting and rock carving, some of which have survived to the present. Religion played a large role in their daily lives, and through ceremonial rituals they asked their gods for advice to help them through troubled times. Their civilization flourished for several hundred years until the Caribs invaded. =Caribs= While the Caribs came from the same area as the Arawaks and may have been distantly related, they did not share the Arawaks' friendly nature. Not only were they fierce warriors, they supposedly feasted on their adversaries. Their bloodthirsty reputation spawned the English word cannibal, derived from the name the Spanish gave them, Caribal. Whether or not they actually ate their victims, the Caribs did destroy numerous Arawak villages. By the mid-15th century, the Caribs had slashed the Arawak population from several million to a few thousand. But even the Caribs were no match for the Europeans who came. Spanish and French colonial period Hospitaller colonization of the Americas Blown off course during his 1493‚Äì1496 voyage, Christopher Columbus landed on Saint Croix, then continued his explorations on Saint Thomas and Saint John. He gave the islands their original Spanish names (Santa Cruz, San Tomas, and San Juan), focusing on religious themes. The collection of tiny islets, cays, and rocks dotting the sea around them reminded Columbus of Saint Ursula and her 11,000 virgin martyrs, inspiring the name Las Once Mil Virgenes. The first encounter Columbus had with the Caribs quickly erupted into a battle. When Columbus and his crew decided to move on to other islands, they kidnapped six Arawaks to guide them. Although Columbus left without founding a colony, many more battles between the Spanish and Caribs followed over the next century. The French and Danish colonizers finished the job the Spanish had begun. They tried to convert the Caribs and Arawaks to Catholicism and Lutheranism, which largely failed. They also enslaved the native populations to work on plantations. With tobacco having already been cultivated on the islands, it made a good cash crop. Later on, coffee, sugar, and cotton also were grown. The Danish West Indies period The H√∏gensborg estate on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, 1833 Diseases, coupled with murder and slavery, took a large toll on both the Arawaks and the Caribs. Several groups of Arawaks committed mass suicide rather than submit to foreign rule. By the late 17th century, the Arawaks had vanished and few Caribs remained. The Virgin Islands were raided by Spanish from Puerto Rico seeking slaves. With only a small population on the islands, there was a great demand for labor. The trans-Atlantic slave trade to the islands began in 1673. The difficult conditions and inhumane treatment slaves were subjected to bred discontent. Moravian Brethren missionaries from Herrnhut Saxony, arrived in St. Thomas in December 1732. Distrusted by the slave holders, they lived with the slaves and won their confidence. In 1733 a long drought followed by a devastating hurricane pushed slaves in St. John to the breaking point. Members of the Akwamu tribe from modern Ghana staged a massive rebellion, seizing control of the island for six months. The Danes, who controlled the island at that point, enlisted the help of French authorities from Martinique to regain control (see St. John Slave Revolt). A non-violent slave revolt in 1848 proved more successful. The governor at the time, Peter von Scholten, faced with thousands of enslaved Africans with burning torches threatening to burn down the town of Frederiksted, freed the slaves, even though the Danish Crown had so far intended that the last slaves would be emancipated in 1859. Von Scholten would later be summoned before a commission of enquiry for his action and deprived of his pension but he was eventually exonerated by the Supreme Court.

The sale was unsuccessful and White attributed the failure to the influence of Kaiser Wilhelm II of the ascendent German Empire. During World War I, the fear of rising German interest in the Caribbean prompted the President Woodrow Wilson to assert the Roosevelt Corollary in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In 1917 a treaty was concluded in which the United States purchased the islands for $25,000,000 (about $390,000,000 in 2010 dollars). After the United States bought what is now known as the United States Virgin Islands from the Danish, the islands officially became an unincorporated U.S. territory in 1927. Most residents were granted U.S. citizenship in 1936, and an act of 1932 provided that all natives of the Virgin Islands who on the date of the act were residing in the continental United States or any of its insular possessions or territories were U.S. citizens. The islands remained under the direct control of the U.S. government until 1968, when residents were first allowed to elect their own governor (previously, governors had been appointed first by the navy, then by the interior department). In 1972, residents elected their first non-voting delegate to Congress. Knowing of his interest in graphic design, Rear Admiral Kitten ordered a yeoman, Percival Wilson Sparks, who was married to St. Thomas native, Grace Itah Maria Joseph Sparks, to design a new flag for the territory. Sparks designed the flag and had his wife and her sister, Blanche Joseph Sasso, sew the first flag for the U.S.V.I. as the professionally made flags had to be manufactured in the States and would take weeks to arrive by ship. The sisters from St. Thomas were then known as the Betsy Rosses of the Virgin Islands. The 1930s represented a watershed as the economy reversed itself because of two external stimuli: The repeal of prohibition in the U.S., which greatly increased the demand for plantation workers, and the wartime decision to construct a submarine base on St. Thomas. Because of habitual out-migration to the U.S. and the historical absence of a peasant agricultural tradition, the indigenous labor supply was inadequate. This vacuum created the demand for West Indian labor from the Eastern Caribbean for the first of several immigrant waves.Klaus de Albuquerque and Jerome L. McElroy, \\"West Indian Migration to the United States Virgin Islands: Demographic Impacts and Socioeconomic Consequences\\" International Migration Review 16#1 (1982), pp. 61‚Äì101 The Organic Act of the Virgin Islands of the United States of 1936 () established a local government, replacing previous temporary provisions (). The Virgin Islands government set a new policy of export diversification via tourism and light industry. People continued to immigrate in substantial numbers ‚Äî some legally and others illegally. They benefited from a series of loose interpretations and favorable revisions of immigration law which reduced occupational restrictions and generally lax enforcement. In 1954, the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands repealed and replaced the previous Organic Act.

It is founded by Hermann Haken, inspired by the laser theory. Haken's interpretation of the laser principles as self-organization of non- equilibrium systems paved the way at the end of the 1960s to the development of synergetics. One of his successful popular books is Erfolgsgeheimnisse der Natur, translated into English as The Science of Structure: Synergetics. Self- organization requires a 'macroscopic' system, consisting of many nonlinearly interacting subsystems. Depending on the external control parameters (environment, energy-fluxes) self-organization takes place. Order-parameter concept Essential in synergetics is the order-parameter concept which was originally introduced in the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory in order to describe phase-transitions in thermodynamics. The order parameter concept is generalized by Haken to the \\"enslaving-principle\\" saying that the dynamics of fast-relaxing (stable) modes is completely determined by the 'slow' dynamics of as a rule only a few 'order-parameters' (unstable modes). The order parameters can be interpreted as the amplitudes of the unstable modes determining the macroscopic pattern. As a consequence, self-organization means an enormous reduction of degrees of freedom (entropy) of the system which macroscopically reveals an increase of 'order' (pattern-formation). This far- reaching macroscopic order is independent of the details of the microscopic interactions of the subsystems. This supposedly explains the self-organization of patterns in so many different systems in physics, chemistry and biology. > \\"[...] the statistical properties of laser light change qualitatively at the > laser threshold.

It is located in Panchmahal district, 47 kilometres from the city of Vadodara. The city was briefly the capital of the Sultanate of Gujarat. History Champaner was founded by Vanraj Chavda, the most prominent king of the Chavda Dynasty, in the 8th century. He named it after the name of his friend and general Champa, also known later as Champaraj. By the later 15th century, the Khichi Chauhan Rajputs held Pavagadh fort above the town of Champaner. The young Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada, deciding to attack Champaner, started towards it with his army on 4 December 1482. After defeating the Champaner army, Mahmud captured the town and besieged Pavagadh, the well-known hill- fortress, above Champaner, where king Jayasimha had taken refuge. He captured the Pavagadh fort on 21 November 1484, after a siege of 20 months.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.164-5 He then spent 23 years rebuilding and embellishing Champaner, which he renamed Muhammadabad, after which he moved the capital there from Ahmedabad. Sultan Begada also built a magnificent Jama Masjid in Champaner, which ranks amongst the finest architectural edifices in Gujarat. It is an imposing structure on a high plinth, with a central dome, two minarets 30 meters in height, 172 pillars, seven mihrabs, and carved entrance gates with fine latticed windows called \\"jalis\\". In 1535, after chasing away Bahadur Shah, Humayun led 300 Mughals to scale the fort on spikes driven into rock and stonework in a remote and unguarded part of the citadel built over a precipitous hillside on Pavagadh Hill.

Pacas are nocturnal, sedentary, and solitary animals with territorial tendencies. It eats mostly fruits and seeds. The mountain paca primarily inhabits higher Andean montane forest regions in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. This paca has coarse fur without underfur, dark brown to black on the upper body and white or yellowish on the underbelly. It usually has three to five rows of white spots along its sides, against a dark grey background. It has thick strong legs, with four digits in the forefeet and five in the hind feet (the first and fifth are reduced); the nails function as hooves. The tail is short and hairless. The zygomatic arch is expanded laterally and dorsally and is used as a resonating chamber - a unique feature among mammals. The mountain paca is hunted for its meat, which is high in calories and is considered a delicacy particularly in rural communities. Due to its quick growth, it may be bred in captivity for commercial use. However, it has a low reproductive capacity and its numbers have been significantly reduced in recent years due to hunting and habitat destruction. It is fairly abundant in protected areas.

The entire picture depicts his homage to King Henry III of England in 1267 but was painted after the event. Llywelyn's coronet () is a lost treasure of Welsh history. It is recorded that Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales and Lord of Aberffraw had deposited this crown () and other items (such as the Cross of Neith) with the monks at Cymer Abbey for safekeeping at the start of his final campaign in 1282. He was killed later that year. It was seized alongside other holy artefacts in 1284 from the ruins of the defeated Kingdom of Gwynedd. Thereafter it was taken to London and presented at the shrine of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey by King Edward I of England as a token of the complete annihilation of the independent Welsh state. A 16th century illustration by Lewys Dwnn of the \\"Arms of Wales\\" which shows the Crown of the Principality surmounting the Arms. In this illustration the \\"crown\\" is clearly a coronet and of a curious design. Given that Llywelyn's crown was still in existence at this time and in the possession of the English monarch then this may be a representation of what that original Welsh crown looked like as seized by Edward I in 1283. Llywelyn's successor was his brother, Dafydd, who claimed Llywelyn's title of Tywysog as Tywysog Cymru or Prince of Wales. His reign was extremely brief; he was killed not long after his brother, without ever having been able to reclaim the precious items from Cymer Abbey. Dating the crown The origins of the coronet are unclear. Some sources state that Dafydd ap Llywelyn had been presented with a coronet by Henry III of England on his accession to the throne of Gwynedd in 1240. However, on the occasion of their first meeting Dafydd is described as already wearing a coronet. Rees Davies believes that there were several coronets and among those seized in 1282 was the \\"Coron Arthur\\", an older native Welsh treasure, that may have been forged as far back as the reign of Owain Gwynedd (1137‚Äì1171) or perhaps earlier, as the princes of Gwynedd sought to consolidate their position as the primary rulers of Wales. :He (Edward) appropriated the most valuable and potent symbols of Welsh princely independence ‚Äì Llywelyn's coronet, the matrix of his seal, the jewels and crown of Arthur, and above all the most cherished relic in Wales, the piece of the true cross known as Y Groes Naid (just as he removed the Stone of Scone from Scotland in 1296). :R.R. Davies There is some confusion as to whether Llywelyn's coronet is what was referred to by some chroniclers as the \\"crown\\" or \\"jewel\\" of Arthur or if this was a separate more treasured artefact. After annexation by England According to King Edward I's jewel account for that regnal year (12 Edward I), the crown was recoated in gold plating to make it look more impressive (which suggests that it may have been made of iron). It was then presented at the shrine of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey as the \\"Coron Arthur,\\" or the Crown of King Arthur. The coronet, alongside the English Crown Jewels, was kept in Westminster Abbey until 1303 before they were all re-housed in the Tower of London after it and the English Crown Jewels were all temporarily stolen. It is widely thought that Llywelyn's Coronet was destroyed alongside most of the original English crown jewels in 1649 by order of Oliver Cromwell; however, an inventory taken by the new republican administration prior to the destruction of the crown jewels makes no mention of this coronet. The heraldic badge of Wales Herald Extraordinary which depicts the Cross of Neith atop a Welsh Talaith, logically that of Llywelyn. Coronet of Owain Glynd≈µr and later reconstructions Mystery surrounds the identity and whereabouts of a possible second Welsh crown, the crown of Owain Glynd≈µr. Glynd≈µr was crowned in 1404 at the Welsh parliament or Cynulliad held at Machynlleth ‚Äì but with whose crown? It is possible that this was either another pre-conquest dynastic coronet, similar to Llywelyn's, and potentially the crown of the Kings of Powys known as the Crown of Elisig. Alternatively, it could have been one that was made specifically for the occasion. Another possibility is that Llywelyn's crown, which had been stolen in 1303 alongside the English Crown Jewels, had not been returned with the rest of them, and thus escaped destruction by Cromwell. This fact may have been covered up to avoid further embarrassment. If it is true, then this crown would probably have been \\"lost\\" at the fall of Harlech Castle in 1409 or may be still hidden in Glynd≈µr's undiscovered final resting place. In more recent times reconstructed Welsh regalia known as the Honours of the Principality of Wales have been cast for symbolic use during the investiture ceremony of the eldest son of the King of England. The design of these coronets, established in 1672 by King Charles II of England, features \\"Crosses and flowers de Liz with one Arch and in the midst a Ball and cross\\". The coronet made in 1911 for the investiture of the future King Edward VIII as Prince of Wales strictly adheres to the style clarified in the 1672 royal warrant. The version created in 1969 for the investiture of the current Prince of Wales (the 1911 Crown was still in the possession of the Duke of Windsor in France) has deviated from the classic designs and was made using modern methods. Both coronets are now kept at the National Museum Cardiff.

Brain Damage was one of many comics trying to emulate the success of Viz; however whereas most of its peers were crude, low-quality Viz imitations, Brain Damage attempted to capture the high end of the market, with contributions from recognised cartoonists and satirists, and a strong leaning towards UK politics. In this way, it seemed to aspire to be a more modern Oz. Many issues contained a central theme around which strips were supposed to focus. Each cover featured an unnamed mascot which vaguely resembled the 1980s children's TV puppet Gilbert the Alien. Its sibling titles included the direct Viz clone Gas and reprint anthology Talking Turkey. Brain Damage was published until volume 3, number 4 (issue 28), and was then replaced with Elephant Parts which abandoned the political aspects in favour of surreal nonsense. Elephant Parts supposedly incorporated \\"The Damage\\", but as it was printed on different paper stock and with a markedly changed editorial, was effectively a different magazine. Elephant Parts was printed for a few months. On 18 June 2009, all rights to the Brain Damage comic series were acquired by Untitled Project Productions in Brooklyn, NY. The intent was to produce a series of half-hour animated TV shows. Regular strips included: * Andy The Anarchist by Anthony Smith ‚Äì a stereotypical anarchist. * Arseover Tit by Hunt Emerson ‚Äì a two- headed creature called Alf (as in \\"half and half\\") and his adventures in society. Usually Alf would get mangled after failing to decide which way to jump from an oncoming attack due to having two heads. * Cameraman by Stevie Best ‚Äì a day-to-day story of a cynical paparazzo (tabloid photographer). * Hell's Rotarians by unknown ‚Äì setting septuagenarian Rotarians as Hells Angels * Home Front by John Erasmus ‚Äì a strip involving a mother and son, the mother being a cheerful psychopath who caused carnage each issue, embarrassing her son. * Rymeword Scrubs by Doug Cameron and Ben Norris ‚Äì a prison to house cartoon characters with rhyming names (e.g. David Fottom, with a talking bottom). * The Striker Wore Pink Knickers by Tony Husband and Ron Tiner- a pastiche of Roy of the Rovers type strips about a girl playing professional football posing as a man.

Plot introduction Predator is the fourteenth book of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta series by author Patricia Cornwell. =Explanation of the novel's title= \\"PREDATOR\\" is an acronym for the Prefrontal Determinants of Aggressive-Type Overt Responsivity, a secret neuropsychological project to determine whether dangerous murderers have different brain patterns or functions from \\"ordinary\\" people. Plot summary Dr. Kay Scarpetta, now freelancing with the National Forensic Academy in Florida, takes charge of a case that stretches from steamy Florida to snowbound Massachusetts, one as unnerving as any she has ever faced. The teasing psychological clues lead Scarpetta and her team‚ÄîPete Marino, Benton Wesley, and Lucy Farinelli‚Äîto suspect that they are hunting someone with a cunning and malevolent mind whose secrets have kept them in the shadows, until now.

Major themes * The hunt for a killer Literary significance & criticism Cornwell was considered courageous by some reviewers Gershenbaum, B.L. 2005. Review of Predator. The Book Reporter for setting the characters of this novel at a major crossroads. All are on edge about their personal lives, relationships, and especially their long dependence upon and affection for each other. Mutual trusts have been eroded over previous books and the group lacks the cohesion it had earlier in the series. The narrative style seen in previous books is also seen in Predator, with more than one character narrating.Dauncey, S. University of Warwick. \\"Patricia Cornwell.\\" The Literary Encyclopedia. 18 Nov. 2005. The Literary Dictionary Company. 22 April 2007. This change in narrative style from the first-person narration of Kay herself is one first seen in Blow Fly. This device not only allows for more characters and their perspectives to come to the fore, but also marks a significant transformation in the way that the novels represent the criminal. Whereas previously the criminal's mind was never made available to the reader‚Äîthus intensifying their \\"otherness\\"‚Äîthe later novels allow space to explore their point of view and uncover their motivations.

Through the Foundation for Economic Education, Raico and his classmate George Reisman arranged to meet with economist Ludwig von Mises, who subsequently invited them to attend his graduate seminar on Austrian economics at the New York University.. There, he met fellow seminar attendee Murray Rothbard, who befriended him... Rothbard and his friends Raico, Reisman, Ronald Hamowy and Robert Hessen formed a \\"self-conscious intellectual and activist salon\\" they named the Circle Bastiat... In the mid-1950s, the Circle Bastiat also brought Raico into contact with novelist Ayn Rand and her followers, informally known at the time as The Collective.. Raico attended the first lectures about Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.. Eventually, relations between the two groups soured, leading to an incident in which the Circle parodied the Collective, performing a skit in which Raico played the part of Rand's protege Nathaniel Branden.. By the summer of 1958, Rand and Rothbard had broken off all ties, and the groups stopped associating. Raico received his B.A. from the City College of New York and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where his adviser was Friedrich Hayek..  Career  While at the University of Chicago, Raico founded The New Individualist Review, a libertarian publication which first published in April 1961 and produced 17 issues until it ceased publication in 1968.. Raico and other graduate students comprised the editorial board. Hayek and Milton Friedman and later economist George Stigler were on the advisory board.

He gave his name to the Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2 University of medicine, literature and social sciences in Bordeaux under the Academy of Bordeaux where he studied, to the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of Brest where he was born, and the French International School of Hong Kong. Some western scholars of Chinese art, starting with Victor Segalen, use the word \\"chimera\\" generically to refer to winged leonine or mixed species quadrupeds, such as bixie, tianlu, and even qilin.

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (VVMF), was a non-profit organization established on April 27, 1979, by Jan Scruggs, a former Army Infantry in Vietnam. Others veterans joined including, Jack Wheeler, and several other graduates of West Point to finance the construction of a memorial to those Americans who served or died during the Vietnam War. The memorial was not designed to make a political statement about the war itself. From this fund came the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, dedicated on Veterans Day, 1982, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. History The Memorial was established by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (VVMF), the nonprofit, charitable organization incorporated on April 27, 1979. VVMF wanted Vietnam veterans to have a tangible symbol of recognition from the American people. By separating the issue of the service of the individual men and women from the issue of U.S. policy in Vietnam, VVMF hoped to begin a process of national reconciliation. The vision of a Memorial of names flowed from the academic work at American University of Jan Scruggs about which he testified to the US Senate. The hope was that the Memorial of names would help surviving veterans and the nation to recover from the Vietnam War. Significant initial support came from U.S. Senators Charles McC. Mathias, Jr., (R-Md.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.). On November 8, 1979, Sen. Mathias introduced legislation to authorize a site of national park land for the memorial. The first significant financial contributions to launch the national fundraising campaign were raised by Sen. Warner. More than $8,000,000 was raised, all of which came from private sources. Corporations, foundations, unions, veterans groups and civic organizations contributed, but most importantly, more than 275,000 individual Americans donated the majority of the money needed to build the Memorial. On July 1, 1980, Congress authorized a site of three acres in Constitution Gardens near the Lincoln Memorial. In October of that year, VVMF announced a national design competition open to any U.S. citizen over 18 years of age. By December 29, 1981, there were 2,573 registrants, and the competition became the largest of its kind ever held in the United States. By the March 31, 1981, deadline, 1,421 design entries had been submitted. All entries were judged anonymously by a jury of eight internationally recognized artists and designers who had been selected by VVMF. On May 1, 1981, the jury presented its unanimous selection for first prize, which was accepted and adopted enthusiastically by VVMF. The winning design was the work of Maya Ying Lin of Athens, Ohio, a 21-year-old senior at Yale University. In August 1981, VVMF selected a building company and architecture firm to develop the plans and build Lin's design. Lin became a design consultant to the architect of record. In January 1982, the decision was made to add a flagstaff and sculpture on the Memorial site in order to provide a realistic depiction of three Vietnam servicemen and a symbol of their courage and devotion to their country. On March 11, 1982, the design and plans received final federal approval, and work at the site was begun on March 16, 1982. Ground was formally broken on Friday, March 26, 1982. In July 1982, VVMF selected Washington, D.C. sculptor Frederick Hart to design the sculpture of the servicemen to be placed at the site. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts finally unanimously accepted the proposed sculpture and flagstaff. Construction at the site was completed in November 1982. The Memorial was dedicated on November 13, 1982. The Three Servicemen statue was added in 1984. That same year, the Memorial was given as a \\"gift\\" to the American people during a ceremony with President Ronald Reagan. In 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial by sculptor Glenna Goodacre was added to the Memorial site to represent the heroic work of women who served in the Vietnam War. In 2000, Congress authorized the placement on the Memorial site of a plaque honoring post-war casualties of Vietnam whose names are not eligible for inscription on The Wall. VVMF worked with several organizations and architects to ensure that the plaque is harmonious with the site's other elements. Funding The founders of the memorial set forth to collect several million dollars from private donors. In its first three years, the VVMF collected more than $8 million from more than 275,000 Americans. Contest In October 1980, the VVMF announced a contest for the design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial would be open to anyone over 18 years of age. The contest was the largest of its kind ever held in the United States, with over 2,573 contestants, and was judged by eight professional artists and architects. The winner of the contest was Maya Ying Lin, who submitted the idea for a wall. The material would be highly reflective black granite. Design The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund wanted, above all, for the memorial to have a prominent site in a large, park- like area; thus, the western end of Constitution Gardens was requested as the site. Subsequently, VVMF set four major criteria for the design: (1) that it be reflective and contemplative in character, (2) that it harmonize with its surroundings, especially the neighboring national memorials, (3) that it contain the names of all who died or remain missing, and (4) that it make no political statement about the war. Maya Lin conceived her design as creating a park within a park ‚Äî a quiet protected place unto itself, yet harmonious with the overall plan of Constitution Gardens. To achieve this effect she chose polished black granite for the walls. Its mirror-like surface reflects the images of the surrounding trees, lawns and monuments. The Memorial's walls point to the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, thus bringing the Memorial into the historical context of our country. The names are inscribed in the chronological order of their dates of casualty, showing the war as a series of individual human sacrifices and giving each name a special place in history. Statement by Maya Ying Lin, March, 1981 (presented as part of her competition submission) \\"Walking through this park-like area, the memorial appears as a rift in the earth, a long, polished, black stone wall, emerging from and receding into the earth. Approaching the memorial, the ground slopes gently downward and the low walls emerging on either side, growing out of the earth, extend and converge at a point below and ahead. Walking into this grassy site contained by the walls of the memorial we can barely make out the carved names upon the memorial's walls. These names, seemingly infinite in number, convey the sense of overwhelming numbers, while unifying these individuals into a whole. \\"The memorial is composed not as an unchanging monument, but as a moving composition to be understood as we move into and out of it. The passage itself is gradual; the descent to the origin slow, but it is at the origin that the memorial is to be fully understood. At the intersection of these walls, on the right side, is carved the date of the first death. It is followed by the names of those who died in the war, in chronological order. These names continue on this wall appearing to recede into the earth at the wall's end. The names resume on the left wall as the wall emerges from the earth, continuing back to the origin where the date of the last death is carved at the bottom of this wall. Thus the war's beginning and end meet; the war is ‚Äòcomplete,' coming full-circle, yet broken by the earth that bounds the angle's open side, and continued within the earth itself. As we turn to leave, we see these walls stretching into the distance, directing us to the Washington Monument, to the left, and the Lincoln Memorial, to the right, thus bringing the Vietnam Memorial into an historical context. We the living are brought to a concrete realization of these deaths. \\"Brought to a sharp awareness of such a loss, it is up to each individual to resolve or come to terms with this loss. For death, is in the end a personal and private matter, and the area contained with this memorial is a quiet place, meant for personal reflection and private reckoning. The black granite walls, each two hundred feet long, and ten feet below ground at their lowest point (gradually ascending toward ground level) effectively act as a sound barrier, yet are of such a height and length so as not to appear threatening or enclosing. The actual area is wide and shallow, allowing for a sense of privacy, and the sunlight from the memorial's southern exposure along with the grassy park surrounding and within its walls, contribute to the serenity of the area. Thus this memorial is for those who have died, and for us to remember them. \\"The memorial's origin is located approximately at the center of the site; its legs each extending two hundred feet towards the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The walls, contained on one side by the earth, are ten feet below ground at their point of origin, gradually lessening in height, until they finally recede totally into the earth, at their ends. The walls are to be made of a hard, polished black granite, with the names to be carved in a simple Trojan letter. The memorial's construction involves recontouring the area within the wall's boundaries, so as to provide for an easily accessible descent, but as much of the site as possible should be left untouched. The area should remain as a park, for all to enjoy.\\"http://vvmf.org/Design Construction The ground-breaking of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in March 1982. Construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial began on March 16, 1982, though the official ground-breaking was on Friday, March 26, 1982. The construction was finished in late October 1982. The memorial was formally dedicated on November 13, 1982. The Three Soldiers statue by Frederick Hart was added in 1984, and the Vietnam Women's Memorial was added in 1993. Controversy The various elements of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial complex on the National Mall have been a subject of numerous controversies revolving around design issues. Probably no other major US memorial has been as controversial. This perhaps partially reflects the controversial nature of the war itself.  Today  Today, the VVMF continues to support the maintenance of the Memorial, though the memorial itself is maintained by National Park Service staff and some military representatives. It also funds the addition of new names to the Wall and creating directories of names currently on the Wall. WWW.VVMF.ORG The Wall That Heals The Wall That Heals is a traveling half-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial started in 1996. It also features a Traveling Museum and Information Center. The Education Center at The Wall The Education Center at The Wall is the newest initiative of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Approved by Congress in 2003 the Education Center is going to be a two-story underground facility adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The Wall of Faces In 2017, the group announced an initiative to find pictures of all those whose names are on The Wall. The group wants to have digital images and profiles for every veteran as part of its planned Education Center. The nonprofit wants to have computers within the Education Center to link names with a digital photo and service background, as well as an online feature displaying names engraved on The Wall with a photo and profile for those who want to know more but are not present at the memorial. As of 2019, digital images of Vietnam Veterans can be found on the VVMF website and visitors can post remembrances about that person.https://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/ See also *Vietnam Veterans Memorial *The Education Center at The Wall ReferencesExternal links * Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund (official website) * The Education Center at The Wall Category:Memorial funds Category:Vietnam Veterans Memorial ","title":"Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund"},{"id":"2748360","text":"Moon Over Miami may refer to: * Moon Over Miami (film), 1941 musical * Moon Over Miami (TV series), 1993 drama/crime series * Moon Over Miami (song), 1935 song by Joe Burke and Edgar Leslie * Moon Over Miami (script), a film script written to portray the Abscam Operation * Moons Over My Hammy, a breakfast sandwich from Denny's ","title":"Moon Over Miami"},{"id":"2748366","text":"Lipps Island is a small rocky island west of Litchfield Island, off the southwest coast of Anvers Island, off the Antarctic Peninsula.

Gas was one of many such comics emulating the success of Viz, and like many of its peers (and unlike its upmarket siblings Brain Damage and Talking Turkey) was a crude copycat of the format Viz pioneered. Initially, many strips were clearly rejected from Viz; many set in Viz's fictional town of Fulchester, but with the 'F' tippexed out (thus Gas appeared to be set in Ulchester). These strips were often of extremely poor quality, both in terms of artwork and plotting. As the title matured, however, strips submitted for Gas became more common and the production quality increased. A number of strips from Gas resurfaced in the comic UT which ran for 18 months from 1991. Gas ran until Volume 3, number 10 (issue 34) Strips included: * The Gas Family - the title strip, an antisocial mother, father, and son, with offensive body odour * Arthur Pilkington - Chartered Barbarian - Pilkington was a bespectacled barbarian accountant in the days of Genghis Khan who got up to many finance-related shenanigans. Written and drawn by David Leach, who later sold the same idea and redrew some of the same strips for the adult humour magazine UT. David also drew several of the later issue covers for Gas in the style of the great EC comics. * Phallas The Soap Opera, Tales Of Nambygate and Hollywood Babbling by Kev F. Sutherland, who also drew many one-off strips for the comic. * Val Downer by Kipps Webb - Adventures of a perpetual pessimist and depressive. Ended with the entire cast being killed off, but subsequently returned in UT. * Star Squad - Science fiction strip by Charlie Brooker. * The Scum - Strip by Geoff Thompson about the staff of a tabloid newspaper. * The Famous Five were parodied in a regular strip which also sent up different art styles, ranging from Pre-Raphaelite to superhero comics. * Roy of the Rogers - Footballing comic strip set in the Wild West, based on a meld of Roy of the Rovers and Roy Rogers. * Senile Delinquents - misadventures of a group of pensioners. * The Pigs - Cartoon about corrupt and violent police officers, drawn as pigs. * Wor Jackie - A long running problem page featuring Jackie Charlton, at this time manager of the Republic of Ireland football squad. Readers would typically offer varied domestic problems, Charlton's answers would frequently liken all life's problems to events on a football pitch. * Dan Dross - adult parody of Dan Dare, drawn by Malcolm Douglas. The cartoonist Dave Colton contributed many 'one off' strips and cartoons to the comic, including a small strip about the inept GP, Doctor Bastard. Other frequent contributors included David Haldane, Anthony Smith, Ed McHenry and Davy Francis.

Early life The son of Jewish immigrants from Austria, Heatter was born and raised in Brooklyn. Young Heatter, who found school difficult but had a passion for reading, became a sidewalk-campaigner for William Randolph Hearst during Hearst's 1906 mayoral campaign. After his high school graduation, Heatter became a society reporter for the tiny weekly, The East New York Record before joining the Brooklyn Daily Times, which led to his being offered a job with Hearst's New York Journal. To the air In December 1932, he was invited by Donald Flamm, the owner of New York's WMCA, to debate a Socialist on radio, and when the Socialist was unable to make the date, Heatter had the program almost to himself. His performance impressed both Flamm and listeners. A few months later, he went to work for WOR, as a reporter and commentator. His audience expanded when in 1934, WOR became the flagship station of the newest network, Mutual Broadcasting. Heatter covered the trial of Bruno Hauptmann, the man accused of kidnapping the infant son of aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. In 1936, he had to report on Hauptmann's execution. It was delayed, which forced Heatter to continue ad-libbing while he awaited word of when it would occur. His professionalism under pressure and his ability to keep the audience informed without resorting to sensationalism earned him critical praise. On January 11, 1948, Heatter's Sunday night program changed format and title. As Brighter Tomorrow, the show had focused on \\"typical American success stories.\\" In Behind the Front Page (the new title), a dramatic format was used to portray \\"current human interest stories.\\" The weekly program was in addition to Heatter's 15 min nightly newscast, both on Mutual. \\"There's good news tonight!\\" During World War II, American forces sank a Japanese destroyer. Heatter opened his nightly commentary accordingly, \\"Good evening, everyone‚Äîthere is good news tonight.\\" The phrase sparked a small flurry of letters and calls, almost all in his favor. Heatter was already well known for trying to find uplifting but true stories to feed his commentaries (he was especially known for a fondness for stories about heroic dogs). In April 1939, he gave the first national broadcast exposure to the burgeoning self-help group Alcoholics Anonymous. Reflecting that reputation, the critic and sometime rival Alexander Woollcott composed the doggerel couplet: \\"Disaster has no cheerier greeter/than gleeful, gloating Gabriel Heatter.\\" Later life Heatter remained with Mutual until, like many of the Depression and wartime broadcasters and commentators, his influence gave way to a newer generation of broadcasters, who made the transition to television or started in television and bypassed radio entirely. Heatter retired in 1961.1960 - 1966: Call it 3MBS In 1915, he married Sadie Hermalin, who died in 1966. After his wife's death, Heatter lived in retirement in Miami, Florida with his daughter until he died of pneumonia in 1972. His daughter is the cookbook writer Maida Heatter. His granddaughter was the artist Toni Evans. His son is the novelist Basil Heatter. His nephew Merrill Heatter is a television writer and producer (Heatter-Quigley Productions). In popular culture In 1944, Heatter appeared as himself uncredited in the wartime Cary Grant film Once Upon a Time. In 1950, he appeared as himself in the Ronald Colman comedy movie Champagne for Caesar. Heatter was also heard but not seen as one of four broadcast journalists portraying themselves in the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still. Heatter is referred to in the recited portion of Yogi Yorgesson's 1949 comedy song \\"I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas.\\" Jean Arthur's character in the 1948 film A Foreign Affair mentions Heatter by saying, \\"I will [go to the General], and to the War Department and to the President.

Egaeus, who is preparing to marry his cousin Berenice, tends to fall into periods of intense focus, during which he seems to separate himself from the outside world. Berenice begins to deteriorate from an unnamed disease until only her teeth remain healthy. Egaeus obsesses over them. When Berenice is buried, he continues to contemplate her teeth. One day, he awakens with an uneasy feeling from a trance-like state and hears screams. A servant reports that Berenice's grave has been disturbed, and she is still alive. Beside Egaeus is a shovel, a poem about \\"visiting the grave of my beloved\\", and a box containing 32 teeth. Contemporary readers were horrified by the story's violence and complained to the editor of the Messenger. Although Poe later published a self-censored version of the work, he believed the story should be judged solely by how many copies it sold. Plot summary The narrator Egaeus, a studious young man, grows up in a large, gloomy mansion with his cousin Berenice. He suffers from a type of obsessive disorder, a monomania that makes him fixate on objects. Originally beautiful, Berenice suffers from an unspecified degenerative illness, of which periods of catalepsy, are a symptom, which he refers to as a \\"trance\\". Nevertheless, they are due to be married. One afternoon, Egaeus sees Berenice as he sits in the library. When she smiles, he focuses on her teeth. His obsession grips him, and for days he drifts in and out of awareness, constantly thinking about her teeth. He imagines himself holding the teeth and turning them over to examine them from all angles. At one point, a servant tells him that Berenice has died and shall be buried. When he next becomes aware, with an inexplicable terror, he finds a lamp and a small box in front of him. Another servant enters, reporting that a grave has been violated, and a shrouded disfigured body found, still alive. Egaeus finds that his clothes are covered in mud and blood, and he opens the box to find that it contains dental instruments and \\"thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances\\": Berenice's teeth. The Latin epigraph, \\"Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas\\" at the head of the text may be translated as: \\"My companions said to me, if I would visit the grave of my friend, I might somewhat alleviate my worries.\\"Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas. From Ibn Zaiat. The second part of the poem is Dixi autem, an ideo aliud praeter hoc pectus habet sepulchrum? :My companions said to me, if I would visit the grave of my friend, I might somewhat alleviate my worries. I answered \\"could she be buried elsewhere than in my heart?\\" From \\"The Works of Sir William Jones, Vol. 2\\", London 1799 This quotation is also seen by Egaeus in an open book towards the end of the story. Analysis In \\"Berenice\\", Poe was following the popular traditions of Gothic fiction, a genre well-followed by American and British readers for several decades.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 111. Poe, however, made his Gothic stories more sophisticated, dramatizing terror by using more realistic images.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. Cooper Square Press, 1992. p. 77. This story is one of Poe's most violent. As the narrator looks at the box which he may subconsciously know contains his cousin's teeth, he asks himself, \\"Why... did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?\\" Poe does not actually include the scene where the teeth are pulled out. The reader also knows that Egaeus was in a trance-like state at the time, incapable of responding to evidence that his cousin was still alive as he committed the gruesome act. Additionally, the story emphasizes that all 32 of her teeth were removed. The main theme lies in the question that Egaeus asks himself: \\"How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?\\"Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 114. Poe also uses a character afflicted with monomania for the first time, a device he uses many times again. Teeth are used symbolically in many of Poe's stories to symbolize mortality. Other uses include the \\"sepulchral and disgusting\\" horse's teeth in \\"Metzengerstein\\", lips writhing about the teeth of the mesmerized man in \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\", and the sound of grating teeth in \\"Hop-Frog\\".Kennedy, J. Gerald. Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1987. p. 79 Egaeus and Berenice are both representative characters. Egaeus, literally born in the library, represents intellectualism. He is a quiet, lonely man whose obsession only emphasizes his interest on thought and study. Berenice is a more physical character, described as \\"roaming carelessly through life\\" and \\"agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy.\\" She is, however, an oppressed woman, having \\"spoke no word\\" throughout the story. Her only purpose, as with many of Poe's female characters, is to be beautiful and to die.Weekes, Karen. \\"Poe's Feminine Ideal,\\" as collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe. New York City: Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 150 Egaeus loses his interest in the full person of Berenice as she gets sick; she becomes an object to analyze, not to admire. He dehumanizes her by describing \\"the\\" forehead of Berenice, rather than \\"her\\" forehead.Weekes, Karen. \\"Poe's feminine ideal,\\" collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 155. Poe may have used the names of the two characters to call to mind the conventions of ancient Greek tragedy. Berenice's name (which means \\"bringer of victory\\") comes from a poem by Callimachus. In the poem, Berenice promises her hair to Aphrodite if her husband returns from war safely. Egaeus may come from Aegeus, a legendary king of Athens who had committed suicide when he thought his son Theseus had died attempting to kill the Minotaur. The final lines of the story are purposely protracted using a series of conjunctions connecting multiple clauses.

Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 113. Incidentally, this is one of the few Poe stories whose narrator is named. =Major themes= Several often-repeated themes in Poe's works are found in this story: *The death of a beautiful woman (see also \\"Ligeia\\", \\"Morella\\", \\"The Oval Portrait\\", \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\") *Being buried alive (see also \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"The Premature Burial\\" ‚Äì being buried alive is also very briefly mentioned in \\"How to Write a Blackwood Article\\" as a source of possible inspiration for The Signora Psyche Zenobia) *Mental illness (see also \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\") *Catalepsy (see also \\"The Premature Burial\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\") Publication history and critical response First published in the relatively genteel Southern Literary MessengerSilverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 110. in March 1835. Many readers were shocked by the violence in \\"Berenice\\" and complained to publisher Thomas W. White,Whalen, Terence. \\"Poe and the American Publishing Industry\\" as collected in A Historical Guide to Edgar Allan Poe, edited by J. Gerald Kennedy. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 69. leading to an edited version eventually being published in 1840. The four removed paragraphs describe a scene where Egaeus visits Berenice before her burial and clearly sees that she is still alive as she moves her finger and smiles. Poe disagreed with the complaints. A month after \\"Berenice\\" was published, he wrote to White saying that many magazines achieved fame because of similar stories. Whether in bad taste or not, he said it was his goal to be appreciated, and \\"to be appreciated you must be read.\\" He admitted, \\"I allow that it approaches the very verge of bad taste ‚Äì but I will not sin quite so egregiously again.\\" Even so, Poe also emphasized that its final judgment should come not from the taste of the reading public but on the circulation of the magazine. Adaptations Director Eric Rohmer directed and took the lead in his 1954 short film adaptation of \\"Berenice\\" entitled \\"B√©r√©nice\\", filmed in 16 mm black and white with cinematography by Jacques Rivette. CBS Radio Mystery Theater presented an adapted version of the story for its radio play \\"Berenice\\" as its January 9, 1975 episode. It was directed by Himan Brown, Adapted by George Lowther, starring Michael Tolan, Norman Rose, Joan Lovejoy, and Roberta Maxwell. Vincent Price performed \\"Berenice\\" on his 1975 album The Imp of the Perverse and Other Tales (Caedmon Records TC‚Äî1450). On the same LP Price also read \\"Morella\\" and \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\". All three Poe stories were re-issued in 2000 on the Harper Collins 5-CD set, The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection. The 1995 computer game The Dark Eye contains reenactments of selected stories by Poe. One of them is based on \\"Berenice\\" and allows the player to experience the story from the alternating points of view of both Egaeus and Berenice.

The new system was built using Smalltalk and GemStone. The software development techniques invented and employed on this project are of interest in the history of software engineering. C3 has been referenced in several books on the extreme programming (XP) methodology. The software went live in 1997 paying around ten thousand people. The project continued, intending to take on a larger proportion of the payroll but new development was stopped in 1999. Project history The C3 project started in 1993 by Tom Hadfield, Director of Payroll Systems, under the direction of CIO Susan Unger. The initial spark for the project was a small object-oriented prototype built by Hadfield. Smalltalk development was initiated in 1994. The end goal was to build a new system to support all payroll processing for 87,000 employees by 1999. In 1996 Kent Beck was hired to get the thing working; at this point the system had not printed a single paycheck. Beck in turn brought in Ron Jeffries. In March 1996 the development team estimated the system would be ready to go into production around one year later. In 1997 the development team adopted a way of working which is now formalized as Extreme Programming. The one-year delivery target was nearly achieved, with actual delivery being a couple of months late; the small delay being primarily due to lack of clarity regarding some business requirements. A few months after this first launch, the project's customer representative ‚Äî a key role in the Extreme Programming methodology ‚Äî quit due to burnout and stress, and couldn't be replaced. The plan was to roll out the system to different payroll 'populations' in stages, but C3 never managed to make another release despite two more years' development. The C3 system paid 9,000 people, representing the \\"vast majority of monthly Chrysler salaries.\\" Performance was something of a problem; during development it looked like it would take 1000 hours to run the payroll, but profiling activities reduced this to around 40 hours; another month's effort reduced this to 18 hours and by the time the system was launched the figure was 12 hours. During the first year of production the performance was improved to 9 hours. Chrysler was bought out by Daimler-Benz in 1998, after the merger the company was known as DaimlerChrysler. DaimlerChrysler stopped the C3 project on 1 February 2000. Frank Gerhardt, a manager at the company, announced to the XP conference in 2000 that DaimlerChrysler had de facto banned XP after shutting down C3; however, some time later DaimlerChrysler resumed the use of XP.

His father was John Wesley Fisher, a clergyman, his mother was Glendora Williamson Fisher, and he had two siblings. Fisher married Jane Ryder, a school teacher from Washington, D.C. in 1925, and they had one son, Hugh, who was born in 1926 and was also nicknamed \\"The New Negro\\" as a tribute to the Harlem renaissance. Early life Born May 9, 1897, in Washington, D.C., Rudolph Fisher grew up in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the youngest of three children born to Reverend John Wesley Fisher, a Baptist pastor, and Glendora Williamson Fisher. Fisher ‚Äì on April 14, 1923, in Manhattan ‚Äì married Jane Ryder, a public school teacher ‚Äì a year after meeting her. They had one child, a son, Hugh Ryder Fisher (1926‚Äì1964).  School  Fisher graduated from Classical High School in 1915 with honors and further went to Brown University where he studied English and biology, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Delta Sigma Rho, and Sigma Xi. [3] [4] During this time, he earned his Bachelor of Arts from Brown in 1919, where he delivered the valedictory address and received a Master of Arts a year later. After graduating from Brown, Fisher took part in a Manhattan-based program titled \\"Four Negro Commencement Speakers\\" where he read his Brown commencement speech, \\"The Emancipation of Science\\". At Howard Medical School, he studied Radiology. He later attended medical school at Howard University in Washington D.C, graduating with honors in 1924. Then, he came to New York City in 1925 to take up a fellowship of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University's college, during which time he published two scientific articles of his research on treating Bacteriophage viruses with ultraviolet light. In addition to researching and writing in medical and literary fields, Fischer also pursued his love for jazz. He played the piano and wrote musical scores. Fisher's ability to use all of his talents simultaneously was evident during his college years. The summer after his college graduation, he and Paul Robeson toured along the East Coast as a band.  Medical career  Fisher was successful in both the literature and medical field. During the 1920s, he published his research on the effect of ultraviolet rays on viruses in medical journals. He was a head researcher at Manhattan's International Hospital. Also, he opened his own private practice. During this time, he continued to write his novels, poetry, and articles.[5] His experience in the medical field helped him to get ideas for his writing on mystery, for it helped to illustrate human body.[6] After his fellowship ended, he had a private practice on Long Island. In 1927, Fisher became superintendent of the International Hospital in Harlem, and set up his private practice as a radiologist, with an X-ray laboratory of his own, in New York.  Literary career  Fisher started his professional writing career by contributing to his articles and to journals, such as \\"National Association for the Advanced of Colored People's (NAACP)\\"[7] and his first contribution to magazines \\"The Crisis\\".[8]Fisher's first novel \\"Walls of Jericho\\" came out in 1928. He was inspired by a friend's challenge to write this novel treating both the upper and lower classes of black Harlem equally. This novel presents a vision that African American men and women can both get ahead in life if they come together and form a bond against centuries of oppression. He then went on in 1932 to write \\"The Conjure Man Dies\\", the first novel with a black detective as well as the first detective novel with only black characters. This novel was also set in Harlem.[19] His novel was publicized by Covici-Friede making him the second African American to write a detective novel in the United States. He also wrote two short stories, the first of the two \\"City of Refuge\\", appeared in the Atlantic Monthly of February 1925, and the second, \\"Vestiges\\" both appeared in Alain Locke's anthology. These two short stories accurately depicted life and events during the Harlem Renaissance. Fisher's last published work, \\"Miss Cynthie\\" appeared in story magazine in 1933. It was a short story about a Southern migrant grandmother, Miss Cynthie. She arrived in Harlem to meet her successful grandson. She was a hard-working and religious woman who had raised her grandson in the South. She expected him to have established himself as a member of the black professional society. What she did not know was that his success emerged from being an entertainer in a theater which she viewed to be a sinful place. Although she is against what he does, she comes to realize that he has developed into an honest young man. Other short stories written by Rudolph Fisher are, High Yaller in 1926, Blades of Steel in 1927, Ringtail, The South still lingers on, Fire by night, The promise land The Caucasian storms Harlem in 1927 and Common meter in 1930.[20] As Oliver Henry states, \\"Fisher writes about black people in a manner which expresses their kinship with other peoples. He underscores and highlights the fundamental human condition of black Americans. ... He captures the historically induced unique qualities of black people; but, and perhaps even more importantly, he writes of them basically as people.\\"[21]  Participation in Pan-Africanism  Throughout his career, Fisher had an interest in Pan- Africanism, which is a movement that aims to encourage and strengthen unity of all African-Americans. It started in 1900. Rudolph Fisher supported Pan- African congress participants promoted colonized Africans to elect their own governments in order to gain of political power as a necessary prerequisite for complete social, economic and political emancipation. Unlike Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and W.E. B. DuBois who tried to put the stereotypes of black exoticism in Pan-African, Rudolph Fisher worked on articulating the broader struggle for black labor privilege, and women's empowerment. Principal works Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen adapted The Conjure Man Dies for the stage two years after Fisher's death. The Federal Theatre Project production starring Dooley Wilson (center) and Lionel Monagas (left) ran March‚ÄìApril 1936 at the Lafayette Theatre, Harlem. = \\"The City of Refuge\\" (1925) = Rudolph Fisher's story \\"The City of Refuge\\" is centered around a Southern black man named King Solomon Gillis and his migration to Harlem, New York from North Carolina to escape lynching. Gillis is amazed by the opportunity and freedom he sees when he first arrives in Harlem. Gillis meets a man named Uggam who helps him settle into Harlem and gets him a \\"job\\". Fisher presents the idea of a migrant's adjustment to the city during \\"Negro Harlem\\" and the race relations along the way. The story concludes with Gillis being duped by Uggam into selling \\"medicine\\" (drugs) for him and gets ratted on, leading him to be arrested. An interpretation of the themes explored in this short story is similar to what is found in Alain Locke's anthology, The New Negro: transformation and self-expression. In comparison, Gillis transitions by the end of the story because when he first arrives in Harlem, \\"city of refuge\\", Gillis sees Harlem as a place of hope and freedom. He wanted to have the chance to achieve liberation and be set free from social and political restrictions from the place he originally came from. Instead, Gillis' experience with Harlem mirrors the South during the time as the beliefs of race and status fill the assumptions that the people of the city contain. \\"The City of Refuge\\" and another short story, \\"Vestiges\\", were included in Alain Locke's anthology, The New Negro: An Interpretation.In 1991, a collection of Fisher's short fiction, City of Refuge: The Collected Stories of Rudolph Fisher, was published by the University of Missouri Press. = \\"High Yaller\\" (1925) = Story about lightskin woman facing difficulties of cross-identity. = The Walls of Jericho (1928) = The Walls of Jericho, Fisher's first novel, is about black life in Harlem. = The Conjure Man Dies (1932) = The Conjure-Man Dies is Fisher's last novel, about Harlem in 1930s. This novel is the most slightly cared of texts. The main character, \\"N. Frimbo\\", a mystical psychist and an old African King. He is discovered dead at his conjure table one evening. Perry Dart, a detective of the Harlem police department, and Dr. John Archer, a physician start to investigate the mysterious murder. The plot gets more complex when Frimbo's dead body is gone and comes back alive as Frimbo. Perry Dart and Dr. John keep searching for the murder suspect. = \\"Miss Cynthie\\" (1933) = \\"Miss Cynthie\\" is a short story, published in 1933 in Story Magazine. In the story, Miss Cynthie, arrives in New York city from Waxhaw, South Carolina. She has come to Harlem to meet her proudful grandson, Dave Tappen, whom she raised after his mother's death. Miss Cynthie thought that her grandson was successful, so she expected him to be a doctor, a dentist, or an undertaker. However, her grandson has chosen a career in theater. As a religious old woman, she is heartbroken. One day, Dave saw Miss Cynthie singing in the other room. Dave decides to lead her to a theater. Dave left Cynthie on a stage and she didn't know he left. Dave appears on the stage and sings a song that Cynthie taught him when he was a child. Miss Cynthie realizes how much her grandson adores her and remembers their past. This story reflects issues of the Great Migration, music and theater of Harlem, religion, and the shift from the \\"old\\" to the new \\"youth\\" in the Harlem Renaissance.

Synopsis Sisters Kay and Barbara Latimer are working as carhops in a Texas drive-in restaurant with their aunt Susan, the cook, when they are notified that an expected inheritance of $55,000 is only $4,000 after taxes and fees. Determined to marry a millionaire, Kay talks Barbara and Susan into spending the money on a trip to Miami, where she hopes to hook a rich man at a resort. With Barbara posing as Kay's secretary and Susan as her maid, the three women check into the Flamingo Hotel and make the acquaintance of Jack O'Hara, a bartender who pontificates about his hatred of fortune hunters. Jack, who quickly becomes enamored with Susan, believes that Kay is on the level and promises to steer her away from gold diggers. Kay finagles an invitation to a party being hosted by rich Jeffrey Bolton, and while there, also meets Phil McNeil, heir to the renowned McNeil Mines. Boyhood friends Jeff and Phil begin a fierce rivalry for Kay, who cannot make up her mind between the two handsome men, nor does she notice that Barbara has fallen in love with Jeff. At the end of three weeks, the women are in trouble because they need $150 to pay their hotel bill, but Susan borrows the money from Jack, who has proposed to her. Realizing that she needs to get one of the men to propose to her that evening, Kay brings Barbara along to a dance to keep one of them occupied. Kay gets Barbara to dance with Jeff while she talks with Phil, with whom she has fallen in love. Phil admits to her that he is broke, and that the McNeil Mines will not be profitable again for at least five years. Kay confesses that she, too, came to Miami to find a rich spouse, and the pair reluctantly agrees to pursue other partners. Phil tells Jeff that Kay loves him, after which she accepts Jeff's proposal. As the women are packing to leave for Jeff's father's island, however, Jack overhears them talking about their scheme and threatens to tell Jeff. After locking Jack in the bathroom, the women leave for the island, where they meet William, Jeff's businessman father. Desperate to see Kay again, Phil goes to the island and volunteers to be Jeff's best man. The women are also stunned by the arrival of Jack, who threatens to tell all if he determines that Kay does not really love Jeff. On the night of a party that Jeff is throwing for Kay, Barbara encourages Jeff to accept a challenging job in South America to escape from under his father's shadow, while Phil admits to Kay that he loves her. As Phil is trying to persuade Kay that they belong together no matter what, Jeff enters the room. Phil and Kay explain that they are going to get married, and Jeff acknowledges that he has loved Barbara all along and will marry her. Soon all ends well, as Susan and Jack also come to a romantic conclusion, and the three couples begin their lives together.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

History Litchfield Island was surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1955. It was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) for Douglas B. Litchfield of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), general assistant and mountaineer at the Arthur Harbour station in 1955, who helped with the local survey and made numerous soundings through the sea ice in the vicinity of the island. Environment The island, together with its littoral zone, possesses an unusually high collection of marine and terrestrial life and is unique amongst the neighboring islands as a breeding place for six species of native birds. It provides an outstanding example of the natural ecological system of the Antarctic Peninsula area. In addition, Litchfield Island possesses rich growths of vegetation and has the most varied topography and the greatest diversity of terrestrial habitats of the islands in Arthur Harbour. For these reasons, it was designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) in 1975 and is currently known as ASPA 113. =Important Bird Area= The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 50 pairs of south polar skuas. Other birds nesting at the site include brown skuas, southern giant petrels, Wilson's storm petrels, Antarctic terns and kelp gulls. Formerly, some 1000 pairs of Ad√©lie penguins also bred there.

It was built in 1889 and designed as a multi-use facility with space for city administration offices as well as police and fire departments. The building was planned by architect Smith Hoag and built by contractor Simon Brink for a cost of $25,000. Today, the City of Woodstock still owns the building, but the building is used exclusively as a performance space. In 2013, the stage was dedicated to Orson Welles, who grew up in Woodstock and performed at the venue during his formative years.  History  The Opera House was built in 1889 to house the library, council room, justice court, fire department and second floor auditorium for the City of Woodstock. The Patti Rosa Company provided the inaugural performance of Margery Daw on Thursday, September 4, 1890. The Opera House became McHenry County‚Äôs center for entertainment hosting touring vaudeville, minstrel and dramatic companies. When the traveling circuits disappeared in the early 20th century, the Opera House became the site for the Chicago-area's first, however short-lived, summer stock theatre. Presented by the Todd School for Boys, The Todd Theatre Festival of 1934 was a six-week summer festival organized by Orson Welles, a 1931 graduate of the school. Three plays were presented ‚Äî Trilby, Hamlet and Tsar Paul ‚Äî featuring Welles, Hilton Edwards and Miche√°l MacLiamm√≥ir of Dublin's Gate Theatre, Louise Prussing, Charles O'Neal and Constance Heron.Tarbox, Todd, Orson Welles and Roger Hill: A Friendship in Three Acts.

The stage of the Woodstock Opera House was dedicated to Welles in 2013, and the Woodstock Opera House hosted an 80th anniversary celebration of the Todd Theatre Festival. In 1947, a group of citizens formed and supported the Woodstock Players. For several years the Players, provided acting experience for students graduation from the Goodman School. Now-famous personalities Paul Newman, Tom Bosley, Betsy Palmer, Geraldine Page, Shelley Berman and Lois Nettleton were among the more notable personalities. Entrance In 1968, the Town Square Players was established. They were incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1973. In 1974, the Woodstock Musical Theatre Company was founded and made the Opera House their home. Both companies still perform regular seasons at the Opera House every year. Architecture Erected in 1889, the Opera House was designed and constructed by Elgin-based architect Smith Hoag at a cost of $25,000. The construction materials are mostly of local origin including limestone, terra cotta, fieldstone, white brick, and sandstone. Its architectural style is a mixture of late Victorian-era tastes combined with Early American, Midwestern, Gothic, and even Moorish elements. The interior is modeled after the showboats of the time, with dimensions and decorations that imitate many of those grand floating theatres. In 1960, the Junior Civic Arts League invested time and effort to battle the increasing deterioration of the auditorium and stage. The Woodstock Fine Arts Association was formed in 1961 with the purpose of restoring the Opera House through the next decade. Woodstock Opera House In 1972, the Opera House was declared a \\"landmark\\" by the city and the Woodstock Opera House Community Center, Inc. was formed to raise funds for a restoration effort. The Opera House was later closed for two years of restoration work. It reopened in February 1977 and was renamed the Woodstock Opera House Community Center. Additional restoration projects were finished over the next two decades and the Opera House was considered fully restored with the final addition of the front Portico in 1999. The building continues to be owned and maintained by the City of Woodstock and local residents. It features historic furnishings, stained glass windows, tin ceilings, original woodwork and hand drawn stencil ornamentations. In 2003, a new annex was completed and added to the Opera House on its adjacent lot. It provides disability access to the stage, a freight elevator, additional back stage areas, offices and the Stage Left Caf√©. The Orson Welles Stage was dedicated February 10, 2013, honoring the site of Welles's American debut as a professional theatre director.  Current operations  Balcony Seating Area The Woodstock Opera House hosts a variety of programming and events each year including concerts, theatrical plays, dance, visual arts, educational programming, lectures, meetings, receptions, and more. Situated on the historic square in downtown Woodstock, the Opera House is one of the oldest continuously operating theatres in the country. The Opera House is a fully modernized theatre while retaining its historical character. It features contemporary sound, lighting, stage rigging, heating, air-conditioning and other amenities and is owned and operated by the City of Woodstock.  Cinema  A scene from Groundhog Day The venue is featured prominently in the film Groundhog Day (which was filmed primarily in Woodstock) as The Pennsylvanian Hotel.

The economy of the town has traditionally been based on the furniture industry. Its name comes from the river of the same name which crosses the comune in a north-south direction. Seveso received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on 18 June 2003.  Geography  The town is situated to the north of Milan in the Brianza lowlands. The territory of the commume is highly urbanised, with the majority of inhabitants living in the town. Seveso lies on the national trunk road Statale dei Giovi, which connects Milan to Como and on the Milan-Meda motorway. Seveso railway station is located on the Milan‚ÄìAsso railway, while Seveso-Baruccana railway station is located on the Saronno‚ÄìSeregno railway. Neighbouring communes are Meda, Seregno, Barlassina, Cogliate, Cesano Maderno.  History  Seveso's origins date back to about the 3rd century BC, when certain areas around Brianza were used as military staging posts for the Roman conquest of Gaul. Towards 780, the monastery at Meda was founded, the jurisdiction of which extended to the territory of Seveso. In 1252 the church of Saint Peter Martyr (S. Pietro Martire) was constructed in homage to the Dominican order brother who had been assassinated in Seveso. The Church of the Seminary preserves in its crypt the knife which was used to kill him. The town was struck in the 16th century by two episodes of famine and plague. During the 17th century, the town was ruled by several families, of which the Arese family left a number of outstanding monuments. In 1798, Prince Giuseppe II of the Napoleonic Cisalpine Republic ordered the Dominicans to leave the monastery and church of Saint Peter. In the unification of the Kingdom of Italy, territory from Barlassina was passed to Seveso. This decision was rejected by the population and the two comuni were again separated in 1901. Seveso made world headlines when, on 10 July 1976, storage vessels at the ICMESA chemical plant ruptured, releasing several kilograms of the dioxin TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) into the atmosphere. Tens of thousands of farm animals and pets died or were later deliberately slaughtered, though it is believed that there was not a single human death directly attributable to the incident. The event came later to be known as the Seveso disaster, which later became the eponym for the European Commission's Seveso directive. Nowadays in the main contaminated area there is a park called \\"Bosco delle Querce\\" (Wood of Oaks).  In popular culture The track \\"Suffocation\\", in the 1980 album See You Later by Greek composer Vangelis, was inspired by the Seveso disaster. Another song, \\"Canzone per Seveso\\", in the 1976 album Ull√†lla by Antonello Venditti, was written for Seveso.

Ontario Lacus is the dark feature at centre-left. Radar image of Titan's south polar region, showing Ontario Lacus and surroundings. In the annotated version, the putative shoreline of a proposed former south polar sea of Titan is outlined. Ontario Lacus is a lake composed of methane, ethane and propane near the south pole of Saturn's moon Titan. Its character as a hydrocarbon lake was confirmed by observations from the Cassini spacecraft, published in the 31 July 2008 edition of Nature. Ontario Lacus has a surface area of about , about 20% smaller than its terrestrial namesake, Lake Ontario in North America. In April 2012, it was announced that it may be more like a mudflat or salt pan.Cassini Finds Titan Lake is Like a Namibia Mudflat - NASA Shorelines On January 12, 2010, Cassini took a more detailed radar-image of Ontario Lacus showing numerous remarkable features. The northern shoreline features low hills, probably about 1 kilometer (3,000 feet) high, and flooded river valleys. A smooth wave-sculpted shoreline, like on the southeast side of Lake Michigan, can be seen at the northeast part of the lake. Smooth lines parallel to the current shoreline could be formed by low waves over time, which were likely driven by winds sweeping in from the west or southwest. The southeast shore features a round-headed bay intruding into the shore. The middle part of the western shoreline shows the first well-developed river delta observed on Titan, showing that liquid hydrocarbons flowing down from a higher plain have switched channels on their way into the lake, forming at least two lobes. Examples of this kind of channel switching and wave-modified deltas can be found on Earth at the south end of Lake Albert between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa and in the remains of an ancient lake known as Megachad in the African country Chad. Shore recession  Infrared observations show that the southwest shoreline of the lake receded 9‚Äì11 km over four years (2005-2009), evidently due to evaporation during the dry southern hemisphere autumn. Over the same interval, no change was observed in the south or southeast shorelines, indicating steeper slopes there. The sizes of northern hemisphere lakes and maria, in contrast, have been much more stable. Depth By terrestrial standards, the lake appears to be extremely shallow. Radar measurements made in July 2009 and January 2010 indicate an average depth of 0.4 ‚Äì 3.2 m, and a maximum depth of 2.9 ‚Äì 7.4 m. This gives the lake an estimated volume of 7 to 50 km3, less than one thirtieth the volume of Earth's Lake Ontario. The notoriously shallow Lake Okeechobee in Florida has a similar depth.  Geomorphology and hydrology  The left and right images show the large catchment areas of Lake Eyre (dark grey region) and Ontario Lacus (red outline) respectively. In both cases, the lake area (blue, dashed ovals) is much smaller than the catchment area. Ontario Lacus may resemble a semi-arid shallow depression lying in an alluvial fan where the water table height (of liquid hydrocarbons) rises above the elevation of the depression floor, analogous to the Etosha Pan in Namibia. Hydrological runoff models have found evidence for an extensive basin catchment area for the lake, suggesting seasonal rainfall may be responsible for filling liquids in the local depression. This situation may be analogous to the ephemeral filling of Lake Eyre in Australia due to its notably large catchment area and the semi- arid climate of central Australia. Waves Any waves on the lake are also far smaller than those that would be on a sizable body of liquid water on Earth; their estimated maximum height was less than 3 mm during observations of a radar specular reflection during Cassini's T49 flyover of July 2009. On Titan, waves can be generated at lower wind speeds than on Earth, due to the four times greater atmospheric density, and should be seven times higher at a given wind speed, due to Titan's surface gravity being one seventh as strong. On the other hand, pure liquid methane is only half as dense as water and may not be dense enough to form a wave in the first place, comparable of building a sand castle with bone dry sand. Alternatively, the lack of waves could indicate either wind speeds less than 0.5 m/s, or an unexpectedly viscous composition of the hydrocarbon-mix fluid. In any case, the apparent presence of a wave-generated beach on the lake's northeast shore suggests that at times considerably higher waves form.

The park, nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, is in the Loyalsock Creek valley on Pennsylvania Route 154, in Forks and Shrewsbury Townships southeast of the borough of Forksville. The name Worlds End has been used since at least 1872, but its origins are uncertain. Although it was founded as Worlds End State Forest Park by Governor Gifford Pinchot in 1932, the park was officially known as Whirls End State Forest Park from 1936 to 1943. The park's land was once home to Native Americans, followed by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially a result of the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places. A wide variety of wildlife is found in the park, which is also part of an Important Bird Area. Located in the Endless Mountains region of the dissected Allegheny Plateau, Worlds End has a continental climate and rocks and fossils from the Carboniferous period. It is one of \\"Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" named by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, which describes it as \\"[v]irtually in a class by itself, this wild, rugged and rustic area seems almost untamed\\". The park offers year-round recreational opportunities, including environmental education, hiking, camping in tents and cabins, whitewater rafting, swimming, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, hunting, and fishing. Name An 1872 map uses the name Worlds End for the area around the S-shaped serpentine bend in Loyalsock Creek. Worlds End State Forest Park opened in 1932, and its name has caused some confusion and controversy over the years. William S. Swingler, Assistant District Forester of Wyoming State Forest (reorganized as Loyalsock State Forest in 2005), penned this note about the story of the name in 1935: This was not the end of the controversy. A letter campaign led to the name of the park being changed to Whirls End State Forest Park in 1936; opponents of the new name launched another letter-writing campaign to revert the name to Worlds End State Forest Park. This matter was brought before the State Geographic Board, which supervised the official naming of places. The board ruled that the name be changed once again to Worlds End State Forest Park in 1943. The word Forest was dropped on November 11, 1954, when the park was officially named Worlds End State Park by the Pennsylvania Geographic Board. This has been the official name ever since, but the names Whirls End and Whirls Glen are still used, and are synonymous with Worlds End. Two other etymologies have been suggested. The first is that an early road along the gorge had a sheer drop to the creek hundreds of feet below, which prompted thoughts of the world's end in early travelers. The second is that the bend in Loyalsock Creek, and the surrounding area that became the park, was originally known as Huerle's Bend, but then \\"years of mispronunciation turned it into World's End (State Park)\\". Whatever the source, as of 2012 the name Worlds End State Park is unique in the USGS Geographic Names Information System and on its maps of the United States. The possessive apostrophe is not part of the official name, although it does appear in older records and in informal usage today.

Humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC. The first settlers were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools.For a general overview of Native American History in the West Branch Susquehanna watershed, see Note: ISBN refers to the Heritage Books July 1996 reprint. URL is to a scan of the 1892 version with some OCR typos. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artefacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000 BC and 1500 AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrow, and ornaments. Worlds End State Park is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin, whose earliest recorded inhabitants were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchial society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. Note: ISBN refers to 1998 impression After this, the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the Province of Pennsylvania acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, including what is now Worlds End State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. The land that became Sullivan County was originally part of Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Settlers first arrived in the park's townships in 1794. Shrewsbury Township was formed from Muncy Township in 1803, and Forks Township was formed from Shrewsbury Township in 1833, both while still part of Lycoming County. Sullivan County was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847. =Horse trails and lumber era= The forests in and around the park are second-growth, since the area was clearcut in the early 20th century. The earliest settlers in the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route 154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these old horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part of two of the seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name. Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, it has been estimated that up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: over of white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods. The forests near the three original counties, Philadelphia, Bucks, and Chester, were the first to be harvested, as the early settlers used the readily available timber to build homes, barns, and ships, and cleared the land for agriculture. The demand for lumber slowly increased and by the time of the American Revolution the lumber industry had reached the interior and mountainous regions of Pennsylvania. Lumber thus became one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. By the mid-19th century, the demand for lumber reached the area, where eastern white pine and eastern hemlock covered the surrounding mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees and sent them down Loyalsock Creek to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills there. The old-growth forests of eastern white pine and eastern hemlock were soon clearcut and the hills were stripped bare. Nothing was left except the dried-out tree tops, which became a fire hazard, so much of the land burned and was left barren. In the 1920s a sawmill was built on land now in the park, and two more were located about south. After it was \\"thoroughly logged\\", the area became a tangle of briars and brush. =Civilian Conservation Corps= The swimming area in the creek was built by the CCC. The history of Worlds End State Park goes back to 1929, when the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, a precursor to the modern Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, began purchasing land devastated by logging and wild fire to create a state forest. The land that specifically became the park was purchased from the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company in 1929 and Mrs. \\"Doc\\" Randall in 1931. Worlds End State Park was established by forest ranger John Annabelle in 1932, with a budget of $50 that purchased four picnic tables. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief program for young men from unemployed families, established in 1933. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, it was designed to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. The CCC operated in every U.S. state. The recreational development of the park began in 1933, when four CCC camps were built in Sullivan County. One of these, CCC Camp S-95, built many of the park facilities, such as the dam for the swimming area, the cabins, hiking trails and roads. The CCC workers blasted out bedrock in the creek for the swimming area and built the Canyon Vista road and lookout. Cabin 14 in the park was built by the CCC and is part of the NRHP-listed Historic District. CCC Camp S-95, which opened on May 29, 1933 on the site of an old lumber camp, was able to distinguish itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941. Historic district In 1987 the CCC architecture earned the Worlds End State Park Family Cabin District within the park a listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The historic district includes nineteen cabins and three latrines built by the CCC between 1933 and 1941. Seven of the cabins have one room, nine have two rooms, and three have three rooms. There are also three modern latrines within the district which are designated as non- contributing structures. The historic structures are examples of CCC work that reflects the standards set forth by the Department of the Interior. The cabins and latrines are constructed with native stones and timber and are placed on the land in a way that minimizes interference with the natural surroundings of the park. Note: This includes =Modern era= The Worlds End State Park office and visitor center, built in 2002 Since the CCC finished their work at the park in 1941, Worlds End State Park has continued to develop and change. In 1951 the Loyalsock Trail, which passes through the park, was laid out by Explorer Scouts. This trail has been maintained and extended by the Alpine Club of Williamsport since 1953. While the park was always popular in Pennsylvania, by the 1960s it began to attract attention from outside the state. The park was home to the first annual whitewater slalom race on Loyalsock Creek in 1964, which attracted over 100 competitors in 1965. A 1964 The New York Times article featured Worlds End park and its \\"excellent trout stream\\", and one in 1967 mentioned the park's \\"peerless wilderness views\\", \\"half-acre swimming pool carved into cool Loyalsock Creek\\" and \\"public campsites\\". In 1980, a trailer was added as a temporary park office. The accomplishments of the CCC at Worlds End State Park were recognized in 1987 by the inclusion of the Family Cabin District on the NRHP. In 1997 the park's Important Bird Area (IBA) was one of the first 73 IBAs established in Pennsylvania. On November 12, 2002, a new visitor center and park office was dedicated, which included of public space for environmental education and public programs. The building, constructed with an \\"energy-efficient design and recycled materials\\", was part of a $1.1 million project that included the park's first flush toilets and sewage treatment plant. In 2003 a $2.7 million project added flush toilets and running water to all the park's wash-houses, renovated the cabins, and made major improvements in the day use area. Landslides and erosion along Loyalsock Creek in the park after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee flooding In 2004, the Loyalsock Creek Watershed Association installed a fence on the creek's banks near the cabins to limit pedestrian access and erosion. The association planted shrubs and trees in the same area to stabilize the creek's banks in 2008, and in September 2010 replaced more than of fence with a less visible version. On January 25, 2010 flooding caused by heavy rain and melt from of snow \\"washed out a bridge\\" leading to the cabin area and destroyed of road there, leaving the park looking like \\"the set of disaster movie\\". The cabin area road needed $72,120 in repairs, the park was not fully restored until Memorial Day. Two floods hit the park in 2011, the first from Hurricane Irene on August 29, and the second from Tropical Storm Lee on September 8. Lee washed away about of gravel used to make emergency repairs to roads in the park from Irene damage. Loyalsock Creek reached south of the park, and campers in the park had to be evacuated. Worlds End and Promised Land State Park had \\"significant damage to roads and bridges\\", damage to Loylasock State Forest roads was also heavy, and the DCNR estimated the two storms caused $3 to $4 million of damage to its forests and parks. Worlds End was closed for two weeks after the Lee flood. As of 2012, post-war facilities include the park office, five wash-houses and other modern restroom facilities, beach house with concession stand, chapel, amphitheater, and modern camping areas. Worlds End State Park is one of twenty-one chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its \\"Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\" list. The DCNR describes it as \\"[v]irtually in a class by itself, this wild, rugged and rustic area seems almost untamed\\". It goes on to praise the opportunities for camping and hiking at the park, and its scenery and vistas. Note: Despite the title, there are twenty-one parks in the list, with Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks treated as one. Geology, paleontology, and Marcellus shale frost wedging making crevices in the rock. The land on which Worlds End State Park sits has undergone tremendous change over the last 350 million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone. Four major rock formations are present in Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge rim and the upper part of its walls are the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Below this is the Mississippian Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored sandstone and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge walls are the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. A boulder of Pottsville Formation conglomerate in the Rock Garden The park is at an elevation of on the Allegheny Plateau, which formed in the Alleghenian orogeny some 300 million years ago, when Gondwana (specifically what became Africa) and what became North America collided, forming Pangaea. The local region is known as the Endless Mountains, but despite the name these are not true mountains: instead millions of years of erosion have made this a dissected plateau, causing the \\"mountainous\\" terrain seen today. The hardest of the ancient rocks are on top of the ridges, while the softer rocks eroded away forming the valleys: the Loyalsock gorge is approximately deep in the park. Loyalsock Creek and its tributaries have been a primary force in the creation of the valleys, as the creek makes its way across the landscape to its mouth at the West Branch Susquehanna River in Montoursville. Fossils have been found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline. This coast was home to an ancient ancestor of the lungfish, which would burrow in the mud to survive dry spells. Fossils of these burrows have been discovered in the red siltstone formations in and near the park. The Marcellus Formation, a shale rich in natural gas, lies thousands of feet below Worlds End State Park and much of Pennsylvania. As of June 30, 2012, there were 127 active gas wells in Sullivan County, with 14 of those in Forks or Shrewsbury Townships. The state did not purchase the mineral rights to much of the land it owns. Anadarko Petroleum (now Occidental Petroleum) owns the mineral rights under the [Loyalsock] state forest and plans to drill in it. About 80% of the mineral rights to its state parks are not owned by Pennsylvania, and the owner of Worlds End State Park's mineral rights is unknown. According to William Kocher, Worlds End's manager, \\"if the owner decided to drill [in the park] ... the state would have no right to say no.\\" Natural gas pipeline construction upstream of the park spilled a \\"significant amount\\" of sediment and mud into Loyalsock Creek in September 2012. =Climate= The Allegheny Plateau has a continental climate, with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges of 20 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C) in winter and 80 ¬∞F (14 ¬∞C) in summer. For the region the park is in, the average minimum temperature in January is , while the average maximum temperature in July is . The mean annual precipitation for Loyalsock Creek is 42 to 48 inches (1067 to 1219 mm). Pennsylvania receives the most acid rain of any state in the United States. Because Loyalsock Creek is in a sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone mountain region, it has a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid. This makes it especially vulnerable to increased acidification from acid rain, which poses a threat to the long-term health of the plants and animals in the creek. The highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1936, and the record low was in 1994. On average, July is the hottest month at Worlds End, January is the coldest, and June the wettest. Ecology Worlds End State Park is near Forksville on Pennsylvania Route 154 in the narrow, serpentine valley of Loyalsock Creek. Note: shows Worlds End State Park State Park It is nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, which was known here as Wyoming State Forest until July 1, 2005. Common trees found in the state park and forest include black cherry, eastern hemlock, red maple, tulip poplar, yellow birch, and white ash. The northern hardwood and hemlock forests are threatened in general by deer overgrazing, while the woolly adelgid, an invasive hemiptera, threatens the hemlock populations. In 2010 Worlds End was part of over of state forests and parks combating the woolly adelgid with a $110,000 federal grant to the DCNR's \\"Forest Pest Management Division for insecticide treatment of high-value Eastern hemlocks\\". Several different interpretive and educational programs on environmental and ecological topics are offered at the park each summer. =Wildlife and Important Bird Area= The creek and its valley and the surrounding plateau support many different plant and animal species Worlds End State Park has an extensive forest cover of hemlock-filled valleys and hardwood tree-covered mountains, which makes it a habitat for \\"big woods\\" wildlife. Animals such as white-tailed deer, black bear, wild turkey, red and gray squirrels are seen fairly regularly. Less commonly seen but present in the park are creatures such as bobcats, coyote, fishers, river otters, and timber rattlesnakes. Loyalsock Creek is home to native brook trout and black bass which feed on a variety of insects including mosquitos, dragonflies, and gnats. Bird watchers have observed over 200 species of birds in the park, including the great blue heron, northern harrier, white-throated sparrow and highly sensitive species which are rare as breeding birds in Pennsylvania such as northern goshawk and yellow-bellied flycatcher. The state park and forest are part of the larger Pennsylvania Important Bird Area (IBA) #42, which encompasses . The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated the IBA as a globally important habitats for the conservation of bird populations. The IBA is home to Swainson's thrush and ruffed grouse, the state bird of Pennsylvania. Other notable passerine species found in the park and IBA include blue-headed and red-eyed vireos, Acadian and least flycatchers. Breeding warblers in the park include both northern and Louisiana waterthrushes, as well as Blackburnian, black-throated blue, black-throated green, Canada, magnolia, mourning, Nashville, and yellow-rumped. Worlds End State Park is featured in the Audubon Society's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide. Birds of interest in the park include common mergansers along the creek and other riparian species such as belted kingfisher, as well as barred, great horned, and the scarce, elusive northern saw-whet owls. Other avian species seen in the park and believed to nest there include tufted titmouse, brown creeper, red-breasted nuthatch, common raven, scarlet tanager, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and winter wren. These bird populations are typical of \\"mature northern hardwood-hemlock forests and high elevation swamps and conifer swamps\\". Note: This guide is available both as a book (page number given) and website (URL given). It also refers to Wyoming State Forest, which has been reorganized as Loyalsock State Forest. Recreation Trails = blazes There are over of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are encouraged to wear proper footgear and to be prepared for icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, \\"If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing\\". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snowmobiling and cross- country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands. * Loyalsock Trail, often abbreviated LT, is a rugged hiking trail that stretches from near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow \\"LT\\". Recently, the trail markers have been changed to a yellow disc with a red \\"LT\\". * Link Trail is a moderate trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a long loop. * Canyon Vista Trail is a loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, sugar maple, and black cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista is at an elevation of and \\"rewards the hiker with a spectacular view of the Loyalsock Creek gorge\\". Double Run waterfall from the nature trail * Worlds End Trail is a trail with yellow blazes that begins at the park office and ascends to an overlook of the swimming area. It then crosses the old Pioneer Road, which was used by some of the first settlers to the area, and enters the Loyalsock State Forest, ending at the post of the Loyalsock Trail, which can be followed back to the park office to make a loop long. * Butternut Trail is a trail marked with orange blazes that loops through a hardwood forest and crosses over Butternut Run. Two side trails connect Butternut Trail with the Loyalsock Trail. * Double Run Nature Trail is an easy trail, marked with a green stripe on a white rectangle blaze, that loops through woodlands along the west branch of Double Run. Wildflowers like Jack-in-the-pulpit, Solomon's seal and wild ginger can be seen on this trail, which passes by an intermittent waterfall. * High Rock Trail is and passes a waterfall on High Rock Run. This steep trail is marked with red blazes and climbs a hollow filled with lichen-covered rocks to a vista. A part of this trail used to pass so close to cliffs that two hikers fell to their deaths; this part of the trail has been relocated for safety. =Fishing, hunting, and whitewater = An angler fishing for trout on Loyalsock Creek, upstream of the dam in the park According to John Young, \\"As soon as you enter Worlds End State Park, you hear it: the never-ending rush of the waters of Loyalsock Creek\\". The creek and its tributary Double Run have been designated as approved trout waters within the park by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. This means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season. Note: Searchable map Hunting is permitted on about half of the lands of Worlds End State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrels, turkey, white- tailed deer and bears; however, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Edward Gertler, author of Keystone Canoeing, writes that Loyalsock Creek's \\"exciting whitewater, above Forksville, has long been a favorite of paddlers who are quick and tolerant enough to endure its fickle water levels and weather\\". This is the stretch of the creek in and near the park, whose \\"long, steepening, and complex boulder patch and ledgy rapids demand your attention ... A boater's chute through the middle of the swimming area dam at Worlds End State Park climaxes this run\\". The best time for whitewater boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, and the park hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The whitewater gradient is 41 for the section of the creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months. =Cabins, camping, swimming, and picnics= One of the park's many picnic pavilions in winter When appointed as manager of the park in 2002, William C. Kocher said \\"Camping really is king here at Worlds End, and the rustic cabins are especially popular ... We also have plenty of picnics and reunions, many of them drawing generation after generation, year after year\\". Worlds End State Park has three options for visitors interested in staying overnight. There are 19 rustic cabins, each with a refrigerator, stove, fireplace, table with chairs, and beds. There is a 70-site tent and camper campground along Pennsylvania Route 154\\\\. Some of the campsites have an electric hook-up, and there is a central shower facility with water and restrooms located nearby. Three organized group tenting areas, each capable of accommodating 30 people, are also available north of the cabins. They may also be used for one large group of up to 90 campers. Non-denominational Christian worship services, sponsored by the Pennsylvania Council of Churches, are held in a wooded chapel at the park on Sunday mornings during the summer. The picnic and swimming areas are adjacent to each other, with the building housing the bath house and concession stand between them. There are many picnic tables and several pavilions available for day use by visitors to the park. During the Great Depression the Civilian Conservation Corps built a tall dam on Loyalsock Creek, which provides a swimming area at Worlds End State Park. Since 2008, lifeguards are no longer on duty at the park.

He was well regarded as a session artist and solo performer, was a member of Taj Mahal's backing band and played with musicians such as Eric Clapton, John Lennon, and George Harrison.Simmonds, Jeremy. The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches. p. 235. In 2018, Davis was posthumously inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual Native American Music Awards. Early life and education Davis was born in Norman, Oklahoma. He was the son of Jesse Edwin (Bus) Davis II, whose ancestry was a blend of Comanche, Seminole, and Muscogee (Creek), and Vivian Mae (Bea) Saunkeah, a Kiowa. His father was an accomplished painter in the Flatstyle Southern Plains painting; his works were exhibited in the state capitol in Oklahoma City. Davis began his musical career in the late 1950s in Oklahoma City and surrounding cities with John Ware (later a drummer for Emmylou Harris), John Selk (later a bass player for Donovan), Jerry Fisher (later a vocalist with Blood, Sweat & Tears), Mike Boyle, Chris Frederickson, drummer Bill Maxwell (later with Andrae Crouch and Koinonia) and others. He graduated from Northeast High School in 1962. Davis graduated with a degree in English literature from the University of Oklahoma; even into his later years, he was remembered to enjoy quoting Socrates and Plato.MARK ARAX and PAUL FELDMAN OBITUARIES : Backed Up Major Artists : Jesse Ed Davis, 43; Noted Rock Guitarist, June 24, 1988. Los Angeles Times By the mid-1960s, he had quit school and went touring with Conway Twitty. Career Davis eventually moved to California. For eight years, he lived in Marina del Rey with his companion, Patti Daley, and her son, Billy. Through his friendship with Levon Helm, he became friends with Leon Russell, who introduced him to recording session work. Davis joined Taj Mahal and played guitar and piano on Mahal's first four albums. He played slide, lead and rhythm, country and even jazz during his three-year stint with Mahal. Mahal and his band were invited to England by the Rolling Stones,Documentary film, Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World, 2017 and they appeared as a musical guest in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He played in the \\"electric\\" disc of Mahal's double album Giant Step/De Ole Folks at Home (1969) and appeared in two songs of his fourth album Happy Just to Be Like I Am (1971). In 1970, he played on and produced Roger Tillison's only album for Atco Records, a division of Atlantic. Davis and Tillison ‚àí both Oklahoman ‚àí were joined at the Record Plant by Bobby Bruce (fiddle), Larry Knechtel (organ and harmonica), Stan Szelest (piano); Billy Rich (bass); Jim Keltner (drums) and Sandy Konikoff (percussion); Don Preston and Joey Cooper were vocal accompanists. Roger Tillison's Album was recorded live. It was finally released on CD by Wounded Bird Records in 2008, with Davis playing electric guitar, bottleneck (slide) guitar and banjo. The Woody Guthrie song \\"Old Cracked Looking Glass\\" has become a standard for Oklahoma bands. In 1971, Davis recorded his first solo album after Atco Records signed a contract with him to record two albums with the label. The first was the album ¬°Jesse Davis! (1971), which featured backing vocals by Gram Parsons and performances by Leon Russell and Eric Clapton, among others. Davis was close friends with Gene Clark. In 1971, he played on and produced Clark's second solo album, White Light, and provided lead guitar on Clark's album No Other in 1974. On Jackson Browne's 1972 debut album, Davis played the electric guitar solo on Browne's hit song \\"Doctor, My Eyes\\". After guesting with Russell on Bob Dylan's 1971 single \\"Watching the River Flow\\", and collaborating in Albert King‚Äôs Lovejoy, Davis went on to work with George Harrison, performing at the ex-Beatle's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden, along with Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Russell, Keltner, Clapton and others. Two more solo albums followed: in 1972 Ululu, which included the original release of Harrison's \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\", and in 1973 Keep Me Comin, occasionally listed as Keep On Coming. Around this time, Davis began playing with John Lennon, for whom he played lead guitar on the albums Walls and Bridges (1974) and Rock 'n' Roll (1975). In addition, Davis was a guest performer on other albums by former Beatles: Harrison's Extra Texture (1975) and Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974) and Ringo's Rotogravure (1976). In the late summer and fall of 1975, he performed with the Faces as second guitarist throughout their final US tour. It was on this tour that Davis became addicted to drugs. After the Faces tour, Davis continued to work as a session player. In addition to the artists listed above, Davis contributed to albums by Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Keith Moon, Steve Miller, Guthrie Thomas, Harry Nilsson, Ry Cooder, David Cassidy, Willie Nelson, Neil Diamond, Rick Danko, Van Dyke Parks and others. He played on Leonard Cohen's Death of a Ladies' Man (1977), produced by Phil Spector. In 1977, Davis moved to Hawaii. In 1981, he returned to Los Angeles broke and ravaged by drug and alcohol addiction. In and out of clinics, Davis disappeared from the music industry for a time, spending much of the 1980s dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. In 1985 he formed and played in the Graffiti Band, which coupled his music with the poetry of the Native American activist John Trudell (American Indian Movement). The result of this collaboration was the album, released initially only on cassette, called \\"AKA Grafitti Man\\", which Bob Dylan called the best album of the year.John Trudell, John Trudell Archives Re-releases The Critically Acclaimed Aka Grafitti Man, March 21, 2017 In the spring of 1987, the Graffiti Band performed with Taj Mahal at the Palomino Club in North Hollywood, California. At this show, George Harrison, Bob Dylan and John Fogerty got up from the audience to join Davis and Mahal in an unrehearsed set which included Fogerty's \\"Proud Mary\\" and Dylan's \\"Watching the River Flow\\", as well as classics such as \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", \\"Peggy Sue\\", \\"Honey Don't\\", \\"Matchbox\\" and \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\". Personal life Davis had a relationship with Patti Daley for about ten years. Then he married twice, first to Tantalayo Saenz and then Kelly Brady. In his last years, he served as drug and alcohol counselor at the American Indian Free Clinic in Long Beach. Davis collapsed in the laundry room of an apartment building and was pronounced dead in Venice, California, on June 22, 1988. Police stated his death appeared to be the result of a drug overdose. Davis had a fresh needle mark on one arm and burned matches and tin foil were scattered on the ground nearby. He was 43 years old. Legacy In 2002, he was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame. In 2018, Jesse Ed Davis was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual Native American Music Awards. A performance tribute was held by his former Graffiti band members, Mark Shark and Quiltman. His cousins Richenda Davis Bates and Constance Davis Carter accepted the induction.18th Annual Native American Music Awards Oct 25, 2019 on YouTube (acceptance speech starts at min 54:00).

William G. Helis Jr., Herman Lay, John W. Mecom Jr., Louis J. Roussel Jr., Jack Sanders, and Edgar B. Stern Jr. were the six bidders for the franchise. On December 15, oilman Mecom became the majority shareholder and thus president of the team with his winning bid of $8.5 million; later that month, Tom Fears was named head coach. The team was named \\"Saints\\" due to its birthday on the Roman Catholic Church's All Saints Day‚Äîa fitting nickname for a team in the largely Catholic New Orleans area. The name was announced on January 9, 1967. The team's original stadium was Tulane Stadium, which could seat more than 80,000 fans. The team was placed in the Capitol Division of the NFL's Eastern Conference; their division foes were the Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Redskins. The team started off well, with a 5‚Äì1 preseason record; then, on the first play of the 1967 regular season, wide receiver John Gilliam returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. However, this was not enough for the Saints, and they lost their regular season opener to the Los Angeles Rams, 13‚Äì27. Their first win came on November 5 as they defeated the Eagles 31‚Äì24. That would be one of the Saints' only triumphs in their inaugural campaign; they ended the season 3‚Äì11, the second-worst mark in the league and 3 1/2 games behind Washington in the divisional race. At the time, however, the Saints' three wins tied for the most ever for an expansion team's inaugural season. Their next few seasons continued along similar lines. They improved slightly in 1968, putting up a 4‚Äì9‚Äì1 record as they competed in the Century Division against the Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams, and Pittsburgh Steelers; in 1969, they returned to the Capitol Division (featuring the same division opponents as 1967) and managed to go 5‚Äì9. 1970‚Äì1974 Archie Manning, pictured attempting a pass in 1980, was one of the first players to be inducted into the Saints' Ring of Honor. The 1970 season saw yet another realignment for the Saints due to the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. The Saints were placed in the NFC West, where they would remain through 2001. Their original NFC West competitors ‚Äì the Atlanta Falcons, Los Angeles (and later, St. Louis) Rams, and San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì would also remain in the division through 2001 (with the Carolina Panthers joining in 1995), leading to the development of long-standing rivalries. The season started off poorly for the Saints. After going 1-5-1 in the first seven games, Fears was fired and replaced by J.D. Roberts on November 3. In Roberts' first game as coach, New Orleans trailed the Detroit Lions 17-16 with time winding down, but Tom Dempsey kicked an NFL-record 63-yard field goal as time expired to win the game. The record would stand through 2013 (43 years later), when Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos broke it with a 64-yard field goal. Dempsey's achievement is made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was born without toes on his right foot (which he kicked with). This Saints victory, however, would be the last for the season; they lost their last six games to finish 2-11-1, the worst record in the young history of the franchise. In the 1971 NFL Draft, the Saints owned the second overall pick behind the Boston Patriots. Deciding that a franchise quarterback was necessary, they selected Archie Manning out of Mississippi. In the season opener, Manning did not disappoint; he passed for 218 yards and a touchdown and ran in another touchdown on the final play to give the Saints a 24-20 win over the Rams. Four weeks later, Manning engineered a 24-14 upset of the Dallas Cowboys, the same team who would return to Tulane Stadium three months later and win Super Bowl VI over the Miami Dolphins. Throughout the season, Manning split the quarterbacking duties with veteran Edd Hargett. Manning ended the season with six passing touchdowns and four rushing touchdowns; he did well enough to become the team's undisputed starter the next season. Despite the promise Manning showed, the Saints' misfortunes continued as they finished 4-8-2. In 1972, the Saints started 0-5 and finished 2-11-1. During the 1973 preseason, the Saints fired Roberts and hired John North, who led the Saints to consecutive 5-9 seasons in 1973 and 1974. 1975‚Äì1979 In 1975, the Saints moved from Tulane Stadium into the Louisiana Superdome. Despite the new home, they went just 2-12; North was fired after six games, and Ernie Hefferle was named interim head coach for the final eight games of the season. For the 1976 season, Hank Stram was hired as head coach; he came with a proven track record (three AFL titles, one Super Bowl win) from his years with the Kansas City Chiefs (formerly the Dallas Texans). However, his talents proved ineffective in his first season, as the Saints went 4-10; Manning sat out the entire season after undergoing elbow surgery just after Stram's hiring, forcing the quarterback duties to be split by backup Bobby Scott and Chicago Bears castoff Bobby Douglass. 1977 was not much better as the Saints went 3-11, including a humiliating 33-14 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 11, the Buccaneers' first victory in the NFL after 26 consecutive losses. In 1978, Stram was replaced by Dick Nolan. The season saw an improvement in the Saints' fortunes; Manning had the best season of his career up to that point, passing for 3,416 yards and 17 touchdowns. He was named to the NFC Pro Bowl squad for the first time and was also named the NFC's Most Valuable Player by The Sporting News and UPI. The Saints put together a record of 7-9, their best ever mark. The Saints might have made the playoffs had it not had been for a pair of losses to the Atlanta Falcons, where the Falcons used the \\"Big Ben\\" play to score the winning touchdown in the final seconds of each contest, as well as a last-minute loss to the eventual Super Bowl XIII champion Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1979, the Saints built on the success of the previous year. After an 0-3 start (including a 40-34 overtime loss to the Falcons on opening day), the Saints won five of their next six games to take sole possession of the NFC West lead after nine games. The Saints were 7-6 heading into a Monday night game with the Oakland Raiders; their rivals for the NFC West title, the Rams, were 8-6. The Saints jumped out to a 35-14 lead and seemed certain to gain a share of first place with their win. But the Saints blew the lead and lost 42-35. The next week, they were blown out 35-0 at the Superdome by the San Diego Chargers, ending their playoff hopes. The Saints, however, did manage to beat the Super Bowl-bound Rams (playing their last home game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum until 2016) in the final game of the regular season. This gave them an 8-8 record, the first non-losing season in team history. It was also the first time that the Saints finished higher than third place in their division. 1980‚Äì1985 In 1980, the Saints had high hopes after their two relatively successful seasons. Instead, the bottom fell out, where, despite a strong offense, their defense was almost nonexistent. The team started 0-12, and Dick Nolan was fired; he was replaced by Dick Stanfel, who lost two games (including one in San Francisco where the Saints blew a 28-point lead). They managed to win against the New York Jets, who finished with the league's second worst record at 4-12, by a point. This game was also noteworthy for an episode where Archie Manning was signing autographs after the game. A boy ran up to him and stole his (unfastened) necktie, after which he was fined for violating the NFL's dress code. The Saints then lost their last game of the season to the New England Patriots to finish 1-15, the worst mark in team history and (at the time) the worst for a 16-game schedule, since eclipsed by the 2008 Detroit Lions and 2017 Cleveland Browns (0-16). A local journalist and radio/TV personality, Buddy Diliberto, wore a paper grocery bag over his head to promote the brown bag special of Sonic, the Saint's sponsor at the time. Many fans took to wearing bags over their heads when attending games. The moniker \\"Aints\\" was also born due to the ineptitude of the 1980 Saints. In 1981, ex-Houston Oilers head coach Bum Phillips was hired as head coach and general manager. The dismal 1980 season meant that the Saints would get the first pick in the 1981 NFL Draft. They selected Heisman-winning running back George Rogers out of South Carolina, a move which in hindsight proved to be a huge blunder; the New York Giants, drafting second, selected future Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor from North Carolina. Rogers was the team's workhorse, playing in all but one game and averaging more than 25 carries a game. He ran for a total of 1,674 yards, making him the NFL rushing champion. However, his fine performances were not enough to make the Saints a winning club. They finished the season 4-12, but two of those wins came over the Rams, New Orleans' first regular-season sweep of the Rams since the two teams were placed in the NFC West by the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger in 1970. The Saints also defeated the eventual AFC champion Cincinnati Bengals. In 1982, the Saints signed former Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers quarterback Ken Stabler and traded Archie Manning to the Oilers. Two games into the season, the Saints were 1-1, but a players' strike led to the cancellation of seven games. When the season resumed, the Saints won two games in a row to take their record to 3-1, but they lost four games in a row before winning their last game, 35-6 over the Falcons. They finished 4-5, but missed out on qualifying for the playoffs (expanded to 16 teams due to the strike) on a tiebreaker. 1983 saw the Saints improve on the previous season once again. They hovered at or above .500 for most of the season, but lost a golden opportunity to stay one step ahead in the playoff race by giving up 17 points in the 4th quarter of a 31-28 loss to the New York Jets on Monday Night Football. Their playoff hopes came down to the final game of the season, when they hosted the Rams. Los Angeles scored two touchdowns on interception returns and another on a punt return, and Mike Lansford kicked a 42-yard field goal with six seconds remaining to give the Rams the victory and a playoff berth, and end the Saints' season. The Saints finished 8-8, tying their previous best season record. Eight weeks after the conclusion of the 1983 season, the Saints traded their number one pick in the 1984 NFL Draft to the New York Jets for quarterback Richard Todd, who had worn out his welcome in the Big Apple by throwing too many interceptions, and was being phased out in favor of rookie Ken O'Brien. During the 1984 season, New Orleans traded for former Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell, who won the NFL rushing championship in each of his first three seasons with the Oilers, when Bum Phillips coached the club. The Saints won for the first time on Monday Night Football by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Superdome, but a three-game losing streak late in the season dropped the Saints to 7-9. The biggest news of the 1984 season was that John Mecom, the owner of the team for almost 20 years, was putting them up for sale. Speculation was rife that a new owner might move the Saints out of New Orleans, namely Jacksonville, Florida. But on May 31, 1985, negotiations were finalized to sell the team to Tom Benson, a native New Orleanian who owned numerous car dealerships throughout the New Orleans area. The team's future in New Orleans was safe for the time being. In 1985, the Saints started off 3-2, but then lost six games in a row. Bum Phillips resigned twelve games into the season, and his son Wade Phillips, the Saints' defensive coordinator, was named interim coach. The Saints ended the season 5-11. A bright spot of the campaign was the emergence of quarterback and Louisiana native Bobby Hebert, who led the Saints to victories over the Vikings and Rams late in the season. Hebert previously spent three seasons in the United States Football League with the Michigan Panthers and Oakland Invaders, leading the Panthers to the first USFL championship in 1983. Jim Mora era (1986‚Äì1996) Before the 1986 season, Saints owner Tom Benson put his stamp on the team by making two important hires: first, he named Jim Finks president and general manager; then, he named Jim Mora head coach. The Saints' offense struggled throughout the year after Bobby Hebert went down with a knee injury in the third game of the season, but behind a revitalized defense and NFC Rookie of the Year Rueben Mayes, New Orleans improved to 7-9. The 1987 Saints started 1-1; then, another player strike followed. This time, however, replacement players were used until the regular players ended their strike. As a result, the season was only one game shorter than usual. The Saints went 2-1 with replacement players as they were led by their quarterback, New Orleans native John Fourcade. When the regular players returned, their first game was against the San Francisco 49ers. The Saints lost 24-22, but that would be the last time they would taste defeat that year. They ran off a nine-game winning streak to close out the season ‚Äî a remarkable feat considering that the Saints had never before won nine games in a season, let alone nine games in a row. The loss against San Francisco, however, would keep the Saints from being NFC West Champions; instead, the Saints finished 12-3, behind the 13-2 49ers, and had to settle for a wild-card spot in the playoffs despite having a better record than either of the other division champions that year. The Saints hosted the Minnesota Vikings on January 3, 1988; after twenty years, the Saints finally took part in the NFL playoffs. The game started well for the Saints as they took a 7-0 lead, but Minnesota answered by taking a 31-10 lead into halftime. The Vikings added 13 more points in the second half to make the final score 44-10. Despite the loss, the Saints were recognized for their accomplishments; six players were selected for the Pro Bowl, and Mora and Finks were named NFL Coach and Executive of the Year, respectively. The 1988 Saints looked to return to the playoffs. After starting the season with a loss to their nemesis, the 49ers, the Saints bounced back with a seven-game win streak. After the streak, though, the Saints lost five of their next seven games. They won their last game of the season, against Atlanta, but they missed out on the playoffs due to tiebreakers. The 1989 Saints managed to finish 9-7, but thanks to other strong performances in the NFC, they missed the playoffs by two games. In 1990, the Saints started off poorly, going 2-5 in their first seven games. However, they turned their season around and close wins in their final two games of the season were enough to give them an 8-8 record and a playoff berth in the newly expanded NFL playoffs, which now included six teams from each conference. They traveled to Soldier Field to take on the Chicago Bears, but lost 16-6. In 1991, the Saints started with a seven-game win streak, a team-record best start, and an overall impressive start, considering the Saints had never started better than 2-0. With the 7-0 start, the Saints opened up a four-game lead over the rest of the division. But then the Saints lost five of their next seven games, giving Atlanta and San Francisco a shot at claiming the division title. However, the Saints regrouped in the final two games of the season, and they finished 11-5 as the Falcons and 49ers finished 10-6 to give the Saints their first-ever division title. The Saints' first- round playoff game would be at the Superdome against Atlanta. The Falcons came from behind to defeat the Saints 27-20. In 1992, the Saints attempted to defend their division title, but their hated rivals, the 49ers, swept the season series and finished 14-2 to the Saints' 12-4, meaning that the Saints would once again have to settle for a wild card berth to the NFC playoffs. They hosted the Philadelphia Eagles but once again could not put their home field advantage to good use, losing 36-20 for their fourth playoff loss in as many games. The 1993 season would see the Saints start their decline from regular playoff contender to league doormat once again. They started off 5-0, but lost eight of their last 11 games to finish 8-8, one game out of the playoffs. After seven straight years without a losing record, the team returned to the losing ways of the pre-Mora era in 1994. The Saints started 4-8 on their way to a 7-9 record. In 1995, the Saints again finished 7-9 in the NFC West, which was newly expanded to include the Carolina Panthers. Due to tiebreakers, the Saints had the disgrace of finishing in last place in the division behind even the expansion team. In 1996, after the Saints started 2-6, Mora resigned after more than ten years with the franchise. He finished his Saints tenure with 93 wins and 78 losses, making him far and away the most successful Saints coach ever. In fact, Mora was (up to then) the only coach ever to have a winning record during his Saints tenure, and his 93 wins were three more than the team had won in its entire history prior to his arrival. Rick Venturi was named interim head coach, but he had even less success than Mora did that season, going 1-7 to bring the Saints' final record to 3-13, their worst record since 1980. Mike Ditka era (1997‚Äì1999) Before the 1997 season, Tom Benson named legendary Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka as the Saints coach, leading to optimism that he would be able to win a Super Bowl with the Saints as he had done with the Bears. However, the Ditka era would be a tumultuous time for the organization. In 1997, Ditka led the team to a 6-10 record, a three-game improvement from the previous season; the team was marked by strong defense (anchored by defensive end Joe Johnson, middle linebacker Winfred Tubbs, and veteran cornerback Eric Allen, among others) and inconsistent offense. The 1998 season was even more chaotic. Starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert was lost for the year in the season-opening win against the St. Louis Rams. Later in the season, the team claimed quarterback Kerry Collins off the waiver wire; Collins had been released by the Carolina Panthers earlier in the season after he informed the team his heart wasn't in the game anymore. Collins was inconsistent as a starter, including a 31-17 loss to a previously winless Panthers team, but he was also at the helm for a 22-3 upset of the Dallas Cowboys, the high point of the season, before being benched against the Buffalo Bills in Week 17. His lackluster performance, coupled with a highly publicized DUI arrest, led Ditka to state that the team would not seek to re-sign Collins. The Saints finished 6-10 once again. In the months before the 1999 NFL Draft, Ditka became enamored with Texas running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner who'd set an NCAA record for career rushing yards with the Longhorns. Ditka's remarks that he'd \\"trade his entire draft\\" for the standout runner were well-publicized; holding the #13 overall pick, the Saints needed to trade up to have a chance at selecting Williams. They got their chance to do so when the Indianapolis Colts selected Miami running back Edgerrin James with the #4 overall pick. The Saints orchestrated a three-way trade with the Washington Redskins and the Chicago Bears that involved the Saints taking Washington's #5 overall pick ‚Äì and therefore, Williams ‚Äì in exchange for all the Saints' remaining 1999 draft picks and their 1st- and 3rd-rounders in 2000. The trade drew mixed reactions from Saints fans. In the days after the draft, Ditka boldly predicted that the Saints would go to the Super Bowl. Fan opinion began to solidify against Ditka when it became clear that his prediction would not come true. The Saints' 1999 season was marked by yet more inconsistency at quarterback, a porous defense, and a hobbled Williams, who struggled with a high ankle sprain and an elbow injury in his rookie year. The Saints finished 3-13. Owner Tom Benson had had enough; soon after the season ended, he fired Ditka, the entire coaching staff, and general manager Bill Kuharich. The Ditka era in New Orleans saw seven different starters at quarterback in three seasons (Heath Shuler, Danny Wuerffel, Doug Nussmeier, Billy Joe Hobert, Billy Joe Tolliver, Kerry Collins, and Jake Delhomme) and a defense which went from top-ten to near the bottom of the league in nearly every statistical category. Jim Haslett era (2000‚Äì2005) To replace Ditka and Kuharich, Tom Benson settled on Randy Mueller, formerly of the Seattle Seahawks, as general manager, and Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett as head coach. Mueller shook up the roster, bringing in a squad of fresh talent via free agency: wide receivers Jake Reed and Joe Horn, quarterback Jeff Blake, tight end Andrew Glover, defensive tackle Norman Hand, cornerback Fred Thomas, safety Chris Oldham, and linebacker Darrin Smith, among others. Lacking their top draft pick because of the Williams trade (a pick the Redskins would use to draft linebacker LaVar Arrington), New Orleans selected defensive end Darren Howard early in the 2nd round. Inspired by Terrell Davis and the Denver Broncos' offense, new offensive coordinator Mike McCarthy implemented a form of the West Coast Offense with Ricky Williams as the focal point: a run-first attack designed to open up passing lanes and create opportunities for the occasional deep ball. After a sputtering 1-3 start, the Saints found their groove, winning six straight games behind Williams and an opportunistic defense. The 2000 season marked the surprising emergence of Joe Horn, who'd previously been a backup receiver with the Kansas City Chiefs but was flourishing as Blake's main target. Adversity struck, however, with injuries in consecutive games to Williams and Blake, forcing the team to rely on backups at both positions for the remainder of the season. Blake's injury presented an opportunity for quarterback Aaron Brooks, who led the team to two critical road wins: an upset over the defending champion St. Louis Rams and a late comeback against the San Francisco 49ers, keeping the Saints atop the NFC West. A Week 16 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, coupled with a St. Louis loss the following night, gave the Saints a 10-5 record, a playoff berth, and their first division title since 1991. In the regular season finale, the Saints lost to the Rams, setting up a rematch between the two teams in the wild card playoff round. Though they lost Horn to an injury early in the game, the Saints managed to surge ahead to a 31-7 lead early in the 4th quarter behind three touchdowns from Brooks to backup wide receiver Willie Jackson. A late comeback by the Rams was halted in dramatic fashion when St. Louis wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim fumbled a punt late in the game. Saints fullback Brian Milne fell on the ball, and New Orleans able to run out the clock to secure its first-ever playoff win. The final score was 31-28. The return of Ricky Williams the next week could not prevent the injury-hobbled Saints from losing to the Minnesota Vikings. Despite the 34-16 loss, the 2000 season was viewed as an overwhelming success by the fans and the media. Haslett and Mueller were recognized by the NFL as Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year, respectively. Five Saints were selected to the Pro Bowl: Horn, left tackle Willie Roaf, defensive linemen Joe Johnson and La'Roi Glover, and linebacker Keith Mitchell. Horn set a franchise record with 1,340 receiving yards and emerged as a playmaker and tenacious possession receiver. Despite his injury, Williams rushed for 1,000 yards and eight touchdowns in 10 games. =2001= The next five seasons failed to meet the raised expectations of fans and media. The 2001 season established a trend of team inconsistency from week to week; though the Saints engineered a stirring comeback from several touchdowns down to beat the Rams on the road, they also collapsed at the end of the season, losing their last four games by embarrassing margins to finish 7-9. New Orleans was outscored 160-40 in its final four games and shut out 38-0 by San Francisco in the finale at home in the Saints' final game as a member of the NFC West. The season was notable for the curious behavior of Albert Connell, a wide receiver acquired in the offseason and intended to be the long-term starter opposite Joe Horn. Connell was accused of, and subsequently admitted to, stealing over $4,000 from teammate Deuce McAllister, though he claimed the theft was just a prank. Connell caught only 12 passes in 11 games with the Saints; the team suspended him for the last four games of the season and later terminated his contract. In the offseason, the Saints ‚Äì having drafted running back Deuce McAllister in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft ‚Äì traded starter Ricky Williams to the Miami Dolphins. The trade ended up giving the Saints two 1st-round picks. =2002= The 2002 season started with promise (in the now geographically accurate NFC South division) but finished in familiar fashion. The Saints began the year with impressive wins over three 2001 playoff teams ‚Äì an overtime win over new division rival Tampa Bay, a 15-point trouncing of Green Bay, and a come-from-behind win over Chicago on the road. But the season would include a loss to bottom-dweller Detroit, as well as another late-season collapse that included three straight losses to Minnesota, Cincinnati, and Carolina, when a victory in any one of these three games would have all but guaranteed a playoff berth. The Saints, after starting 6-1, finished at 9-7 and missed the playoffs once again. Jim Haslett and his coaching staff drew criticism for not benching starting quarterback Aaron Brooks in any of the season's final games. Brooks had been hobbled by a shoulder injury, and though both he and Haslett insisted the injury would not affect his play, Brooks' performance suggested otherwise. Over the last six games of the season, Brooks completed only 47% of his passes, throwing for six touchdowns and five interceptions and losing six fumbles. His passer rating over those six games was 66.7, far less than his 80.1 rating over the entire season. Backing up Brooks in 2002 was fan-favorite Jake Delhomme, who'd played at nearby UL- Lafayette and had come off the bench to cement a victory over Tampa Bay several weeks earlier. Brooks' poor performance late in the 2002 season prompted fans to chant \\"We Want Jake!\\" at games, but Haslett ignored these chants. In the offseason, Delhomme signed with Carolina, in part because he'd be able to compete for the starting job. Delhomme would lead the Panthers to Super Bowl XXXVIII in his first season in Carolina, further rubbing salt in the wounds of Saints fans. =2003= The 2003 season started off poorly for the Saints, going 1-4 in their first five games, including a 55-21 blowout loss at home against the Indianapolis Colts, as Colts quarterback and New Orleans native Peyton Manning threw six touchdown passes to hand the Saints a humiliating loss on national television. The Saints, however, would rebound somewhat from their poor start and finish the season 8-8. McAllister ran for a career-high 1,641 yards. =2004= The 2004 season saw the Saints struggle out of the gate. They compiled a 4-8 record in their first 12 games, and Haslett's job appeared to be in jeopardy. Then the Saints put together three straight wins (two of them on the road) to give them a shot at an 8-8 record and a playoff berth. The Saints faced Carolina (also 7-8) in Week 17. The Saints needed to beat the Panthers; they also needed one of two things to happen: a St. Louis tie or loss, or a Seattle win or tie and a Minnesota win or tie. The New Orleans, St. Louis, and Minnesota games were all played at 1:00 PM EST that Sunday. The Saints defeated the Panthers 21-18, but Minnesota lost to Washington (also by a 21-18 score), meaning that the Saints' playoff chances came down to the game between the Rams and the New York Jets. The game went to overtime with the score tied 29-29. The teams battled back and forth for most of the overtime period. The crucial moment occurred when Jets kicker Doug Brien (formerly of the Saints) missed a 53-yard field goal. The Rams capitalized on the good field position and kicked a field goal of their own to win with a little over 3 minutes left in overtime, sending the Saints out of the playoffs on the tiebreaker scenarios. Though the Saints had beaten the Rams earlier in the season, their loss to the Vikings and the fact that the Rams did not play the Vikings that season meant that the tiebreaker had to go to the best conference record, where the Rams finished ahead of the Saints and Vikings to claim one of the NFC's wild card spots. The Vikings then got the final wild card spot thanks to their win over the Saints. While the season finished in heartbreaking fashion, many thought that Haslett would have been fired if not for his team's four-game win streak to end the season. =2005= Going into the 2005 season, the Saints were optimistic that they could build on their good results at the end of 2004. But when Hurricane Katrina struck, the Saints were thrown into chaos with the rest of their city. The Saints relocated their headquarters to San Antonio, Texas. The Saints managed to provide an emotional lift for their hometown when they defeated the Panthers 23-20 in Week 1. The NFL decreed that the Saints' first home game would be played in Giants Stadium, adding insult to injury as the Saints were forced to play a \\"home\\" game against the New York Giants in front of a hostile crowd. The Saints struggled and lost 27-10, feeling aggrieved at the situation. The rest of the Saints' home games would be played either in San Antonio's Alamodome or Baton Rouge's Tiger Stadium. The Saints lost to Minnesota in Week 3, but won in the Alamodome the next week over Buffalo to bring their record to 2-2. They then proceeded to be blown out 52-3 in Green Bay by a team which came into the game 0-4. The loss to the Packers was even worse for the Saints due to a season-ending injury suffered by star running back Deuce McAllister. The Saints would eventually finish the season with a 3-13 record; the last few games of the season saw quarterback Aaron Brooks being benched (and later traded to the Oakland Raiders), giving playing time for backup quarterback Todd Bouman and even third-stringer Adrian McPherson and, eventually, the season ended with head coach Jim Haslett losing his job. Sean Payton/Drew Brees Era (2006‚Äìpresent)2006: Brees and Payton first year= The 2006 Saints orchestrated one of the more remarkable turnarounds in NFL history, as they were the first team to go from 3-13 to a conference title game the next season. First-year head coach Sean Payton, who came from Dallas as a Bill Parcells pupil, was hired for a daunting task at hand. In his first move as coach, he released almost half of the roster, most notably inconsistent quarterback Aaron Brooks. The Saints were aggressive in free agency, signing former San Diego Chargers quarterback Drew Brees, who had been released after suffering a career-threatening injury to his throwing shoulder during the last game of the 2005 season and was still recovering from surgery at that time. Brees was also being pursued by Nick Saban and the Miami Dolphins but their doctors gave Brees a 25% chance of making a comeback. The Saints gambled on his ability to recover in time for the season and signed him to a major long- term contract. His signing would become a major turning point for the Saints. Then came April, and the 2006 NFL Draft. On the eve before the draft on April 29, news broke that the Houston Texans could not reach an agreement with Reggie Bush and instead reached a deal with defensive end Mario Williams as the #1 pick. When the team found out that Bush would be available, they selected the USC running back with their #2 pick. In that draft, the Saints also picked an unknown player in the 7th-round who would become a standout: wide receiver Marques Colston from Hofstra as the 252nd pick. When preseason got underway, the Saints started out strong in a victory over the Tennessee Titans, which featured a dazzling run by Reggie Bush where he reversed his direction for a big run. That was the only highlight for the Saints' preseason as they finished just 1‚Äì3, losing their other three preseason games. The 2006 regular season officially began for the Saints with a road win against the Cleveland Browns, with Bush accounting for 129 yards from scrimmage, while Colston caught a touchdown pass from Brees. The next week, the Saints went to Green Bay, where the Saints lost 52-3 the previous year, to face the Packers. The start of the game looked bleak for the Saints as they quickly went down 0‚Äì13, but Brees led a comeback, throwing for 353 yards and two touchdowns as the Saints came back to win a shootout, 34‚Äì27. The Saints then headed back for the first game in the Superdome since the 2005 preseason, a Monday Night date with the Atlanta Falcons on September 25. The Saints entered the game 2‚Äì0 against the 2‚Äì0 Falcons with many expecting the Falcons' powerful running game to overwhelm the team. The game kicked off to fanfare of the Saints' official return to New Orleans. The game also featured pregame festivities featuring Green Day and U2 performing a song that would become the team's unofficial anthem, \\"The Saints Are Coming\\". New Orleans dominated the game right from the start when Steve Gleason blocked a punt that was recovered for a touchdown by Curtis Deloatch. The Saints went on to win 23‚Äì3. The next week, the Saints lost their first game of the season to division rival Carolina, 18‚Äì21. The Saints bounced back in their second game in New Orleans facing division rival Tampa Bay. With time winding down and the Saints down by four, they were set to receive a punt. Reggie Bush returned the punt 65 yards, untouched, for the winning touchdown, and the first of his career. The Saints were 4‚Äì1 and in control of the NFC South. A week later, the Saints upset the favored Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans, 27‚Äì24, and the Saints were taken seriously heading into their bye week. New Orleans entered a midseason slump, losing three of four by Week 10 before going on a three-game win streak. They defeated Atlanta, San Francisco, and Dallas in convincing fashion. The Saints concluded the regular season at 10‚Äì6, winning the NFC South title and, for the first time in the team's history, securing a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Saints' divisional playoff game would be a Week 6 rematch with the Eagles, who were led by backup quarterback Jeff Garcia this time and riding a six-game winning streak. The game featured several lead changes and a most inspired effort by Deuce McAllister, who rushed for almost 150 yards and two touchdowns, one receiving and one rushing. New Orleans won its first divisional playoff game in team history, 27‚Äì24, and only the second playoff win in franchise history. The Saints then traveled to Chicago to face the Bears in the team's first ever NFC Championship appearance, where they ended up falling short in the title game, 14‚Äì39. New Orleans led the NFL in total yards gained and passing yards in the 2006 season. Drew Brees set new Saints single-season records in passes completed (356), passer rating (96.2), and passing yards (4,418). The team sent three players to the 2007 Pro Bowl: Brees, defensive end Will Smith, and offensive tackle Jammal Brown. =2007‚Äì2008= The 2007 regular season began with a primetime matchup against the defending Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, but New Orleans suffered a 10‚Äì41 pounding. The losses continued, as Tampa Bay and Tennessee routed them, followed by a close loss to Carolina. The Saints finally managed a victory in Week 6 by defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28‚Äì17. After three more victories, they lost two more games, then beat the Carolina Panthers, and then fell to the Buccaneers again. In Week 16, the Saints lost to Philadelphia, which removed them from the playoffs. A loss to the Chicago Bears in the regular season finale ended the Saints' season with a 7‚Äì9 record. In 2008, the Saints began by defeating the Buccaneers before losing three of the next four games. New Orleans was selected for that year's international series game in London, where they beat San Diego 37‚Äì32. The remainder of the season was an uneven string of games, and after being beat by Carolina on December 28, the team ended its 2008 campaign with an 8‚Äì8 record. =2009: The Road to Super Bowl XLIV= New Orleans started off 2009 innocently enough with a rout of the hapless Detroit Lions. Afterwards, they traveled to Philadelphia and beat an Eagles team that was missing its starting quarterback, Donovan McNabb, due to an injury. They accumulated further easy wins over the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets in the next two games. After the bye week, they handily defeated the New York Giants and then beat the Miami Dolphins in a high-scoring affair at Landshark Stadium. With this impressive win, which featured a second-half rally, the Saints moved to 6‚Äì0. The next four opponents were comparatively weak ones, and the Saints soon found themselves at 10‚Äì0 along with the Colts. In Week 12, they faced the New England Patriots in the Superdome and inflicted a stunning defeat on the three-time Super Bowl champions. The Saints nearly lost their next game against the 3‚Äì8 Washington Redskins at FedEx Field. The score was tied 30‚Äì30 at the end of regulation, and in overtime, Washington almost broke the Saints' eleven-game winning streak. However, a fumble by the Redskins gave the Saints the ball. They then made a field goal and won the game, 33‚Äì30, clinching the NFC South division title. Afterwards, New Orleans faced the Dallas Cowboys at home and were finally brought down by a 17‚Äì24 score. The next week, the Saints were upset at home by the 2‚Äì12 Tampa Bay Buccaneers in overtime. They secured the #1 NFC playoff seed when the 11‚Äì3 Minnesota Vikings lost to the Chicago Bears in Week 16. The Saints rested starters during their Week 17 game against the Panthers, finishing their season at 13‚Äì3. The re-energized team came back from the first-round bye week and hosted the Arizona Cardinals, crushing them 45‚Äì14. Now in the NFC Championship, the Saints faced the Vikings. The two teams waged an epic struggle through all four quarters. Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre was hit several times by the New Orleans defensive line, and there were multiple penalties, timeouts, and booth reviews of questionable plays. Although the Vikings never trailed by more than a touchdown, they could not gain a lead, and as the 4th quarter was drawing to a close, Favre threw an ill-advised pass across the middle of the field, which was intercepted by Saints cornerback Tracy Porter. The game went into overtime, and New Orleans got possession of the ball after winning the coin toss. Kicker Garrett Hartley made a 40-yard field goal, sending the Saints to Super Bowl XLIV. The Super Bowl was played in Miami against the Colts, who had won Super Bowl XLI there three years earlier. Indianapolis jumped out to a 10-0 lead by the end of the 1st quarter. The Saints were unable to score a touchdown in the first half, and instead settled for two long Hartley field goals, making the score 10-6 at halftime. The 3rd quarter opened with New Orleans executing a surprise onside kick, and both teams got into an argument over who got hold of the ball. The Saints were ultimately ruled to have recovered it. A screen pass by Drew Brees to running back Pierre Thomas was good for a touchdown, giving the Saints a 13‚Äì10 lead, their first of the game. After another Colts touchdown, Hartley kicked another field goal to make it a 17‚Äì16 game. The Saints regained the lead with 5:42 remaining in the 4th quarter; a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brees to tight end Jeremy Shockey, followed by a two-point conversion by Lance Moore, made it a 24‚Äì17 Saints lead. On the Colts' ensuing drive, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Tracy Porter, who returned it 74 yards for the game-clinching touchdown. A strong defensive effort by New Orleans halted the Colts' attempt at another scoring drive, and the game ended 31‚Äì17. The Saints had finally won a championship after decades of futility, sending the city of New Orleans, and the region, into wild celebrations. =2010‚Äì2011= The Saints did not quite live up to their 2009 level of play the following season. Hosting the Vikings in the 2010 season opener, a much-vaunted rematch of the NFC Championship resulted in a meandering 14-9 win, the lowest-scoring victory of Sean Payton's tenure as head coach. After a close win in San Francisco, the Saints went 3-3 down the stretch, as Drew Brees threw several interceptions and Garrett Hartley (the hero of the 2009 postseason) missed multiple field goals that resulted in his being temporarily benched in favor of John Carney, a former Saint who had first played in the NFL back in 1988. The last remaining active NFL player from the 1980s booted two field goals to help New Orleans beat the 0-3 Carolina Panthers in Week 3. After a loss to the Cardinals the following week, Carney quit, and the kicking position returned to Hartley. Overall, the Saints looked sloppy and out of form during the early season, and they suffered their worst loss when the Cleveland Browns beat them at home in Week 7. But after the bye week, the team got back on course and won four games in a row before losing to Baltimore in Week 15. A Monday night matchup with the Atlanta Falcons saw New Orleans win 17-14. The Saints lost to Tampa Bay 23-13 to end the regular season with a record of 11-5. New Orleans reached the playoffs, but had to settle for a wild card spot as division rival Atlanta had already locked up the NFC South title and the #1 seed. The #5-seeded Saints headed to Seattle, where their season came to a spectacular end, as the 7-9 Seahawks overpowered the defending champions 41-36. The game was highlighted by a 67-yard touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch, who broke several tackles on the play. In 2011, New Orleans played in the season opener for the second year in a row, but this time in Green Bay as guests of the defending champion Packers. The Saints struggled, as the Packers quickly marched out to two touchdowns, but regained their composure in a wild shootout. Green Bay never lost their lead however, and went on to win the game 42-34 after stopping Saints rookie running back Mark Ingram on the 1-yard line as time expired. Opening at home in Week 2, the Saints easily beat Chicago 30-13, then won another shootout against the Houston Texans. Although New Orleans' defense had performed poorly up to Week 3, the unit got back in sync by limiting Jacksonville to 10 points in a 23-point win the following game. After beating winless Carolina, Drew Brees threw three interceptions as the Saints lost to Tampa Bay 26-20. In Week 7, the team hosted Indianapolis in what had been expected to be a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV, but without Peyton Manning, the Colts struggled. Brees threw 5 touchdown passes as the Saints crushed the Colts, 62-7. The Saints set a franchise record for most points in a game. However, the Saints reverted to their Week 6 form the following week, as Brees threw two interceptions, and the Saints suffered an astonishing defeat against the winless St. Louis Rams. However, that would prove to be the last loss of the regular season, as the Saints went on an eight-game winning streak to close the season. They defeated division rivals Tampa Bay and Atlanta, then came out of the bye week to blow out the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants 49-24 at home. The Saints then defeated the Lions 31-17, the Titans 21-17, and the Vikings 42-20. On Monday Night Football, the Saints hosted the Atlanta Falcons and went on to blow them out, 45-16 and secure the division title. In that game, Brees broke the NFL's single-season passing yardage record set by Dan Marino 27 years earlier. The Saints would finish the regular season with a 13-3 record by defeating the Panthers 45-17. However, the Saints finished behind the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers for the 3rd seed in the NFC playoffs. In the wild card round of the playoffs, the Saints hosted the Detroit Lions in the Lions' first playoff appearance since 1999. The Lions got off to a good start, ending the first half with a 14-10 lead, but couldn't keep up with the Saints, who prevailed 45-28. In the divisional round, the Saints traveled to San Francisco to face the #2-seeded 49ers. The Saints had trouble against the 49ers' defense, committed five turnovers. Despite the mishaps, the Saints remained one score behind the 49ers for most of the game. In a spectacular finish, the lead changed hands four times in the last four minutes, but the Saints lost 36-32, as 49ers quarterback Alex Smith threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with nine seconds left to end the Saints' 2011 season. Bountygate Scandal On March 2, 2012, the NFL announced the findings of an investigation of a bounty program that former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams and over two dozen defensive players maintained. The program rewarded cash to players for violent hits on opposing players that took place during the 2009‚Äì2011 seasons. Bounties were placed on four specific players: quarterbacks Brett Favre, Cam Newton, Aaron Rodgers, and Kurt Warner. The NFL hit the Saints hard with punishments. Williams, who became defensive coordinator with the St. Louis Rams, was suspended indefinitely. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season. Although he did not participate in the bounty program, he never told anyone to stop it. General Manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight regular season games, as he ignored an order from owner Tom Benson to ensure that the program was stopped. Assistant head coach Joe Vitt (who was named interim head coach during Payton's suspension) was banned for the first six regular season games. The Saints were also fined $500,000 and stripped of their 2nd-round picks in the 2012 and 2013 NFL drafts.http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans- saints-banned-one-year-bounties Payton began his suspension April 15 after his appeal was rejected. Loomis and Vitt also appealed their suspensions, but they were upheld.http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7792405/nfl-upholds-suspension- new-orleans-saints-sean-payton-mickey-loomis-joe-vitt The NFL later announced punishments to four current and former Saints players. Linebacker Jonathan Vilma was suspended for the entire 2012 season; he twice offered $10,000 to anyone who knocked out Warner and Favre in the 2009 playoffs. Defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season. Will Smith was suspended for four games, and Scott Fujita (now with the Cleveland Browns) received a three-game ban.http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d828cf1cf/article/jonathan-vilma- among-four-saints-suspended-in-bounty-case All of the suspensions were without pay. A grievance was filed on behalf of the suspended players, but it was rejected. All of the players have appealed to Commissioner Roger Goodell.http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/08/arbitrator-rejects- bounty-grievance/ =2012: Bountygate Punishment= After much negotiation, the Saints re-signed quarterback Drew Brees. Due to the Bountygate scandal, head coach Sean Payton, as well as some of the defensive players allegedly involved in the scandal, were not allowed to play. The 2012 season began in disappointing fashion with four straight losses to the Washington Redskins, Carolina Panthers, Kansas City Chiefs, and Green Bay Packers. Then the Saints went on to win five of their next six games, including handing division rival Atlanta its first loss of the season. After three straight losses to San Francisco, Atlanta, and the defending champion New York Giants, the Saints won two of their last three games, including a 41-0 shutout against division rival Tampa Bay. The 2012 season ended with a 7-9 record for the Saints, their first losing season since 2007. The Saints finished 1st in the NFL in passing yards per game and 2nd in overall offense, but they were last in the league in overall defense. =2013= As the team tried to leave the Bountygate in the past, Sean Payton returned to the team as Head Coach following the 2012 season. 2013 prove to be a successful season for the Saints, going undefeated at home and going 11‚Äì5, making it into the playoffs as a 6th seed. They manage to win their first road playoff game in franchise history against the Philadelphia Eagles, 26‚Äì24. They advanced to 1st seed Seattle Seahawks, getting defeated by the eventual Super Bowl champions 15‚Äì23. =2014‚Äì2015= 2014 was not a memorable year for the Saints. Despite being 2nd in total offense, they went 7‚Äì9, with most of the reason for the disappointing season coming from the defense, who ranked 31st in defense that year, turnovers, and inconsistency. They were eliminated from playoff contention after a 14‚Äì30 loss to their divisional rival Atlanta Falcons in the second-to-last week of the regular season. 2015 also proved to be a mostly forgettable year for the Saints. They finished 7‚Äì9 again mainly part to once again having one of the league's worst defenses. =2016: 50th season= The Saints, in their 50th season, despite having the top scoring offense in the league, finished 7-9 for the third consecutive year. This put them in place for the 11th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. They picked Alvin Kamara. Drew Brees threw for over 5,000 yards for the fifth time in his career. Brandin Cooks and Michael Thomas, the 47th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, both had over 1,000 yards receiving. Running back Mark Ingram broke 1,000 yards rushing for the first time in his career. =2017: Return to the playoffs= Before the season, the Saints acquired longtime Viking and All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson. However after playing in only four games in which he rushed for 81 total yards, the Saints traded Peterson to the Arizona Cardinals. Alvin Kamara would go on to have a successful rookie season as the Saints finished the year with an 11-5 record to return to the playoffs after a three-year absence.  Minnesota Miracle  However, after defeating their division rivals, the Carolina Panthers, in the opening round, the Saints were eliminated from the playoffs after losing to the Minnesota Vikings when a missed tackle allowed Stefon Diggs to score the game-winning touchdown on the final play. =2018= The 2018 season was the first season since 1984 without longtime owner Tom Benson, as he died on March 15, 2018. His wife, Gayle, assumed ownership duties. The Saints enjoyed another strong season as they finished the year with a 13-3 record and first-round bye. Highlights of this season included Drew Brees surpassing Peyton Manning for most career touchdown passes during a win against the Washington Redskins; he also beat the Ravens for the first time in his career.  NOLA No-Call  The moment Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman committed an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty on Tommylee Lewis during the 2018 NFC Championship Game They defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles in the Divisional round, but controversially lost to the Los Angeles Rams, led by 32-year-old head coach Sean McVay, in the title game. Saints fans later cried out against an uncalled pass interference against Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman call that was a pivotal turning point in the fourth quarter; had the pass interference call been made, the Saints would have likely put the game away by scoring a touchdown, but were forced to settle for a field goal instead, which the Rams easily matched on the next drive to force overtime, in which they Rams won with a field goal. This ruling lead to numerous lawsuits against the NFL from Saints fans and led to a rule change allowing challenge flags to be used on pass interference calls.

It officially started on May 15, 1979, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1979, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1979. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean. With ten storms, less than two-thirds of the average of seventeen, this season was very inactive. There were six hurricanes, also below average. Of those hurricanes, four were major by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, 1979 remains the most recent year without any tropical cyclones active in the Central Pacific. __TOC__ Systems ImageSize = width:800 height:190 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1979 till:01/12/1979 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1979 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:29/05/1979 till:31/05/1979 color:TD text:\\"One-E (TD)\\" from:31/05/1979 till:04/06/1979 color:C2 text:\\"Andres (C2)\\" from:21/06/1979 till:25/06/1979 color:TS text:\\"Blanca (TS)\\" from:14/07/1979 till:16/07/1979 color:TS text:\\"Carlos (TS)\\" from:16/07/1979 till:16/07/1979 color:TD text:\\"Five-E (TD)\\" from:17/07/1979 till:23/07/1979 color:C3 text:\\"Dolores (C3)\\" barset:break from:17/08/1979 till:24/08/1979 color:C4 text:\\"Enrique (C4)\\" from:21/08/1979 till:25/08/1979 color:C3 text:\\"Fefa (C3)\\" from:04/09/1979 till:04/09/1979 color:TD text:\\"Nine-E (TD)\\" from:08/09/1979 till:13/09/1979 color:C1 text:\\"Guillermo (C1)\\" from:04/10/1979 till:06/10/1979 color:TS text:\\"Hilda (TS)\\" from:23/10/1979 till:30/10/1979 color:C4 text:\\"Ignacio (C4)\\" barset:break from:15/11/1979 till:18/11/1979 color:TS text:\\"Jimena (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/1979 till:01/06/1979 text:May from:01/06/1979 till:01/07/1979 text:June from:01/07/1979 till:01/08/1979 text:July from:01/08/1979 till:01/09/1979 text:August from:01/09/1979 till:01/10/1979 text:September from:01/10/1979 till:01/11/1979 text:October from:01/11/1979 till:01/12/1979 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" =Tropical Depression One-E= A tropical disturbance formed on May 29 south of Manzanillo, Mexico and moved slowly southwestward. On May 31, the storm was upgraded to tropical depression status based on satellite data. Shortly after becoming a depression, the storm turned northward over cooler waters where it rapidly weakened and dissipated southwest of Manzanillo. The only effects from the tropical depression was from a ship which reported heavy rainfall. =Hurricane Andres= A depression formed on May 31, In early June, it became a hurricane, subsequently named Andres, and approached the Mexican coast as a large hurricane. The hurricane disintegrated rapidly as it approached the coast, and eventually made landfall as a weak depression on June 4. Initial reports indicated that the storm made landfall with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h); however, according to the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Database, the storm crossed the shore with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Around Acapulco, airlines canceled flights in and out of the region on June 3 and resumed the following day after the passage of Andres. Torrential rainfall triggered widespread flooding which inundated homes and floated cars left on streets. High winds also downed power lines, leaving many residents without electricity. Offshore, two fishermen were killed by the storm after their boat capsized amidst rough seas. =Tropical Storm Blanca= A westward moving tropical disturbance from the Atlantic crossed into the Pacific Ocean over Costa Rica and Panama on June 17. Continuing westward, the disturbance developed into the third tropical depression of the season on June 21. It further intensified and became Tropical Storm Blanca, eventually peaking as a relatively weak 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm. As Blanca was heading west-northwestward, it began to slowly weaken after peak intensity, and later dissipated on June 25. Blanca remained out at sea for the entire duration, and no fatalities or damage was reported as a result. =Tropical Storm Carlos= A tropical disturbance formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 11. The system moved across the Gulf of Tehuantepec 9 mph (14 km/h) and gradually intensified. By late on July 14, satellites indicated a cyclonic circulation; the disturbance was promptly classified as Tropical Depression Four while west of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. As the depression moved over sea surface temperatures (SST's) of , it rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos early on July 15. As Carlos headed westward at , it continued to strengthen. By midday on July 15, Carlos attained its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Carlos moved over slightly colder SST's, and a weakened trend began as a result. Early on July 16, Carlos was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated later that day. =Tropical Depression Five-E= On July 16, Tropical Depression Five formed approximately west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico. The depression tracked northwestward and did not intensify into a tropical storm. Instead, the depression dissipated later that day. =Hurricane Dolores= Dolores began as a tropical disturbance that developed 350 n mi south of the Guatemalan coast on July 14. Moving west at 11 mph (17 km/h) the disturbance began to intensify. By July 17, a circulation had developed in the center and the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression near 10.5N 103.7W. Winds increased to 40 mph (65 km/h) by 1800 UTC and the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores. Dolores intensified over 85.F water as it moved around a high pressure area over the west coast of Baja California. It then was upgraded to a hurricane on July 18 at 1800 UTC. On July 19 at 0600 UTC, Dolores turned to the northwest and intensified rapidly. Satellite imagery showed Dolores with a well defined eye by 1800 UTC July 19. Winds increased near the center to 115 mph (185 km/h) by July 20 and Dolores reached its maximum intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) on July 21. Moving 690 mi (1110 km) offshore and parallel to the Baja California coast, the cyclone began to weaken over cooler 78.F water. By July 22 it was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm. The next day it was downgraded to a tropical depression near 23.3 N 127.0W. The final advisory on the cyclone was issued at 1800 UTC 23 July. =Hurricane Enrique= Enrique began as a tropical disturbance that developed over the open Pacific on August 17. Moving west at 10 mph (16 km/h), the disturbance began to intensify over 86.F water. By August 17 at 1800 UTC a circulation had developed about in the center, and the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression. The next day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Enrique. On the 19th of August the storm was upgraded to hurricane status, it then moved over cooler water and began to weaken to a tropical storm. By August 21, winds increased to 80 mph (130 km/h) and the storm was upgraded again to a hurricane near 16.4N, 126.7W. Enrique intensified rapidly on August 22 and reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) at 1200 UTC. The storm then moved over cooler waters and weakened. Enrique was downgraded to a tropical storm near 20.4N, 132.0W. By August 24 it was downgraded to a tropical depression near 21.3N 135.8W. Enrique then dissipated several hours later. The final advisory on the cyclone was issued at 1800 UTC. =Hurricane Fefa= Fefa began as a tropical disturbance south-southeast of Acapulco on August 19. It then was upgraded to a tropical depression on August 21 and a tropical storm a few hours later. As Fefa moved west-northwest, winds increased to 75 mph (120 km/h) and on August 22 at 0600 UTC, Fefa was upgraded to a hurricane. Fefa then started to rapidly intensify, reaching its peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) on August 23 at 1200 UTC. Moving to the west, Fefa accelerated to 22 mph (35 km/h) and slowed down as it started to weaken over cooler water. By August 24, winds in the center of Fefa had decreased to 75 mph (120 km/h) and the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing to weaken, Fefa was downgraded to a tropical depression near 18.N, 122.7 W. The final advisory on the cyclone was issued the next day as Fefa dissipated. =Tropical Depression Nine-E= This depression existed on September 4. =Hurricane Guillermo= Guillermo originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 7. The system moved northwestward at 17 mph (27 km/h), and was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ten on September 8. The depression quickly intensified, and became a tropical storm on September 9. Guillermo was a short-lived hurricane which did not have direct impacts on land. =Tropical Storm Hilda= A tropical disturbance developed south of Guatemala on October 1. The system intensified as it moved west over SST's of at least . By early on October 4, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Eleven. After forming, the depression continued west 15 mph (24 km/h) over SST's of . The depression eventually turned west-northwest, where it intensified into Tropical Storm Hilda on October 5. Hilda was a short-lived storm which did not affect land. =Hurricane Ignacio= On October 22, a well-organized area of low pressure formed a few hundred miles of the coast of Guatemala. The next day, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center upgraded the low into a depression. The system would strengthen into a tropical storm hours prior to formation. The system strengthened into a tropical storm, which was named Ignacio. On October 25, Tropical Storm Ignacio strengthened into a minimal hurricane on October 26. It quickly intensified, becoming a major hurricane a few hours later. On October 27, Ignacio reached its peak intensity with winds of up to 145 mph (230 km/h). On October 28, however, the storm began to weaken, and was downgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. On October 29, it weakened into a tropical storm. The system weakened to a depression on October 30. Ignacio made landfall on the coast of western Mexico as a tropical depression. The storm dissipated hours later after landfall, without causing any impact. =Tropical Storm Jimena= The final tropical cyclone of the season developed from a tropical disturbance which formed 92 mi (148 km) south of Panama on November 13. The system headed west-northwest at until curving westward and speeding up to on the following day. As the disturbance intensified over SST's of , satellite imagery indicated that a cyclonic circulation existed. As a result, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Thirteen while west-southwest of the Cabo Blanco Absolute Natural Reserve on November 15. The depression steadily intensified as it headed westward, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jimena later that day. On the following day, Jimena turned west-northwestward and continued to intensify. Later that day, Jimena peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Also on November 16, Jimena curved briefly northwestward. After resuming its westward direction, Jimena began to weaken from SST's of and cold, dry, and northerly winds from the Gulf of Tehuantepec. By early on November 18, Jimena weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Jimena was declared dissipated while centered south of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico.

Th√©odore Maunoir was born to a wealthy family of doctors in Geneva. Following family tradition he studied medicine in England and France and gained his doctorate in surgery in 1833. After his return to his home city, he became a member of the Geneva Commission for Hygiene and Health and the Geneva Society for Public Welfare. He was considered extremely intelligent and charming with an excellent sense of humor. When he married for the first time, he took on additional children from his wife's previous marriage. When she died, he married again and had further children with his second wife. His family, especially in his efforts in raising his children, played a large role in his life aside from his work as a doctor and medical consultant. After the publication of Henry Dunant's book A Memory of Solferino in 1862, Maunoir, together with Gustave Moynier, Guillaume-Henri Dufour and Louis Appia, joined the \\"Committee of Five\\" which was founded in February 1863 as a commission of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare. Soon afterwards, the five men decided to rename the committee to the \\"International Committee for Relief to Wounded Soldiers,\\" which by 1876 evolved into the \\"International Committee of the Red Cross\\" (ICRC). In the initial meetings of committee, Maunoir supported Dunant's ideas to propel the concepts behind the Red Cross into a widespread social movement reaching out to as many people as possible, instead of only creating an organization through negotiations with powerful political and military figures. From 26 to 29 October 1863, an international conference took place in Geneva to examine the practical implementation of Dunant's ideas. When differences between the delegates about the use of volunteers in caring for the wounded threatened to cause the conference to fail, Maunoir gave a persuasive speech that helped avert this result. Maunoir was especially close friends with Louis Appia, who was also a professional surgeon. Maunoir was a sort of mentor in Geneva society to 12-years younger Appia, who had only first come to Geneva at the age of 31. Maunoir remained a member of the ICRC until his early and unexpected death in 1869. His successor in the Committee was the local Geneva politician Louis Micheli de la Rive.

Confederate forces defeated the Union's only attempt to capture Charleston, South Carolina, by land. Its noted for the court martial of the Union Brig. Gen. Henry Benham for trying to take James Island, which was against the orders given. https://acws.co.uk/archives-history-battle_secessionville Prelude The importance of Charleston to the Confederate cause, after the Union implemented their Anaconda Plan, can be summarized in the words of Gen. Robert E. Lee, \\"The loss of Charleston would cut us off almost entirely from communications with the rest of the world and close the only channel through which we can expect to get supplies from abroad, now almost our only dependence.\\" After the Battle of Port Royal, the Union planned an expedition against Charleston, capturing Edisto and John's Island, and by June 2, they had 20 vessels in the Stono Inlet. Union troops on Edisto moved to Seabrook's Island, then across John's Island to Legareville and onto James Island at the Thomas Grimball plantation. The defenders of Charleston had laid breastworks across the 125 yard wide peninsula separating Folly Island from Morris Island. This Seccessionville work was referred to as the Tower Battery, because of its reconnaissance platform. Thomas G. Lamar was in command of the battery, while Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist was in overall command of James Island. The battery included a Columbiad, two 24-lb rifled artillery pieces, and several 18-lb guns, all manned by 500 men. Secessionville itself consisted of a few summer homes belonging to the James Island planters. James Island defenses consisted of Fort Pemberton on the west along the Stono River south of Wappoo Creek, extending southwards to the Tower Battery, and back up to Fort Johnson to the east along the Charleston Harbor. Confederate troops manning the defenses included the 24th South Carolina Infantry Regiment under the command of Col. Clement H. Stevens, the Charleston Battalion (1st South Carolina Battalion) under the command of Lt. Col. Peter Charles Gaillard, Thomas Lamar's 1st Battalion of South Carolina Artillery, the Eutaw Battalion under the command of Lt. Col. Simonton, the Palmetto Battalion under the command of Maj. E. B. White, the 2nd Battalion of South Carolina Artillery under the command of Maj. J. W. Brown, Co. D of the 3rd Battalion South Carolina Cavalry, and the Macbeth Light Artillery. They were joined by the 4th Louisiana Battalion under the command of Lt. Col. John McEnery, the Pee Dee Battalion (9th South Carolina Battalion) under the command of Lt. Col. Alexander D. Smith, the 47th Georgia Volunteer Infantry and the 22nd South Carolina. Battle Fort Sumter National Monument marker of the Map of Charleston Harbor defenses showing Secessionville in the lower left Map of Secessionville Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. In early June 1862, Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter transported the Union divisions of Brig. Gens. Horatio G. Wright and Isaac I. Stevens, under the immediate direction of Brig. Gen. Henry Benham, to James Island, where they entrenched at Grimball's Landing near the southern flank of the Confederate defenses. Benham landed 6,600 men from the 3rd New Hampshire, 8th Michigan Infantry , 7th Connecticut Infantry, 28th Massachusetts, 100th Pennsylvania Infantry, 46th New York Volunteer Infantry, 3rd Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, and 79th New York \\"Highlanders\\" on the southeastern end of James Island, and marched toward Charleston. On June 10, Gen. John C. Pemberton sent the 1st South Carolina Rifle Regiment and the 4th Louisiana Battalion, under the command of Col. Hagood, supported by the 47th Georgia Volunteer Infantry under the command of Col. Gilbert W.M. Williams, to Grimball's plantation. His intent was to establish a Confederate battery in opposition to the Union gunboats. However, the 47th New York Volunteer Infantry, 45th Pennsylvania Infantry, and the 97th Pennsylvania Infantry put up an effective defense and the Confederates were repulsed. On June 14, Brig. Gen. Nathan \\"Shanks\\" Evans arrived with two regiments and took command of Confederate forces. For the next two days, the Federal and Confederate batteries exchanged fire. Capt. Joshua Jamison's 100-man detachment from the 22nd South Carolina joined the battery on the morning of the 16th. At about 4:30 a.m. on June 16, the Northern troops attacked the Confederate fort at Secessionville where Colonel Thomas G. Lamar commanded about 500 men who had a number of very heavy artillery guns and a good field of fire. Marshy terrain to the north and south would constrict any Union advance. In the lead was the 8th Michigan and behind them was the 7th Connecticut and the 28th Massachusetts. The 8th Michigan were \\"mowed down in swaths\\" from \\"a shower of musket balls and discharges of grape and canister\\" from the Confederate cannon, according to one Union officer. Yet, some of the Union infantrymen made it into the fort fighting the Confederate artillerymen hand to hand before Confederate infantry reinforcements arrived to help Lamar's decimated men. These were Lt. Col. Alexander D. Smith's 9th South Carolina Battalion, up from Secessionville. Lt. Col. Peter Gaillard's Charleston Battalion soon followed and the battle became a rifle match along the battery wall and swamp lines. Lt. Col. Joseph Hawley's 7th Connecticut's advance halted when their left flank became mired in the marsh mud and their right received canister and grape. The 28th Massachusetts followed the 7th into the same mire and both regiments became intermingled as the Confederates continued to shoot and shell the confused mass of men. In the meantime, Lt. Col. John McEnery's 4th Louisiana Battalion advanced to reinforce Lamar's garrison, while Simonton's Eutaw Battalion advanced along Battery Island Road to face the Union left flank. A Union battery, the 1st Connecticut under Capt. Alfred P. Rockwell, finally started firing on the Confederate garrison as the Highlanders of the 79th New York under Lt. Col. David Morrison advanced. Confederate artillery fire forced the 79th to the right flank of the fort where they joined the remnants of the 8th Michigan. The 79th mounted the top of Tower Battery and went over the wall. In the end however, they were repulsed, as had the 8th Michigan before them, when reinforcements failed to appear. The 100th Pennsylvania Roundheads, under the command of Maj. David Leckey, tried to support the Highlanders, but their attack stalled as did the previous ones with Confederate canister and grape. Col. Rudolph Rosa's 46th New York tried to line up on the 100th's left, but some retreated with the fleeing Irish 28th Massachusetts and the 7th Connecticut, while the remainder received Confederate canister. Finally, Col. Daniel Leisure ordered a general retreat. Isaac Stevens ordered the 28th Massachusetts, 100th Pennsylvania, 46th New York, 8th Michigan, 79th New York, and the 7th Connecticut to retreat back towards the hedges. The attack had lasted less than 45 minutes. Yet, the Union advances were not over. On the other side of the marsh to the north was a piece of land the 3rd New Hampshire under Lt. Col. John H. Jackson, supported by Maj. Edwin Metcalf's 3rd Rhode Island Heavy Artilley, used to advance upon the right flank of Tower Battery. However, 150 yards of marsh prevented any Union advance upon the fort's defenders, while Confederate batteries to the north fired into their backs. By then, the 4th Louisiana had advanced to the fort's defense. Additionally, the Eutaw Battalion had advanced to the 24th South Carolina's east-west picket line off the Battery Island Road, in a heavy thicket north of the Union's 3rd Rhode Island and 3rd New Hampshire. The 3rd New Hampshire were now encircled in a ring of fire, forcing their retreat back to the west, while the 3rd Rhode Island, who had advanced upon the Confederate thicket to the north, were also forced to retreat. Aftermath Thomas Lamar was hailed as \\"The Hero of Secessionville.\\" While Benham feared further casualties amongst his six shattered regiments after three assaults, and declared the battle a \\"reconnaissance in force.\\" Hunter relieved Benham of his command for disobedience, citing the 10 June directive forbidding an attack on Charleston or Fort Johnson, and placed under arrest. On 27 June, Hunter ordered the abandonment of James Island and by 7 July, all Union forces were gone. On 26 Jan. 1863, Judge Advocate General of the United States Army Gen. Joseph Holt decided Benham's attack was justified and was not prohibited by the 10 June directive. However, Benham would never again be given a field command.

This technique is also equivalent to several trademarked techniques that have the monikers direct metal deposition (DMD), and laser consolidation (LC). Compared to processes that use powder beds, such as selective laser melting (SLM) objects created with this technology can be substantially larger, even up to several feet long. Method A high power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied coaxially to the focus of the laser beam through a deposition head. The laser beam typically travels through the center of the head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The X-Y table is moved in raster fashion to fabricate each layer of the object. The head is moved up vertically after each layer is completed. Metal powders are delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head either by gravity, or by using a pressurized carrier gas. An inert shroud gas is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen for better control of properties, and to promote layer to layer adhesion by providing better surface wetting. Other techniques This process is similar to other 3D fabrication technologies in its approach in that it forms a solid component by the layer additive method. The LENS process can go from metal and metal oxide powder to metal parts, in many cases without any secondary operations. LENS is similar to selective laser sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. It can produce parts in a wide range of alloys, including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials; as well as composite and functionally graded materials. Primary applications for LENS technology include repair and overhaul, rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing, and limited-run manufacturing for aerospace, defense, and medical markets. Microscopy studies show the LENS parts to be fully dense with no compositional degradation. Mechanical testing reveals outstanding as-fabricated mechanical properties. The process can also make \\"near\\" net shape parts when it is not possible to make an item to exact specifications. In these cases post production process like light machining, surface finishing, or heat treatment may be applied to achieve end compliance.It is used as finishing operations.

Many of the houses in the neighborhood are large single homes or twins built at a later period than much of central North Philadelphia. There is also a significant number of typical Philadelphia rowhouses. Boundaries East Oak Lane is currently defined by the borders of Cheltenham Avenue at the north (the border between Philadelphia and Cheltenham Township), Broad Street on the west, Godfrey Avenue at the south, and 5th street to the east. Historical background This area of Philadelphia was first settled in 1683 as William Penn's first neighborhood. In 1695, a Welshman named Griffith Miles bought 250 acres of land and built a log home along a dirt road that would later be known as Oak Lane. The area became known as Milestown in 1711, and as farming began to flourish, water-powered mills were built. The road that came to define the neighborhood, initially called Martin's Mill Road, was renamed Oak Lane by a landowner in 1860, in remembrance of an ancient oak tree that had blown down in a storm. Milestown School Painting of the original 1745 one-story building of the Milestown School and adjoining octagonal schoolhouse added in 1818 The first school building at what is now 12th and Oak Lane was a one- story schoolhouse, built in 1745 and donated in 1761 by Joseph Armitage to the trustees of what was then the Milestown School. Ornithologists Alexander Wilson and John Bachman were among the teachers there. An octagonal schoolhouse was added in 1818. The building and grounds were given to the City of Philadelphia for a public school in 1866. Ellwood School, an \\"L\\"-shaped elementary school building, was built in 1957 on the site of a previous 1875 schoolhouse, which replaced the original buildings of the Milestown School. Buildings and landmarks Across the street from Ellwood School, the Oak Lane Branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia still operates in its historic 1910 building at the corner of 12th and Oak Lane, renovated in 1958 and 1999. East Oak Lane is known for \\"large, elaborate houses of various styles\\" and \\"grand churches.\\" Numerous architectural styles are visible, for example, in the area between 65th and 69th Avenues, with homes that have been the subjects of paintings by artist Chuck Connelly. Across the railroad tracks, a row of shops, most built in the second half of the 20th century, gives the impression of a small town Main Street. Demographics and notable residents In addition to its architectural diversity, East Oak Lane has long been known for being racially and ethnically diverse. Notable past residents have included: * Noam Chomsky, linguist and political theorist who grew up in East Oak Lane on Fairhill Street. While Chomsky described his family as being, in the 1930s and 1940s, \\"the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish and German Catholic neighborhood\\", he attended the nearby Oak Lane Country Day School, a \\"progressive and lively K-8 private school [whose] students were for the most part Jewish\\". * Vivian Green, singer-songwriter and pianist * Leslie Odom Jr., Tony Award-winning actor who originated the role of Aaron Burr in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton * Hugh Panaro, actor who played the title role in The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway for over eight years between 1999 and 2014 ReferencesFurther reading * * Category:Neighborhoods in Philadelphia Category:Olney-Oak Lane, Philadelphia ","title":"East Oak Lane, Philadelphia"},{"id":"2748604","text":"The Royal Danish Theatre ('RDT, Danish: ''''') is both the national Danish performing arts institution and a name used to refer to its old purpose-built venue from 1874 located on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen.

In 1905, France became a secular state and, since then, the French government has followed the principle of la√Øcit√©, in which the State does not recognize any official religion (except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). Instead, it merely recognizes certain religious organizations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. In return, religious organizations are to refrain from involvement in the State's policy-making. Background Terminology = French language terminology related to religion and freedom of religion differs somewhat from English. In particular, there are several misleading faux amis between French and English regarding religion: * The French culte means \\"(religious) worship\\", or, in a legal context, an organized \\"religion\\", taken in a broad sense. An organisation cultuelle is thus an organization that supports religious worship, not a \\"cult\\". As explained below, there are financial and other operational constraints for being recognized as an association cultuelle for tax purposes. * The French secte can have the meaning of the English sect, especially when applied to Buddhism. However, in general parlance, it has the derogatory meaning of the English \\"cult\\". =Government and religious organizations= The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society. The relationship between government and religious organizations in France is defined by the 1905 \\"Law concerning the separation of the churches and the state\\" (\\"Loi concernant la s√©paration des √âglises et de l'Etat\\"). Its first sentence is, though: > The Republic assures freedom of conscience. It guarantees the free exercise > of religious worship under the sole restrictions hereafter in the interest > of public order. The Republic does not grant recognition nor pay nor > subsidises any church. (La R√©publique assure la libert√© de conscience. Elle > garantit le libre exercice des cultes sous les seules restrictions √©dict√©es > ci-apr√®s dans l'int√©r√™t de l'ordre public. La R√©publique ne reconna√Æt, ne > salarie ni ne subventionne aucun culte.) The 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which is considered by legal authorities to have equal legal standing with the Constitution of France, states: > No one may be questioned about his opinions, [and the] same [for] religious > [opinions], provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public > order established by the law. and: > The law has the right to ward [i.e., forbid] only actions [which are] > harmful to the society. Any thing which is not warded [i.e., forbidden] by > the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it > [i.e., the law] does not order. Thus follows that the French government cannot arbitrarily regulate and prohibit religious activity; it is strictly constrained to regulate it only to the extent that there is a need to safeguard public order and prohibit actions harmful to society (such as, for instance, human sacrifices). The French concept of religious freedom did not grow out of an existing pluralism of religions but has its roots in a history with Roman Catholicism as the single official religion and including centuries of persecution of people not endorsing it, or straying from the most official line, from the Cathars to the Hugenots and the Jansenists ‚Äì this lasted until the French Revolution. French insistence on the lack of religion in all things public (la√Øcit√© or secularism) is a notable feature in the French ideal of citizenship. This concept of secularism, also plays a role in ongoing discussions about the wearing of scarves by Muslim women in public schools. In 2004, the French Parliament passed a law prohibiting the wearing of ostentatious religious garb in public primary and secondary schools; motivations included the tradition of keeping religious and political debates and proselytism out of such schools, as well as the preservation of the freedom of Muslim female students forced to wear certain costumes out of peer pressure. See French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. The French Republic has always recognised individuals rather than groups and holds that its citizens' first allegiance is to society in general and not to a particular group, religious or otherwise; the opposing attitude, known as communautarisme, is generally considered undesirable in political discourse in France. On the other hand, the state sees that it is also responsible to protect individuals from groups rather than to protect groups, religious or others. Apart from special cases due to historical circumstances (the local law in Alsace-Moselle and the military chaplaincy regimes), the French government is prohibited by law from granting official recognition to religion, and is also prohibited from subsidizing them or paying their personnel. However the government grants recognition to legal entities (associations) supporting religious activities. The difference is important, since the French government refuses to legally define what is a religion and what is not, and refuses to legally delimit the boundaries of religions. The state has a role in the appointment of bishops, directly in the case of Strasbourg and Metz, and indirectly (but with a rarely used power of veto) in that of other diocesan bishops. In consequence only suitable nationals are appointed and the episcopate does not reflect the ethnic diversity of practising Catholics in France. Individuals organizing as groups with the exclusive purpose of worship (associations cultuelles) may register as such and get significant tax exemptions set by law. Religious groups with non-worship (e.g. humanitarian) activities are free to get organized as associations with the usual tax exemptions granted to secular associations. These definitions are covered by an extensive body of jurisprudence (roughly, case law) which focuses on the activities of the groups from a financial point of view, and does, according to law, not take religious doctrine into account. The population of France is roughly 50% Roman Catholic, 4‚Äì5% Muslim, around 3% Protestant, 1% Jewish, 1% Buddhist, 1% other denominations, and 40% not religious (with 30% of atheists). Fran≈£a nu mai e o ≈£arƒÉ catolicƒÉ (France is no longer a Catholic country), Cotidianul, 2007-01-11; \\"France 'no longer a Catholic country'\\", Daily Telegraph, 10 January 2007 Church attendance is low among Catholics, and polls indicate that a significant proportion of the population is atheist or agnostic. Since the French government does not collect data on religious preferences, all quoted numbers should be considered with caution.  Attitudes with respect to minority religions and cults in France  Since the 1970s and 1980s, an increasing number of new religious movements have become active in France. Certain body of beliefs such as Scientology, the Children of God, the Unification Church, the Ra√´lism or the Order of the Solar Temple were listed by parliamentary reports as dangerous or criminal cults. Officials and associations fighting excesses of such groups, justified these measures by the need to have appropriate legal tools and the need to fight criminal organizations masquerading as legitimate religious groups. Critics contended that those actions unfairly targeted minority religions, jeopardized freedom of religion, and were motivated by prejudice. The matters were made even more complex by the fact that some of the groups involved are based in the United States, where they actively lobbied the intervention of the government of that country.The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored \\"War on Sects\\" Susan J. Palmer 2011 =Difficulties= France, as well as other countries, was aware of various tragedies caused by groups labeled as \\"destructive cults\\" such as the People's Temple, the Branch Davidians and Aum Shinrikyo and the suicide murders of the Order of the Solar Temple which occurred in Quebec, Switzerland and France. Furthermore, some groups such as the Church of Scientology were accused of defrauding their members. The population in general is not in favor of groups described as cults. In 2000, a representative 1000 person poll indicated that the majority of the polled people considered cults a significant threat to democracy (73%), their family and friends (66%), and themselves (64%) and 86% (76% of adherents of other religions than Catholicism) favored legislation restricting cults. Leaders of the French Protestant minority claim that freedom of religion was actually well protected in France and that cultural sensitivity and careful relationships with local authorities and other Christians could prevent most difficulties. * Jean-Arnold de Clermont, president of the French Association of Protestants: ::\\"I have no time for the idea that we live in a country that represses religious liberties. We continue to enjoy total freedom in setting up religious organizations as long as the existing legislation is known and applied.\\" *St√©phane Lauzet, the N√Æmes-based general secretary of the French Evangelical Alliance (part of the World Evangelical Fellowship): ::\\"Christian groups encounter problems mostly when they misunderstand or ignore the complex technicalities of French law. Even aggressive evangelists can work without any real problems as long as they stick to the law.\\" = Complaints by minority religions and groups = Some groups have complained that, following from the publications of those reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law, they have suffered from discrimination by public authorities, private corporations and individuals. The group Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Libert√© de Conscience, founded in January 2002, requested: :the dissolution of the MILS as its very purpose, \\"to fight against sects,\\" is an affront to the French Constitution which guarantees the religious neutrality of the State and the principle of separation of Church and State :the repeal of any discriminatory law containing the word \\"cult,\\" \\"sect,\\" \\"cultic,\\" or \\"sectarian\\" as laws should not specify groups as \\"sectarian\\" or \\"cultic\\" as, in a democracy, all individuals and groups should be treated equally and in the same manner. This group, however, has been qualified by a 2005 OSCE report as a partisan organization whose \\"allegations are essentially anonymous and thus of uncertain provenance and reliability.\\" Some limited controversy occurred in France concerning alleged religious discrimination regarding the security measures that the French government has deployed for official visits of Chinese officials and for festivities organised in collaboration with China, including the exclusion of pro-Tibet and pro-Falun Gong protesters from the path of the Chinese officials. The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights denounced the warm welcome of president Jiang Zemin in France, which it denounced as being motivated by economic prospects of trade with China. Many French politicians have denounced what they considered to be an over-zealous security apparatus in those visits. Similar controversial security measures have been implemented for the visit of former US president George W. Bush, another foreign head of state controversial in France. =Reports by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom= In its 2000 annual report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the U.S. Department of State, it was reported that \\"The ensuing publicity [by the release of a parliamentary report against \\"sectes\\"] contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance and bias against minority religions. Some religious groups reported that their members suffered increased intolerance after having been identified on the list.\\" In its 2004 annual report by the same commission it reports that \\"[...] official government initiatives and activities that targets \\"sects\\" or \\"cults\\" have fueled an atmosphere of intolerance toward members of minority religions in France. [...] These initiatives [the publication of reports characterizing specific groups as dangerous and the creating of agencies to monitor and fight these groups] and are particularly troubling because they are serving as models for countries in Eastern Europe where the rule of law and other human rights are much weaker than in France\\". They conclude with an assessment that since the restructuring of the main agency concerned with this issue (referring to the new MIVILUDES replacing its predecessor, MILS), have reportedly improved religious freedoms in France.Download PDF In its February 2004 statement, the commission recommended that the U.S. government urge the government of France to ensure that any state regulations on public expression of religious belief or affiliation adhere strictly to international human rights norms and that the French government and legislature should be urged to reassess their initiatives in light of its international obligations to ensure that every person in France is guaranteed the freedom to manifest his or her religion or belief in public, or not to do so. The Commission went on by giving advice to the French government that it should start to tackle immigration issues, which have been a topic of hot political debate for the past 25 years: The commission did not include France in their 2005 report. =Pew Research Center= According to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Among the world's 25 most populous nations, France is among the 12 countries with a high level of religious restrictions, according to 2015 data. In Europe, France has the second highest level of religious restrictions, behind only Russia. Official position about religious signs and symbols In 2004, France passed a law banning the use of \\"conspicuous\\" religious symbols in public schools, including the hijab. See drop-down essay on \\"Religious Freedom in France\\" Many Muslims complained that the law infringed on their freedom of religion. Similarly the Muslim Public Affairs Council called the ban \\"a major affront to freedom of religion\\", noting that many Muslims believe it is mandated by religious texts. Human Rights Watch stated that the law is \\"an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice\\". The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, appointed by the US government, expressed concern for the law in its 2004 report. It stated that \\"The French government's promotion of its understanding of the principle of secularism should not result in violations of the internationally recognized individual right to freedom of religion or belief.\\"2004 report , United States Commission on International Religious Freedom On 14 September 2010, an act of parliament was passed resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear, including masks, helmets, balaclava, niqƒÅbs and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances. The ban also applies to the burqa, a full-body covering, if it covers the face. It was reported that a set of rules including a ban on religious signs or symbols at civil marriages was introduced in the 9th and 10th arrondissements of Marseille. The mayor-council of Marseille did not support the ban.  Government activities against cults Actions of the national government= In 1982 premier minister Pierre Mauroy requested a report on sectes which was delivered by Alain Vivien in 1983. The \\"Rapport Vivien\\" outlines problems of families, possible reasons for this sudden increase in such groups, sects as described by themselves and by others, the legal situation in France and abroad, and recommends some actions like education of children in the sense of la√Øcit√©, better information of the general public, mediation between families and adherents by a family court, help to French adherents abroad, attention on the rights of children. It concludes with the Voltaire quotation: \\"Que chacun dans sa loi cherche en paix la lumi√®re.\\" (\\"So that everyone within its law can search in peace for the light\\") The National Assembly instituted the first Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France in 1995, headed by parliament members Alain Gest and Jacques Guyard, following the mass suicide of adepts of the Order of the Solar Temple. On March 21, 2000, the Justice Court of Paris found Jacques Guyard guilty of defamation for having called Anthroposophy a secte (\\"cult\\") practicing \\"mental manipulation\\". He was fined FF 20,000 and ordered to pay FF 90,000 to the anthroposophical Federation of Steiner schools. The Court stated that \\"the investigation [of that parliamentary report] was not serious. It is proved that it only considered affidavits by alleged 'victims' of Anthroposophy but that neither the authors of these affidavits nor the alleged perpetrators were heard by the [parliamentary] commission\\". The Paris judges also decided to strip Guyard of his parliamentary immunity in connection with this case. (Le Monde March 23, 2000) The most controversial part of the report was the appendix, where a list of purported cults compiled by the general information division of the French National Police (Renseignements g√©n√©raux) was reprinted. It contained 173 groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, the Theological Institute of N√Æmes (a fundamentalist Christian Bible college), and the Church of Scientology. Although this list has no statutory or regulatory importance, it is at the background of the criticism directed at France with respect to freedom of religion. Major concerns listed in these official reports and other discussions include: * the well-being of children raised in religious communities that isolate themselves from the rest of society, or, at least, ask their members to avoid social interaction with the rest of society; * child abuse, especially abusive corporal punishment or sexual abuse; * the defrauding of vulnerable members by the religious management; * suicides and killings in destructive cults; * the advocacy of medical practices that are generally considered unsafe, and the prohibition of some \\"mainstream\\" medical practices; * the aggressive proselytizing of minors and vulnerable persons; * the hidden influence peddling of certain groups in the administration and political circles. The government of Alain Jupp√© created in 1996 the \\"Observatoire interminist√©riel des sectes\\" (\\"interministerial board of observation of cults\\") which delivered yearly reports and out of which grew in 1998 the \\"Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects/Cults\\" (MILS) headed by Alain Vivien. MILS was formed to coordinate government monitoring of sectes (name given to cults in France). In February 1998 MILS released its annual report. The activities of the MILS and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization raised serious concerns and critiques from several human rights organizations and government bodies (See also About- Picard law#Reactions). In 1999, Vivien was put under police protection following threats and the burglary of his home (L'Humanit√©, January 14, 1999; ). Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism from groups targeted by the Report on Cult activities. An interministerial working group was formed to determine the future parameters of the Government's monitoring of sects, called the \\"Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances\\" (MIVILUDES; official site). Headed by Jean-Louis Langlais, senior civil servant at the Ministry of the Interior, MIVILUDES was charged with observing and analyzing movements that constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the appropriate response, informing the public about potential risks, and helping victims to receive aid. In its announcement of the formation of MIVILUDES, the Government acknowledged that its predecessor, MILS, had been criticized for certain actions abroad that could have been perceived as contrary to religious freedom. In an interview given in March 2003, Langlais emphasized that the issue at stake is not to fight \\"sects\\" as such but merely \\"deviances\\" these might have. However, he also admitted that it is difficult to define the concept of \\"deviances\\". In May 2005 the former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin issued a circular indicating that the list of cults published on the parliamentary report should no longer be used to identify cults. =Litigation= In a number of cases, minority religious groups have litigated against the national or local governments, or against private organizations, which they deemed to have infringed on their rights because of religious prejudice. * The association of Jehovah's Witnesses have lost and won court cases regarding their tax-exempt status, specifically concerning action on the part of the government of France to imposed a retroactive 108% tax on all donations received to the organizational body of Jehovah's Witnesses in France, and/or a 60% tax on incoming donations. On June 30, 2011, the European Court of Human Rights found the French government in violation of article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The ruling marked the first time France was found in violation of article 9. *In 2001 the psychiatrist Jean-Marie Abgrall and called for by French justice as an expert concerning cult affairs won a court suit deposed against him by the Rael Movement (Belgian branch). The latter movement had seen two of its members convicted for child abuseProc√®s Ra√´l contre Jean-Marie Abgrall, Prevensectes * On December 18, 2002, the Court of Appeal of Versailles reversed a decision by a lower court and convicted Jean-Pierre Brard ‚Äì a French deputy, Journal 15-25 ans, and the director of publication of this magazine, of libeling the Jehovah's Witnesses. The court ordered that a communiqu√© drafted by it be published in Journal 15-25 ans as well as in a national daily paper and that the defendants pay ‚Ç¨4,000 to the Christian Federation of Jehovah's Witnesses. The verdict related to a September 2001 report on sects published by Journal 15-25 ans, where Brard accused the Jehovah's Witnesses of employing the same methods as international criminal organizations. The deputy appealed the verdict to the Court of Cassation, which confirmed the conviction of Jean-Pierre Brard but canceled that of the director of publication.Court of Cassation, September 30, 2003, no 03-80039. * On November 6, 2002, the Auch court of large claims ordered the dissolution of an organization that had been explicitly created to prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from constructing a place of worship in Berdues. The court found that the organization's goal was to \\"hinder the free exercise of religion\\". * On October 17, 2002, the administrative court of Orl√©ans annulled a municipal decision issued by the mayor of Sorel-Moussel, which granted him the preemptive right to purchase a plot of land that the local Jehovah's Witness community had intended to buy and use for the construction of a house of worship. The court considered that the mayor had abused his right of preemption, since he exerted it without having an urbanization project prior to preemption. * On June 13, 2002, the administrative court of Poitiers annulled a municipal decision issued by the mayor of La Rochelle, which refused the use of a municipal room to the Jehovah's Witnesses on grounds that the Witnesses were listed in the 1995 parliamentary report; the court ruled that, while a mayor may refuse the use of a room for a motive of public order, the motive that he used in this case was not a motive of public order. * On March 21, 2000, the Justice Court of Paris found Jacques Guyard, one of the main author of the controversial parliamentary report against sects guilty of defamation for having called Anthroposophy a cult practicing \\"mental manipulation\\". He was fined, and his parliamentary immunity removed in connection with this case. (Le Monde March 23, 2000) * On October 16, 2013, the Council of State condemned the refusals of the French administration to accept the religious ministers of Jehovah's Witnesses as prison chaplains, explaining that the detainees \\"may exercise the religion of their choice, in accordance with the suitable conditions for organising the premises, within solely the limits imposed by security and good order in the institution\\".Jehovah's Witnesses chaplains must be approved for prisons, EUREL.

He founded the Ko√ß Group, one of Turkey‚Äôs largest groups of companies. During his lifetime he came to be one of Turkey's wealthiest citizens. Early life Vehbi Ko√ß was born in 1901 in √áorakalƒ±, a predominately Muslim neighborhood in Ankara. Vehbi Ko√ß then lived in a vineyard estate located in the Ke√ßi√∂ren district near Ankara. Purchased by his father in 1923, the property, which was left vacant after the Kasapyan family left the, was later acquired by Ko√ß and became the Vehbi Ko√ß museum in 1944 after a thorough renovation. Career Ko√ß began his working career in 1917 at the small grocery store his father opened in Ankara for him. The first firm he established was \\"Ko√ßzade Ahmet Vehbi\\" and was registered in 1926 at the Ankara Chamber of Commerce. While dealing with commerce, he became the local representative of Ford Motor Company and Standard Oil (presently Mobil) in 1928. When Ankara became the capital of young Turkish Republic, construction activities increased and Vehbi Ko√ß began trading in construction materials, building supplies and hardware. Following establishment of branch offices in Istanbul and Eski≈üehir in 1938, Ko√ß gathered its enterprises under the company Ko√ß Ticaret A.≈û. In 1942, Vehbi Ko√ß, who had not played any role in the Varlik Vergisi, saw the opportunities it afforded him as a businessman and took over many collapsed or confiscated companies. One such acquisition by Ko√ß was a building in Istanbul owned by an Armenian named Margarios Ohanyan, who had sold the property worth 1.5-2 million liras through public auction at a price significantly below value, in the owner's attempt to avoid paying the tax- hike. Ko√ß, nevertheless, hired many of the former owners and treated them with fairness and without racial prejudice.E.P. Nowill: Constantinople and Istanbul: 72 Years of Life in Turkey. Troubador Publishing, 2011. p. 77 Having convinced General Electric, he signed an agreement in 1948 to build a light bulb factory, which opened in 1952. Ko√ß took important steps in industry in the 1950s and manufactured automobiles, household appliances, radiators, electronic devices, textiles and matches. Factories like Bozkurt Mensucat, Ar√ßelik (1955), Demir Dokum (1954), Turkay, Aygaz (1962), Gazal, Turk Elektrik Endustrisi and a joint cable factory with Siemens were founded. In addition tractor production started under the Fiat license. The first initiative by Ko√ß in the automotive sector turned eventually to a full-scale industry. Following an agreement with Ford Motor Company in 1959, today's prominent automotive company Ford Otosan came to life. Following the production of the first domestic mass-production car Anadol in 1966 and in line with improving economic activities in Turkey, Vehbi Ko√ß collaborated with the Italian company FIAT to establish Tofa≈ü in 1968 resulting in the production of the second domestic car Murat in 1971. Vehbi Ko√ß consolidated all of the companies bearing his name under the same roof in 1963 and founded Ko√ß Holding A.≈û. The holdings era in Turkey started with this step by Vehbi Ko√ß and a great number of businessmen followed him. The group also has international partnerships with well-known companies such as Fiat, Ford Motor Co., Yamaha and Allianz. During his 76-year career, he created an immense organization with more than 108 companies in the Ko√ß Group, all of which are specialized in different sectors such as food, retailing, finance, energy, automotives, tourism and technology. The Ko√ß Group has 80,000 employees, ca.$40 billion turnover, $900 million of exports and $500‚Äì600 million of investment annually. Today, it is one of the world's 200 largest enterprises. Ko√ß retired in 1984 to devote more time to social activities. His son Rahmi took over the leadership of the Ko√ß Group companies. Philanthropy Vehbi Ko√ß founded an Eye Bank at the Faculty of Medicine of Ankara University, a Cardiology Institute at the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul University, the Turkish Education Foundation (T√ºrk Eƒüitim Vakfƒ±), and the Vehbi Ko√ß Student Dorm at ODT√ú (METU). He established the Vehbi Ko√ß Foundation on 17 January 1969 to promote activities in the fields of education, health and culture. Vehbi Ko√ß donated the Atat√ºrk Library in Taksim, Istanbul to the Municipality of Istanbul in 1976 and in 1980 opened Turkey's first private museum, the Sadberk Hanim Museum in memory of his late wife, Sadberk. Ko√ß was honorary chairman of Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi S.K. in Ankara. Ko√ß School opened in 1988, and Ko√ß University opened its classroom doors in 1993. He also established the T√ºrkiye Aile Saƒülƒ±ƒüƒ± ve Planlamasƒ± Vakfƒ± (The Turkish Family Health and Planning Foundation) and functioned as the president of the foundation until his death. Death Vehbi Ko√ß died from heart failure on 25 February 1996 in a hotel in Antalya, where he was with his daughter Sevgi and son-in-law celebrating the Ramazan Bayrami holiday. His corpse was transported the same evening to Istanbul by a Ko√ß Holding's business jet. On 27 February 1996, following a funeral service held at the holding's headquarter and later in Fatih Mosque, he was laid to rest at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. He was succeeded by his son Rahmi Ko√ß (b. 1930), and his daughters Semahat Arsel (b. 1928), Sevgi G√∂n√ºl (1938‚Äì2003) and Suna Kƒ±ra√ß (b. 1941). Snatching of corpse Grave of Vehbi Ko√ß at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery, Istanbul On 24 October 1996, the corpse of Vehbi Ko√ß was snatched from his grave. After some time, the body snatchers called the Ko√ß family and demanded a ransom. As the family refused to pay, they applied to the TV channel Kanal D, owned by Aydƒ±n Doƒüan, demanding 20 billion TL (around US$210,000 at that time). Since Kanal D showed no interest, the body snatchers called the TV channel InterStar, owned then by Cem Uzan, and reached an agreement to release the corpse against 25 billion TL (around US$260,000). Informed by the TV channel, the police captured two suspects, who came to the meeting point in a stolen car. Later, three other accomplices, including a woman and a hotel owner, were also arrested. Vehbi Ko√ß's corpse was found in another grave at the same cemetery not far from his resting place. At the request of the public prosecutor, the remains were taken to the city forensic medicine laboratory for identification by DNA profiling. Finally, the remains were reinterred in the presence of the family members.

At left, Copernicus' heliocentric motion. At right, traditional geocentric motion, including the retrograde motion of Mars. For simplicity, Mars' period of revolution is depicted as 2 years instead of 1.88, and orbits are depicted as perfectly circular or epitrochoid. The Copernican Revolution was the paradigm shift from the Ptolemaic model of the heavens, which described the cosmos as having Earth stationary at the center of the universe, to the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. This revolution consisted of two phases; the first being extremely mathematical in nature and the second phase starting in 1610 with the publication of a pamphlet by Galileo. Beginning with the publication of Nicolaus Copernicus‚Äôs De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, contributions to the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù continued until finally ending with Isaac Newton‚Äôs work over a century later. Heliocentrism Before Copernicus= The \\"Copernican Revolution\\" is named for Nicolaus Copernicus, whose Commentariolus, written before 1514, was the first explicit presentation of the heliocentric model in Renaissance scholarship. The idea of heliocentrism is much older; it can be traced to Aristarchus of Samos, a Hellenistic author writing in the 3rd century BC, who may in turn have been drawing on even older concepts in Pythagoreanism. Ancient heliocentrism was, however, eclipsed by the geocentric model presented by Ptolemy in the Almagest and accepted in Aristotelianism. European scholars were well aware of the problems with Ptolemaic astronomy since the 13th century. The debate was precipitated by the reception by Averroes' criticism of Ptolemy, and it was again revived by the recovery of Ptolemy's text and its translation into Latin in the mid-15th century. Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957 argued that the debate in 15th-century Latin scholarship must also have been informed by the criticism of Ptolemy produced after Averroes, by the Ilkhanid-era (13th to 14th centuries) Persian school of astronomy associated with the Maragheh observatory (especially the works of Al-Urdi, Al-Tusi and Ibn al-Shatir).George Saliba (1979). \\"The First Non- Ptolemaic Astronomy at the Maraghah School\\", Isis 70 (4), pp. 571‚Äì576. The state of the question as received by Copernicus is summarized in the Theoricae novae planetarum by Georg von Peuerbach, compiled from lecture notes by Peuerbach's student Regiomontanus in 1454 but printed only in 1472. Peuerbach attempts to give a new, mathematically more elegant presentation of Ptolemy's system, but he does not arrive at heliocentrism. Regiomontanus himself was the teacher of Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara, who was in turn the teacher of Copernicus. There is a possibility that Regiomontanus already arrived at a theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, as he paid particular attention to the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus in a late work, and mentions the \\"motion of the Earth\\" in a letter.Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers, Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212. =Nicolaus Copernicus= Nicolaus Copernicus's heliocentric model Copernicus studied at Bologna University during 1496-1501, where he became the assistant of Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara. He is known to have studied the Epitome in Almagestum Ptolemei by Peuerbach and Regiomontanus (printed in Venice in 1496) and to have performed observations of lunar motions on 9 March 1497. Copernicus went on to develop an explicitly heliocentric model of planetary motion, at first written in his short work Commentariolus some time before 1514, circulated in a limited number of copies among his acquaintances. He continued to refine his system until publishing his larger work, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (1543), which contained detailed diagrams and tables. The Copernican model makes the claim of describing the physical reality of the cosmos, something which the Ptolemaic model was no longer believed to be able to provide. Copernicus removed Earth from the center of the universe, set the heavenly bodies in rotation around the Sun, and introduced Earth's daily rotation on its axis.Osler (2010), p. 44 While Copernicus's work sparked the \\"Copernican Revolution\\", it did not mark its end. In fact, Copernicus's own system had multiple shortcomings that would have to be amended by later astronomers. Copernicus did not only come up with a theory regarding the nature of the sun in relation to the earth, but thoroughly worked to debunk some of the minor details within the geocentric theory. In his article about heliocentrism as a model, author Owen Gingerich writes that in order to persuade people of the accuracy of his model, Copernicus created a mechanism in order to return the description of celestial motion to a ‚Äúpure combination of circles.‚Äù Copernicus‚Äôs theories made a lot of people uncomfortable and somewhat upset. Even with the scrutiny that he faced regarding his conjecture that the universe was not centered around the Earth, he continued to gain support- other scientists and astrologists even posited that his system allowed a better understanding of astronomy concepts than did the geocentric theory. ReceptionTycho Brahe= Tycho Brahe's geoheliocentric model Tycho Brahe (1546‚Äì1601) was a Danish nobleman who was well known as an astronomer in his time. Further advancement in the understanding of the cosmos would require new, more accurate observations than those that Nicolaus Copernicus relied on and Tycho made great strides in this area. Tycho formulated a geoheliocentrism, meaning the Sun moved around the Earth while the planets orbited the Sun, known as the Tychonic system. Although Tycho appreciated the advantages of Copernicus's system, he like many others could not accept the movement of the Earth. In 1572, Tycho Brahe observed a new star in the constellation Cassiopeia. For eighteen months, it shone brightly in the sky with no visible parallax, indicating it was part of the heavenly region of stars according to Aristotle's model. However, according to that model, no change could take place in the heavens so Tycho's observation was a major discredit to Aristotle's theories. In 1577, Tycho observed a great comet in the sky. Based on his parallax observations, the comet passed through the region of the planets. According to Aristotelian theory, only uniform circular motion on solid spheres existed in this region, making it impossible for a comet to enter this region. Tycho concluded there were no such spheres, raising the question of what kept a planet in orbit.Osler (2010), p. 53 With the patronage of the King of Denmark, Tycho Brahe established Uraniborg, an observatory in Hven.J J O'Connor and E F Robertson. Tycho Brahe biography. April 2003. Retrieved 2008-09-28 For 20 years, Tycho and his team of astronomers compiled astronomical observations that were vastly more accurate than those made before. These observations would prove vital in future astronomical breakthroughs. =Johannes Kepler= Kepler's Platonic solid model of the Solar System from Mysterium Cosmographicum Kepler found employment as an assistant to Tycho Brahe and, upon Brahe's unexpected death, replaced him as imperial mathematician of Emperor Rudolph II. He was then able to use Brahe's extensive observations to make remarkable breakthroughs in astronomy, such as the three laws of planetary motion. Kepler would not have been able to produce his laws without the observations of Tycho, because they allowed Kepler to prove that planets traveled in ellipses, and that the Sun does not sit directly in the center of an orbit but at a focus. Galileo Galilei came after Kepler and developed his own telescope with enough magnification to allow him to study Venus and discover that it has phases like a moon. The discovery of the phases of Venus was one of the more influential reasons for the transition from geocentrism to heliocentrism.Thoren (1989), p. 8 Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica concluded the Copernican Revolution. The development of his laws of planetary motion and universal gravitation explained the presumed motion related to the heavens by asserting a gravitational force of attraction between two objects. In 1596, Kepler published his first book, the Mysterium Cosmographicum, which was the second (after Thomas Digges, in 1576) to endorse Copernican cosmology by an astronomer since 1540. The book described his model that used Pythagorean mathematics and the five Platonic solids to explain the number of planets, their proportions, and their order. The book garnered enough respect from Tycho Brahe to invite Kepler to Prague and serve as his assistant. In 1600, Kepler set to work on the orbit of Mars, the second most eccentric of the six planets known at that time. This work was the basis of his next book, the Astronomia nova, which he published in 1609. The book argued heliocentrism and ellipses for planetary orbits instead of circles modified by epicycles. This book contains the first two of his eponymous three laws of planetary motion. In 1619, Kepler published his third and final law which showed the relationship between two planets instead of single planet movement. Kepler's work in astronomy was new in part. Unlike those who came before him, he discarded the assumption that planets moved in uniform circular motion, replacing it with elliptical motion. Also, like Copernicus, he asserted the physical reality of a heliocentric model as opposed to a geocentric one. Yet, despite all of his breakthroughs, Kepler could not explain the physics that would keep a planet in its elliptical orbit.  Kepler's laws of planetary motion  :1. The Law of Ellipses: All planets move in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus. :2. The Law of Equal Areas in Equal Time: A line that connects a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. :3. The Law of Harmony: The time required for a planet to orbit the Sun, called its period, is proportional to long axis of the ellipse raised to the 3/2 power. The constant of proportionality is the same for all the planets. =Galileo Galilei= The phases of Venus, observed by Galileo in 1610 Galileo Galilei was an Italian scientist who is sometimes referred to as the \\"father of modern observational astronomy\\".Singer (1941), p. 217 His improvements to the telescope, astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism were all integral to the Copernican Revolution. Based on the designs of Hans Lippershey, Galileo designed his own telescope which, in the following year, he had improved to 30x magnification.Drake (1990), pp. 133-134 Using this new instrument, Galileo made a number of astronomical observations which he published in the Sidereus Nuncius in 1610. In this book, he described the surface of the Moon as rough, uneven, and imperfect. He also noted that \\"the boundary dividing the bright from the dark part does not form a uniformly oval line, as would happen in a perfectly spherical solid, but is marked by an uneven, rough, and very sinuous line, as the figure shows.\\"Galileo, Helden (1989), p. 40 These observations challenged Aristotle's claim that the Moon was a perfect sphere and the larger idea that the heavens were perfect and unchanging. Galileo's next astronomical discovery would prove to be a surprising one. While observing Jupiter over the course of several days, he noticed four stars close to Jupiter whose positions were changing in a way that would be impossible if they were fixed stars. After much observation, he concluded these four stars were orbiting the planet Jupiter and were in fact moons, not stars.Drake (1978), p. 152 This was a radical discovery because, according to Aristotelian cosmology, all heavenly bodies revolve around the Earth and a planet with moons obviously contradicted that popular belief.Drake (1978), p. 157 While contradicting Aristotelian belief, it supported Copernican cosmology which stated that Earth is a planet like all others.Osler (2010), p. 63 In 1610, Galileo observed that Venus had a full set of phases, similar to the phases of the moon we can observe from Earth. This was explainable by the Copernican or Tychonic systems which said that all phases of Venus would be visible due to the nature of its orbit around the Sun, unlike the Ptolemaic system which stated only some of Venus's phases would be visible. Due to Galileo's observations of Venus, Ptolemy's system became highly suspect and the majority of leading astronomers subsequently converted to various heliocentric models, making his discovery one of the most influential in the transition from geocentrism to heliocentrism. = Sphere of the fixed stars = In the sixteenth century, a number of writers inspired by Copernicus, such as Thomas Digges, Giordano Bruno and William Gilbert argued for an indefinitely extended or even infinite universe, with other stars as distant suns. This contrasts with the Aristotelian view of a sphere of the fixed stars. Although opposed by Copernicus and Kepler (with Galileo not expressing a view), by the middle of the 17th century this became widely accepted, partly due to the support of Ren√© Descartes. =Isaac Newton= right Newton was a well known English physicist and mathematician who was known for his book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.See the Principia on line at Andrew Motte Translation He was a main figure in the Scientific Revolution for his laws of motion and universal gravitation. The laws of Newton are said to be the ending point of the Copernican Revolution. Newton used Kepler's laws of planetary motion to derive his law of universal gravitation. Newton's law of universal gravitation was the first law he developed and proposed in his book Principia. The law states that any two objects exert a gravitational force of attraction on each other. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the gravitational masses of the objects, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Along with Newton's law of universal gravitation, the Principia also presents his three laws of motion. These three laws explain inertia, acceleration, action and reaction when a net force is applied to an object. =Immanuel Kant= Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason (1787 edition) drew a parallel between the \\"Copernican revolution\\" and the epistemology of his new transcendental philosophy.Ermanno Bencivenga (1987), Kant's Copernican Revolution. Kant's comparison is made in the Preface to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (published in 1787; a heavy revision of the first edition of 1781). Kant argues that, just as Copernicus moved from the supposition of heavenly bodies revolving around a stationary spectator to a moving spectator, so metaphysics, \\"proceeding precisely on the lines of Copernicus' primary hypothesis\\", should move from assuming that \\"knowledge must conform to objects\\" to the supposition that \\"objects must conform to our [a priori] knowledge\\". Much has been said on what Kant meant by referring to his philosophy as \\"proceeding precisely on the lines of Copernicus' primary hypothesis\\". There has been a long-standing discussion on the appropriateness of Kant's analogy because, as most commentators see it, Kant inverted Copernicus' primary move.For an overview see Engel, M., Kant‚Äôs Copernican Analogy: A Re-examination, Kant-Studien, 54, 1963, p. 243. According to Victor Cousin: \\"Copernicus, seeing it was impossible to explain the motion of the heavenly bodies on the supposition that these bodies moved around the earth considered as an immovable centre, adopted the alternative, of supposing all to move round the sun. So Kant, instead of supposing man to move around objects, supposed on the contrary, that he himself was the centre, and that all moved round him.\\" Cousin, Victor, The Philosophy of Kant. London: John Chapman, 1854, p. 21 According to Tom Rockmore,Tom Rockmore, Marx After Marxism: The Philosophy of Karl Marx (2002), p. 184. Kant himself never used the \\"Copernican revolution\\" phrase about himself, though it was \\"routinely\\" applied to his work by others.  Arabic astronomy  In the Arabic-Islamic world, primarily the 10th and 11th centuries, was considered a resourceful era in Islamic science. Thus leading Copernicus a better understanding of the Ptolemaic model. Muslim scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, al-Shatir, al-Tusi, al-Urdi contributed to the development of astronomy. Ibn al-Haytham put forward a planetary motion idea questioning and doubted Ptolemy's model. By the 11th and 12th century, Al-Haytham work reached Spain and Asia. Ibn al- Shatir created similar models to Copernicus away from the Ptolemaic model. Which evidently led to a new research for Islam. Arabic mathematicians unable to make Ptolemaic astronomy connect to Aristotelian cosmology modified the Ptolemaic system, and heavily criticized its tradition. Medieval European astronomers inherited Arabic attempts at mathematical realism in the Ptolemaic system that created a new line of scientific motivation, which influenced the direction of Copernicus‚Äôs work.Bala (2006), p. 148. Without a doubt, the contributions that the Arabic-Islamic civilization made to help the development of modern science before the 13th century are significant by \\"its contributions to the fund of knowledge, logical, mathematical, and [the] methodological.\\" However, the lack of societal \\"freedom of thought and expression\\" inhibited Arabic-Islamic science from advancing any further, and eventually led to its decline in the 15th century. Metaphorical usage Following Kant, the phrase \\"Copernican Revolution\\" in the 20th century came to be been used for any (supposed) paradigm shift, for example in reference to Freudian psychoanalysis\\"By defining hysteria as an illness whose symptoms were produced by a person's unconscious ideas, Freud started what can be called a ‚ÄòCopernican Revolution‚Äô in the understanding of mental illness -- which put him into opposition both to the Parisian Charcot and to the German and Austrian scientific community.\\" Jos√© Brunner, Freud and the Politics of Psychoanalysis (2001), p. 32. or postmodern critical theory.\\"Jacques Lacan's formulation that the unconscious, as it reveals itself in analytic phenomena, ‚Äòis structured like a language‚Äô, can be seen as a Copernican revolution (of sorts), bringing together Freud and the insights of linguistic philosophers and theorists such as Roman Jakobson.\\" Ben Highmore, Michel de Certeau: Analysing Culture (2006), p. 64.

Its two components are designated Lambda Virginis A (formally named Khambalia ) and B.  Nomenclature  Œª Virginis (Latinised to Lambda Virginis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Lambda Virginis A and B derives from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

(Coptic has no sound, and so often substitutes k for g in Greek words, though not usually kh.) In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Khambalia for the component Lambda Virginis A on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In China, (), meaning Neck, refers to an asterism consisting of this system, Kappa Virginis, Iota Virginis and Phi Virginis. Consequently, Lambda Virginis itself is known as (, .)  Properties  Lambda Virginis is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 206.7 days and an eccentricity of 0.0610. The semi- major axis has an angular size of 0.02 arcseconds, which, at the distance of this system, is equivalent to a physical span of AU. The orbit is inclined by an angle of 110¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. Tidal theory predicts that eventually the orbit of the stars will circularize and their rotation rates will become synchronized with their orbital motion. However, this will occur over a time scale of more than 1.2 billion years, whereas their estimated age is 935 million years. The combined spectra of the two components has a stellar classification of A1V, which matches an A-type main-sequence star. They have magnitudes of +5.0 and +5.6.

He was described by Horace Walpole, in his Memories, as \\"‚Ä¶Blackbourn, the jolly old Archbishop of York, who had all the manners of a man of quality, though he had been a buccaneer, and was a clergyman; but he retained nothing of his first profession, except his seraglio.\\" Early life and career as a pirate He was born in London, a younger brother of Richard Blackburne.Lancelot Blackburne was also likely the brother of Robert Blackborne, Secretary of the Admiralty and later of the British East India Company. He attended Westminster School, and in 1676 entered Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated in 1680, was ordained a deacon on 25 September 1681 at Christ Church by John Fell, Bishop of Oxford, and travelled to the West Indies. In January 1684 he was granted an MA by the university; at this time, he is known to have been in Nevis. A popular story recounts that he spent these years sailing with buccaneers, either as their chaplain or as a pirate himself; there is little evidence either way, although a record of 1681 notes that he was paid ¬£20 () by Charles II for \\"secret services\\". Archbishop of York He returned to England during 1684, marrying Catherine Talbot (the elder sister of William Talbot) on 2 September at the Savoy Chapel, and shortly thereafter took up the first of a set of church posts. In 1691 he became a Canon of Exeter, and in 1705 Dean of Exeter, succeeding William Wake whose patronage would later stand him in good stead, and in 1715 Archdeacon of Cornwall. In 1716 he travelled to Hanover as the personal chaplain to George I and the next year became Bishop of Exeter. As Bishop, he was active in the House of Lords where he supported the repeal of the Occasional Conformity Act. In 1724 he became Archbishop of York (and therefore a Privy Counsellor), a position he held until his death. While he continued to be politically active, he often neglected his spiritual duties; he appears to have carried out few confirmations, and stopped ordaining priests after 10 years. Instead, he kept apartments in Downing Street, London and spent much time at the royal court. Downing Street is listed as his abode on the 1739 royal charter of the Foundling Hospital, a charity for which he was a founding governor. Blackburne was Lord High Almoner from 1723 to 1743. His career was controversial, with rumours that he had secretly married George I to his mistress. The Dictionary of National Biography mentions \\"his reputation for carnality\\" and \\"the laxity of his moral precepts\\", while Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics comments that \\"[his] behaviour was seldom of a standard to be expected of an archbishop. In many respects his behaviour was seldom of a standard to be expected of a pirate.\\" He was famously ejected by John Disney, the vicar of St. Mary's Church, Nottingham, after a confirmation service during which he asked for his pipe, tobacco and ale.\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p143: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 One local legend in York even claimed that Dick Turpin was his butler. Blackburne died at his home in Downing Street, Westminster on 23 March 1743 after a \\"lingering illness\\". His wife Catherine had died on 9June 1726 at the age of 80 and they left no children. It has often been claimed that he fathered Thomas Hayter; there is no conclusive evidence either way: he did not himself identify Hayter as his son, but he did leave a sizeable portion of his estate to Hayter.

It is the penultimate album completed by the singer and last released in her lifetime (her final album, Last Recording, being recorded in March 1959 and released just after her death). The original album was produced by Irving Townsend, and engineered by Fred Plaut. Background For the majority of the 1950s, Billie Holiday was signed to jazz producer Norman Granz's Clef Records, which was later absorbed into the newly founded Verve Records by 1956. All of her work for Norman Granz consisted of small jazz combos, reuniting her with musicians she recorded with back in the 1930s when she made her first recordings with Teddy Wilson. There were talks in the early 1950s of Holiday making albums, or songbooks, dedicated to composers such as George and Ira Gershwin and Jerome Kern, but they fell through and ended up going to Ella Fitzgerald when she signed to Verve. By 1957, Holiday had recorded twelve albums for Granz and was unhappy. Therefore, she decided not to renew her contract. By October 1957, Holiday contacted Columbia producer Irving Townsend and expressed interest in recording with bandleader Ray Ellis after listening to his album Ellis in Wonderland. Originally, she wanted to do an album with bandleader Nelson Riddle after hearing his arrangements for Frank Sinatra's albums, particularly In the Wee Small Hours, but after hearing Ellis's version of \\"For All We Know\\", she wanted to record with him. When Holiday came to Townsend about the album, he was surprised: Townsend got in touch with Ellis about the album. Ellis, having heard of Holiday's work throughout the 1930s and 1940s, was excited for the project, saying: \\"I couldn't believe it...I didn't know she was aware of me.\\"Blackburn (2005), With Billie, p. 268. Townsend arranged a meeting for both Holiday and Ellis to sign a contract with Columbia. Columbia provided an unlimited budget for the album. The musicians in the orchestra were paid $60 for the three sessions and Holiday was paid $150 per side in advance. Townsend went on to set up the recording dates for late February 1958. Content When Holiday signed her contract for Columbia, the label looked at it as a new beginning, for this was her return to the label after sixteen years. During Holiday's time with Norman Granz's label, she revisited old material she had previously recorded and songs that were well known in her repertoire, such as \\"My Man\\", \\"Lover, Come Back to Me\\", \\"I Cover the Waterfront\\", \\"Them There Eyes\\", \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" and others. Columbia wanted Holiday to do an album of songs she had never recorded before,Townsend, Irving. Lady in Satin, Columbia: 1958, original liner notes. so the song material for Lady in Satin derived from the usual sources for Holiday in her three-decade career, that of the Great American Songbook of classic pop. Also, unlike the bulk of Holiday's recordings with Norman Granz and her early years at Columbia in the 1930s and early 1940s, rather than in the setting of a jazz combo Holiday returns to the backdrop of full orchestral arrangements as done during her Decca years eight years earlier. She wanted the album to be in the same contemporary vein of Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald on her Songbooks series. Ray Ellis made his arrangements of the songs to match Holiday's voice. By the mid- to late 1950s, Holiday's voice changed drastically due to years of alcohol and drug abuse, altering its texture and gave it a fragile, raspy sound. Despite her voice's setback, she never lost the edge that had always made it so distinctive and was able to still use her style of phrasing that made her a popular jazz singer. Ray Ellis said of Holiday's voice: Ellis used a forty-piece orchestra, complete with horns, strings, reeds and even a three-piece choir. It would turn out to be Holiday's most expensive music production. Soloists on the album included Mel Davis, Urbie Green, and bebop trombone pioneer J. J. Johnson. Reception Reaction to the album has been mixed. Holiday's voice had lost much of its upper range in her 40s, although she still retained her rhythmic phrasing. The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a three-star rating out of a possible four stars, but expressed a basic reservation about the album, describing it as \\"a voyeuristic look at a beaten woman.\\" The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide said \\"Lady in Satin presents the Lady overdressed. It's an album from the late Fifties, when much of Billie's punch was gone.\\" However, trumpeter Buck Clayton preferred the work of the later Holiday to that of the younger woman that he had often worked with in the 1930s.Schaap, Phil. Lady in Satin, Columbia Legacy: 1997, reissue liner notes, p. 15 Ray Ellis said of the album in 1997: > I would say that the most emotional moment was her listening to the playback > of \\"I'm a Fool to Want You\\". There were tears in her eyes...After we > finished the album I went into the control room and listened to all the > takes. I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was just > listening musically instead of emotionally.

Lady in Satin was reissued by Legacy Records on September 23, 1997, remastering using 20-bit technology with four bonus tracks. Reissue producer Phil Schaap located the unused master tape for the stereo version of \\"The End of a Love Affair,\\" and included a stereo mix of the \\"I'm a Fool to Want You\\" take which had been used on the mono LP.

Name Several mountains around Japan are called \\"Funagata\\" due to their resemblance to the hull of a boat when viewed from certain angles. The name of \\"Mount Gosh≈ç\\" comes from a local legend that exiled Emperor Juntoku escaped from his prison on Sado island and lived in obscurity at the base of this mountain.

It has a modern counterpart in the large settlement located at the junction of the A2 and A256 roads, some four miles (6.4 km) north of Dover. Overview The village itself (Church Whitfield) can claim ancient roots in that evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements have been unearthed. The village church, dedicated to St Peter, has two Saxon windows, and the bell is from the 13th century, or earlier. St Peter's Church is a 10th-century Saxon Church largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. It was restored and enlarged in 1894. There is also an early Congregational Chapel in the village (Chapel Rd) dating to 1781 but rebuilt in 1867. Whitfield also had its own windmill for many years, with a bakery beneath. It was built in about 1755 and was owned by generations of the Cadman family. In 1900 the mill was left to decay and was finally demolished in 1916 though the mill house still stands in Napchester Road. The modern Whitfield began to appear when the more affluent citizens of Dover built their homes in \\"West Whitfeld\\", alongside what was to become the A2 trunk road which bypassed the village.\\"The Kent Village Book\\" Alan Bignell 1999 Modern (post-Second World War) development enlarged the new village and in the 1960s Beauxfield was built then extended in the 1980s. The 1970s saw with the introduction of Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way. Again in 2005, the government proposed a maximum of 9,900 new homes to be built on greenfield sites around the village, doubling its size. The Whitfield Action Group was set up to oppose any large scale developments while accepting natural growth. It was confirmed, in February 2010, that this figure will now be 6,000 new homes built.Village Action Group Amenities The main village of Whitfield along the 'Sandwich Road' has a public house, 'The Archer'; the private members/function hall 'The Whitfield Club'Clubs of Whitfield Rolles Court Guest House and the Ramada Dover Hotel (formerly the Dover Motel). There is also a village hall with doctors surgery, vets, caf√©, take aways, hairdresser and the local Post Office. A branch of McDonald's and BP service station is located near the A2 roundabout at the top of 'Whitfield Hill'. The village's older pub, the Royal Oak, closed in February 2008ROYAL OAK (Whitfield) Pubs of Dover and a Marston's Brewery pub/restaurant, the 'Rock Rose', is now open at the junction of Menzies Road/Gordon Road.Pubs of Whitfield July 2015 saw the introduction of new KFC, Pets at Home and B & M stores on the ever-expanding Honeywood Retail Park, Honeywood Parkway. The village has two schools, both of which also cater for special educational needs: primary and secondary. Whitfield and Aspen School (primary);Whitfield and Aspen School and Dover Christ Church Academy, formerly Archers Court School.Dover Christ Church Academy In view of its site on the periphery of a town such as Dover, and because of its strategic position on the A2/A256 junction, Whitfield is of importance to businesses. The huge White Cliffs Business Park,White Cliffs Business Park covering 272 acres (110 ha) is located at Whitfield and is described as attracting \\"‚Ä¶ household names and a raft of companies with international pedigrees\\". Origins and Growth The village of Whitfield has grown so that it is now physically connected to urban Dover, Kent, yet it has kept its own identity and sense of place. The central core of modern Whitfield was, however, not the original heart of the village; the original settlement was sited at Church Whitfield to the east. Pineham, located to the east of Church Whitfield is a small rural hamlet that is often considered part of the Whitfield community. It contains a small handful of farms and houses. Church Whitfield seems to have originated around a small, enclosed farmstead; archaeological work in the area showed that there was a collection of structures on the site during the early medieval period and evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements. The Roman road from Dover (Dubris) to Richborough (Rutupiae) runs north-south near Pineham, suggesting that the village developed along its route. The village church, dedicated to St Peter, is testament to this history; the church is a 10th-century Saxon structure largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. The building has two Saxon windows, and the bell dates from the 13th century. The village was originally known as 'Bewsfield', which is said to refer to its high and open situation. It is thought that Whitfield began to be called 'Whytefeld' in the mid-seventeenth century. At some point in the later medieval period, a new village was formed to the west. This may have been due to the Black Death, whereby many villages moved their centre of habitation a mile or two for fear of being too near the burial site of victims. The 'new' village became known as West Whitfield, before changing to Lower Whitfield and simply as 'Whitfield' as the village gradually grew. Old Whitfield to the northeast then became known as Church Whitfield. The villages developed quite different characters but maintained a close attachment in terms of physical proximity. Early maps such as the Andrews and Drury map of 1769, shows the basic arrangement of the villages, as separate, but linked hamlets. Map research shows the small-scale, village origins of Whitfield, before twentieth-century expansion. The village was based around a roughly triangular road pattern, comprising Forge Lane/Lenacre Lane, Church Lane (now Napchester Road and Nursery Lane), and what is known today as The Drove. To the west, development was centred on Lenacre Court, although the original Lenacre Manor may originally have been located further south; a 'Lennickers' is shown on early nineteenth-century maps, on roughly the location of Bewsbury Cross Farm. This development led along forge lane to the north, around Whitfield House, and towards the Congregational Chapel, originally built in 1781. To the east, development was clustered around the Windmill with a bakery beneath, originally built in 1755. The example at Whitfield was a smock mill, consisting of an octagonal, weatherboarded tower, on a brick or masonry base. However, windmills suffered a rapid decline during the early twentieth century due to an influx of cheap imported grain and new government food regulations. Whitfield mill was demolished in 1916 after standing derelict for many years. This was originally a key focus to the village. The village was linked to Church Whitfield and Pineham via Shepherds Cross to the north, and through a series of lanes and footpaths across the fields. It is clear that Whitfield was originally very rural in character with a tight knit collection of lanes in the oldest section of the village to the north of Nursery Lane. Map research shows however, that Whitfield was bisected in the early nineteenth century by the main Sandwich Road. The Mudge map of 1801 shows that a small lane or footpath had been built linking Church Lane to the crossroads at the top of forge lane. However, by the production of the first small-scale ordnance survey maps in 1816, a main route running directly through the village from north to south had been constructed. This altered the village in a drastic manner, literally cutting the settlement in half ‚Äì the reasoning behind the chosen route is unclear. The Royal Oak public house dates from this time, built as a coaching stop along this main route to the improving harbour at Sandwich. The modern Whitfield developed when more affluent citizens of Dover began to build new homes, alongside the junction of the A2 and A256 roads near the village. Gradually, the historic built form has been subsumed into the modern housing with no clear distinction created between the older segments of the village, and the modern growth. This has diluted the architectural character of Whitfield. As a result, Whitfield is now largely suburban in character, with remnants of the older village scattered throughout. There are a few elements within Whitfield that give some indication of the original character of the village, within the network of small lanes. Most housing dates from the postwar period. Where historic buildings survive, they show a strong tradition of brick and flint. In contrast, Church Whitfield has retained a very rural character with a small cluster of houses and farms built around the church. The houses have however, been altered in form and are now mainly rendered and modernised. Postwar development enlarged the village and in the 1960s new estates such as Beauxfield were built and extended in the 1980s. The Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way were built in the 1970s.

There's a lot of potential here for future books in the series, but to be really successful he will need to bring John and Philippa to life.\\" =The Akhenaten Adventure= John and Philippa Gaunt are twelve-year- old twins with a remarkably gifted mother, a very kind father, and two dogs that aren't who they seem to be. The family lives a life of luxury in New York. One day, their wisdom teeth appear simultaneously. During an operation to get the wisdom teeth removed, they both have the same dream in which their uncle, Nimrod, asks that they come to London. He tells them that they are djinn (genies). They begin the adventure of a lifetime, going from Cairo to London, using pink Ferraris, and riding camels. From New York, Egypt, and London, the twins' adventures are filled with excitement as they undergo training in the use of their newly discovered powers, but are also fraught with danger, as they battle the evil Ifrit tribe of djinn and its leader, Iblis. They must preserve the balance of good luck and bad luck in the world. =The Blue Djinn of Babylon= John and Philippa Gaunt, twelve-year-old twins who recently discovered themselves to be descended from a long line of djinn (commonly called genies) and who are now in possession of great powers, have only just returned from their adventures battling evil djinn in Cairo and London. Now the mystery surrounding a powerful book of djinn magic named Solomon's Grimoire lures the twins straight into their next extraordinary adventure. When the Solomon Grimoire is reported missing, John and Philippa are called upon to retrieve this book of power. They travel across the globe, from New York City to Istanbul, Berlin to Budapest but, little do they know, a trap has been set and the djinn twins are about to walk right into it. Soon, John must embark on an epic journey to save his sister from the fate of eternal hard-heartedness from Ayesha, before it's too late. =The Cobra King of Kathmandu= Fiery magic in a land of ice, midnight intruders, and murder by snakebite sweep John and Philippa Gaunt into their third fantastic adventure. After their friend Dybbuk Sachertorte sends an email pleading for help, the twins go save him; they cannot refuse. Dybbuk gives a mysterious painting leading them to Nepal to save their friends. In snowy Kathmandu, the children, along with Mr. Groanin, face the ultimate test of their amazing djinn powers. Can they uncover the venomous secrets of an evil Snake Cult to find the long-lost talisman of the Cobra King? Meanwhile, at home, their mother prepares to follow her destiny, which she has still kept secret. =The Day of the Djinn Warriors= The Day of the Djinn Warriors is the fourth novel and deals with more of the Sachertorte family's past, as well as the encounter with the newly changed Layla Gaunt. Dealing with thefts, hauntings and a red- hot mystery, it is a race against time for John and Philippa Gaunt to outwit the wicked Iblis. But can the djinn twins stop Iblis now he has awoken the ancient warriors of a long-dead emperor from their sleep? John and Philippa attempt to rescue their mother from her fate as the Blue Djinn of Babylon (a djinn that is beyond good and evil, who has powers over all.) They discover that an aging curse has been placed on their father and if the twins are gone too long, he will rapidly become an old man. As the twins and their friends travel around the globe on their rescue mission, they notice that something very strange is happening: An evil force has awakened the terracotta warriors created by an ancient Chinese emperor, and someone with very bad intentions has cast a spell possessing the soldiers with wicked spirits. And now, the very fate of the world hangs in the balance. Meanwhile, museums all over the world are reporting robberies of valuable jade artifacts from their collections, as well as bizarre hauntings. =The Eye of the Forest= John and Philippa Gaunt find themselves tangled up in a spellbinding mystery that takes them deep into the heart of the Amazon jungle in book five of the NY TIMES bestselling Children of the Lamp series. When a collection of Incan artifacts goes missing, the Blue Djinn of Babylon dispatches the twins and Uncle Nimrod to recover them. Along the way, though, John and Philippa encounter their friend Dybbuk, who was drained of his djinn powers but is determined to get them back. In a fury, he's headed to an ancient Incan Empire where he believes he can regain his power. Dybbuk will stop at nothing . . . even if it means opening a cursed portal, disturbing the enchanted kingdom of the Incas that has slept for thousands of years, and (unintentionally) destroying the world. Dybbuk's kindness was crushed, and his evilness took over his body. Philippa tried to save him but failed. =The Five Fakirs of Faizabad= John and Phillipa Gaunt are in search of an ancient fakir, who is a holder of one of the world's greatest secrets given by tirthankara. A fakir comes out only when the world is in a high amount of bad luck or misfortune. Eventually John and Phillipa find him, Mr. Saraswati, he is called. The twins also find out that Mr. Rakshasas is alive from Mr. Burton, Rakshasas's old butler. In the twins' attempt to find Rakshasas at Yellowstone national park, Groanin finds himself following John and Phillipa but getting attacked by a bear at Yellowstone. Rakshasas, a wolf now, tells them that they must go to shangri-la or actually called Shamba-La. Nimrod finds out that he must go to Shamba-La as well. Through the hardships of getting to Shamba-La, the twins and Rakshasas get captured by Nazis, and Nimrod gets hit by a bird and gets amnesia. They all eventually get to Shamba-La, to find that the ruler there is actually Rakshasas himself, after he had left 70 years ago. Finally, Groanin is saved and Nimrod turned back to normal, and they are teleported back in time where they don't recall anything about Shamba-la and it seems as if it is the beginning of the book again but they all feel a sense of De-Ja-Vu. =The Grave Robbers of Genghis Khan= The seventh book in the series was officially released on November 1, 2011 (but was already being sold by booksellers before this date). Djinn twins John and Philippa are off on another enchanting, and dangerous, adventure in the last book in the bestselling Children of the Lamp series. As volcanoes begin erupting all over the world, spilling golden lava, the twins must go on a hunt for the wicked djinn who wants to rob the grave of the great Genghis Khan. Can the twins stop this latest disaster before the world is overwhelmed? Join John and Philippa, their parents, Uncle Nimrod, and Groanin as they must defeat an evil more powerful than any they've ever faced before. Use of djinn power in the series The djinn - whether they like it or not - are the guardians of luck, so they derive their power from \\"luck\\" or \\"fate\\". Much of the narrative thus comes from those who promote good luck, who are attempting to combat those who promote bad luck. The djinn power that all djinn possess is directly linked to their own lifelines, fueled by fire. Every wish that is granted costs the djinn a portion of their lifeforce and shortens their lifespan. The energy that is lost cannot be regained and the older a djinn is, the more force is drained from them. Because of their connection with fire, djinn are immune to it and can not be burnt or killed by it. The exact limits of djinn power vary with age and experience, but what all djinn have in common is that when they use their power they must picture and think about what exactly they will use their power for, be it making an object appear and disappear or granting a wish. Djinn power has limits, as djinn cannot bring back anything from the dead. Djinn power cannot affect the flow of time, cannot create copies of themselves, generally cannot undo the spells of another djinn, and cannot create gems. When a mundane (non-djinn) releases a djinn the Djinn will grant the mundane three wishes. Djinn can live up to 500 years unless they enter a bottle, then they may be able to live a bit longer. Djinn do not actually start aging until their wisdom teeth are taken out. Time is different inside the bottle, to a djinn an hour in a bottle is similar to ten hours outside the bottle, unless they've entered the bottle incorrectly, in which case the oppose effect happens. Djinn have the ability to turn into smoke when they enter or exit a container, called transubstantiation. Space in a bottle to a djinn is very much like a room in a house for which they still retain djinn power and are able to make their stay comfortable for themselves. Djinn power allows djinn to have an astral body, that allows them to enter other people's dreams and gives them access to possess people. Djinn have the power of shape-shifting and can change into any animal or object they choose, for a limited time, except for their tribe's special animal. While in animal or object form, the djinn still retain their thoughts and 5 senses granting them a form of telepathy to communicate to other djinn while in an animal or object guise. The downside to shape-shifting into an animal is that the djinn retain some animal-like qualities when they change back into their mundane forms. Djinn have the ability to travel by whirlwind by means of forming a funnel of air for which they must sit on or risk of losing balance and falling off. CharactersPhilippa Gaunt= Philippa Gaunt is the twin of John Gaunt. Philippa is shorter with red hair and glasses, like her father. She prefers to be called Phil, rather than Philippa. Like her brother John, she is claustrophobic and dislikes loud noises. Philippa is described as the more intellectual one; this was seen with her quick skill of telling lies to Miss Pickings, allowing herself to successfully remove Gordon Warthoff's pimples, and is an expert Djinnverso player. In \\"The Blue Djinn of Babylon\\", she is kidnapped by her maternal grandmother Ayesha, the Blue Djinn of Babylon. It is revealed Philippa was used as a key to get Layla Gaunt to usurp the role as Blue Djinn. Her focus word is FABULONGOSHOOMARVELISHLYWONDERPIPICAL, and changes it later in \\"The Five Fakirs of Faizabad\\" to \\"DIDDLEEYEJOEFROMMEJICOFELLOFFHISHORSEATARODEOHANDSUPSTICKEMUPDROPTHENGUNSANDPICKEMUPDIDDLEEYEJOEFROMMEJICO\\", the longest one in the series. She has no idea that Dybbuk likes her, but she is shown to have a sense of affection for him as she tries to rescue him in the \\"Eye of the Forest.\\" She is shown to have a crush on Axel in The Grave Robbers of Genghis Khan. = John Gaunt = John Gaunt is the twin of Philippa Gaunt. John is described as tall and dark, and previously pimply. John, like most djinn, is claustrophobic but as seen in \\"The Akhenaten Adventure\\", John panics more than Philippa does. He has a strong dislike to vegetables, as revealed in \\"The Blue Djinn of Babylon\\". He is quite athletic, and acquired more strength in the second book in order to fight off a bully physically. During the second book, John faces numerous obstacles, including having to kill a very real looking projection of his own father, in his efforts to save Philippa. His focus word is ABECEDARIAN. When he meets Faustina in book four he immediately falls for her. =Dybbuk Sachertorte= Dybbuk Sachertorte is a Djinn friend of John and Philippa who prefers to go by the name of Buck. His mother is the djinn Doctor Sachertorte, who helps John and Philippa recover from their illness in The Blue Djinn of Babylon. He goes with them on their adventures in The Cobra King of Kathmandu. His favorite things are treasure hunts and old war movies. He, his mother, and his pet coyote Colin live in Palm Springs, California. He also has a crush on Philippa. In the third book, it is revealed that he is the youngest son of Iblis Teer, leader of the Ifrit tribe and most evil of all Djinn. Dybbuk acts as a magician under the name of Jonathon Tarot in the fourth book, but uses up his powers in a complicated stunt and becomes mundane, which for a Djinn, is very unfortunate. He regains his powers in the 5th book after splitting into two- a good Buck and an evil Dybbuk and the evil kills his good \\"twin\\". His focus word is ZYGOBRANCHIATE. =Uncle Nimrod= Nimrod Plantagenet Godwin is the powerful Djinn uncle of John and Philippa and de facto leader of the Marid. Nimrod is depicted as a loud djinn who enjoys the color red, and a near expert at all things relating to djinn. Apparently, he has a strong dislike to jade, as well as rubies. He is always seen with a cigar, and has a strong talent in allowing the smoke of his cigar to create shapes and/or allowing those shapes to then become real. Nimrod's companion is Mr. Rakshasas, who he always keeps in his pocket. He first appeared in a dream of John's and Philippa's simultaneously, when their wisdom teeth or \\"dragon teeth\\" were extracted. His focus word is QWERTYUIOP (the top ten letter keys on a keyboard). =Mr. Harry Groanin= Mr. Harry Groanin is Nimrod's one-armed butler. Groanin freed Nimrod from confinement and won three wishes. After wasting his first two wishes he became Nimrod's butler so he could properly consider how to use his third wish, and to make sure Nimrod does not trick him. He uses his third wish to help locate a trapped Nimrod and feels quite liberated afterwards. Groanin's other arm was recreated by John, Philippa, and Dybbuk in book 3. This arm is strong enough to fight an angel in book 4 and win. Groanin also got beaten, and seriously wounded, by a bear. He would have died, if this all turned out to have \\"never happened\\". What happened was a wrinkle in time. =Mr. Rakshasas= Mr.Rakshasas is Nimrod's djinn friend. Mr. Rakshasas has an Irish accent which he got from watching Irish shows (he did this in order to learn English). Mr. Rakshasas feels more at home in his lamp than outside of it, following a long period of forced confinement in a milk bottle thanks to a djinn from the Ghul tribe. He is afraid of large and open spaces. He is considered a leading djinn expert on the Baghdad Rules, a series of conventions regulating wishes and wish granting and even wrote a book on the subject called The Shorter Baghdad Rules. In the fourth book of the series, he was absorbed by one of the Terracotta warriors. His focus word is SESQUIPEDALIAN (which means to have many syllables). In the sixth book, however, he is revealed to be reincarnated as a wolf. Strangely enough, in Hindi, the word Rakshasas generally means \\"monster\\" or \\"greedy\\" or even \\"demon\\". However, he mostly resembles one of the rare \\"good Rakshasa\\", Vibhishana =Layla Gaunt= Layla Gaunt is an extremely tall and glamorous lady who is the eccentric mother of John and Philippa, and sister to Nimrod. She first appears as a very nice and allowing mother, telling John that naming one of the dogs \\"Elvis\\" would be a nice change. From then and through the series, she was depicted as an extremely tall djinn who had the media clamouring up for her. She had an apparent blatant relationship with her brother Nimrod in their later lives, but had grown up loving him earlier. She then cut herself off from the djinn world, including dropping the use of her powers right after turning her husband's murderous brothers into the pet dogs. She finally began using her powers again to turn an assassin, hired to kill John and Phillipa, into a cat, who they took in as a pet and named Monty. She had renounced the use of her djinn powers after she attempted to save her daughter Philippa from her mother Ayesha. Ayesha wished her to become the new Blue Djinn of Babylon, a position Layla did not desire; resulting in the kidnapping of Philippa in order to force Layla to take the position. In \\"The Cobra King of Kathmandu\\", Layla Gaunt leaves her family forever in order to become the next Blue Djinn. In \\"The Day of the Djinn Warriors\\" she is replaced by Faustina, Dybbuk's sister, as the Blue Djinn and comes back home. On her way home from Iraq, her body is incinerated by a pyroclastic flow from the Hawaiian volcano Kilauea and she is forced to find another body to possess. Her spirit occupies the body of Mrs. Trump, the Gaunts' maid, before seeing a djinn plastic surgeon in Brazil to make Mrs. Trump look like Layla's former self. During the events of \\"The Eye of the Forest\\" she gets absorbed by an exorbere (a half-man-half-spider creature), but her husband saves her from ending up like Mr. Rakshasas. Her focus word is NEPHELOKOKKYGIA (from Cloud cuckoo land). =Edward Gaunt= The father of the twins Philippa and John Gaunt. He is fearful of the twins' powers after their mother turned his two brothers into dogs. Described as absentminded, but a brilliant and a good father, he is quite fond of antiques and is a successful banker. During the end of the third book he becomes a victim of the Methuselah Binding (which causes him to age several years), cast by Layla Gaunt to prevent John and Philipa from attempting to stop her from being the next Blue Djinn after Ayesha. He is short and has glasses. The Minor charactersFaustina Sachertorte= Sister of Dybbuk and the current Blue Djinn. She took over the prime minister's body to get back at Iblis when she realized he had taken over her father's body. After blood was removed from the prime minister during her possession, she was unable to regain control of her own body and was forced to move to her aunt's castle on Bannerman's Island, while her body, presumed dead, was placed in an Italian crypt, where it became famous for staying in a sleep-like, perfectly preserved state. John and Philippa save her and she repays them by rescuing their mother from becoming the Blue Djinn by taking her place. She is also quite fond of John. =Ayesha Godwin= Former Blue Djinn, Layla Gaunt's and Uncle Nimrod's mother, and John and Philippa's grandmother. She is about two hundred years old, but looks like she is in her late eighties. As the Blue Djinn, Ayesha serves as the arbitrator of djinn disputes and is considered \\"beyond\\" good and evil. Her state of mind is not achieved naturally; she uses the tree of logic (the \\"third tree of Eden\\") to become a hard-hearted being. =Iblis Teer= Former leader of the Ifrit. He was punished by Ayesha for killing Hussein Hussaout in the first book. Ayesha sentenced him to be exiled to Venus for ten years, but the container he was trapped in never made it to the shuttle because it was stolen, in the Cobra King of Kathmandu his body is torn apart by Djinn tigers and he possessed a magician as his new body, he is now trapped in an impenetrable suit of Jade and Gold. He has a son named Rudyard who extremely dislikes the twins. He is also Dybbuk's father. He is nemeses with Nimrod Plantagenet Godwin. His focus word is TETRAGRAMMATONITIS. =Alan and Neil= Brothers of Mr. Gaunt. Jealous of how successful he was, the pair attempted to murder him. They were stopped by Mrs. Gaunt and she transformed them into the family's beloved Rottweilers. In the first book, John tried to change their names into Winston and Elvis (much to the horror of his father). After they sacrificed their own lives to save John, in his quest to rescue Philippa, they returned to human form, since Layla Gaunt had made it so that their punishment would only last for as long as the animals lived (technically their \\"animal forms\\"). =Rudyard Teer= The djinn son of Iblis and half-brother to Dybbuk Sachertorte. He suffers the same fate as his father, trapped in a suit of jade and gold.

Based upon parallax measurements, it is approximately from Earth. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.65, which is bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye under suitable viewing conditions. This star has a stellar classification of K2 III, with the luminosity class \\"III\\" indicating that this is a giant star that has consumed the hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence. It has a mass about double that of the Sun and has expanded to 23 times the Sun's radius, giving it a luminosity of 182 times the luminosity of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 4,395 K, which gives the star the orange hue typical of K-type stars. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is slightly higher than in the Sun. This star has three optical companions. At an angular separation of 173.1 arcseconds is a magnitude +9.1 star, which is of spectral type K0. A 10th magnitude star is located 221.2 arcseconds away, and the third is a magnitude +9.1 K2 star 321.2 arcseconds away. None of these have been confirmed as a physical companion. In July 2009, it was discovered that Chi Virginis has a massive planet with a high orbital eccentricity of 0.46. It is orbiting with a period of about 835 days and has a mass at least 11 times greater than Jupiter.

The Pushcart War is a popular children's novel by the American writer Jean Merrill, illustrated by Ronni Solbert and published by W. R. Scott in 1964. It is Merrill's best known work. The story is written in the style of a historical report from the future, looking back at the earlier events of a \\"war\\" on the streets of New York City between trucking companies and pushcart owners who use pea shooters as weapons to disrupt the trucks. Merrill said the idea for the novel brewed in her for several years while she lived in Greenwich Village. She said the truck traffic there was oppressive and she fantasized about flattening the tires out with pea shooters. She had an epiphany and thought that \\"What you feel about the trucks is what everybody feels about bullies,\\" and from there she began writing the novel. Merrill won a Fulbright Fellowship in 1965 for it. It won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award (1964) and was a Horn Book Fanfare Best Book (1965). PlotThe Big Three= The opening sentence says, \\"The Pushcart War started on the afternoon of March 15, 1976 when a truck ran down a pushcart belonging to a flower peddler.\\" Later editions changed 1976 to 1986 then to 1998 so that the date would still be set in the future. Post-millennium editions of the book have been published with the date 2016. The newest is 2036 Traffic in New York City has become intolerable. Leaders of the three biggest trucking companies, known as The Three, hold a secret meeting where they plan to take over the streets for themselves by eliminating other traffic, starting with the pushcarts. The character Professor Cumberly says, \\"The truck drivers had gotten together and figured out that in crowded traffic conditions, the only way to get where you wanted was to be so big that you didn't have to get out of the way of anybody.\\" This is known as the Large Object Theory of History. =Pea-Shooter Campaign= Faced with truck-related \\"accidents\\", damaged carts, and injured fellows, the pushcart peddlers respond with the Pea-Shooter Campaign. Their aim is to flatten truck tires using pea shooters with pins in the peas so that everyone can see that the trucks are the cause of the traffic problems. One peddler, Frank the Flower, is arrested and falsely confesses that he shot all 18,991 of the truck tires. After his arrest, the peddlers give up the Pea- Shooter Campaign. But soon, inspired by Frank's arrest, children join in the sabotage of truck tires. The movie star Wenda Gambling also comes out in support of the peddlers. On the truck team are the owners Moe Mammoth of Mammoth Moving, Walter Sweet of Tiger Trucking, and Louie Livergreen of LEMA (Lower Eastside Moving Association) (The Three). Their biggest trucks are respectively the Mighty Mammoth, the Ten-Ton Tiger and the Leaping Lema. Their most prominent driver is Albert P. Mack. A driver for Tiger Trucking is Joey Kafflis and he gets fired for saying that traffic is lousy and that he is standing up for the pushcarts instead of the trucks. Prominent peddlers are Frank the Flower, Morris the Florist, General Anna, Harry the Hot Dog, Mr. Jerusalem, Carlos, Papa Peretz, Eddie Moroney and the pushcart repair shop owner Maxie Hammerman, also known as the Pushcart King. =Resolution= Initially, the outlook is bad for the peddlers because the trucking companies control the newspapers and the corrupt mayor, Emmett P. Cudd, but the citizens of New York City and the members of the press eventually move to the side of the street vendors after the peddlers' Peace March is interrupted by violence on the part of the truck drivers. New laws are enacted to limit the size of the trucks to the current smallest size or smaller and to limit the number of trucks to one half of the current number.

The krsnik turns into an animal at night to fight off the kudlak, his evil vampire antithesis, with the krsnik appearing as a white animal and the kudlak as a black one. The krsnik 's soul leaves the body, either voluntarily or due to a higher power, to fight evil agents and ensure good harvest, health, and happiness. The legend evolved from a pre-Christian myth present in Slovenia and Croatia (mainly Istria and the islands), where the celestial pagan god Perun is locked in eternal combat with the evil snake of the underworld, Veles. The krsnik is taught magic by Vile (fairies), and in traditional medicine has the ability to heal people and cattle. However, due to the undocumented nature of oral tradition, it's difficult to determine with certainty how much of kresnik folklore originated from Slavic mythology (Kresnik (deity)), and how much arose from a separate shamanistic tradition. After Christianization, the kresnik instead was claimed to have learned magic at the School of Black Magic in Babylon, but retained benevolent traits as a generous and powerful friend of the poor. The origin of the name may be from the word krst, which means \\"cross\\", and which in Serbia is the word for a stone sign denoting village boundaries. It may also be derived from the same root as the Slav word for \\"resurrection,\\" so that the word itself means something approximating \\"resurrector.\\" Similar beliefs circulated among the Italian Benandanti cult. Also see zduhaƒá.  In popular culture  * In the novel, anime, and manga series Trinity Blood, a \\"Crusnik\\" is a vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. Lilith Sahl, Cain, Seth, and Abel Nightroad are Crusnik who are much more powerful than regular vampires, who have the bacillus kudlak. They all take different forms: Cain appears as an angel with white wings, even though he is the antagonist, whereas Abel appears slightly demonic with black wings and red eyes, while being the protagonist. Kudlak also appears in the series as a bacillus that is responsible of the creation of \\"normal\\" vampires. * Kresnik and Kudlak are recurring characters in the Shin Megami Tensei series of video games. * Kresnik is the name of a mythological hero in Tales of Xillia. A superweapon bearing the name \\"Lance of Kresnik\\" is a plot device. The sequel features one of the hero's descendants, named Ludger Will Kresnik. A plot-significant machine named Kudlak is also present. * The main villain in Darkness Hunts by Keri Arthur is a male serial killer who believes he is a kresnik hunting down supposed kudlaks and murdering them. * Kudlak appears as a card in the online collectible card game Shadowverse. The mechanics of the card allow copies of Kudlak to be placed in the player‚Äôs deck after his defeat, which mirrors the theme of Kudlak‚Äôs recurring return.

The escarpment on which the lakes are located is at 2,250 feet (685.8 m), 1,700 feet (518 m) above the valley floor, providing a view of five states in clear weather. The area is rich in history. It was a favorite subject of painters in the Hudson River school, particularly Thomas Cole. For a long time, the prestigious resort hotels in the area made it synonymous with the Catskills. Today, the area provides hiking, swimming, boating (no motors), and fishing. HistoryEarly America= The North‚ÄìSouth Lake area is not only the beginning of the recreational history of the Catskills, but \\"America's First Wilderness.\\" This goes back to the years before the Revolution, to 1753, when early naturalist John Bartram visited the area with his son to collect samples of balsam fir, which was sought for its alleged medicinal properties. While the seedlings he gathered failed to flourish in Britain when replanted by his patrons, his account of the expedition, \\"A Journey to Ye Cat Skill Mountains with Billy,\\" became popular in the colonies and in Britain. =Hudson River School= North-South Lake In the early years of the 19th century, American artists seeking a subject matter unique to the new nation were drawn away from New York City and up the Hudson Valley. There they focused on the wildness of the landscape where mountains drew close to the river, first in the Hudson Highlands and then, further north, the Catskill Escarpment, where mountains rise to nearly 4,000 feet (1219 m) from a flat valley floor. Their work was known, at first derisively, as the Hudson River School and eventually became America's first homegrown artistic movement. On that escarpment they found the two lakes. Painters like Thomas Cole depicted them in many works that sold far and wide. =Resort hotels= View east over the Hudson River from Catskill Mountain House site. Taconic Mountains of New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts are in the background. Cole would be a frequent guest at, and lend his fame to, the Catskill Mountain House, built in 1823 by a group of businessmen from the nearby village of Catskill on the \\"Pine Orchard\\" overlook that the Bartrams had made famous in their visit 70 years earlier. In 1839, Charles Beach took over. He made it into a premiere attraction for the country's elite, a sort of Hamptons of its day where politicians (including some presidents), captains of industry, artists, poets and writers would rub shoulders, admire the view, take walks in the adjacent forests by day and excellent dinners by night. The hotel owners told guests that an Indian legend had it that the two lakes were the eyes of a fallen giant, and his buried body the escarpment itself (in reality, there is no such legend). Other hotels were built in the area. Beach's remark to a dissatisfied guest, a Philadelphia businessman, that he should build himself his own hotel led to the creation of the Hotel Kaaterskill near the top of neighboring South Mountain, and the smaller Laurel House Hotel on Laurel House Road in Haines Falls, N.Y. boasted control over one of the top attractions of the area, Kaaterskill Falls. The popularity of the resorts led to the construction of narrow-gauge rail spurs and an incline railway up the escarpment to more efficiently bring guests to their destinations. The rights-of-way remain in the area to this day although the tracks themselves are long gone. The area's reputation suffered a major blow in the early 1880s when Arnold Henry Guyot, an occasional visitor, undertook to do in his spare time the first complete survey of the Catskills and found that, contrary to the claims of Beach and other hoteliers in the area, the highest mountain was not nearby Kaaterskill High Peak, which dominates the view south over the lakes, but Slide Mountain, some distance to the southwest in the Ulster County town of Shandaken. They at first disputed this claim vigorously and even tried to cast aspersions on Guyot's reputation, but by 1886 his results had been confirmed by others and the North-South lake region had lost some of its cachet. In the early 20th century the hotels began to decline as other mountain regions in the Northeast and elsewhere began to attract guests and automobiles began to displace rail as the primary means of intercity transport, making vacations of a weekend's duration possible rather than the weeks and months guests had often stayed at the Mountain House. Fires leveled both the Kaaterskill and Laurel; neither was ever rebuilt. =Public ownership= In 1929 the state parks department, under the leadership of Robert Moses, took advantage of the downturn in the hotel business to acquire some of the land around the lakes and keep them \\"forever wild\\" under Article 14 of the New York State Constitution. At that time the two lakes were separated by an earthen dam, and South Lake and the land east of North Lake beach were privately owned. The original campground consisted of 10 sites (there are currently 219 sites) and a small picnic area. The beaches were added in 1936. Eventually, the state was able to acquire all the land save that around the original Mountain House, which finally closed for good after a failed attempt to revive and relaunch it in 1940. After the war that, too, would come into state ownership. While preservationists fought to save the remains of the Mountain House throughout the 1950s for their historical value, the policies under which Forest Preserve land was managed required the state to remove most structures on it, and they were becoming an attractive nuisance as well. Accordingly, the Mountain House was razed one winter morning in 1963. In the 1970s, the dam between the lakes was removed and a new dam built at the outlet of South Lake to create one large lake. Today North-South Lake The campground now plays host to 219 sites and thousands of visitors, both day and overnight, annually. It is the most popular state property in the Catskill Park. Visitors can choose from a wide array of recreation, either waterborne or land-based. The most common activity is the same as it was in the days of the Mountain House ... hiking via the many trails to nearby points of interest such as the ruins of the Kaaterskill and the Mountain House, Kaaterskill Falls, Mary's Glen and its smaller waterfall, and the many views of the Hudson Valley along the Escarpment Trail. The latter retain names from the 19th century such as \\"Artists' Rock.\\" Some have etchings dating back to those days as well. The hardiest visitors usually take in the trip up North Mountain to the views at North Point. Closer to the ground, there are also many clever balanced-rock displays made by hotel guests. One rarely missed is Alligator Rock, in which a pair of glacial erratics that formed an open mouth had \\"teeth\\" added over the years so it looks like an alligator's open mouth. DEC charges a $10 fee per car for day users of the campground between May and October. North‚ÄìSouth Lake was used in the music video by the band Simple Minds for their song Alive and Kicking. The song reached No.3 on the US Billboard.

Pressure washing or power washing is the use of high-pressure water spray to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, chewing gum and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles and concrete surfaces. The volume of a mechanical pressure washer is expressed in gallons or liters per minute, often designed into the pump and not variable. The pressure, expressed in pounds per square inch, pascals, or bar, is designed into the pump but can be varied by adjusting the unloader valve. Machines that produce pressures from 750 to 30,000 psi (5 to 200 MPa) or more are available. The terms pressure washing and power washing are used interchangeably in many scenarios, and there is some debate as to whether they are actually different processes. A pressure washing surface cleaner is a tool consisting of two to four high-pressure jets on a rotating bar that swivels when water is flowing. This action creates a uniformed cleaning pattern that can clean flat surfaces at a rapid rate. Hydro-jet cleaning is a more powerful form of power washing, employed to remove buildup and debris in tanks and lines.  Areas of use  Pressure washing is employed by businesses and homeowners to reduce allergies, minimize hazards, and improve aesthetics. A pressure washer is used to clean surfaces such as: * Gutters * Roofs * Decks * Sidewalks * Patios * Driveways * Siding * Parking lots *Cladding Depending upon the surface to be cleaned, higher or lower pressure should be used, as well as the appropriate nozzle.  Nozzles  Pressure washer nozzles alter the direction of flow and velocity of the water. Nozzles allow users to reach a greater distance or apply more pressure to a difficult to clean surface, however, they can be dangerous. Nozzles are color coded for easy identification, with black nozzles covering the widest degree (65¬∞) and red nozzles covering the least (0¬∞). Great care should be taken when using a 0¬∞ nozzle as it can cause injury to the user and damage to surfaces.

The first International School of Choueifat was founded in Choueifat, Lebanon in 1886 and later expanded to various parts of the Persian Gulf region. The first Choueifat school in the Persian Gulf opened in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates in 1975 and subsequently others opened in other cities across the Middle East. The school has built a tradition of placing students' acceptance letters from the college they attended in their foyers. The last day of secondary education is traditionally marked by Choueifat students on the last day of formal classes in the 12th grade. This last day of classes runs as any other day. There is also a tradition of the graduating class planting a tree on the campus grounds with an accompanying plaque, as their legacy to the school. Several such trees with accompanying plaques can be found on the grounds of every Choueifat school. Student Life Organization (SLO) AKA SLO: This organization started as an attempt to have students basically run their school in areas such as academics, school trips, sports and \\"discipline\\". Unfortunately, withoutin some schools, lack of proper funding from the school's Board of Directors, considered to be stingy and unsympathetic to the student body, it has failed to achieve many of the goals it has set for itself. School trips to different locations around the cites they are located in are a rare treat, and the SLO has fallen back to organizing the inefficient system of make-up exams for the schools' Academic Monitoring System (A.M.S.). Not to render the SLO completely useless, it has shown certain advantages in an area the school defines as \\"discipline\\", where students take it upon themselves to enforce the rules and values the school has given itself. The schools have recently adopted a system dubbed \\"Power Prefects\\", where certain members of a classroom appointed to report any wrong- doings to the administration, such that their identities are kept secret, only known to the students chosen and certain members of the administration, namely the Director and Head of SLO. This system has only shown to spread discord between the student body, and since the system is only applied to students whose ages range from ten to eighteen years old, it ends up with more physical hurt to certain students than if the system were dropped altogether. The current SABIS education system is a fusion of the British GCSE and US High School systems. The first 9 years of students' schooling is typical prep- school education. Once in grade 10 (equivalent to grade 8 in some schools), students must choose between contingencies to either a Science (S) or Literary/Arts (L) section. In grades 10 and 11, students prepare for GCE/IGCSE O Level examinations, which are administered by the Edexcel International/London University Examinations and/or Cambridge International Examinations. Most of these tests are taken at the end of grade 11, even though select subjects might be accelerated and taken at the end of grade 10. After completing the British GCE exams, in grade 12, students again have a choice between Science and Literature. Moreover, in grade 12, they pursue studies to take the College Board Advanced Placement examinations at the end of grade 12 and earn their high school diplomas (a minimum grade of 50% in at least 5 subjects is required). Moreover, students may prepare to take their GCE Advanced Levels (A Levels) at the end of grade 13 (A level courses are two-year courses, grade 12 and 13). Depending on the courses a student takes and the university he or she wishes to apply to, they can generally be qualified with 12 or 13 years of schooling.

Production of the car was first based in Terrebonne and was later moved to Granby.  The Beginning  In the late 1960s an employee of Renault-Canada's public relations department named Jacques About was asked to assess the feasibility of importing the Alpine A110 berlinette into Canada. At that time Alpine was an independent company (they were absorbed by Renault in 1974) that used Renault engines in their cars, which were then sold through Renault dealers in Europe. Although the results of the survey were positive, Renault chose not to import the Alpine. About left Renault shortly thereafter. Jacques About was born in France on February 14, 1938. His early childhood was spent in Vietnam but he returned to France for his secondary education. In 1955 he emigrated to Qu√©bec. Following his graduation from the College Stanislas he pursued a variety of occupations, including physical education teacher, sports-journalist, automotive industry analyst and racing driver. In 1968 About established Les Automobiles Manic Inc. The company's name, pronounced \\"ma-NEEK\\", was a shortened version of the Montagnais word for Qu√©bec's Manicouagan River and its Manic-5 hydroelectric dam (since renamed the Daniel-Johnson Dam) whose curves inspired About.  Manic GRAC  The company's first product was a version of an open-wheeled racing car developed by the French \\"Groupe de Recherches Automobiles de Course\\" (GRAC). In Europe the car raced in the Formula France series. In Canada the car was built by Manic under license and called the Manic-GRAC. With sponsorship from Gitanes cigarettes, it was campaigned by the company's own team, l'√âcurie Manic, in Forumula C. Serge Soumille took a turn as a driver. The Manic-GRAC enjoyed a measure of success, including setting track records at Saint-Jovite and Mosport. It also garnered publicity which raised the profile of the young company. The company later embarked on development of an endurance racer called the Manic PA-II. This car was built to run in the Group 6 class for prototypes, and had full barquette-style bodywork.  Manic GT  The company's next project was a compact two passenger road-going berlinette called the Manic GT. In trying to create a uniquely Qu√©b√©cois visual identity, the styling of the car was to be a hybrid, with the front end echoing contemporary European work and the rear displaying an American influence. The GT was designed by Serge Soumille and built with the assistance of chief mechanic Maurice Gris, both of whom, like About, were originally from France. The prototype Manic GT used many parts from the Renault 8. The car was built on a Renault 8 chassis with a steel roll-over structure added to improve safety and add stiffness to the frame. Mounted behind the rear axle centre- line was a Renault Cl√©on-Fonte engine. This inline four-cylinder motor had a wet-linered cast-iron block with five main bearings and an alloy cylinder head with overhead valves. The body of molded fiberglass was bonded, rather than bolted, to the chassis. While this further stiffened the structure it made repairs difficult. Steering was by rack-and-pinion. The suspension was independent at all four wheels via coil springs and telescopic dampers. The brakes were likewise disks at all four wheels. An anti-roll bar was mounted at the front. Many of the car's other components and trim came from Renault. The first Manic GT was built with financial support from a small group of lawyers in Montreal familiar with the project. Construction took place in the company's facility in Terrebonne. The prototype was first shown to the public at the Montreal Auto Show in April 1969. That same year it was also displayed at the Qu√©bec Pavilion at the Worlds Fair in Osaka Japan. Following the car's debut About was able to secure financial backing from the Bombardier International Capital Corporation, the Steinberg family, the Caisse de D√©p√¥t, the Industrial Credit Bureau of Qu√©bec and the Canadian government. Initial capitalization reached more than $1,500,000. About contracted with Renault to use the chassis and power-train from the Renault 8 and 10 sedans as the basis for the production Manic, whose full model name was the Manic GT PAI. The production engine was still a Cl√©on-Fonte but was now the \\"810\\" version, making this essentially a Renault 10 platform. The car was offered in three stages of tune: 65, 80 and 105 horsepower permitting top speeds of 169, 193 and 217 km/h respectively. Power reached the rear wheels through a standard four-speed manual transmission, while a five-speed was available as an option. The Manic GT was to be sold and serviced by Renault dealers across Canada. Production of the GT began in October 1969 at the Terrebonne factory. The car was advertised at a price of $3384.00 Canadian fully equipped. Now in its final production form, the GT made another appearance at the Montreal Auto Show in 1970, where it appeared alongside the Manic-GRAC and the PA-II. About restructured the company and renamed it Les Automobiles Manic (1970) Lt√©e. A new factory was built in Granby Qu√©bec. The factory opened on January 1, 1971 with 40 employees. Production was anticipated to be 2000 cars per year. The factory soon ran into problems obtaining parts from Renault. While major components for unfinished cars sat on the factory floor many smaller but still critical parts were not available. The factory attempted to fill their requirements by buying parts from Renault dealers in Mexico and Spain. With no financial penalty for late delivery written into their supplier agreement with Renault, Automobiles Manic had little recourse other than to threaten to withhold payment, which only worsened the relationship with Renault. Investors in Manic demanded that Renault assume the losses caused by these delays. Renault refused and the investors subsequently cut off funding for the company. In April 1971, the Manic GT made two important appearances in the United States. In Detroit, a GT was successfully homologated for sale in the US. In New York a GT was put on display at that city's 1971 Auto Show. An order for 1000 cars was received from an American distributor, but this came too late to change the company's fortunes. The Granby factory was closed in May 1971, and on June 8, 1971, Les Automobiles Manic officially ceased operations.  Legacy  While estimates vary, the number of Manic GTs produced is typically said to have been 160. A Manic GT is part of the collection at the Canadian Automotive Museum in Oshawa Ontario. A Manic GT is part of the virtual online exhibition \\"In Search of the Canadian Car\\" at the Canada Science and Technology Museum. A Manic GT was displayed at the 2009 Canadian Concours d'√âl√©gance at Terrebonne. A Manic GT was featured at the 2010 Montreal Auto Show. A Manic GT was displayed at the Avignon Motor Festival in March 2011. An unfinished car sold during the liquidation of the factory was later acquired by journalist Glen Woodcock and restored. It won first place at the Antique and Classic Car Club of Canada's 49th annual Concours d'√âl√©gance in August 2012. This car was lost due to fire later that same year. Designer Serge Soumille drove a Manic GT in a historic racing event in France. It is reported that at least one prototype of a planned successor to the GT has survived. This car has a custom steel-tubing chassis and the engine and transaxle from a Renault 12 turned 180¬∞ to mount in a mid-engined configuration. About continued to repay debts incurred by Automobiles Manic until 1984. He also returned to his career in education, founding the Acad√©mie Ste-Th√©r√®se in 1982, where the Campus Jacques About is named in his honour. Jacques About died on April 18, 2013 at age 75 due to complications of multiple sclerosis. He was survived by spouse Lorraine Caron and son Pierre. Pierre About owns Manic GT chassis number 74.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 30 June 1791, M√©zi√®res - 16 March 1841, Paris) was a physicist, mathematician who is primarily known for the Biot‚ÄìSavart law of electromagnetism, which he discovered together with his colleague Jean-Baptiste Biot. His main interest was in acoustics and the study of vibrating bodies. A particular interest in the violin led him to create an experimental trapezoidal model. He gave his name to the savart, a unit of measurement for musical intervals, and to Savart's wheel‚Äîa device he used while investigating the range of human hearing. Biography He was the son of G√©rard Savart, an engineer at the military school of Metz. His brother, Nicolas, who was a student at the √âcole Polytechnique and an officer in the engineering corps, did work on vibration. At the military hospital at Metz, Savart studied medicine and later he went on to continue his studies at the University of Strasbourg, where he received his medical degree in 1816. Savart became a professor at Coll√®ge de France in 1836 and was the co-originator of the Biot‚ÄìSavart law, along with Jean-Baptiste Biot. Together, they worked on the theory of magnetism and electrical currents. Their law was developed and published in 1820.A joint Biot-Savart paper \\"Note sur le magn√©tisme de la pile de Volta\\" was published in the Annales de chemie et de physique in 1820. The Biot‚ÄìSavart law relates magnetic fields to the currents which are their sources. Savart also studied acoustics. He developed the Savart wheel which produces sound at specific graduated frequencies using rotating disks. F√©lix Savart is the namesake of a unit of measurement for musical intervals, the savart, though it was actually invented by Joseph Sauveur (Stigler's law of eponymy).

The distance to this star has been measured directly using the parallax method, which places it away with a margin of error of about a light year. Rho Virginis is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 V. It is larger than the Sun with a radius 60% larger and about twice the mass. As such it is generating energy at a higher rate than the Sun, with a luminosity 14 times greater. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 8,930 K, which is what gives it the white-hued glow of an A-type star. It is classified as a Delta Scuti type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.02 magnitudes over periods of 0.5 to 2.4 hours. This star has been established as a Lambda Bo√∂tis star that displays low abundances of iron peak elements.

He is the son of the songwriter and drummer Doyle Bramhall. Early life Bramhall was born in Texas and lived half of his life in Northern California. His father, Doyle Bramhall, Sr., played drums for the legendary bluesmen Lightnin' Hopkins and Freddie King and was a lifelong collaborator with his childhood friends Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimmie Vaughan. Music career When Bramhall was 18, he toured with Jimmie Vaughan's band, the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Two years later he co-founded the blues rock band Arc Angels with fellow Austinite Charlie Sexton and members from Stevie Ray Vaughan's rhythm section, Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon. In 1996, he released his first solo album, Doyle Bramhall II. Following the 1999 release of Jellycream, Bramhall's second album and first for RCA, he received phone calls from both Roger Waters and Eric Clapton. Bramhall joined Waters on his In the Flesh tour, playing guitar and providing background and lead vocals. His performances were recorded on the subsequent live album and DVD, In the Flesh ‚Äì Live. Bramhall also played guitar on Clapton's Riding With the King, a collaboration with B.B. King. The album included versions of Clapton's and King's songs, and covers of blues songs‚Äîincluding two Bramhall-penned tracks originally from Jellycream. In 2001, Bramhall released Welcome with his new band, Smokestack. The album's lead single, \\"Green Light Girl,\\" was somewhat of a hit in the blues world. In 2006, Bramhall and Smokestack released a live DVD entitled Live at the Great Wall of China. Two audio tracks from the DVD were released on iTunes under the title of Doyle Bramhall II (Live at the Great Wall of China). In the following years, Bramhall collaborated with artists such as T Bone Burnett, Elton John, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Gary Clark Jr., Gregg Allman, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, Billy Preston, Erykah Badu, Questlove and Meshell Ndegeocello. Bramhall has produced several records, including Sheryl Crow's 100 Miles from Memphis in 2011. He also joined her on a tour for this album. In 2013, Bramhall completed co-production on Eric Clapton's 2013 release Old Sock, and played guitars on his 2014 release The Breeze: An Appreciation of JJ Cale. He joined Clapton on his 50th anniversary tour as an opening act and backing musician. He appeared at Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival and was recorded for the subsequent live album and DVD. Bramhall played lead guitars on Elton John's 2013 album The Diving Board. In 2015, he played with the Tedeschi Trucks Band and Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings for the \\"Wheels of Soul\\" tour across the United States. He performed both as an opening act and as a rhythm guitarist in the Tedeschi Trucks Band, performing songs ranging from his days with the Arc Angels to unreleased songs. Also in 2015, he performed a tribute concert to honor Joe Cocker along with the Tedeschi Trucks Band and alumni from the 1970 Joe Cocker Mad Dogs and Englishmen Tour, including Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge, Bobby Torres, Claudia Lennear, Chuck Blackwell, Pamela Polland, Daniel Moore, Matthew Moore, Chris Stainton, and photographer Linda Wolf. He also performed at the Mahindra Blues Festival in India alongside Buddy Guy and Quinn Sullivan in 2015. On September 30, 2016, Bramhall released his 4th studio album titled Rich Man. The album consists of 12 originals and a cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\". \\\\- In 2018, Bramhall signed with the Mascot Label Group, with a new album expected that fall. The album, entitled \\"Shades\\", was planned to be released on October 5, 2018, following the lead single \\"Everything You Need\\", a duet with Eric Clapton. In addition to Clapton, the album featured collaborations with Norah Jones, Greyhounds, and Tedeschi Trucks Band. Style Bramhall is one of the few guitarists who plays with his instrument strung upside-down. He plays left-handed, but the instrument is strung upside-down with the high E on the top. This unusual arrangement of the strings gives his playing a unique sound, because he bends the strings by pulling them downwards rather than upwards, the customary approach. Others who have bent strings in this direction include Albert King, Eric Gales, Otis Rush, Barbara Lynn, Coco Montoya, Edgard Scandurra, king of surf guitar Dick Dale, and the late blues guitarist Jeff Healey, who played with his instrument flat on his lap for stability and increased string flexibility.

Background Carl Rowan was born in Ravenscroft, Tennessee, the son of Johnnie, a cook and cleaner, and Thomas Rowan, who stacked lumber.Blackpast.org He was raised in McMinnville, Tennessee during the Great Depression. Rowan was determined to get a good education. He graduated from Bernard High School in 1942 as class president and valedictorian. After graduating high school, Rowan worked cleaning porches at a tuberculosis hospital in order to attend Tennessee State College in Nashville. He studied at Tennessee State University (1942‚Äì43) and Washburn University (1943‚Äì44). He was one of the first African Americans to serve as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy. Rowan was also a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was graduated from Oberlin College (1947) and was awarded a master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota (1948). He began his career in journalism writing for the African-American newspapers Minneapolis Spokesman and St. Paul Recorder (now the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder).Carl T. Rowan, page on yourdictionary.com He went on to be a copywriter for The Minneapolis Tribune (1948‚Äì50), and later became a staff writer (1950‚Äì61), reporting extensively on the Civil Rights Movement.Carl T. Rowan , in \\"Tennessee Authors Past and Present\\", The University of Tennessee, 2003 (accessed December 2, 2009). In 1960, Rowan was denied membership to a club on the grounds that it was racially segregated; this subsequently inspired Joe Glazer to write the song \\"I Belong to a Private Club\\".Joe Glazer Sings: Garbage (with the Charlie Byrd Trio), released 1980 by Collector Records; liner notes archived at Smithsonian Folkways; \\"In 1960, Carl Rowan, a distinguished journalist and government official, was denied membership in one of Washington's most exclusive clubs because he was black. I got mad and wrote this song.\\" In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Rowan reflected on his reporting of the civil rights movement, as well as his opinions on the distinctions between the North and the South, prejudices and persecution, and African Americans' political power. Cabinet Room of the White House, July 1965 In 1961, Rowan was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State by President John F. Kennedy. The following year, he served as a delegate to the United Nations during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Rowan became the U.S. Ambassador to Finland in 1963. In 1964, Rowan was appointed director of the United States Information Agency (USIA) by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In serving as director of the USIA, Rowan became the first African American to hold a seat on the National Security Council and the highest level African American in the United States government. From 1966 to 1998, Rowan wrote a syndicated column for the Chicago Sun-Times and, from 1967 to 1996, was a panelist on a television program Agronsky & Company, later called Inside Washington; Rowan was a fair opponent whose arguments were persuasive and well-balanced - he always came across as the voice of reason. His name appeared on the master list of Nixon political opponents. Rowan was a 1995 Pulitzer Prize finalist for his commentaries. He is the only journalist in history to win the Sigma Delta Chi medallion for journalistic excellence in three successive years. Carl Rowan was a well known and highly decorated journalist. His columns were published in more than one hundred newspapers across the United States. In 1968 he received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. In 1997, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.NAACP Spingarn Medal Thurgood Marshall's only interview while serving on the Supreme Court of the United States was for Carl Rowan's 1988 documentary. The National Press Club gave Rowan its 1999 Fourth Estate Award for lifetime achievement. On January 9, 2001, United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dedicated the press briefing room at the State Department as the Carl T. Rowan Briefing room., January 9, 2001. Rowan died in Washington on Sept. 23, 2000, of heart and kidney ailments in the intensive care unit at Washington Hospital Center. Rowan was 75 and had diabetes prior to his death. Rowan was survived by his wife, Vivien, and the three children they shared: two sons and one daughter. Rowan‚Äôs two sons are Carl Jr., a lawyer, and Jeffrey, a clinical psychologist. His daughter, Barbara Rowan Jones, is a formal journalist like her father. Carl Rowan also is survived by four grandchildren. Montgomery bus boycott In the late 1950s, Rowan covered the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement in the South, including the historic Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott in 1955, resulting from Rosa Parks's refusal to relinquish her bus seat to a white passenger. As the only black reporter covering the story for a national newspaper, Rowan struck a special friendship with the boycott's leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr. When news of an unlikely compromise settlement of the boycott came to Rowan's attention across the Associated Press wire, he notified King, who made quick steps to discredit the story, which was about to appear in a Montgomery newspaper, thus ensuring the continuance of the boycott. Project Excellence Founded in 1987 by Rowan, Project Excellence was a college scholarship program for black high-school seniors who displayed outstanding writing and speaking skills. Rowan founded Project Excellence to combat negative peer pressure felt by black students and to reward students who rose above stereotypes and negative peer influence and excelled academically. Chaired by Rowan, a committee of journalists, community leaders, and school officials oversaw the program. Participants were African- American students in their senior year of high school from public, private, and parochial schools in the metropolitan Washington area, including the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. By 2000 the program had given out $26 million in scholarship money to over 1150 students. Shooting controversy Rowan gained public notoriety on June 14, 1988, when he shot an unarmed teenage trespasser, Ben Smith. \\"The interloper was a near-naked teenager who had been skinny-dipping with friends in Rowan's pool, and the columnist's weapon was an unregistered, and thus illegal, .22 caliber pistol.\\"Carl M. Cannon, \\"Columnist Rowan Shoots Young Intruder\\", Philly.com, June 15, 1988. From People magazine: \\"When Rowan heard the police arrive, he stepped outside to let them in. It was then, he says, that he was confronted by \\"a tall man who was smoking something that I absolutely was sure was marijuana.\\" Rowan says he repeatedly warned the intruder that he was armed and would shoot. \\"My first words were: 'Freeze! Stay where you are!' \\" says Rowan. \\"Then I said, 'I have a gun.' \\" Rowan says the man kept coming and that he finally felt forced to shoot in self-defense. He says he aimed at the intruder's feet but hit him in the wrist when the man lunged forward. The intruder, Chevy Chase, Maryland, teenager Benjamin Smith, 18, tells a different story. \\"I was in my underwear,\\" he told a radio interviewer. \\"I just climbed out of the pool. It was pretty innocent. I never spoke with him. He just shot me and closed the door and went back hiding in his house. I mean, I guess I was trespassing. But that's no reason to shoot a person, is it? For swimming in their pool?\\"Susan Schindehette, \\"By Plugging a Teenage Intruder, Columnist Carl Rowan May Have Shot Himself in the Foot\\", People, July 4, 1988. Rowan was charged for firing a gun that he did not legally own. Rowan was arrested and tried. During the trial, he argued that he had the right to use whatever means necessary to protect himself and his family. He also said the pistol he used was exempt from the District's handgun prohibition law because it belonged to his older son, a former FBI agent. He was called out for hypocrisy, since Rowan was a strict gun control advocate. In a 1981 column, he advocated \\"a law that says anyone found in possession of a handgun except a legitimate officer of the law goes to jail--period.\\" In 1985, he called for \\"A complete and universal federal ban on the sale, manufacture, importation and possession of handguns (except for authorized police and military personnel).Cal Thomas, \\"Arms And The Columnist: The Making Of A 'Gun Nut'\\", Philly.com, June 22, 1988. Rowan was tried but the jury was deadlocked; the judge declared a mistrial and he was never retried. In his autobiography, Rowan said he still favors gun control, but admits being vulnerable to a charge of hypocrisy.More Use Guns In Self Defense Bibliography * South of Freedom (1952) * The Pitiful and the Proud (1956) * Go South to Sorrow (1957) * Wait till Next Year: The Life Story of Jackie Robinson (1960) * Just Between Us Blacks (1974) * Breaking Barriers: A Memoir (1991) * Growing up Black: From The Slave Days to the Present - 25 African- Americans Reveal the Trials and Triumphs of Their Childhoods (contributor, 1992) * Dream Makers, Dream Breakers: The World of Justice Thurgood Marshall (1993) * The Coming Race War in America: A Wake-Up Call (1996) NotesExternal links *\\"Carl T.

Nizier Anthelme Philippe (Ma√Ætre Philippe de Lyon) 1849-1905 Family background Philippe was born the son of peasants. He was also known as \\"Ma√Ætre Philippe\\" or \\"Ma√Ætre Philippe de Lyon\\". His mother was Marie Vachod (1823‚Äì1899) and his father was Joseph Philippe (1819‚Äì1898). From the age of fourteen he stayed with his uncle Vachod, a Butcher in Lyon. He gained a reputation as a healer by the age of thirteen. He married Jeanne Julie Landar (1859‚Äì1939) on 6 October 1877 in L'Arbresle. He had a daughter, Jeanne Marie Victoire born on 11 November 1878. She died on 29 August 1904 aged 25, just before her seventh wedding anniversary. He refused to heal her, saying that it was Heaven's wish that she should go on ahead, and predicted the precise course of her illness and death. \\"This death,\\" he said, \\"has for me been a living crucifixion.\\" Career He gained a reputation as a miracle worker amongst Paris occultists. Having been harassed for practicing medicine without a license, he went to St Petersburg where he was awarded his Doctor's Diploma in recognition of extraordinary feats of remote healing conducted in St Petersburg. Grand Duchess Militza Nikolaevna of Russia later introduced Philippe to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia in 1901, and Philippe enjoyed a brief influence over the imperial couple, until he was exposed as a charlatan in 1903 and was expelled from Russia.King, Empress, 153 In October 1884 he presented a paper (published in French) entitled \\"Principles of Hygiene applicable in Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infancy\\" at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio. In recognition of this the University conferred a Doctorate of Medicine on him. Many other academic and social honours were conferred on him during the 1880s and 1890s in France and Italy. Philippe died on 2 August 1905 at the age of 56, in L'Arbresle, Rh√¥ne, France where he was living. He was buried in the cemetery of Loyasse, in Lyon, France.

A foresail is one of a few different types of sail set on the foremost mast (foremast) of a sailing vessel: * A fore and aft sail set on the foremast of a schooner or similar vessel. * The lowest square-sail on the foremast of a full rigged ship or other vessel which is square-rigged. Sails set forward of the mainmast, such as jibs and staysails, are sometimes referred to as foresails, although \\"headsails\\" is a more common term, headsail can also specifically refer to the sail on a forestay that connects directly to the head of the mast.  History  ancient Greek trireme with raked foresail, called artemon Foresails set on foremasts between midships and bow were the first type of sail to appear after the mainsail which had been the sole standard rig on sailing vessels for millennia, down to classical antiquity. The earliest foresail, or two-masted ship, has been identified on an Etruscan pyxis from Caere, Italy, dating to the mid-7th century BC: a warship with a furled mainsail is engaging an enemy vessel, deploying a foresail.Turfa, J. MacIntosh; Steinmayer, A. G. (1999): \\"The Earliest Foresail, on Another Etruscan Vase\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 292‚Äì296 (295) A two-masted merchant vessel with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan tomb painting from 475‚Äì450 BC.Casson, Lionel (1963): \\"The Earliest Two-masted Ship\\", Archaeology, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp. 108‚Äì111 (111) An artemon (Greek for foresail) almost the same size as the galley's mainsail can be found on a Corinthian krater as early as the late 6th century BC, but apart from that Greek longships of the 8th‚Äì5th century BC are uniformly shown without it.Casson, Lionel (1980): \\"Two-masted Greek ships\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 68‚Äì69 (69) The foresail became fairly common on Roman war galleys, where it seems to be used rather for steering than as a driver.Casson, Lionel (1963): \\"The Earliest Two-masted Ship\\", Archaeology, Vol. 16, No. 2, pp. 108‚Äì111 (109) Its size was reduced and the now strongly raked foremast made it more appear like a bowsprit sail. While most of the evidence is iconographic, the existence of foresails can also archaeologically be deduced from slots in foremast-feets located too close to the prow for a mainsail.Beltrame, Carlo (1996): \\"Archaeological Evidence of the Foremast on Ancient Sailing Ships\\", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 135‚Äì139 (135) Artemon, along with mainsail and topsail, developed into the standard rig of seagoing vessels in imperial times, complemented by a mizzen on the largest freighters.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 239‚Äì243 Throughout antiquity, both foresail and mizzen remained secondary in terms of canvas size, but still large enough to require full running rigging. In late antiquity, the foremast lost most of its tilt, standing nearly upright on some ships. By the onset of the Early Middle Ages, rigging had undergone a fundamental transformation in Mediterranean navigation: the lateen which had long evolved on smaller Greco- Roman craft replaced the square rig, the chief sail type of the ancients, which practically disappeared from the record until the 14th century (while it remained dominant in northern Europe).Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 243‚Äì245Pryor, John H.; Jeffreys; Elizabeth M.

Peoples, Economies and Cultures, 400‚Äì1500, Vol. 62, Brill Academic Publishers, , pp. 153‚Äì161 The dromon, the lateen-rigged and oared bireme of the Byzantine navy, almost certainly had two sails, a larger foresail and one midships. The length of its foremast has been estimated at about 12 m, somewhat smaller than that of the Sicilian war galleys of the time.Pryor, John H.; Jeffreys; Elizabeth M. (2006): \\"The Age of the ŒîŒ°ŒüŒúŒ©Œù. The Byzantine Navy ca. 500‚Äì1204\\", The Medieval Mediterranean. Peoples, Economies and Cultures, 400‚Äì1500, Vol. 62, Brill Academic Publishers, , pp. 238f., 244 Multiple-masted sailing ships were reintroduced into the Mediterranean by the Late Middle Ages. Large vessels were coming more and more into use and the need for additional sails to control these ships adequately grew with the increase in tonnage. Unlike in antiquity, the foresail was adopted on medieval two-masters after the mizzen, evidence for which dates to the mid-14th century. To balance out the sail plan the next obvious step was to add a mast fore of the main-mast, which first appears on a Catalan vessel from 1409. With the three-masted ship established, propelled by square rig and lateen, and guided by the pintle-and-gudgeon rudder, all advanced ship design technology necessary for the great transoceanic voyages was in place by the onset of the 15th century.Mott, Lawrence V.

The Kirk is situated below Arthur's Seat and next to Duddingston Loch. \\"Jock Tamson's Bairns\\" is a Lowland Scots (and Northumbrian English) dialect version of \\"Jack (John) Thomson's children\\" but both Jock and Tamson in this context take on the connotation of Everyman. The Dictionary of the Scots Language gives the following definitions: *Jock: (1) A generic term for a man, a male person. (34) Jock Tamson's bairns: the human race, common humanity; also, with less universal force, a group of people united by a common sentiment, interest or purpose.Dictionary of the Scots Language entries (1) and (34) for Jock. Note the examples lower down the page. Further examples are to be found in the supplement to the dictionary. *Tamson: a Scottish form of the surname Thomson. In phrases Tamson stands for the ordinary representative man in the street: Jock Tamson's bairns, common humanity. The phrase is used in common speech in Scotland and it also occurs in general culture. Some examples are: the play of that name by Liz Lochhead; a folk music group of that name; The folk group Jock Tamson's bairns have a recording of the same name the title of a book describing the official records of the Scottish nation; a report of a speech in parliament by Winnie Ewing;Winnie Ewing in Hansard and Morag Alexander, the Scottish Commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The phrase more often occurs in an extended form: We're a' Jock Tamson's bairns. This is interpreted in a metaphorical sense as a statement of egalitarian sentiments equivalent to \\"we're all the same under the skin\\" or \\"we are all God's children\\". The origin of the phrase is uncertain. The earliest reference quoted in the Dictionary of the Scots Language is from 1847 where it describes the phrase as \\"an expression of mutual good fellowship very frequently heard in Scotland.\\" One suggestion is that it was simply common usage in the Fife town of Buckhaven which had 70 Thomson families out of a total of 160 families in 1833. Another is that the Reverend John Thomson, minister of Duddingston Kirk, Edinburgh, from 1805 to 1840, called the members of his congregation (and his many children) \\"ma bairns\\". The latter saying may well be the reason for the location of the plaque illustrated above. The equivalent phrase in Scottish Gaelic is \\"Clann MhicTamhais\\".

The Washitaw Nation was headed by Verdiacee Hampton Goston (also known as Verdiacee Turner, also known as Empress Verdiacee Tiari Washitaw Turner Goston El-Bey, ca. 1927‚Äì2014). She was mayor of Richwood, Louisiana in 1975 and 1976, and again from 1980 to 1984, Monroe Free Press and is the author of the self- published book Return of the Ancient Ones (1993). Goston asserts that the United Nations \\"registers the Washitaw as indigenous people No. 215\\". Classification In 1999, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimated that the group had about 200 hard-core members, noting its popularity among followers of Moorish Science, a nationalist movement. The asserted legal basis for the establishment of the Washitaw Nation is a theory that individuals and groups may declare \\"sovereignty\\" and may separate themselves from state and federal governments, a concept earlier used by the Posse Comitatus. The argument is also made that Napoleon only sold \\"the streets of New Orleans and a military barracks\\" and that the rest of Louisiana was stolen from the Washitaw. Various United States courts have held that the Washitaw Nation is fictional and that it is not recognized as a sovereign nation. Actions The Washitaw Nation is the accrediting agent for a diploma mill, the City University of Los Angeles.

The event was meant to be the first in a series of pay-per-views that would feature popular wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s. Plans for the franchise were abandoned following the event, which suffered from a poor buy rate and several controversies, most notably a disastrous main event featuring an inebriated Jake Roberts. Overview Playing off the resurgence in popularity of pro wrestling at the time, Fosstone Productions president Bill Stone conceived a series of events consisting of wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s fighting one another in a series of \\"dream matches\\". Stone booked the initial pay-per-view with the intent of having three more, run on a quarterly basis, if the initial target of 40,000 buys was reached. Although the event was heavily promoted, it was only purchased by 29,000 households. Additionally, the event itself was generally regarded to be of poor quality: Wrestling Observer rated it the worst major wrestling event of 1999, with its editor Dave Meltzer giving a rating of \\"absolute zero\\" to a tag team match featuring Luke Williams and Butch Miller facing Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik. Meltzer's colleague, Bryan Alvarez of Figure Four Weekly, has repeatedly referred to this match as the worst he has ever seen and rated it \\"minus more stars than there are in the universe\\"Heroes of Wrestling: Sucked Long Before Jake Used a Snake as a Penis Controversy Color commentary = Minor controversy initially erupted at the beginning of the broadcast due to a last-minute change of commentators. Gordon Solie, a well-respected figure in the wrestling world with several decades of experience delivering play-by-play, had been advertised as one of the event's commentators. Shortly before the event, Solie fell ill with the throat cancer to which he would succumb nine months later. No announcement was made of the change before the show, and neither Solie nor his illness were ever mentioned during the broadcast. Solie's replacement, Randy Rosenbloom, appeared to have little to no knowledge of professional wrestling, delivering what would come to be regarded as some of the poorest color commentary ever given at a professional wrestling event. Rosenbloom repeatedly made mistakes during the broadcast, such as misidentifying wrestlers' countries of origin, and having to be repeatedly corrected on basic wrestling terminology by his broadcast partners Dutch Mantell and Captain Lou Albano, such as when he called an arm drag performed by Marty Jannetty a \\"reverse slam takedown\\". A particular source of criticism was Rosenbloom's inability to identify a simple dropkick, repeatedly calling the maneuver such things as a \\"flying kick,\\" \\"flying leg kick,\\" and \\"leg drop\\". = Jake Roberts incident = The show is nominally remembered for its conclusion, originally slated to be a double-main event pitting Jake Roberts against Jim Neidhart, and King Kong Bundy against Yokozuna. Roberts' problems with drug and alcohol addiction had been well publicized in the preceding years, and his booking in the main event was meant to capitalize on the resurgence in popularity he had enjoyed as a result of his attempts at sobriety. Roberts' return to the ring was meant to be the high point of the evening, and the match responsible for generating the most publicity. However, Roberts suffered a relapse prior to the show and consumed a significant amount of alcohol before arriving. Prior to his match with Neidhart, Roberts had been scheduled to cut a promo in which he would taunt Neidhart. Due to his level of intoxication, Roberts' promo instead consisted of a slurred, incoherent rant consisting largely of wordplay based on the event's casino setting. One particular segment of the rant would go viral after it was posted on WrestleCrap: > You don't want to play cards with me because I'll cheat. Okay? I cheat. You > wanna play 21? I've got 22. You want to play blackjack? I've got two of > those, too! You wanna play ... Aces and eights, baby? I got too many of > those, too! After the interview, Roberts staggered to the ring with his trademark snake. However, upon reaching the ring, Roberts put the snake down and attempted to return backstage; he then reversed course, returned to ringside, and began greeting fans. Before entering the ring, Roberts grabbed a female fan and had her rub her hands on his bare chest. Later, Roberts removed the snake from its bag and simulated masturbation with it. The event's producers cut to wide- shots of the crowd during the incident, so that at-home viewers were unaware what was happening in the ring. Roberts eventually collapsed in the middle of the ring with the snake draped over his body; the supine Roberts then began to attempt to kiss the snake. In an effort to salvage the match, promoter Bill Stone decided on the fly to combine the main events into one tag team event and sent Bundy to team with Neidhart and Yokozuna to team with Roberts. Stone then sent a member of the production crew, Michael Henry, to ringside to consult with the wrestlers. Bundy pinned Roberts by hitting him with a splash after Roberts had staggered and fallen around the ring several times, despite Roberts not being the legal man in the ring.OO Column: Online Onslaught by Rick Scaia Pro Wrestling News, Analysis, and Commentary... WWE, WWF, WCW, ECW, The Rock, Brock Lesnar, Triple H, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, Undertaker, Trish Stratus, Lita, Stacy Keibler, Divas, RAW, SmackDown, WrestleMania Yokozuna and Henry attempted to salvage the event and Roberts' reputation by trying to goad Roberts into attacking Henry, making his behavior appear scripted. Roberts was too inebriated to realize what was happening and remained oblivious to Yokozuna and Henry's attacks. Yokozuna then hit a Samoan drop on Henry to make the entire series of events appear scripted; while Yokozuna attacked Henry, Roberts began to disrobe in the middle of the ring and the producers cut the feed immediately thereafter.

Janowitz was an officer in World War I, but returned from it as a pacifist. Shortly after the war ended, he met the similarly minded Carl Mayer in Berlin, who suggested he work as an author. Together they wrote the script to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari), which was filmed by Robert Wiene during 1919 and 1920, and released in February 1920. The movie is a prominent work of German expressionism. Supposedly, the film was at first offered to director Fritz Lang, in the early part of his career, who suggested the now-famous framing story of the madman remembering his past, who then recounts the tale of a girl's mysterious murder, first read about by Janowitz in a newspaper account. Janowitz and Mayer protested the change, but it was made anyway over their objections, and Lang left the project to direct another film. Wiene was then hired to direct the film. Janowitz then worked with another two movies by F. W. Murnau. As early as 1922, he ended his movie career and became active in the oil business.

An important class of examples occurs when X is a smooth manifold M, T is a diffeomorphism of M, and Œº is any measure that locally is a measure with base the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space. Then the effect of T on Œº is locally expressible as multiplication by the Jacobian determinant of the derivative (pushforward) of T. To express this idea more formally in measure theory terms, the idea is that the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative of the transformed measure Œº‚Ä≤ with respect to Œº should exist everywhere; or that the two measures should be equivalent (i.e. mutually absolutely continuous): :\\\\mu' = T_{*} (\\\\mu) \\\\approx \\\\mu. That means, in other words, that T preserves the concept of a set of measure zero. Considering the whole equivalence class of measures ŒΩ, equivalent to Œº, it is also the same to say that T preserves the class as a whole, mapping any such measure to another such. Therefore, the concept of quasi-invariant measure is the same as invariant measure class. In general, the 'freedom' of moving within a measure class by multiplication gives rise to cocycles, when transformations are composed. As an example, Gaussian measure on Euclidean space Rn is not invariant under translation (like Lebesgue measure is), but is quasi-invariant under all translations. It can be shown that if E is a separable Banach space and Œº is a locally finite Borel measure on E that is quasi-invariant under all translations by elements of E, then either dim(E) < +‚àû or Œº is the trivial measure Œº ‚â° 0\\\\.

As a State Defense Force, members serve alongside the Georgia Army National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard. The mission of the Georgia State Defense Force is to provide an organized, trained, disciplined, rapid response volunteer force to assist state and local government agencies and civil relief organizations during emergencies to ensure the welfare and safety of Georgia citizens. The SDF's members help, support, and augment the Georgia National Guard, provide professional skills to the Georgia Department of Defense, and assist Georgia communities. Volunteers are trained to assist the National Guard, provide search and rescue, medical support, and disaster relief. Organization The Georgia State Defense Force is currently organized with a headquarters at the Clay National Guard Center in Marietta; three brigades with geographic areas of responsibility throughout the state; medical companies; a support brigade providing special skills augmentation; Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC); an Opposing Force (OPFOR) Command; a Ready Reserve Command; and a Chaplain Corps (based on Army special branches religious support) with a Command Chaplain, Brigade Chaplain, Battalion Chaplain (UMT) Unit Ministry Team and a Chaplain Training Center. Each brigade and equivalent unit is commanded by a field grade officer (usually a colonel). The current chain of command for the State Defense Force at the state level is organized under three positions: The commander-in-chief (Governor Brian Kemp), the adjutant general (Major General Tom Carden), and the Georgia State Defense Force commander (Brigadier General Tom Blackstock). Requirements Current eligibility to join the Georgia State Defense Force extends to men and women between the ages of 18 and 64 who: * pass a background check, * are U.S. citizens or legal residents, * have a high school diploma or equivalent, and * meet height and weight standards that are \\"designed to ensure that GSDF personnel present minimum acceptable appearance when in uniform.\\" Prior military experience is not required, although approximately 40 percent of active members have prior service experience. History The Georgia State Defense Force's rich heritage dates back to England. Under the direction of General James Oglethorpe, Sergeants of the Guard trained future colonists in militia tactics. As settlers began arriving in Georgia around 1733, many became members of General James Oglethorpe's militia and were called upon during the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742 to help repel the Spanish invasion of Georgia. These militia forces later joined General George Washington in the fight for American Independence. Georgia State Defense Force members help recertify Georgia Army National Guard medics in CPR/AED. The volunteer militia remained in continuous service throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. During this time, the militia participated in Indian wars against the Creeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws, and, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, Georgia responded with over 100 volunteer regiments, battalions, and batteries. The portion that remained at home helped to defend Atlanta and Macon, shadowed by the Union advance in 1864. This volunteer commitment was second only in number to the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1917, following passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, the National Guard could be called into federal service. As a result, Georgia law organized the militia into three classes: the National Guard, the naval militia, and the unorganized militia. It further created a separate Home Guard, or State Constabulary, also subject to military law. After World War I, the militia was called to put down labor unrest at factories and mills across the state. In 1940, with the onset of World War II, Governor E.D. Rivers requested the American Legion to organize the Georgia State Defense Corps. The next year, in 1941, Colonel Ryburn Clay was appointed to head the State Defense Corps and it was activated and placed under the command of Brigadier General Omar Bradley, commanding officer at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Its name was shortly changed to the State Defense Corps of Georgia and then to the Georgia State Guard in 1942. During World War II, 35,000 volunteer members guarded war plants, critical communications facilities, utilities, reservoirs, and transportation facilities. Approximately 8,000 served at any given time with about 10,000 left at the end of the war. They were trained to repel an invasion that never came. Although not officially disbanded until 1951, the Georgia State Guard began its retirement in July 1946. The Georgia State Guard was re-authorized in 1973 to serve as a constabulary force, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s was tasked to serve as a backup for state police forces. Legislation resulted in the first muster in 1985 when it was re-activated as the Georgia State Defense Force under the command of Brigadier General John Gillette. The force was tasked to provide a cadre around a larger force to assume the vacated domestic missions of Georgia National Guard members called to federal duty. Members of the Georgia State Defense Force assist with crowd and traffic control during the annual Wreaths Across America event at the Georgia National Cemetery in Canton, Georgia. Georgia State Defense Force Soldiers provide OPFOR (Opposing Force) training to Georgia Army National Guard Soldiers The current Georgia State Defense Force is authorized by the federal government under 32 USC 109(c), by the State of Georgia under Title 38 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, and by the National Guard Bureau under NGR 10-4. The Georgia Department of Defense is composed of the State Defense Force, the Army National Guard, and the Air National Guard, all of whom serve under the direction of the adjutant general of Georgia. Recent operations include support to National Guard units during the Gulf War, participation in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, emergency aid to agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA), support to Georgia National Guard units and their families since 2001, activation during the 2004 G-8 Summit at Sea Island, the 2005 Katrina and Rita hurricane evacuations, and response to Hurricanes Matthew, Irma, and Michael. In 2010, the GSDF and its members were recognized by a special resolution of the Georgia Legislature for their participation in Operation Healing Hands, providing disaster relief to earthquake victims in Haiti. After the devastating outbreak of tornadoes across the Southeast U.S. in May, 2011, members of the GSDF participated in relief efforts in Lamar County and other hard-hit areas of the state. Members of the GSDF, including consumer advocate Captain Clark Howard, assisted with car removal following a huge traffic jam caused by Winter Storm Leon. In 2018, the GSDF established an Opposing Force unit tasked with providing realistic combat training to National Guard troops prior to deployment. In March 2020, elements of the Georgia State Defense Force were activated to assist in Georgia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Members filled 4,000 disaster relief boxes filled with food and other essential items for the Second Harvest Food Bank in Valdosta, Georgia. Legal protection Employers in the state of Georgia are required by law to grant a leave of absence to any employees who are members of the Georgia State Defense Force who are activated for any military service, and to restore those employees to their previous positions upon their return from their deployment. GSDF members who are employed by a government organization are also entitled to 18 days of paid leave per fiscal year.

Because of its large penguin colony, it is a popular destination for sightseeing tours. Description The island is composed of lava flows capped by a cinder cone with a small summit crater. Geothermal heat keeps parts of the island ice-free, and the youthful morphology of the volcano suggests that it was last active within the last 1,000 years. The island is part of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group. Historic monuments Paulet Island was discovered by a British expedition (1839‚Äì1843) under James Clark Ross and named by him for Captain the Right Honorable Lord George Paulet, Royal Navy. In 1903 during the Swedish Antarctic Expedition led by Otto Nordenski√∂ld his ship Antarctic was crushed and sunk by the ice off the coast of the island. A stone hut built in February 1903 by shipwreck survivors, together with the grave of an expedition member, and the cairn built on the highest point of the island to draw the attention of rescuers, have been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 41), following a proposal by Argentina and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. The shipwrecked crew of the Endurance original plan was to travel to the island and use stores there that were left by the above Swedish Expedition but the ice pack that they were stranded on eventually drifted too far east. Important Bird Area The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a very large breeding colony of about 100,000 pairs of Ad√©lie penguins. Other birds known to nest on the island include imperial shags, snow petrels and kelp gulls. small lake in crater Gallery Image:Paulet Island.jpgPaulet Island (February 2007) Image:Paulet Island Adelie Pinguin Kolonie.JPGAdelie penguin colony on Paulet Island  See also  * List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands * List of volcanoes in Antarctica ReferencesBibliography * Antarctica.

Designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, the bridge links the Campo Volantin right bank and Uribitarte left bank of the river. Description Opened in 1997, the bridge's unusual design consists of a curved walkway which is supported by steel suspension cables from an overhead arch. The structure of the bridge is painted white and the bridge deck consists of translucent glass bricks. Access ramps and stairways are located on both banks. The Zubizuri offers pedestrians a convenient route from hotels to the nearby Bilbao Guggenheim Museum. CriticismPublished criticism= Since its opening, it has been subjected to praise as a symbol of the new Bilbao and as a draw for tourism. Architectural professor Alexander Tzonis wrote:Tzonis, Alexander, Calatrava Bridges, Thames & Hudson, 2005, > \\"The intelligence, vitality, and originality of the bridge's curved > configuration challenged the ordinariness and slow decline of the urban > setting, bringing a message of hope and an invitation to imagine better > conditions.\\" However, other professionals have been more equivocal, bridge engineer Matthew Wells saying:Wells, Matthew, 30 Bridges, Laurence King Publishing, 2002, > \\"Regrettably, the balance of light steel superstructure on the cantilevered > abutment ends is strained, like a sculptural toy, and the bridge touches the > ground uncomfortably.\\" =History since opening= The bridge has also been accused of impracticality: it is locally infamous for the glass bricks set into its floor, which can become slippery in the wet climate of the city.Entre losetas y y arquitectos 'estrellas', El Correo, 24 February 2007 The original design connects the bridge on the left bank to the Uribitarte dock and not to the higher street Alameda Mazarredo. Local authorities temporarily installed a further scaffolding footway joining the bridge and Mazarredo street, but removed it under protests from Calatrava.

In 2006, the local authorities authorized Arata Isozaki to erect a new footway from the bridge to the construction site of the Isozaki Atea towers. Calatrava responded in 2007 by suing Bilbao for the moral rights to the integrity of his creation (a part of the intellectual property under the Spanish copyright law), where a metal bar had been cut.Calatrava lleva a los tribunales su guerra con Isozaki por los puentes de Uribitarte, El Correo, 22 February 2007.¬´Ten√≠an que habernos encargado la prolongaci√≥n de la pasarela¬ª, El Correo, 23 February 2007. The mayor of Bilbao, I√±aki Azkuna, with the support of his fellow councilors claimed that the rights of the owners (Bilbao) took precedence over the architect's rights. He also noted the slips and falls of bridge users, and the cost of replacing broken glass tiles (6,000 euros a year according to opposition speaker Antonio Basagoiti, 250,000 euros in ten years according to a municipal reportLa reparaci√≥n de las losetas ha costado 250.000 euros, El Correo, 28 November 2007).

Anchialine pools are a feature of coastal aquifers which are density stratified, with the water near the surface being fresh or brackish, and saline water intruding from the coast below at some depth. Depending on the site, it is sometimes possible to access the deeper saline water directly in the anchialine pool, or sometimes it may be accessible by cave diving. Water levels in anchialine pools often fluctuate with tidal changes due to the coastal location and the connection with the ocean. Especies marinas incluidas en el cat√°logo Espa√±ol, in magrama.gob.es. The range in water levels fluctuations will be decreased (damped) and delayed compared to the range and time observed for the adjacent tide. The primary controls on the damping and lag are the distance from the coast, and the hydraulic conductivity of the geological materials. Anchialine pools are extremely common worldwide especially along Neotropical coastlines where the geology and aquifer system are relatively young, and there is minimal soil development. Such conditions occur notably where the bedrock is limestone or recently formed volcanic lava. Many anchialine pools are found on the coastlines of the island of Hawaii, and on the Yucat√°n Peninsula, where they are locally called cenotes, as well as Christmas Island. The Sailor's Hat crater created by an explosives test in 1965 is an anchialine pool. Ecological studies of anchialine pools frequently identify regionally rare and sometimes endemic species. In Hawaii, the pools are home to the  ª≈çpae ªula (Hawaiian shrimp, Halocaridina rubra). In karst anchialine pools and the caves that these may be connected to, the fauna are diverse and include crustaceans, including remipedia and copepods. Vertebrates are also found, including several species of blind cave fish.Romero, A., editor (2001). The Biology of Hypogean Fishes. Developments in Environmental Biology of Fishes.

History Paper cutters, similar to those of today, were patented in 1844 and 1852 by Guillaume Massiquot. They have been around since the late 1830s, when, in 1837, Thirault built a model with a fixed blade to a flat surface. Since the middle of the 19th century, considerable improvements have been made by Fomm and Krause of Germany, Furnival in England, and Oswego and Seybold in the United States. Description Paper cutters vary in size, usually from about in length on each side for office work to (an edge of A1 paper) in design workshops. The surface will usually have a grid either painted or inscribed on it, often in half-inch increments, and may have a ruler across the top. At the very least, it must have a flat edge against which the user may line up the paper at right-angles before passing it under the blade. It is usually relatively heavy, so that it will remain steady while in use. On the right-hand edge is a long, curved steel blade, often referred to as a knife, attached to the base at one corner. Larger versions have a strong compression coil spring as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper. The other end of the knife unit is a handle. The stationary right edge of the base is also steel, with an exposed, finely-ground edge. When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two knives moving against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal, cardboard, and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel, which provides long-term durability. The steel blade can be resharpened as needed. A variant design uses a wheel-shaped blade mounted on a sliding shuttle attached to a rail. This type of paper cutter is known as a rotary paper cutter. Advantages of this design include being able to make wavy cuts, perforations or to simply to score the paper without cutting, merely by substituting various types of circular blades. With a rotary cutter, it is also almost impossible for the user to cut oneself, except while changing the blade. This makes it safer for home use. Higher-end versions of rotary paper cutters are used for precision paper cutting and are popular for trimming photographs. An even simpler design uses double-edged blades which do not rotate, but cut like a penknife. While cheaper, this design is not preferable for serious work due to its tendency to tear paper, and poor performance with thick media. Safety Most paper cutters come equipped with a finger guard to prevent users from accidentally cutting themselves or severing a digit while using the apparatus. However, injuries are still possible if the device is not used with proper care or attention. Industrial paper cutters In the modern paper industry, larger machines are used to cut large stacks of paper, cardboard, or similar material. Such machines operate in a manner similar to a guillotine. Commercial versions are motorized and automated, and include clamping mechanisms to prevent shifting of the material during the cutting process.

Kuduro was developed in Luanda, Angola in the late 1980s. Producers sampled traditional carnival music like soca and zouk from the Caribbean to Angola, techno and accordion playing from Europe and laid this around a fast 4/4 beat. The kuduro is similar to the kizomba rhythm. The lyrics are usually in Portuguese. Origins The roots of kuduro can be traced to the late 1980s when producers in Luanda, Angola started mixing African percussion samples with Konpa and soca to create a style of music then known as Batida (\\"Beat\\"). European and American electronic music had begun appearing in the market, which attracted Angolan musicians and inspired them to incorporate their own musical styles. Young producers began adding heavy African percussion to both European and American beats. In Europe, western house and techno producers mixed it with house and techno.Globo.com: Producers explain the origins of Kuduro (24 May 2007) Kuduro is primarily a genre of electronic dance music. In addition to the aforementioned influences, Kuduro also incorporates regional styles that are based on global and local influences that highlight sonic expressions of personal and collective identities. These collective and personal identities were formed due to Angola's turbulent history. The history of kuduro has come about in a time of Angolan civil unrest, and provided a means of coping with hardship and positivity for the younger generation. Angola experienced periods of war, repression, and some instances of political tranquility. The origination of Kuduro came from and due to this political instability. There was significant anti-colonial resistance to Portuguese rule and influence which created a transitional government composed of two political parties. These two parties engaged in power-based struggles and tensions that led to the Angolan Civil War. Such shift in attitude away from optimism was reflected through Kuduro's increasing distortion in timbre and hardened aesthetics, while lyrics of the genre often reflected experiences of life in the musseques (Luanda‚Äôs informal, unpaved and marginal neighborhoods). Kuduro's establishment of collective and individual identities created stereotypes of Africanness that permeate the Western mind. With the strong immigration to Portugal of Angolan citizens kuduro spread and evolved further in the neighborhoods of Lisbon, with the inclusion of additional musical elements from genres of Western European electronic music, giving origin to the progressive kuduro. This also allowed Kuduro to spread in terms of popularity as it became increasingly available to more populations. The youth also became a large part of the influence and spread of Kuduro. With the increase in popularity of electronic music in periods of relative political tranquility, youth played Kuduro in side-street markets, local parties, and nightclubs. While listenership is primarily Angolan, there are some sonically diaspora communities and niche communities across a wide range of age groups that enjoy, experience, and produce Kuduro. Technology, global citizenships and intercultural communities impact the evolution of the genre as it has endured various \\"generations\\" of sound. Each of the three Kuduro generations lasted nearly a decade. Kuduro also endured various tempo fluctuations over time as well as the presence or absence of vocals and the distortion or clarity of sound. Kuduro‚Äôs hybridity directly reflects its technological evolution; the music was codified in its constitutive technology. For example, contemporarily, kuduro vocals are rendered with relative low fidelity. This is a trace of the genre‚Äôs early technological limitations as early 1990s Angola studios lacked the necessary technology to record vocals. Furthermore, early producers created batidas in direct conversation with their techno and house influences and thus kuduro is predominantly loop-based and instrumental (ibid). These composition choices demonstrate how music styles arise as active negotiations of imagination and availability; these choices are both the result of ‚Äútechnical limitations and creative decisions‚Äù (ibid). The technology continues to define the music when one unfolds the history of the Fruity Loops drum samples. As the Civil War abated, instating a coalition government between UNITA and MPLA, the Angolan economy liberalized and there was a wider availability of personal computers (ibid). This resulted in DIY kuduro production using the Fruity Loops interface, which democratized the enterprise of creating batidas (ibid). The Fruity Loops interface is described by Garth Sheridan in the following manner: > The Fruity Loops interface is centred on a row of on/off controls for each > sound, known as the step sequence that resemble the user interface of the > Roland TR series of drum machines. In the default 4/4 setting these 16 > controls represent 4 bars of quarter notes. Drums, samples and software > synthesisers are controlled using the step sequencer and, in later versions, > also a digital piano roll. These loops could then be arranged and burned > onto CD or recorded to tape. This production source unified the kuduro sound so it coalesced into an identifiable entity: ‚ÄúProducers using Fruity Loops had created the archetypal kuduro rhythms (see Fig. 1) and timbres‚Äù. Software availability also contributes to the ideological connotations surrounding the genre as the accessibility of these technologies lowered the barrier to entry to kuduro production, and thus the genre became increasingly working class and vulnerable to denigration as it became associated with Angola's mousseques (ibid). According to Tony Amado, self-proclaimed creator of Kuduro, he got the idea for the dance, after seeing Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1989 film Kickboxer, in which he appears in a bar drunk, and dances in a hard and unusual style. As Vivian Host points out in her article, despite the common assumption that \\"world music\\" from non-Western countries holds no commonalities with Western modern music, Angolan kuduro does contain \\"elements in common with punk, deep tribal house, and even Daft Punk.\\"Host, Vivian (and contributors). \\"The New World Music.\\" XLR8R 109 (Aug 2007): 64‚Äì73. And although Angolan kuduro reflects an understanding and an interpretation of Western musical forms, the world music category that it fits under, tends to reject the idea of Western musical imperialism. DJ Riot of Sistema said, \\"Kuduro was never world music‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt born on congas and bongos, as some traditional folk-music. It was kids making straight-up dance-music from, like, ‚Äô96. Playing this new music, this new African music, that feels straight-up political in itself.\\" Kuduristas use body movements that often emanate movement/stillness, incoordination, falling, pop & lock, and breakdancing. This style of dance seems to ‚Äúbreak down‚Äù body parts into isolations and staccato movements, serving as a reflection of debility and the mixture of abled/disabled bodies in performance. Popular Angolan dancer Costuleta, whose leg has been amputated, is known for his captivating performances displaying dexterity and sexuality. The incorporation of debility complicates normative notions of ‚Äúabled-ness‚Äù while recalling motifs of black survival throughout the diaspora, specifically in relation to the land mines planted after Angola's war of independence that has left many Angolans amputated.Young, Hershini. \\"Sound of Kuduro knocking at my door\\": Kuduro Dance and the Poetics of Debility\\". The Johns Hopkins University Press and Saint Louis University. 2013. Kuduristas contort their bodies in direct response to their spatial environments: > Kuduristas, acutely aware of the six to twenty million landmines still > waiting to be detonated, as well as the fact that one out of every 334 > Angolans has lost a limb as a result of landmine detonation, emulate to > various degrees the movements of the land mine victims around them, and are > themselves victims. Young also argues that kuduristas use their dancing ‚Äúto signify on the normative landscape of the black body,‚Äù and by extension, their spatial order. Acts of oppression (colonialism) and violence have composed their environments as sites of subjugation, but these dancers influence the essence of their settings by taking up space and recasting it through their bodies and movement. Terminology The name of the dance refers to a peculiar movement in which the dancers seem to have hard buttocks (\\"Cu Duro\\" in Portuguese), simulating an aggressive and agitated dance style.Superinteressante Magazine: What is Kuduro? (May 2012)  Generations of kuduro  There were three primary generations of kuduro that each lasted nearly a decade. Through all generations, the primary common vein was storytelling of social and political messages. These messages are innately representative of the diaspora as it spreads the influence of Africanness transnationally, using African-originated and influenced sounds as a global genre. = The first generation = The first generation began in the early 1990s. It consisted primarily of middle- class youth and was representative of influences that resulted from political unrest. Artists and producers experimented with localized versions of techno and house music which aligned with much of the music that already permeated the club scene. It ranged from 128-135 beats per minute and vocals were rarely used to convey the message of the music. Kuduro in this generation also favored synthesized productions of acoustic instruments. = The second generation = This generation had a 'do it yourself' aesthetic which expanded the industry through establishing lower-income neighborhoods as the center of production. By this time, many home studios were based around Fruity Loops which were sequencers that incorporated a range of synthesizers and samples. The increase in availability of computers and pirated technology, especially the music production software FruityLoops made kuduro more widely available to the masses for production. This generation was characterized by sped-up versions of the first generation's tempo at 140 beats per minute. \\"Urgent\\" vocal styles were used in kuduro songs during this generation. = The third generation = This generation, too, focused on more neighborhood-based performance. There was an increase in participatory aspects in this genre as well. The use of Afrohouse and N'dombolo both had slower beats represented the globally connected nature of the genre. This generation also had slower beats. Technologically, this generation marked a shift away from FruityLoops as the primary means of production to sequence-based software such as Cubase or LogicPro. Popularity Kuduro is very popular across former Portuguese overseas countries in Africa, as well as in the suburbs of Lisbon, Portugal (namely Amadora and Queluz), due to the large number of Angolan immigrants. In the Lisbon variety (or progressive kuduro), which mixes kuduro with house and techno music, Buraka Som Sistema a Portuguese/Angolan electronic dance music project based in Portugal, was responsible for the internationalisation of kuduro, presenting the genre across Europe. It featured in several international music magazines, after their appearance with their hit \\"Yah!\\" (\\"Yeah!\\"). Buraka Som Sistema takes its name from Buraca, a Lisbon suburb in the municipality of Amadora.Miguel Judas. VIS√ÉO n¬∫ 752 3 Ago. 2007 Since the explosion of the Buraka Som Sistema, kuduro dance performance videos find an increasing audience on internet video platforms like YouTube. The videos range in quality from MTV standard to barely recognizable mobile-phone footage. =I Love Kuduro (festival)= A travelling festival that has become known as one of the largest gatherings dedicated to the Kuduro genre and lifestyle. It was created by Angolan artist Cor√©on D√∫ in 2011 with premiere events in the Showcase Club in Paris followed Arena Club in Berlin under the name Kuduro Sessions. It included Angolan legends such as Noite e Dia, Nacobeta, Bruno M, DJ Znobia, Big Nelo, the then up and coming Titica, Francis Boy Os Namayer, DJ Djeff & DJ Sylivi, as well as with a slew of international guests / Kuduro supporters such as Louie Vega & Anan√© Vega, Ousunlade, Daniel Haaksman, John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, Trentemoller, Tiefshwarz, Diego Miranda, and Wretch 32, among others.

The even has happened annually in Luanda, with various events happening around the world in cities such as Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Rio de Janeiro, New York and Washington DC . Recent including a recent event at the 2014 TechnoParade in Paris, as the Os Kuduristas tour (a follow up to the Kuduro Sessions theme tour) which focused mainly on bringing the broader Luanda urban culture to Kuduro lovers around the world, with an emphasis on dance.

The region was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Guadalajara and the administration of its president. As part of the Bourbon Reforms, the northern provinces of the Viceroyalty were organized into the Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North in 1777. The Internal Provinces were originally designed to function independently from the New Spanish Viceroy, but being financially supported by him, they soon lost their autonomy. In 1787, an intendancy was established in Durango to promote economic and population growth. Another intendancy was also set up at Arizpe, Sonora. In 1788, the Internal Provinces were divided into two Commandancies, east and west. From 1788 to 1793, Nueva Vizcaya became part of the Western Internal Provinces, until the two Commandancies were reunited. The Crown restored the dual Commandancies again in 1813, and this division remained until independence in 1821.History Of The North Mexican States And Texas, Vol. II 1801-1889, San Francisco, The History Company, Publishers,1889, Chapter 24 War of independence The Mexican War of Independence started in 1810.

After the call of the Junta to reconvene the Cortes of C√°diz, Nueva Vizcaya elected Juan Jos√© Guere√±a as their deputy to the Cortes. Guere√±a served from April 4, 1811, until his death on September 10, 1813, and was a signatory of the Spanish Constitution of 1812.Rieu-Millan, Marie Laure. Los Diputados Americanos en las Cortes de C√°diz: Igualdad o independencia. (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 1990), 42. The Constitution was well received in the provinces, but was suspended by the viceroy in 1813. Colonial liberals who supported the Constitution continued both legal and extra-legal efforts to reinstate it. Towards the end of 1814, Jos√© F√©lix Trespalacios and Juan Pablo Caballero planned an outbreak at Chihuahua but the plot was revealed to Commandant General Garc√≠a Conde, who now controlled the western section from that city. He promptly arrested the principal plotters, but the men were pardoned through the efforts of authorities and clergy. A brief rebellion by the Opatas of Durango in 1820 was quelled without any serious bloodshed. The war also imperiled the northern frontier. The trade and tribute system, which the Viceroyalty had established at the end of the 18th century to pacify the nomadic tribes, had broken down due to the war. During this period Chihuahua began to suffer from renewed Apache raids. At the same time the Jesuits, who had been suppressed decades earlier, were permitted to re√´stablish their missions. Tensions grew with the young United States, which followed the French boundaries of the recently purchased Louisiana Territory, including several areas which Spain considered its own. In 1819, explorer Zebulon Pike was sent to explore the disputed territory and was arrested by the authorities. Independent Mexico When the Spanish Constitution was restored in 1821, Mariano de Urrea was installed as Jefe Pol√≠tico (governor) of Nueva Vizcaya, while Antonio Cordero y Bustamante, who had governed effectively in Durango as civil and military governor during the past three years, was rewarded with the post of Commandant General of the West, replacing Diego Garc√≠a Conde. A turning point came later that year, when General Agust√≠n de Iturbide rose against the viceregal authorities. The Governor and Intendant of Nueva Galicia, General Jos√© de la Cruz, retreated to Durango to make a final effort in behalf of the royalist cause. He entered that city on July 4, 1821, with a force of several hundred soldiers accompanied by fleeing officials from Zacatecas and nearby localities. Iturbide's lieutenant, Pedro Celestino Negrete, followed in pursuit and laid siege to the city early in August with about 3,000 men. De la Cruz held out for over three weeks. His forces suffered severe losses during the fighting which involved heavy shelling and occasional sorties. On August 30, Negrete finally found a vulnerable point in de la Cruz's defenses and placed an artillery battery against it, gaining a decisive advantage. His forces diminished by many defections, de la Cruz accepted a truce on September 3 and the garrison surrendered. They were treated with full honors and permission to leave the country for Spain. In less than a year, the First Mexican Empire collapsed. Troops rose against the now-Emperor Iturbide. Chihuahua joined the rebellion. Durango was initially against the movement, but on March 5, 1823, the troops and the general population in the region declared themselves in favor. Commandant General Cordero y Bustamante resigned, as did the civil and military Governor of Durango, Brigadier I. del Corral. Gaspar de Ochoa became the new Commandant General and Juan Navarro became Governor of Durango. =Creation of the Federal States of Chihuahua and Durango= On July 19, 1823, the Supreme Congress decreed the division of Nueva Vizcaya into two provinces, Chihuahua and Durango. The capital of Chihuahua received the title of city and became the seat of a provincial council (diputaci√≥n provincial). Chihuahua, with a population of over 100,000, benefited from a separate administration. It had often found Durango distant and sometimes uncooperative. In the meantime, as a new constitution was being written for the nation, the Mexican provinces transformed themselves into states. A party from Chihuahua and Durango temporarily persuaded the Congress to create a new state ‚Äî Estado Interno del Norte ‚Äî by reuniting the two former provinces and including New Mexico. Its capital was at Chihuahua. Durango, however, raised objections, demanding retention of the capital or separation from the new state, because of its large population and superior resources. On May 22 and July 6, 1824, the separation was affirmed. New Mexico was transformed into a separate territory directly administered by the federal government. In the following year the two states issued their constitutions. Chihuahua established a legislative council of not less than eleven deputies, while Durango created bicameral state legislature, with a senate of seven members and a lower house.

Her work focused on community development, consumer protection, industrial development, civil rights, and women's issues.  Biography  Family and early years = Caroline ‚ÄúLina‚Äù Ware was born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts. Her family belonged to the New England Unitarian church, and had a history of social concern. Ware's great great grandfather, Henry Ware, dean of the Harvard Divinity School, controversially established Unitarianism in the institution. Ware's great grandfather, Henry Ware Jr., also a faculty member of the Harvard Divinity School, published unorthodox ideas and was also deemed a controversial figure. Her grandfather was Charles Pickard Ware. During the Civil War he worked in Port Royal, South Carolina, with some of the first newly freed people to be liberated by the Union Army. Caroline's father, brother, and various cousins were all graduates of Harvard College.Ware Genealogy; Robert Ware of Dedham, Massachusetts 1642-1699 and His Lineal Descendants, compiled by Emma Forbes Ware, published by Charles H Pope, Boston, Mass, 1901 Caroline's father, also named Henry Ware, was a municipal judge, lawyer, and member of the Brookline town meeting. Her mother was involved in community service, such as volunteering with the Girl Scouts and the church. Her family strongly advocated for the education of women. = Adolescence = Ware attended local private schools before choosing to enroll in Vassar College over Bryn Mawr College. At Vassar, Ware became a student of Lucy Maynard Salmon, a professor of history. Salmon emphasized the importance of observing ordinary people's lives and thinking independently. She taught Ware how to carry out careful research methodology, and encouraged her to use primary sources. Several of Vassar's faculty at the time taught that knowledge was the foundation of ‚Äúresponsible conduct‚Äù. = Early teaching career and postgraduate studies = Ware received her A.B. from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie in 1920, her A.M. from Radcliffe College, a women's college associated with Harvard University in 1924, and her Ph.D. in 1925. Ware was an associate professor of history at Vassar from 1925‚Äì1930 and from 1932-1934. After graduating from Vassar College with an A.B. (artium baccalaureus), Ware taught summer school in the state of Kentucky's mountains. At the age of eighty-four, Ware reflected that her first trip to the south was the first time she had encountered segregation. In the fall, Ware began teaching at a preparatory school for girls in Pennsylvania, the Baldwin School. The school was founded in 1881 with the purpose of preparing young women for admission into Bryn Mawr College. In the summer of 1921, Ware became a teacher at the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers. One of the school's main founders was Hilda Worthington Smith, a labor educator who believed female workers required a broader education than only vocational training. Smith became a lifelong friend of Ware, and influenced Ware's pedagogy. As a teacher, Ware provided the workers with a liberal arts education, many of whom had left school after the sixth grade. Following her experience at the Bryn Mawr Summer School, Ware continued to teach worker education classes throughout her life. Ware resumed her teaching position at the Baldwin School in 1922 (Scott, p. 3). During this year she was awarded a Vassar scholarship to continue her studies at Oxford University. This was an uncommon opportunity for a woman at this time. After one year at Oxford, her studies were cut short, in order to return home to her sick mother. While in Massachusetts, Ware decided to pursue a Ph.D. in economic history, and enrolled at Radcliffe College. As a graduate student, Ware worked with Harvard faculty, including Edwin Gay, who informed her about unexamined records in the Harvard Business School. The records were of early experiments in cotton cloth factories, which became the primary documents of her dissertation. In 1929, Ware was awarded the Hart-Schaffner- Marx Prize for her dissertation, an award for scholarship in the areas of economics and commerce. Two years later, Houghton-Mifflin published her dissertation, titled The Early New England Cotton Manufacture: A Study in Industrial Beginnings. After she received her Ph.D. in 1925, the only job Ware found that was satisfactory was a teaching position at Vassar College. She excelled in this position and was considered a masterful teacher. Ware held her teaching position at Vassar from 1925 to 1934. Ware moved to New York in 1931 in order to join her husband, Gardiner Means, who was completing his dissertation at Columbia University. During this time, Ware worked on a community study of Greenwich Village. She published her research in a groundbreaking book titled Greenwich Village. = New Deal = When Gardiner Means was offered a position in the Department of Agriculture in 1933 to work on consumer and economic problems, Ware increasingly spent time in Washington D.C. Ware left her teaching position at Vassar and joined her husband at the Department of Agriculture. Ware became involved in President Roosevelt's New Deal, specifically creating a new field called ‚Äúconsumer affairs.‚Äù The previous definition of ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù had been termed at the beginning of the 20th century by Florence Kelley, and was used to explain that consumers had the power to improve the situation of poor by boycotting goods that were created at the expense of the well-being of workers. The New Deal expanded this idea with the concept that consumers were also in need of protection from neglect or greed by local government. New Deal agencies were meant to equally represent consumers, labor and business. During World War II the focus of consumer affairs was on the needs of workers in war industries; these needs included adequate housing, childcare, education, and the end of race-based discrimination for war industry jobs. Ware became involved in several New Deal agencies that dealt with consumer protection problems, and often faced opposition from labor and business representative and bureaucrats. She learned how to effect change in Washington D.C from the perspective of a bureaucrat and lobbyist, which became useful knowledge in her later work as an activist and historian. Ware learned that individuals could exercise a significant amount of power if they were more knowledgeable about the subject than anyone else. She noted that government contracts and grants caused a fragmentation of responsibility (Scott, p. 8). Ware worked as a specialist for different agencies until the early 1940s, when the focus of the government shifted toward the war. = Later career = In 1939 Ware was asked to organize a series of papers to be presented at the American Historical Association's annual meeting. This request was unusual for a woman to receive, as women scholars were often under-appreciated during this time period. Despite the obstacles of finding a teaching position as a woman, Ware taught at Sarah Lawrence College from 1935 to 1937, and at American University graduate school from 1936 to 1945. While she was teaching, Ware continued to hold advocacy positions in various government agencies. She regularly testified about consumer protection issues at congressional hearings (Scott, p. 10). President Roosevelt appointed Ware to be deputy to Harriet Elliott, the consumer representative of a National Defense Advisory Commission. Elliot and Ware had worked together in the American Association of University Women. Ware faced gender discrimination in this position, as the members of the commission had condescending attitudes towards consumers and towards female commissioners. Ware was forbidden from using the Executive Dining Rom, and was excluded from policy discussion. Despite these obstacles, Ware continued to gain responsibility. She oversaw food supply, housing, and medical care in neighborhoods where war production took place. After resigning from her position in the National Defense Advisory Commission, Ware joined the Office of Price Administration consumer advisory group. She remained involved in various advisory groups until the Eisenhower distanced itself from consumer protection in 1952. In the early 1940s Ware began teaching constitutional history full-time at Howard University, where she stayed until 1961. Ware was invited to lecture on community development in 1947 in Puerto Rico. This invitation led her to become an advisor for women's groups in Central and South America. Ware learned the Spanish language in order to lecture and to write a guidebook on community development. Her publication became a bestselling guidebook for the Pan American Union. Ware taught social science at Sarah Lawrence College from 1935‚Äì1937, and was an associate professor at American University from 1936‚Äì1940. In 1936 she published with her husband The Modern Economy in Action. Furthermore, she was a lecturer at the American University School of Social Sciences and Public Affairs from 1940‚Äì1954, and a professor at the Howard University School of Social Work from 1945-1961. Ware was a member of the American Association of University Women and from 1939-1945 served on the Association's Committee on Social Studies. She worked with the Association to establish a consumer agency in the federal government. Ware edited the influential book The Cultural Approach to History (1940), which featured distinguished historians such as Merle Curti, Ray Allen Billington, Constance Green and Ralph Gabriel. The cultural approach involved shifting the focus of historical analysis away from institutions and elites toward social realities among Americans, placing heavy emphasis on social and economic context and explicitly recognizing the diminishing roles of individuals in the modern industrial world. It also stressed the interdependence of social, economic, and cultural forces. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy selected Caroline Ware to be a member of the President's Commission on the Status of Women.  Personal life  Marriage = In 1927 a nearly illiterate town clerk married Ware and Means. Caroline Ware met Gardiner Means while she was a graduate student at Radcliffe College. They lived in the same apartment building. Means and Ware shared a common interest in studying factories. Means, who was four years older than Ware, had been a pilot in World War I. Ware and Means were both analytical thinkers, and collaborated in their research. Together they wrote The Modern Economy in Action. Ware and her husband bought seventy acres of land in the rural community of Vienna, located in northern Virginia. The property was purchased in 1936 for $7000. ‚ÄúThe Farm‚Äù housed various friends and acquaintances of the couple, including students, government workers, writers, professionals, travelers on international missions, and humanitarians. On numerous occasions Ware housed young people who needed mentorship or housing. Caroline Ware's friend, Pauli Murray describes her time at the Farm: Ware and Means later donated the seventy acres of land as a public park. They later purchased Yellowhead Island, an island off the coast of Maine. They sought to preserve the natural landscape, and searched for solutions through which local fishermen could earn higher wages.  Works  The Early New England Cotton Manufacture: A Study in Industrial Beginnings, published in 1929 by Houghton- Mifflin, was based on the dissertation Ware wrote at Radcliffe College. The book was reviewed in several publications, including The New York Times, The Nation, and The American Economic Review. In her book, Ware argued that the early cotton mill industry in New England transformed rural life, particularly for women, and influenced the future industrial development in the United States: Ware thought that the social consequences the changes brought about by industrialization were not yet fully understood by historians. She addressed the work culture of industrial mills, and its effect on women. These topics were, at the time, unaddressed by historians. Greenwich Village was written in the early 1930s, and dealt with the Irish, Italian, Spanish, and Jewish populations in the area, rather than the bohemian writers and artists that the area was famous for. Ware described the social structure of the multiracial, multiethnic neighborhood. The book is an early example of a new type of social history in which the lives of previously invisible people was documented. The Cultural Approach to History was a collection of papers Ware organized to present at the American History Association's annual meeting. Ware's introductory essay discussed ‚Äúthe problem of objectivity,‚Äù which refers to the unconscious biases historians have. Ware called on historians to recognize these biases and to recognize that these biases affect the premises in their writings. History of the Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind was a six-volume book Ware wrote for the United Nation's Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The Modern Economy in Action was a collaboration between Ware and her husband, Gardiner Means.

History Founded by and named after Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel on 15 October 1576, the first university of the duchy and the first Protestant university of the northern Holy Roman Empire quickly became one of the largest German universities. In order to train pastors and administrators for work in the Lutheran churches, the duchy needed a university of its own.

Tilemann Heshusius was an important early Lutheran theologian at Helmstedt. He developed a clergy network in the region that supported other Helmstedt professors, including Daniel Hofmann, Gottfried Schulter, Basilius Sattler, and Tilemann's son, Heinrich Heshusius. The university developed four faculties for theology, law, medicine and philosophy including the seven liberal arts. The great auditorium, the Juleum Novum, was erected in 1592. In the late 18th century, Helmstedt lost popularity to newer universities, such as the University of G√∂ttingen.

Included are classics such as \\"A Certain Smile\\" by Johnny Mathis, \\"Broken Hearted Melody\\" by Sarah Vaughan, and \\"Standing on the Corner\\" by the Four Lads. In 1970, he produced Emmylou Harris' debut LP Gliding Bird. Ellis' work encompassed all areas of music, from records to film, commercials, and television. In the early 1960s, Ellis had a contract to produce his own easy listening record albums with RCA Victor, MGM, and Columbia, the most popular probably being Ellis in Wonderland. His television credits include theme music for NBC News At Sunrise with Connie Chung and the background and incidental music for the original Spider-Man cartoons. =NBC News Today= Ellis also composed two extended themes for The Today Show, the first in 1971. It was used as the Friday closing theme (and eventually the show's full-time theme) until the end of the decade. However, in Herald Square Music v. Living Music, the District Court of the Southern District of New York \\"found the instrumental arrangement and harmonization of defendant's melody to be substantially similar to that of 'Day by Day,'\\" a Stephen Schwartz song from the musical Godspell. As a result, Ellis composed a second Today Show theme based on the trademark NBC chimes.

Some of its area of concern overlaps that of admiralty law and, in many cases, aviation law is considered a matter of international law due to the nature of air travel. However, the business aspects of airlines and their regulation also fall under aviation law. In the international realm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides general rules and mediates international concerns to an extent regarding aviation law. The ICAO is a specialized agency of the United Nations. In the United States and in most European nations, aviation law is considered a federal or state-level concern and is regulated at that level. In the U.S., states cannot govern aviation matters in most cases directly but look to Federal laws and case law for this function instead. For example, a court recently struck down New York's Passenger Bill of Rights law because regulation of aviation is traditionally a federal concern. Aviation law, however, is not in the United States held under the same Federal mandate of jurisdiction as admiralty law; that is, while the United States Constitution provides for the administration of admiralty,i.e. by an interpretation of the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. it does not provide such for aviation law. States and municipalities do have some indirect regulation over aviation. For example, zoning laws can require an airport to be located away from residential areas, and airport usage can be restricted to certain times of day. State product-liabilitys law are not preempted by Federal law and in most cases, aviation manufacturers may be held strictly liable for defects in aviation products. Space law, which governs matters in outer space beyond the Earth's atmosphere, is a rather new area of law but one that already has its own journals and academic support. Much of space law is connected to aviation law. History Roman law and other ancient lund systems generally granted all rights in airspace to the owner of the underlying land. The first law specifically applicable to aircraft was a local ordinance enacted in Paris in 1784, one year after the first hot air balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers. Several court cases involving balloonists were tried in common law jurisdictions during the 19th century. =Development of public international law= Balloons were used in the Franco-German War of 1870‚Äì71, and the First Hague Conference of 1899 set a five-year moratorium on the use of balloons in combat operations, which was not renewed by the Second Hague Conference (1907). Prior to World War I, several nations signed bilateral agreements regarding the legal status of international flights, and during the war, several nations took the step of prohibiting flights over their territory. Several competing multilateral treaty regimes were established in the wake of the war, including the Paris Convention of 1919, Ibero-American Convention (1926)The Ibero-American Convention, ICAO History and the Havana Convention (1928).The Havana Convention, ICAO History The International Air Transport Association (IATA) was founded in 1919 in a conference at The Hague, to foster cooperation between airlines in various commercial and legal areas. The lack of uniformity in international air law, particularly with regard to the liability of international airlines, led to the Warsaw Convention of 1929. The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation was signed in 1944, during World War II. It provided for the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organization as a unit of the United Nations devoted to overseeing civil aviation. The Convention also provided various general principles governing international air service. The Tokyo Convention of 1963 enacted new international standards for the treatment of criminal offenses on or involving aircraft. The Montreal Convention of 1999 updated the carrier liability provisions of the Warsaw Convention, while the Cape Town Treaty of 2001 created an international regime for the registration of security interests in aircraft and certain other large movable assets. =Development of national regulations=British Commonwealth The United Kingdom enacted the Air Navigation and Transport Act in 1920, which formed the basis of aviation regulation in the British Empire and Commonwealth. United States In the United States, the Air Mail Act of 1925 and the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 formed the early basis for regulation of domestic air transportation. The United States established a Federal Aviation Agency in 1958, which became the Federal Aviation Administration, a unit of the newly formed United States Department of Transportation, in 1967. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was a watershed in the U.S. air transportation industry, and it greatly increased the regulatory workload of the FAA as new operators were allowed to apply for operating certificates. Communist bloc The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic declared sovereignty over its airspace and enacted basic aviation regulations in 1921, forming a state-owned Civil Air Fleet in 1923 which became known as Aeroflot in 1932. Other communist states followed a similar pattern in establishing state-controlled entities for civil aviation, such as the Civil Aviation Administration of China in the People's Republic of China and Interfug in East Germany. Japan Japan enacted a legal regime governing civil aviation in 1952, after a brief moratorium during the occupation that followed World War II. While the early domestic air travel market was lightly regulated and highly competitive, the government implemented a regulation system in 1970 which limited service to three carriers (Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System), with largely separate markets and strictly regulated fare levels that minimized competition. Pressure from the United States, which sought to introduce new U.S. carriers to the transpacific market in the 1980s, led Japan to gradually deregulate its market in the form of cheap packaged-tour fares and an increased international role for ANA in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by the advent of new domestic carriers such as Skymark Airlines and Air Do.
